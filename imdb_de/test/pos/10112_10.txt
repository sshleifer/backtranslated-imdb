"A Story of Two Sisters" or "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a true masterpiece. Brilliant psychological thriller, heartbreaking drama and gripping horror - all in a beautifully orchestrated package. From the intricate plot to the beautiful cinematography to the absolute perfect casting, every aspect of this film is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Afraid to tell too much about the plot, I just want to say it's very satisfying. It may seem a bit difficult to understand at first, but in the end it is good to explain things. And whether you prefer a psychological thriller, a drama or a horror, I promise you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's almost flawless. The set, the cinematography, the lighting and above all the soundtrack fascinate. The waltz seemed a strange choice at first sight, but turned out to be an ingenious choice. <br /> <br /> As far as casting is concerned, we speak of absolute perfection. I'm totally convinced of Su-jeong as the defiant but concerned Su-mi. Mun Keunyeong is as convincing as her emotionally traumatized sister Su-yeon. These two girls were magical on the screen. I will certainly look into her other films. Yeom Jeong-ah, as a stepmother, is deceptively cheerful and maliciously angry. After all, Kap-su Kim performs excellently as the tired, broken father. <br /> <br /> I really love this movie. If you have not yet seen "A Story of Two Sisters," I strongly recommend finding a copy. It is a true gem worthy of every collection. <br /> <br /> (10/10)
