The Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess), who has a bad flight in over 4000 hours and has to renounce commercial flying. He meets a pretty girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and they start an act with flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is injured, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the role for a while and falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly sad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pre-code for several reasons. First, Jim and Jill have made their relationship without being married or intending to wed. Second, Eilers can be seen in her underwear, and the scene is absolutely limited when the Production Code came into effect. This film does not save the dramatic love triangle and ends bittersweet.
