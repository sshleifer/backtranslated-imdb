No, it is not a citizen Kane. But would you expect it to have a name like "Meatballs"? It's the best damn summer camp movie of all summer camp movies. Does anyone quote "Little Darlings" line by line? Or "Whitewater Summer"? <br /> <br /> This is just one of the films that came to my mind in my youth and stayed with me all these years. Every time I feel geeky, I mumble "Spaz. Spaz. Spaz. Spaz." Or when we walk in the brush in the woods, I tell my husband, "I'm Wudy da Wabbit." (He does not understand it). "It just does not matter, it just does not matter." I mean, this stuff is classic! <br /> <br /> Disappointed with the DVD. I wish there were specials, maybe a comment or a making-of. But the movie itself is a perfect snapshot of a teenager's life in the late '70s. Maybe not in my life ... You can not walk around wearing short shorts, knee-high socks and feathered hair in the woods when you see this movie.
