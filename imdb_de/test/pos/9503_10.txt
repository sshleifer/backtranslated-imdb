The Residents are a band known for their strange performances and peculiar musical styles. Your music videos will not necessarily be normal. In fact, these little videos are unusual and bizarre, but they have great artistic value. The atmosphere is built with lighting and thoughtful visuals. It's a great viewer experience. <br /> <br /> Basically, Icky Flix consists only of many Resident music videos made for her songs. The music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music that sounds like a horror movie of the 80s. What does not change is the quality of these videos. They are amazing! <br /> <br /> Any fan of art films will love them. They are so original with their visuals and the angles they are filmed on, and the lighting makes them particularly interesting. The music is scary and catchy and very original, and these short films are mini-classics that deserve several observations. This is a near perfect collection of short videos. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** out of ****. 56 min.
