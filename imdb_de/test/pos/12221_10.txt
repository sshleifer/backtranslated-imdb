I bought the entire season from Surface. have seen it in 3 days! I was so fascinated by the storyline, the theories and actually everything about this show. The actor who plays Miles is great. Miles sister, mother and father acted like a real-life family. They could be connected on so many levels that it is fascinating. <br /> <br /> I think animals are so wonderful that you can almost connect with them as parents. It would be something if a creature of this kind really exists. <br /> <br /> I'm sad that Surface does not have a second season or at least four more shows. I have so many questions to answer, and hopefully they will maybe do more or maybe a book. <br /> <br /> I love the show a lot. For those who have not seen Surface, if you like sci-fi, you have to see this !!!!!!!!!!!!!
