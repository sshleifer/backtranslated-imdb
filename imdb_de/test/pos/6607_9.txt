Take a topic that I did not know much about and make it exciting. Why not? It so happened that director Robert Altman said around 1979 that he did not think he'd ever made a real movie and expected one of those kids to skateboard if he did not break his neck the first movie Well, Stacy Peralta would I do not expect it, but he is a skateboarder who made a good movie. Of course, he was forced by the nature of his film to use existing footage, and it is certainly a good thing that so much archive material was available. Peralta did a good job of working with his former colleagues who are not used to talking like they are today. The whole effect is postmodern in the best sense, but that was done. The prognosis of Altman is not quite fulfilled. What Peralta has done, however, is enough of the energy of those busy days to understand what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the Z-Boys. That's all good. I highly recommend "Dogtown".
