I agree with another reviewer. This is such a shattering movie that will soon be hard to see again, though it has to be viewed several times just for quality. The complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematography and the excellent direction make this movie worth the emotional prize of the audience. <br /> <br /> There's a scene where the two partisans are wading through the snow to escape a patrol, perhaps the most amazing performance I've ever seen in pure physicality. In fact, though not episodic - the story is flowing - this is a film of unforgettable scenes. There are rations between the partisans, the snow scenes, the destroyed farm scene, the encounters in the houses, the interrogation, the "cellar" scene, the "ascent". All stand like jewels in a necklace. <br /> <br /> Religiousness is not obvious to me. Honestly, I do not think it would be allowed in a Soviet movie. I see this as an existential parable about the value of life. Here is a story in which the hero - and he is a true hero - becomes the villain and the weaker the stronger. Is this a mystical or circumstantial process? There is a transfiguration, but does it come from inside or outside? They need to see the movie to understand the problems, because they can not be discussed without giving too much of the story. I can not say enough about acting. It's hard for me to decide which of the leads has more influence. I do not know the Soviet movie of the 70s and do not know any of the actors, but they are all great. I also notice how director Larisa Shepitko uses children. They remind me of Giotto's children's angel. <br /> <br /> In the end there is a little bit of confusion. There seems to be a relationship between the soldier Sotnikov and the interrogator Portnov, which is still dangling. And the final scene is a bit ambiguous. However, these are inconsistencies compared to the overall experience. This is a movie that will shape you for life.
