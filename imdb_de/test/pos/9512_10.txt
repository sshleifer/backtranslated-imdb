I do not know what Dick Steel was talking about, but I thought this movie is one of the most exciting epics in Japan. As for Armageddon or Deep Impact or something. The day after tomorrow is pale in comparison. For what I know about movies, most catastrophes in movies are essentially done by the asteroid shotguns of the mill or those of global warming. This ran however differently. A natural course in which the earth's crust begins to erode so badly that it takes another piece of land for the ride. What the science teams had to do was to prevent erosion, to go far and sink all of Japan. In most cases, this is simply referred to as a tectonic shift in steroids. I found the characters quite appealing in every way, from the kid who lost his mother just to knock himself out among unknown friends. Or the rescue girl, who does everything to save lives in the face of disaster. Or a man who thought he could change his mind so as not to be such a reckless devil and go to safety with him, just to become the hero himself and save his homeland. And let's not forget how the rest of the world threw them all back, just to forget that the world was turning its back on Japanese citizens crying for help. This was a great movie in every way. What Dick is trying to say is that this movie was not filmed in Hollywood, that he was made in Japan, that he had characters that compete with other actors around the world, that the effects are very great, as he has mentioned, but it was all he was waiting for, and nothing else. He lacks the vision of what is important to everyone and why this film had every feeling, greatness and humanity. I thought this movie was top-notch, and I've seen many disaster movies to know that Japan Sinks may be one of the most original and thought-out projects I've seen. I really hope that Shinji Higuchi will do another such movie. By the way, I'm not Japanese, although in many ways I wish I was. I was Canadian, born and raised. And in all areas an avid film fan. Prejudiced visions are bitter and it is not worth to be recognized as opinion. Dick, you should look at it with a more open heart and mind, do not just look for the feast that makes a movie, look for the most important thing and understand it. They may not be Americans, but the Japanese have recently conquered the market for some of the most breathtaking and really fat filmmakers. That's why the doctor spent exactly 25,000,000 euros. You heard right, 25,000,000 to make this movie. Now you tell me, was it worth it? or was it worth it because American actors were not there?
