The winter end of Sarah Plain and Tall was the best movie I have ever seen. The person in the story I liked best had to be Cassie, played by Emily Osment. Only because of her energy and how she speaks her mind. For example, when Anna calls from the city, Cassie wants to answer and say, "Hello, Anna, guess what, grandfather was lost, but he's back and he's not a good man!" I loved all Sarah Plain and great movies for my rating. I think Sarah Plain and Big was No. 3. Skylark was # 2. The Winter End was No. 1! If I could live in any family from before, it would have to be the Witting family. I think there are so many good parts in this movie that I can not name them all. I think they have chosen the best and most perfect actors to play all these people in the movie. So if you ever want to see a movie from the past, I would highly recommend Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters End.
