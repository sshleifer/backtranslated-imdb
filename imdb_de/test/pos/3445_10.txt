This epic brings together an outstandingly talented cast and crew, a narrative depth that is superior to novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find hard to explain. Immersion in The Second Home is for me a kind of spiritual experience, much like the awe of looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language and the use of color and monochrome segments contribute to the dramatic effect. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some places, including the office of Edgar Reitz. From then on, I vowed to improve my German skills - after the second home I feel almost German, as if I'm in the head of the characters. I also try to find the piano playing by Henry Arnold (Hermann), but that's the only thing I'll miss! This drama is unique and I was fortunate to see it on BBC2 in the UK and SBS in Australia. The sequel Heimat 3 is currently being shot in Germany.
