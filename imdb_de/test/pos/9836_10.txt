This show is a great show for adults and kids who can sit and watch together. The stories are a bit slow for adults, but they are still good. There are many children, boys and girls in my family, and it's hard to get them all to agree on what they should see, but they always agree if they want to see the Mystic Knights. It's a wonderful show and I hope they will continue to do so. All the children in my family and I think that Vincent Walsh is the best of them all. We have seen that he has done a lot of other work and think that he does a great job. We wish all actors, actresses, writers, directors and producers good luck and just want to say that you want to continue the good work.
