I am a fan of independent film. Dialogue-driven character studies are the right thing for me. Some of the other posts are right: "Wannabes" will not compete with "The Godfather" for the best mob movie ever. On the other hand, "Wannabes" is a well-written and well-directed image that shows surprisingly good performances by all the actors. My problem with one of the other reviews: <br /> <br /> - Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians. <br /> <br /> - Dubin is a Jewish surname and as such has a dark one Complexion, not a traditional red chalk of an Irishman. He does not stand out but delivers a great performance. <br /> <br /> This has not won many prizes, but it deserves a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. I found it at Blockbuster for $ 7 and was pleasantly surprised to say the least! Highly recommended.
