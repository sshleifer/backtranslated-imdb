I saw this movie when it first came out and never forgot it. My uncle Antoine is much, much bigger than the sum of his parts. The film loosely revolves around a pre-adolescent being sent to a relative in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical, but below is a current building. MUA has a comfortable pace, but patience, the reward comes. I think the movie was subtitled and as with all non-English movies I've seen, it's worth avoiding any dubbed version. Sync-synced movies inevitably reflect the attitudes of a new director and actor, with the additional need for liplines that do not quite fit. For example, the English-language amarcord is a travesty while the subtitle version sings. My uncle Antoine is well worth the time to find him and see him in French.
