I can not believe that this movie reached only 7.4! This is certainly among the best films by Hitchcock like VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can imagine why the scores are so low is that THE MAN ... renounces violence and certainly does not receive a diploma in "Sex and Crime". <br /> <br /> The tension that results is not violence. It is the ruthless energy of these criminals who takes a child from their parents and is ready to kill the child if the operation fails. With many hard-hitting hijacking films seen today as Mel Gibson's RANSOM, this seems normal, but in the 1950s, when the family was in America today, the thought of such a crime has certainly aroused emotions. <br /> And these Stress still works for me today. Yes, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards who disturb their behavior: it's a business for them, and they want to be "good business people" without taking into account that the business kidnaps kids and murders opera politicians !! <br /> <br /> What makes the movie so great, however, are the creative aspects, the muddled ideas of Hitchcock, the unbelievably disturbing scene in the church (which draws the viewer's attention to how alone and how the protagonists are left cares, nobody helps, people in the church just go home ...), meeting with the owner of this shop, who stuffs and prepares dead animals (what the somewhat "oriental" flair that the film from the opening scenes in the Foreign countries, emphasized), not least the role of MUSIC in this film. <br /> <br /> Music is the key principle here as *** SPOILER *** the assassination of the envisaged politician is to take place at the very moment of a loud orchastra tutti / gong; So Hitchcock lets the camera follow the score of the orchestra and you will now do it in a second *** BANG ***. And then, of course, DORIS DAY, who sings Que Sera, who became more famous than the movie itself; She sings it to inform the child about his parents in the embassy ... <br /> <br /> All in all: a classic !!
