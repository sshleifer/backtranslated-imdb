Paha Maa is another Finnish movie. But what is different is copied abroad. Some narrative techniques are by Amores Perros, Jackie Brown and Elephant. Scenes are shot again from different angles. Paha Maa is a good movie, but it's not so good that the hype says, "Realistic movie, no happy ending and no commercial footage." Some actors have done a good job. Sulevi Peltola was as good as a vacuum cleaner. Jasper Pääkkönen also shows his skills. But Mikko Leppilampi was so lame. He's so overrated, he's good-looking and a nice guy, but not the best actor in Finland. However, if you like Finnish movies, Paha Maa is well worth a visit.
