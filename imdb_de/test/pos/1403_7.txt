I just looked at this early Harold Lloyd short film, in which he presented his glasses on the DVD of Kino Video of the "Harold Lloyd Collection". He is actually a cheater with Snub Pollard as his partner, who is discovered by Bebe Daniels, who himself performs fake s√©ances. What she discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard break many customers by "dropping" fake rings that are "lost". I stop and say that this was pretty funny, especially when Harold and Snub enter the place where Bebe works, find some creepy things and put on costumes like snub trying one of Bebe's outfits. Not too much slapstick, but what is there was pretty funny too. In that sense, do I recommend Are Crooks Dishonest?
