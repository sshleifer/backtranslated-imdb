CONTEXT is everything when evaluating a movie. When rating this movie, you have to take into account the time it was made. We did not really know what the interior of the EARTH was then, so you can not blab the movie too much for the storyline (based on a much older book). For the time, these were first-rate special effects and the production quality was great. I saw this movie in a masterfully restored HD master. The make-up and the effects make the guys in the rubber suits almost plausible as a monster thing. This is a pure cheese with bad rubber suits, models and spooky costumes. INGENIOUS. PS Doug McClure ROCKS!
