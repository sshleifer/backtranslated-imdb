This was a rather disconcerting look at an allegedly functional family facing her daughter's drug lover. Father gets involved with drugs and eventually kills him. In guilt, he turns up a drunken redneck, what he did. Things roll out of hand quickly before they completely degenerate. The end you are afraid of pursues the viewer throughout, but it can still scare you when it finally arrives.
