The entire film, an elaborate adaptation of one of Joyce's "Dubliners" stories, takes place on the night of January 6 (Epiphany) in 1906. Most of the film takes place at an annual party hosted by three spinsters (two sisters and their niece), where a group of high-class Dubliners gather for an evening of music, recitations and dinners. While there is very little conspiracy in itself, the interaction and conversation between the group reveals much about Dublin at the beginning of the 20th century, when the independence aspirations just started. The performers, all talented Irish stage actors except Anjelica Huston, are universally wonderful, and you really feel like you are a guest at the gathering. The poignant closing scene between Mrs. Huston and the amazing Donal McCann reveals much about the characters' marriage. There is a mix of humor and insight, and for those who like quiet, thoughtful films, "The Dead" is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we do a ritual every 6th of January to watch this wonderful movie. After many visits, I keep trying to move, and each time I take out something that I've missed before.
