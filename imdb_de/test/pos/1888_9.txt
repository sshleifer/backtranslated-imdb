I saw it last night and laughed loud the whole second half of the movie. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell made a damn funny movie! I do not want to reveal anything, but when the movie gets crazy and goes crazy, it really drives me crazy. Just a funny scene after another. My hats to Mr. Campbell and the crew who did it on such a small budget. Bruce was there to introduce the movie and do a Q & A, which was a treat. Many of the questions people asked were pretty lame, but Bruce would turn them over and everyone would be sarcastic. He was great! Anyway, the movie loved. I am looking forward to seeing this later on DVD on DVD. Make sure you check it on the sci-fi channel this autumn. I can highly recommend this.
