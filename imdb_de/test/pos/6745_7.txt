(Some Corruptors) Sweep into New York City on a world-class railroad car, a murderer who does not kill with a gun or a knife or a club, but only with his touch or his breath. A murderer who is the same age or older than the man himself. This killer has a name he knows as smallpox all over the world. <br /> <br /> When he arrived on a cold November afternoon in New York, the killer hides in Sheila Bennet, Evelyn Keyes, and waits like a Trojen horse to introduce himself to the occasion. Then, like a ticking time bomb exploding the fuse, it explodes in full length and in the breath of the city. Sheila knows that she is being persecuted by a US customs official who has been with her since returning to the US from the island nation of Cuba. After smuggling $ 50,000 in illegal unpolished diamonds, she had to be careful to bring her to her husband Matt Charles Korvin to cut and sell them to unsuspecting jewelers in the city. <br /> <br /> Before the diamonds are shipped, Sheila knows that the diamonds are not found on her. What she does not know is that Matt is two, having an affair with her little sister Francie, Lola Albrght. Even worse, he plans to leave the diamonds that left them and Francie, who holds the bag in his hand. <br /> <br /> Even though we know from the beginning that Sheila is in a deadly state, it does not really happen. The first half of "The Killer Who Persecuted New York" is a crime in which the US Customs officials and New York police look for stolen diamonds. When Sheila falls ill and infects anyone who comes into contact with the film, she reaches the point of a mass panic in the street horror movie. <br /> <br /> Both the police and the customs officers are battling the clock with members of the city's health department to find Sheila before she infects the entire city of New York with the deadly smallpox infection she carries. Sheila learns from Matt's boss Willie Dennis, Jim Backus, that he has given up his job as a pianist in a nightclub and has an affair with Francie, and shocked her, what a heel he is. <br /> <br /> When Francie is confronted in her apartment, it turns out that Matt has stiffened not only Shelia, but also her sister. Which later causes the guilty Francie to commit suicide. On the run and unaware that she's infected with smallpox, Sheila goes to her brother Sid (With Bissell), who runs a flop house on the Bowery to find lodgings. It's too late for Sheila and Sid to learn that the stolen diamonds are the last of their problems. Knowing she is dying, Sheila goes to the office of jeweler Arnold Moss, Art Smith. He knows that the sleaze ball of a husband Matt, who has beaten the old man Moss in a bloody porridge, will be there to take revenge on him. A do-it-yourself drama based on a true story and producing exciting black-and-white photographs on-site makes this film about the horrors of invisible and deadly smallpox unleashed on an unsuspecting audience worth seeing.
