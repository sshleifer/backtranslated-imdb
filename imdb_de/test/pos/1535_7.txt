This two character drama is very well played and has a valid message and some really shocking moments (shocking, not because they are graphic, but because you are not prepared when they come). But ultimately it gets depressing, just like "A Pure Formality". Nevertheless, Alan Rickman would have received an Oscar nomination for his multi-dimensional performance, no doubt about it. (** 1/2)
