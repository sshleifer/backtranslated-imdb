I was surprised to read the comments of the person who did not like this movie. It is really funny. There are definitely some laughing lines that my friend and I quote ourselves. Some situations may be disturbing (bisexuality, drugs, a particular foreign point of view of the child on sexuality), but at the same time believable. It's about communication and misunderstandings between men and women.
