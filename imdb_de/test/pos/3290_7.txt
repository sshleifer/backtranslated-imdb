But Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has something for Brian and Norton that challenges Brian's motives. Brian, however, has a great security device. It's called CHOMPS, which stands for home security system of dogs. In fact, the device that looks like a dog is a computer-controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and make siren sounds to capture intruders. The rival owner sends two besieged spies (one of them red buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton's security? This is a funny family movie from the old school for good, clean entertainment. CHOMPS is of course a real dog, played by the enchanting and talented Benji. In fact, Benji has a dueling role, as Brian also has a "real" dog called Rascal. Seeing this little dog in action is pure joy as he scales walls, pulls trucks, and presses machine knobs to catch the bad guys. The cast is also very nice, and all give infectious performances. Costumes, stage sets and production values ​​are also good. Even if you have difficulty finding the movie, it's worth keeping your gaze on your loved ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful, healthy change from the worries of the world.
