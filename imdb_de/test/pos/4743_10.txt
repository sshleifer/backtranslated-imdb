Things that are just "news" have been taken for granted in this shocking documentary. I am afraid that the producers of this film will be piqued in the further course of the investigation. <br /> <br /> The producers show us the Davidians, the government agents, the investigators with all their mistakes and all their humanity. Nothing a reviewer can say could approach the effects of watching and listening. Evidence - witnesses to the congress, 911 tapes, news material, expert commentary, interviews, photos and home videos - are seamlessly interwoven and tell a disturbing story. <br /> <br /> Do not wait. Watch this movie and tell your friends.
