If you do not like Italian horror, you do not like this movie. In that sense ... <br /> <br /> "All in all ... it was a terrible experience ... Many things happened ... Vanessa Redgrave was supposed to be in the movie and she retired, one of the actors was crushed by a car I was engaged, but at the end of the picture it was ready My dad died during the shooting ... anything. "-Dario Argento on the making of" Opera "<br /> <br /> I was really impressed with Argento and the movie he shot here, especially against such terrible circumstances. The whole mystique of "Macbeth" and its curse on those who try to stage the game adds "Unexpected Volume" to Opera. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Argento hires some of its brightest (and most public) directors. Tricks The young opera singer Christina is persecuted by a violent psychopath who forces her to watch a series of brutal murders. Sticking several sharp blades to Christina's eyelids makes it impossible for the killer to close his eyes. If you try to close your eyes, pull them apart so you just have to watch everything! "<br /> <br /> It's clear that Argento has the faux" Macbeth "opa up designed the screen very carefully, and that its hard work pays off. Add to that some unimaginably brutal murders, an incredibly exciting chase sequence and the ingenious use of POV to portray a specific character (the role that, thank God, Vanessa Redgrave has performed) and you have one of the best Italian horror films ever gave created. <br /> <br /> That is - it's still Italian horror. Why Christina never tells anyone about these brutal murders can not be understood. Some scenes may be hard to endure for certain viewers, but I felt more tense about Christina and her eyes than the brutal killings in the movie. In the finale to "Tenebrae," my stomach grunted in "Opera" more than anything, but that's probably just me. <br /> <br /> And the last five minutes ... Argento wanted it, he filmed it and he's struggling to keep it in the movie. Absolutely nobody likes it, including me, but it's not enough to ruin the rest of the movie for me. It is still one of Argento's best films. <br /> <br /> 9/10
