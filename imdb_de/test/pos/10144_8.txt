Unfortunately, I can not say that this is one of Hitch's best films due to a slow start. It is still very good. Film stars Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents involved in a political murder plan and trying to get their abducted son back. Both offer excellent services, of course not surprising. I was really impressed with Hitchcock's amazing use of music. The climax in the opera house was fantastic, and using a live orchestra to create music and excitement at the same time was pure genius. Absolutely fantastic excitement came from this scene. Also, the use of Doris Day, who sings "Que Sera, Sera", was excellent. Especially if it is converted into scenes at the end of the film. Well, this movie is for me the best use of music I've seen so far. Unfortunately, it had a slow start, or I could have recommended this movie a bit higher. Nevertheless, it is worth taking a look. 8 out of 10.
