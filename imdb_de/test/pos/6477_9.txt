It is hard to imagine today how popular and how strongly a Norwegian immigrant and a chemist influenced the American public and how much a national tragedy saw its sudden death in 1931. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary personality who revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small obscure Catholic college on the map. <br /> <br /> I've heard clips of Rockne's famous pep talk and it's scary, like Pat O'Brien has got the voice and the twist perfect. In a career that turned out to be his career, Pat O'Brien captures the integrity and fighting spirit of Rockne. Rockne is well supported by Gale Page as Bonnie Stiles Rockne has complained that her home was a training camp for Notre Dame, but never threw someone out of her home. Rockne's first influence on football was not a coach at Notre Dame. One day in the second half of a lost football game against the favored army, Rockne and his team-mate Gus Dorais, played by Owen Davis, used forward pass as an attacking weapon. Previously, football was just a game where you just got bigger guys for your team and went through the defense. Rockne did not invent the forward pass, but it became more popular and football became a strategy game and then muscle. <br /> <br /> Rockne also knew how to handle the media. These well-publicized pep talks should not only inspire his players. They were well known, and it was not least due to him that college football became an important sport in the Golden Age of the Golden Twenties. <br /> <br /> Playing a small but important role is Ronald Reagan. When George Gipp, the first player to train Rockne to achieve greatness, Reagan not only achieved a good performance, but also forever a name that was useful for his later political career. This deathbed scene, to which Rockne swears, became a republican battle cry as many GOP outsiders won one for the Gipper. I remember a widespread 1981 photograph that was one of the first by President Ronald Reagan at Notre Dame graduating with his old friend Pat O'Brien. Reagan cited O'Brien and Dick Powell of all the Warner Brothers stars of the time as the friendliest and encouraging for a young player in the post who was trying to do something good. Notre Dame itself owes Rockne his reputation. It is quite possible that Notre Dame would be an obscure little Catholic college without the reputation of football. <br /> <br /> Although George Gipp and the later famous Four Riders' backyard certainly had their place in the sun, Rockne had the reputation. It is no coincidence that Warner Brothers Amos Alonzo Stagg, Glenn 'Pop' Warner, Howard Jones and William Spaulding, Rockne's contemporaries and coaches, have a reputation in their own right to appear in Knute Rockne, All American. It was a way to honor the guy who was number one in their profession. <br /> <br /> I think more than football fans will like Knute Rockne, All American. Although you may become one after watching the movie.
