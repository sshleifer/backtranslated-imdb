Jewel Thief is Bollywood's * thriller, and why should not it be like that? It is directed by the greatest exponent of crime drama in Indian cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.). I was able to watch this movie for one of the following reasons (in order of importance): <br /> <br /> 1 Vijay Anands Director 2 RD Burmans Music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpuris Text <br /> <br /> Although Jewel Thief is not a Bond movie, he definitely has Bond Girls. Helen, Tanuja and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos). But our Sauvé Vinay (Dev Anand) is anything but Bond. He is out of control for most of the story and goes to where history almost always confuses him as we are. He even flirts with Anju (Tanuja), who tries to hit her romantic nerve just so he can be hired in her father's business. Dev Anand could play a dual role - I do not want to spoil your movie, otherwise I would have told you. That's what the mystery is all about. Dev Anand works in a jewelry store and there's a robbery when he's supposed to be at work - though this is not the case or at least has a perfect alibi. We wonder who did that. Is Dev Anand the person he claims to be, or is it Amar? Someone we have not met, but many people say he looks the same. Come 'Shalu' (Vyjayanthimala) who even claims to be her fiancé. In a tense situation, Dev Anand has to prove that he is Vinay and not Amar. While everyone is wondering if Dev is Anand Vinay or Amar, he is asked to remove his socks. Amar, it is said, has 6 digits on one foot. While we are watching with bated breath the events that are unfolding, Dev Anand even finds time to joke. <br /> <br /> The real brothers, directors Vijay Anand and Actor Dev Anand, have many films together. This is not the best of them, but definitely the best in crime thriller. <br /> <br /> There are moments of Hitchcock's North By Northwest, but the movies are very different. Apart from the confusion about who is who, a treacherous female lead and many trips are not very similar. Dev Anand could very well be Amar and be Vijay. People have seen him, they identify him wherever he goes. There are too many of these people to think that this is a scam. Finally, Vinay thinks it's better to be Amar to find out what the truth is, and it's a sad mistake. He goes in too deep just to be saved from the cinema's spin. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie as a kid, I was definitely not amused, the end confused me completely. Even now there are parts about the end that I do not like, but I would still recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Already as a child I enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer. 'Yeh dil ...' - a definitive idler song in Kishor Kumar's voice. I could hear 'Rulake gaya ...' all day long. The same applies to "Aasmaan ke neeche", which is set "under the sky" by Gangtok (at least the plot suggests). "Raat akeli hai" is one of the hottest songs of Hindi cinema with Tanuja as seductress. "Meri taraf dekho" - Helen's cabaret and we "look at her". 'Hothon pe ...' - could there be a better thriller of a song? As the song progresses, we are more tense than ever, and the words "hidden in Shalu's lips" contribute to it.
