I was very happy to see this gem on DVD. Although it is a television movie shot on 16mm film, it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a London taxi driver, along with their weaknesses and family responsibilities. Even the most unlucky candidate, "Titanic" with his uncommunicative wife, was able to see how Jack Rosenthal was able to transform an often funny and sometimes tragic excerpt from London life into an entertaining 90 minutes. Originally premiered as a vehicle for Mick Ford (pun intended), the quality of the drama from an ensemble, including Michael Elphic, Nigel Hawthorne, Jonathan Lynn, Lesley Joseph and Maureen Lipman (Ms. Rosenthal) meant that Mick might have had a top record. Despite these competing talents, he had to work hard. <br /> <br /> Even 15 years after the 1991 release, it's still as fresh as ever!
