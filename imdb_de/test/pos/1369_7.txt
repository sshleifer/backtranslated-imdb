My buddies and I spent most of a Saturday afternoon choosing a selection of "bad" movies. Among the flicks we've seen, Jack-O was the strongest contender (for bad movie quality). It's ridiculous that movies like "Gigli", "Glitter" and "You Got Served" are listed in the bottom 100 of the IMDBs. Although they are definitely bad movies, they are not among the bottom 100. They rob "Jack" -O "and" Keeper of Time ", etc. of the bad movie size they make so much. <br /> <br /> So "What makes Jack-O so great (in terms of bad movies)?" To begin with, Steve Latshaw, the director, decided that his son Ryan Latshaw plays in the role of Sean Kelly. Unfortunately for Steve, Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close The child seriously has no ability to express anything The end result: unwanted cartoon gold The child could listen to a joke or be moments away from having smashed his head, and his Facial expression is stony "lack of emotion." <br /> <br /> The other aspect of the movie we found amazing was the sheer number of "double dreaming" sequences. What is a double dream? Well, it's when a character from wakes up a nightmare, then something happens just as nightmare and then awakens the character again. Basically, you wake up after you've dreamed of waking up from a nightmare. Clever device, no? I believe that the character of Sean Kelly has experienced no fewer than three double-dreaming sequences. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what else? Oh yeah! This movie has a true cast of thousands. It is really impressive to see how many speaking roles are introduced in the course of the film. Best of all, almost none of the characters has anything to do with the story. Either they are killed by Jack-O or they serve no purpose. Jack-O himself was pretty cute. Like most other B-Movie monsters, Jack-O has the amazing ability to teleport seemingly over long distances. He is always somewhere in the background when dealing with a main character. What is confusing, though, is that when he chases someone he is moving at a confusing / stumbling pace and yet he is able to keep up with the sprintmates. <br /> <br /> That's all for the moment. Conclusion: If you are looking for an unintentionally hilariously bad movie, you can not go wrong by borrowing this beast. <br /> <br /> Bad Movie Score: 7/10 Good Movie Score: 3.5 / 10
