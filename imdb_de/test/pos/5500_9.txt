"In the Line of Fire" is one of those Hollywood movies that are pretty much on TV, but although I've seen it a couple of times, I usually sit through again. Why? - It's good! As always, Clint Eastwood is great and the character he plays is more interesting and distinctive than usual. The figure, intelligence agent Frank Horrigan, is tormented by the fact that he came across details that failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas. Now he has to compete with a professional murderer who openly declares killing the president. The film does not make him a depressed, brooding and obsessed character. He is charming and personable and is realistic as a guy who has experienced a lot in life and feels comfortable in his own skin. He is even quite convincing when he flirts with the rather younger agent of Rene Russo. The killer, played by John Malkovich at its finest, is cerebral, intentional and enjoys playing games with a high use of life and death. He even bears the name of another presidential killer, John Booth. <br /> <br /> The film is consistently enjoyable and delivers all the goods - excitement, action, romance and drama - in the right amount. It's a funny movie that's really supported by the great actors!
