Christopher Nolan's first directorial work, a year before he did "Memento," and that's almost as brilliant as this classic. Similarly, he uses time differences to tell his story, and it's a very smart one. Bill is this young writer who starts to follow totally strangers just to see where they live and what they are all about. One day he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and faces Bill, who collapses and confesses what he's up to. <br /> <br /> Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill with him so he can teach him the ropes. Both men are a kind of voyeurs and a connection between the two begins to develop. <br /> <br /> But there is an ulterior motive for Cobb to maintain this relationship, and in the end everything is very intelligent. No, I will not ruin it, but this is a very cool movie, and I'm starting to think Christopher Nolan is a genius. <br /> <br /> If you like exciting movies with surprising ends, this one is a must see.
