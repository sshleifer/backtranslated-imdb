The governments are elected for three years. As Reg Whithers said in 1973, the Liberals were determined to force Labor into the election until their defeat. If you ask me, this is portrayed in docudrama, but whoever says Kerr behaved correctly does not recognize the selfish and costly strategy of the Liberal Party of Australia. In the show itself, though Max Phipps was a poor Whitlam, I was too ghostly in his voice. In addition, more key political actors should be used on both sides, although this reflects the budgetary constraints of the period. Nevertheless, I recommend it with caution.
