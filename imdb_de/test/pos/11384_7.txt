The three names that matter most to this film are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, and Julianne Moore. These three provide the strongest performances, but the entire cast does a wonderful job. The movie about the porn industry does not get out of hand with its own sexual premise. On the other hand, there were many scenes involving drug use, and although it is important to understand the lifestyle of the characters, I think there was an overkill in that department. Although Paul Thomas Anderson has not directed much, but might have been selected for this film due to his 1988 work "The Dirk Diggler Story". One thing that has been brilliantly portrayed is the family atmosphere between the characters when they work together, live and celebrate. Although this is not a typical family, they certainly seem to care about each other. The wonderful soundtrack really gives a sense of time in a time when disco was the rage. There are many disco favorites and some other wonderful songs. <br /> <br /> The story is about a gifted young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg), who is invited to the porn industry. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes an adult movie star almost overnight. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director who takes his films very seriously because he believes that his work is more than just pornography, but true art. However, Dirk becomes overly addicted to drugs and soon walks along a dangerous road where he can lose everything. Although the character Dirk is more in focus, there are subplots for the other characters and their life attempts. They will wish and hope their situation improves. All in all, a successful movie.
