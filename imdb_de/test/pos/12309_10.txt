James Joyce may well write some of the best phrases in English, and his short story The Dead, which finishes his The Dubliners collection, may contain the most perfect paragraph in the English language in his finale. It's fitting that John Huston, who wanted to hold back to film that story, ended his career with it. As with The Red Badge of Courage and the man who would become king, Huston worshiped the literary source but made the adaptation cinematographic. And with "The Dead" (which was completed after Huston's death by his son Tony Huston) we get something almost perfect in the combination of literature and cinema. <br /> <br /> Everything the cinema can do can be judged as a whole, commentators point out that "this is not the African queen" (and does not have to be); This is a kind of film that is uncompromising for an audience. Each of us has argued through the portrait of an artist in school, and one must bring with it the maturity of appreciation of how words and images in and of themselves can affect us. As with the silent films, Huston is looking for something pure here. He works with the confidence of his many years of experience and makes the world a masterpiece that corresponds to the original by Joyce. <br /> <br /> Many veterans of the Irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a self-esteemed (and bogus self-doubt) man, who is reinforced by hosting an annual party on the eve of the Epiphany. What awaits Gabriel Conroy is an evening full of celebration, song, dance and poetry, where he is asked to toast the annual sisters and their two sisters and niece hosting the party. He is distracted from the task of taking this opportunity, and this distraction makes him vulnerable to a crushing experience handed over to him by his wife. Although his ego is shattered when he hears a story from his wife's past, it is also a gift in which everything that seemed important throughout the evening is carried away by the realization of the impending mortality for all who live , <br /> <br /> And instead of trying to make the last famous episode of the story "cinematic," Huston brings in a voice and we hear those incredible words being recited as we "watch the snow, the weak falling through the universe and falling weak. " It's the perfect solution for adapting a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The cast is all we want. Since this is essentially a testament to the power of the written word and how it brings us together through shared experiences, every performer seems to be exalted by his role. Anjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy has a great selection to play, and her account of a little boy who once loved her Sears was not just Gabriel Conroy, but also the audience. <br /> <br /> When I think of Anjelica Huston, it is the transformation she makes in this film; and when I think of her father, I remember this movie first.
