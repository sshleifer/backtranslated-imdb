Nothing is worse than the genocides of our world history. This film attempts to describe the horror faced by a particular family - a common narrative instrument - in the atomic bomb world of Hiroshima. Most memorable are the graphic and sad images people meet in Hiroshima after the war. The story, however, is more concerned with the effect on a particular group of people and how they deal with their lives. In other words, if you do not really care about it, the movie gets boring. However, it is hard not to worry about destroying the home of a family. I am not sure if I would recommend this film because it has little political connotation and frankly did not sustain my interest in the problems of the family.
