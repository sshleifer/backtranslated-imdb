I loved the movie. I loved Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whaley. The movie had many different places. I really liked it when Ann Hampton realized that she could not make Rhett love her. And when Scarlett and Ann got together and Ann apologized for taking Rhett and Scarlett, she told her not to worry, she was going to get him back. It had a great story. You just can not compare it to GWTW. It just has so many great scenes. I love SCARLETT and GWTW! Of course, do not forget to have a handkerchief on hand.
