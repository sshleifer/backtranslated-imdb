Right, let's go, you've probably read in previous reviews of this movie that it's horrible, bad traded at all costs. Well, I suppose that's true in a way. You can say that you could not write a spoiler in this comment because there is no conspiracy. However, there is a fine line between terribly awful and absolutely hilarious and believe me that this movie is the last. Acting is so bad, the plot is so non-existent and the ending so completely amazing that you will laugh all the way through. There are scenes in this film that take the comedy to a new level. Do not expect an Oscar winner, but trust me for the low price you'll pay for this disaster, it's worth every penny.
