I saw this movie the other day and I have to admit, it was probably the best movie of this generation. It turned out that I was born in 1988, but I can relate to this film, just as Cary Grant has to do with an STD or Burt Reynolds on burnout. Marky Mark did not lean on a 'poop after his brief stay in New Kids on the Block, which I'll call "the best band in the world" (aka BBW), so beware! I love you all and continue to support Marky Msrk, because he needs us more than ever. He is the only boy who has survived the de-sharted.
