This film, with its complexity and subtlety, is one of the most memorable short films I've ever seen. The themes he addresses are ugly, cynical and sometimes even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, elaborate with its camera angles and magnificent in its style, taking the short story of the same name written by a master, skilfully recreates short stories, Tobias Wolff. <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil the movie and I do not want to go into details except to say that this movie is great in and of itself. It is proud of what it does and makes it good. It shows the most important memories of life, all of which can be surpassed by the only elusive feeling: unexpected bliss. This film has generated the same feelings in my own accord that the main character (Tom Noonan) felt when words changed his existence, and that's an impressive achievement.
