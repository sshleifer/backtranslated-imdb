I recently watched this movie for the first time in over 30 years and was very pleasantly surprised. I recalled a film that captured the mood and feel of Britain in the mid-1960s without getting into the clichés of "swinging Britain," which so many other films believed would need to spread, and my memory turned out to be right. Those who feel that it is a television game are not entirely wrong, but while Andrea Newman became famous for his TV drama, the film is more in the tradition of "Kitchen Sink" films like "Saturday Night And Sunday Morning '' but with a focus on civic life rather than working class life. Rod Steiger is excellently suited as a frightened middle-aged leader who is unfortunately married to an oppressed and apparently infertile wife (Claire Bloom). The beginning of the "technological revolution" is the background for the drama, in which old values ​​and certainties are called into question. This is the stage for Judy Geeson's central character, a role that at the time was a shocking departure from the typical prim behavior of contemporary heroines. The reversal of the roles in which the girl assessed her conquests in a small black book was a precursor to the feminist movement and was criticized for promoting the promiscuity of young girls. The irony of this criticism lies in the characters of Claire Bloom and Peggy Ashcroft, both of whom are acceptably dissatisfied. Peter Hall has made only a few films, and this is a pity. Steiger is exemplary and absolutely believable, why he was so highly regarded
