I actually saw an ad for JAPAN SINKS in a Japanese magazine last year and wondered what the hell it was until I saw the trailer for the movie. It was then that I remembered seeing the English translation of Sakyo Komatsu's novel a few years ago. I got it, and it was pretty good, but also realistic. It is enough to make the reader afraid to hear any news of earthquakes in Japan. Now I have read the book and seen this 2006 movie version (the first movie was released in 1973). And you know what? I thought the movie was pretty good, although there are big changes from novel to film (but that's understandable). The story is simple - a significant tectonic shift will cause Japan to fall within a year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis shake the country as desperate efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible. A scientist has a plan that could stop the sinking of the land and save what is left of the landmass. But can it be implemented on time? I saw JAPAN SINKS at the Otakon 2007, and although there were some problems I had with it - it's a bit too long, and a few character moments were a bit too sour - I was still excited. The sheer notion of a nation sinking into the sea has come terribly true, and the impact has been some of the best I've ever seen, rivaling anything Hollywood has done. The film also does not play favorites with the main characters, and some do not come to the credits. <br /> <br /> Frankly, some negative comments on this movie were taken by surprise. Disagreements, I think. I personally enjoyed it. And I have read the original book.
