Although this episode was offensive to Tourette Syndrome Association, others thought it was funny while others thought it was a bad start to the new season. <br /> <br /> This episode was funny and shocking. South Park was the first episode to write history with the most cursive words, unless you count the movie as an episode. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching Chris Hansen and his television show make fun of Catch a Predator. I did not like the idea, as Chris Hansen had thought, that Chris Hansen would do a show on Tourettes and talk to a boy and beat up the Jews. <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like was how South Park thought people with Tourettes syndrome were just spilling out such a bad language. I've seen people with Tourettes Syndrome on TV, and they're not just spitting out bad words. Unless I am wrong.
