My attitude towards the end. Bobby died at the hands of his stepfather. Mike had tried to get Bobby out. Only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. Bobby died ... Mike survived as a kid, creating an alternative to how Bobby left off ... Mike made a plane that blew out Bobby. Children who are sexually and violently abused often create very different worlds to survive. <br /> <br /> Also great to see my old neighborhood. We called it San Jose Boulevard and I lived exactly where these houses were filmed. It was so strange to see that they were shot in the houses ... not in studios. It was my kitchen, my bedroom and my living room. And these hills ... we use them to hike them as children ... to look down on our little valley ... and catch a glimpse of the bay. Was a real nostalgic trip for me.
