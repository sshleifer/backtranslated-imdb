That was an excellent movie. I am dealing with a child I am educating that has FAE, and the reputation of this film was more than words can explain. I also bought the book and it was great. I would like to have a copy for my own use, so I can have my son's teachers look at it as well. I would like to know if someone could sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a while or refer me to someone where I could buy it. Thanks, Myra. I would recommend this movie to anyone dealing with children / adults with special abilities. This movie should be shown again on TV. The medical team that has been following my son would also like to have a copy. His special Ed teacher also asked me to try to find a copy he could have or borrow. <br /> <br /> Thank you
