If you find the first 30 minutes of this movie so slow that you are wondering why you are looking at it, do not give up. Listening to the Danish language is something new for most North Americans who do not see and hear Danish films. As the movie progressed, however, it got better and better and the viewer was rewarded for his patience. <br /> <br /> As a fan of the movie "Out Of Africa", this movie caught my interest because it is based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the main character in the film. <br /> <br /> The meal - Babette's Feast - was amazing. I am not a cook, but I was impressed! How you interpret the story varies depending on how much you read into it and where you are religious. If the latter refers to the definition of "legalism," this may influence the interpretation of this story. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a good movie, but do not pay attention when you're dieting.
