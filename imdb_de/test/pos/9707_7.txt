Johnny Knoxville has gone mad. <br /> <br /> In the first Jackass, he enjoyed practical jokes more than physical stuff. his opening car gag and the later bit involving an air horn on a golf course were more like a kind of extreme open camera? But in Jackass: Number Two he is really out of his rocker. <br /> <br /> Starting with a sequence in which he is chased by a bull through a living room or, later, when he is riding a rocket (a stunt that almost cost him) his life due to an unexpected explosion of his Side of the rocket) and, above all, when he deliberately stands in front of a defense mechanism and takes a puff with pellets in the stomach, Knoxville is a madman. In the first movie Bam Margera and Steve-O ?? infamous party animals? They were the brave ones, but it's pretty bad seeing Knoxville tempt them to do a stunt. This is essentially a series of stunts that are pulled out by guys with testosterone use. each other up. It will eventually end with death for one of the performers? In Jackass 2, Steve-O almost loses his leg to a shark, Knoxville (as mentioned earlier) is nearly exploded by a rocket, and so on and so forth. Jackass 3 has been confirmed by the success of 2, and I can not imagine a stunt going beyond the bull run in the opening scene of this film. this is incredible stuff. It's almost unbelievable, and I wondered if it was fake, but apparently it was 100% real. (Which is really scary.) And in terms of extremes, Jackass 2 far surpasses its predecessor? it also feels more cinematic than the first movie, with less of the cheesy title stunts that became famous in the original MTV television series. Unfortunately, the guys here had too much freedom a good number of the gags are just rough exercises? I can enjoy the occasional poop-gag, but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet or seeing Steve-O drinking beer (yes, frankly) gets angry after a while. Even the frat boys in the show I visited? Who was thrilled when Wee Man pulled back a playing card and wriggled off a manipulated chair? were disgusted by some scenes in this movie. It's not about getting away as much as possible. it's about saying, "Is that entertaining or funny?" Unfortunately, that's often not the case. <br /> <br /> But for every lame stunt that deals with feces and farts on people's faces, there are some brilliant hidden camera bits. The crazy director Spike Jonze ("Adaptation") disguises herself as an old woman and goes naked on the street, with drooping breasts and without shame. My personal favorite sketch was that Knoxville was an irresponsible old man who had lunch with his grandson and had him drink and smoke and abuse and insult people. This is a classic comedy that is taking the liberties of an R rating to new dimensions. Too bad that they had to ruin all that great stuff? including a final segment with a sophisticated terrorist prank? with funny jokes on the way. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, there is enough spirit and insanity in this movie to deserve a look, and it has really taken the concept of extremity in the cinema to new heights.
