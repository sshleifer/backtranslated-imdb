... as valuable as the tomb of King Tut! (OK, maybe not so valuable, but it's worth looking down). I have noticed that no one has commented on this film for some years, and I hope that a new post will bring new comments. This is a movie I remembered only from excerpts from my childhood, and I recently saw when I was tired of waiting for Fox to honor his own past, and the Korean DVD (in English, but with irreplaceable Korean subtitles). I will not go over any further detailed description of the plot - suffice it to say that for the first time I have seen in the correct widescreen format, which interests me in the prospects and scope of the film. The dull pictures still hold and the palace sets are really breathtaking. However, it is the smaller scale details that give this film its depth and richness and give an insight into the way of life of the Egyptian poor and their elite. The bazaars, huts, docks, embalming houses and taverns are as intriguing as the pharaoh's throne room. While mistakes are made on a large scale (especially the dynastic succession), the details are more carefully researched than the vast majority of Hollywood films. Visually, it is not without flaws - the interiors are often too bright and colorful to integrate seamlessly with the exterior. Nonetheless, this is a movie that rightfully should be considered as bold on a small scale as it is on a large scale. Boring? In parts absolutely. About Reacts? Underacted? Yes, both - though "understated" could be a more appropriate description. Too long? Absolutely not. I wish they had spent more time with Sinuhe's experiences in the House of Death and the Hittites and less with his "romance" with Nefer. Historically inaccurate? Yes, that too, but also Shakespeare. Nobody chastises him for it. I appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next man, but in the end it has to be remembered that cinema is theater and not a history lesson.
