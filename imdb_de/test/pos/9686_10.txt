.... but at the same time a part of you thinks, "Am I ready for what I will see?" <br /> <br /> In the end, you're glad you saw it. It was me at least. Jackass Number Two has twice the laugh and twice the action. Some stunts will make you breathless. I think next to Little Miss Sunshine it was the best movie I saw this summer. Maybe even this year. <br /> <br /> The entire cast returns, alongside a few like Chris Raab and Rake Yohn. I do not think one of the cast members had a boring moment. Each stunt was either funny or dangerous or a combination of both; stupid. The beginning was as funny as the first, and interestingly enough, the end was funny; the cast a musical number. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is the perfect movie you can see with your friends. Stay during the credits, there are some pretty funny moments. One concerns Luke Wilson.
