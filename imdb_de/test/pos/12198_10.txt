Surface is one of the largest t.v. Series that I have seen. The spectacle is great and the action fascinating. With each episode, I could barely wait for the next one. I especially thought that Carter Jenkins, who played Miles Bennett, did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Surface only did one season ... once again the public disappointed me. It's hard to fathom that a great show like this would be canceled as the reality shows go on and on. Whoever made the decision to cancel this show really dropped the ball.
