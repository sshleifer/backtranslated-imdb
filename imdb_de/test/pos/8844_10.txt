I can not believe that I have never added two cents to this movie! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies ever. Many critics and moviegoers speak of John Carpenter's "Halloween" to set trends and be "his best work". These people have not seen this version of "The Thing" because it is top of the list with "Halloween." <br /> <br /> John Carpenter's work shines in this movie. He made a movie that was already done, and instead of "making it new" he made the book on which the first film was based! Brilliant. <br /> <br /> Every man's casting was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me fearful, let me guess, made me laugh, challenged me to this day, "Who goes there? " in this movie. This movie did not have a Hollywood sweetie pie or a funny ending and what a brave step to have none in 1982. Another brilliant step. <br /> <br /> I was at the show for this movie when I was on holiday in Southern California. The audience at the show became wild! I've been wearing these memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought there would be no way on God's green earth that this movie would not be a hit. The revenue at the box office was because of the "ET, The Extra Terrestrial" and "Poltergeist" a Dudel. Two very good family-oriented films went to the box office in 1982 when this movie came out. <br /> <br /> This movie was what I was looking for as a horror movie for adults, a horror / thriller with an adult script and real adult actors. No kids playing adults. Not a little Miss "big-breasted" scream queen of the day running around screaming for titillations, BUT real men with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. Heck, as a feminist, I have not even missed women in this movie! And good for Mr. Carpenter, because he did not insert one there, it really would not have made sense! (Unless "The Thing" was actually female! Something to think about!) <br /> <br /> I've seen special effects of that time that I've never seen before. I saw make-up that kept me up for a few nights. This is what today's horror / thriller lacks. Today, the directors are teeming. Today the studios disappeared. Too much CGI and too little faith, too much CGI and too little history, too little imagination. They leave the theater and in a week - or less - forget the movie and go to the next big movie opening. This one stays with you. This is one of the hallmarks of a great movie. <br /> <br /> Many reviews have written that it's horrible to pay $ 10 for a movie. For films like this one would pay for it and does not feel offended. This movie is NOT for everyone. <br /> <br /> I think it's terrible that they give this movie a "cult" movie. I think the audience is wider than many would think, and although this was not a commercial success in 1982, it's an example of how the release of a damn good movie at the wrong date makes a damn good movie look bad. After John Carpenter's film, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects, and storylines from this version of The Thing. <br /> <br /> I am now very excited to record this movie is one of the best films of all time, undervalued. Please see it uncut, see it in the mailbox and hear it digitally. They will talk about it for years, too.
