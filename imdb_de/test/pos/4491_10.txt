I'll never forget how much this show affects me when I saw it for the first time. From the moment the major is surprised by the clown, his desperate attempts to understand the situation ("We live, we are human, we must have memories!", Inaccurate quote, but close), to his skillful Attempt To improvise a means of escape, this is a fascinating drama. <br /> <br /> Small touches remain with the viewer for a long time after he has seen them. The moment when the lovely ballerina dances for everyone, the off-key and screeching bagpipe of the Scottish musician; the hitchhiker's tramping remark, "A miss is as good as a mile," the Major shakes the conclusion that they must be in hell. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant episode, beautifully written and played. The stunning beauty of Susan Harrison contributes to the memory of the strange, touching story.
