This film was an amazing tribute to all who have undergone this kind of pain and suffering. Acting was not the greatest, I admit, but it was a passion for the message of sending people to prisons without a lawyer or any kind of trial being cruel and unusual. They even had a damned trial of Saddam. Why does not every suspected terrorist have a fair and justified trial or hearing why they were even tagged? I'm leaving the movie, but I think it's worth talking about this sick, twisted idea of ​​the government. The way the film tells the story and the background story was a big mystery. The whole movie I tried to connect the daughter with the plot, which in the end was very obvious. No doubt the direction was unbelievable, but the only thing that did not interest me was that Reese Witherspoon's interest and the struggle for the ideal she held was not so much emphasized. Otherwise, it was actually very entertaining and, above all, it caught my attention and interest in the two hours it played.
