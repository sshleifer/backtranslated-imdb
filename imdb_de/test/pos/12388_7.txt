I just watched this movie at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival. As I watched the movie, I felt like I'd seen a movie with a similar story ... a movie with Ray Liotta, but I do not remember much. Of course this one is much more dramatic, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> This is the story: Emilio's life becomes a lie that he can no longer bear. After 20 years lied to his wife, son and all the people he knows about all his life, the truth haunts him and there's no place to watch After a while, you're the same Thing tired ... The affair with a young girl should add something, but it does not matter. Still, the movie is still funny, exciting and stirring. Either you want to help Emilio with his lies or help everyone else to catch him. I liked the analogies, the photography and the good performances. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10.
