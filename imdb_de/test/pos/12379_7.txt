* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I do not care what anyone says, this movie is damn funny. This is the sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a killer snowman. The snowman originates when a convicted serial killer is brought into the execution chamber, but the truck crashes with a truck carrying DNA manipulation chemicals that associate human DNA with dirt or, in this case, with snow. The first movie was just boring, and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him. <br /> <br /> Or so they thought. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a year after the second one. Some scientists are resurrecting Jack Frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals. There is never any explanation for why they do that, they just do it. Meanwhile, the sheriff, who has arrested Frost at first, goes to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all. There are talking carrots that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you put them in your mouth, and kill snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They even say "Dada!" like babies. I have to give the creators of this recognition. The snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever devised. I wish I could get one as a pet. Frost finally freezes the island as if a killer snowman has the ability to affect the weather. Then there are the actors. There's Manners, the FBI agent from the first movie, except he wears an eyecatcher here. YARR MATEYS, SHIVER ME TIMBERS, I'M AN FBI AGENT! Yarrr! And then the stereotypical British adventurer and the stereotypical black Jamaican with dreadlocks. And finally Captain Fun. The most fruity man on the planet in the world, no. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, but it's funny. I laughed at the whole butt and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
