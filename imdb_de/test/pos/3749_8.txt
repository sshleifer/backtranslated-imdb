A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to find their evasive fianc√©. This is a very vicious movie because of its resolution, but up to this point it is interesting, well-played, scary and with a fine set design (by William Cameron Menzies, developed for 3-D projection). Veronica Hurst is intriguing and upscale, a kind of chic Brit Marilyn Monroe, still in love with Richard Carlson, who hides a family secret in his deterrent castle. there are even bats in the bell tower! It moves leisurely to the last extraordinary setting as Hurst and her aunt (Katherine Emery, also the narrator) sneak out of the castle at night to venture into the labyrinth and find in the middle what they are looking for. As a child, I always remembered this sequence - there's nothing more terrifying (or claustrophobic) than not finding out from a 10-foot-high hedge labyrinth. Of course, the two women are separated to prepare the stage for the suspense of the terrible music. The end result is actually somewhat disappointing, because Carlson's epilogue in the end makes something meaningful for all events and even arouses sympathy. Worth seeing.
