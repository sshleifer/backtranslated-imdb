This is a movie gem, slapstick violence abound, Simon Pegg and Green Spew. <br /> <br /> A suspicious-looking power plant and an uncontrollable motorcycle add extra thrill. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend it, maybe not as good as below, but not too short. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen a man impaled by him put his nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for? buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I did not even see the turn at the end when it turned out that Ritchie and Eddie are both ghosts. <br /> <br /> Feeb - 1 boiled egg.
