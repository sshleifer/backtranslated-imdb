The cinema of the 1960s was as much a time of revolution as politics and music. The filmmakers dared to shoot avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects previously only allowed in commercial films. Beginning with "Breathless" and American underground cinema (like Kenneth Anger), films have become more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had a commercial incentive with Easy Rider. One of the best (and most surprising) results of this era was initially one of the least successful. "Head" came into being when The Monkee's career sank seriously, condemning one of the best psychedelic films of all time. <br /> <br /> The story? Well, there really is not, as many have said. The Monkees go from one surreal scenario to the next. However, these sequences are all apparently LSD stained and essentially mock that the Monkees were fed up with their easy pre-production reputation. It is a shame that the film found no audience. As always, the youthful Boppers who loved them had entered a new fashion. The psychedelic / Haight Ashbury crowd the film belonged to would never be caught in a Monkees movie. It's all her loss. This film may be less plottable, but it certainly is not without significance and is put together very intelligently. The crew later made both Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces. The film was revived later in a 1973 Raybert retrospective and received a very positive response, which gave him the cult that had earned him a long time. Ironically, The Monkees would fall victim to the same compromise that they protested in this film in their later reunification of the 1980s. (10/10)
