I met Jennifer a few years ago a few days ago, when she appeared on television in the middle of the night. I fell asleep before it ended, but it stayed with me until I found it. The charm is that although it has not much to offer, there is a fascinating atmosphere, and Ida Lupino and Howard Duff (then a true man and woman) show a tantalizing, restrained chemistry. Lupino plays a woman who was engaged to house a huge California estate whose former janitor - Jennifer - disappeared. (Shadow of Jack Nicholson in Shining, though in this case Lupino is not crazy or has gone). Duff is the guy in town who manages the estate's finances and brings them to Lupino, who decides to play hard. She's more and more involved, not to be obsessed, with what happened to her predecessor in the old dark house with descending stairwells and locked cellars. The atmospheres and the romantic juxtaposition are by far the best part of the movie, since the resolution of the viewer's dissolution is probably a bit disappointing - there just is not much to say (except a little bit of a frisson that Brian anticipates De Palma's cinematic codas) , But it's done well, and it stays with you. An additional extra attraction: This is the film that introduced the song "Angel Eyes", which was to become part of the standard repertoire of Ol 'Blue Eyes.
