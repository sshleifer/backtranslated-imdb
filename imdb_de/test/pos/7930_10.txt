Eisenstein was not only one of the greatest Soviet Russian film directors, but one of the great masters of cinema, including Griffith, Murnau, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles and others. One of the biggest things in all of his films was the edition, very personal and extraordinary in this movie. This was his first sound film, and the use of the score by the great Russian composer Serge Prokofiev in the order of battle forms a perfect contrast between music and image. When you watch this movie, it's like taking a class or lesson in the cinema, something that few movie directors can afford. I never tire of seeing REAL CLASSICS like this movie. I hope that in the near future more people will recognize a great work of art.
