This film reminds me a lot of the later Rock Hudson movie MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT - about a fisherman who NEVER fished and is forced to angling tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is a Martha-Stewart-like writer who can not cook and does not really have the perfect family she describes in her articles - in fact, she has no family at all. Well, like Rock, she gets maneuvered into the performance - in this case, she creates a huge holiday dinner while on a vacation in the country. Since there is no family, she takes a veteran and a few friends home and desperately tries "not to let the cat out of the bag" that she can do nothing for which she is known. A cute little comedy and a welcome movie for the annual holiday movie cast.
