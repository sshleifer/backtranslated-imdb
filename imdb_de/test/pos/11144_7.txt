A particularly adorable movie for those who have seen this at a young age, because it was meant for young people - when they see it again as an adult, it's better to come up with pink eyeglasses. It was the first of the 16 Jungle Jim films and later TV series, the chunky Johnny Weismuller, later made for Columbia (in the last three films he had to use his own name because they had lost the rights) after getting the sack when he played Tarzan for Sol Lesser. Johnny Sheffield also gave up playing Boy to become Bomba the Jungle Boy in a series of 12 films. Jim and party go on a dangerous safari to hunt down the hidden temple of Zimbalu, which is occupied by an obscure devil's tribe. Doctors seem to have the secret of a poison that could also be a cure for polio. Edgar Rice Burroughs probably agreed. After 16 years of monosyllabic speaking, Weismuller seemed awkward to knit sentences, not that it mattered. On the fast march we meet many of the interesting, but generally playful inhabitants of the jungle, the eerie crocodile eating the leading lady with her leg trapped under a branch and the surreal elephant's shell (footage in a corner of the frame). Skipper, the dog, and Caw-Caw, the crow, had many adventures, none of which proved essential to the plot in case you wanted to concentrate! The biggest problem with the movie is the absurd climax, which can be exciting and unfortunately can remind you of the end of a series part. and the original excellent series was made 12 years ago. Although it would not have bothered me personally, it would take a few hours! <br /> <br /> The only thing that was difficult was Weismuller; in many ways a funny children's film from the old days - not recommended for serious adults, so I love it.
