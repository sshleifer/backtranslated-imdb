This movie is really worth watching - Robin Tunney excels and Henry Thomas proves he's one of those rarities, the kid actor who grows into a real actor. The characters are perfectly drawn and because of their depth in the wrong hands, they would not have been able to convince - but all the actors are just amazing. The cast of this film must be there with that of "Girl, Interrupted" (both films happen to be the brilliant Clea Duvall). The music and music choices are perfect, and there are plenty of ways to prevent the movie from becoming just a character study. If you want the story, you will not find it in this review, but I will say that the climax will haunt you for a long time.
