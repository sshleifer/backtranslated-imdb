One of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with "Just for big fans of the main cast or fans of exotic romance / adventure Holywood movies ..." as if these were not enough reason to love them! Anyone who complains about Connery's accent or lack of historical accuracy or the realism of political motives or about any other films outside of the film after this movie, just does not love movies. See it and be impressed by the star power of the two main roles, the exotic, romantic, photography and music motifs, and the courageous adventure of a truly escapist film. This is proof that Hollywood can "do it as before" if it really wants to. A solid 8/10.
