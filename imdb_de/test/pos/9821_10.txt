A film for an adult, educated audience ... <br /> <br /> I saw "Random Hearts" about to be released in North America. This romantic drama was a treat. I'm sure this story will not be for everyone, especially considering that the movie has a bleak downbeat premise. But the picture has some very uplifting strengths in its favor. <br /> <br /> All-Time Box Office Drawing Harrison Ford ("Star Wars", "Lost Ark Raider", "The Fugitive", "Air" Force One ("Patriot Games") is on At the top of his game, as the desperate and desperate internal affairs officer, Dutch, Ford's very restrained, nuanced performance demonstrates the reach he can achieve with class and determination to bring the audience into his world of loss and betrayal This is the perfect complex and very different kind of movie for Harrison Ford to decorate the screen between his action blockbusters, and next year Harrison Ford returns in action, first for director Robert Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump", "Back To The Future ") in his summer thriller" What Lies Beneath "(2000) and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of Tom Clancy" The sum of all fears. "" Fears "becomes Harrison Ford's third appearance as CIA employee Jack Ry Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa," "The Firm," "Tootsie") plays a supporting role in this role, a political adviser to Scott Thomas' Congressmen. It is a very sharp and energetic representation for Pollack. Sydney Pollack is not only a gifted director, he is also one of the most credible, natural and charming actors (see also "Eyes Wide Shut"). <br /> <br /> Kristin Scott-Thomas ("The English.") "The Horse Whisperer" shows that you do not have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. This is one of her better films, and it offers a hugely mature and sophisticated performance that fits well with Ford's quiet toughness. <br /> <br /> The subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot where Ford's character investigates the police corruption. Look for a refreshing and effective twist on "Heat" actor Dennis Haysbert playing Detective George Beaufort, the obstacle Dutch police investigation needs to overcome. <br /> <br /> The rest of the minor occupation is wonderful joy. Charles S. Dutton (whose long-overdue role in a movie starred) shows he's one of the best character actors, and Bonnie Hunt, whom I find extremely solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, charming smile as Wendy Judd. <br /> <br /> The technical side of Pollack's thriller is top notch. From Dave Grusins ​​(Pollack's "The Firm"), a perfectly surrealistic jazzy score, spiky photography by Philippe Rousselot ("A River Run Through It"), to the sharp cut that keeps the movie fresh despite the movie's unfortunate vermouth. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys mysterious plans, character stories and romance. This is a great story about betrayal and forgiveness. It also offers one of the most surprising, yet most striking and certainly controversial endings of a Harrison-Ford movie lately. "Random Hearts" is definitely one of the better films of the year. <br /> <br /> (*** 1/2 of ****) or (8.5 of 10.0)
