This movie must have been quietly released on another side of the world, maybe even in English. I hope nobody understood a word, there is nothing to understand in this movie anyway! Haahaa! Call me a nut, but I think that's one of the best movies ever. Why should I come to this conclusion? Because it's my national free time to sabotage terrible movies, and this begs every other minute! When I became a fan of the Myster Science Theater 3000, I had no doubt that they would find it and use it somewhere. Sure enough! The purchased version had the title "Cave Dwellers" and used strange intro shots, not even from the movie itself (apparently they were ashamed to use footage from their own movie!). I can not say that I recommend buying this movie. Rather, I strongly recommend the MST3K version. Sure, it can be found almost anywhere where MST3K DVDs are sold, do not miss it!
