In my opinion - "The Patriot" is one of Steven Seagal's best films. <br /> <br /> I've heard that people say it's the worst thing ever, it's not like SS, etc. I can not agree with that. As a very spiritual man, a great Master Seagal established a good tradition in action movies. He always has a good background, great action, high professionalism and a clever message. This movie has everything. They have good shooting scenes, great aikido. Although there is not much, it shows us its peaceful side. This change in his filmmaking only proves his spiritual growth (he does not kill Chisolm's buddy in the end). "The Patriot" is definitely one of the best films from the filmmaker's point of view view I've seen lately. You have great panoramic views of Montana, we see real American nature and beautiful wildlife (including horses and flowers). The soundtrack also deserves a few words. During the film, I had a great opportunity to hear classic American cowboy western music (not country). Similar music was heard in "Back to the Future Prt.3". The spectacle of SS has greatly improved since his last films. His role is unknown to him (unlike cops and commandos), but he does a good job as a retired government doctor. His acting is convincing and his lines are good. <br /> <br /> I was really happy with the cast. LQ Jones proves that life and death go together around the world, Whitney Yellow Robe plays a beautiful and clever scientist, Camilla Belle makes an outstanding appearance as McClaren's daughter. Mr.Seagal discusses the much talked-about "Real American" tradition and militia commandos who hold their own position (he likes the constitution well, but chubby bearded men have nothing to do with it). Also with regard to the East-West medical system and nature good points are addressed. <br /> <br /> The best of Seagal. And open new horizons in his film career. <br /> <br />
