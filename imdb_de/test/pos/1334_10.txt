Regardless of what the critics draw from it, I liked what it is. Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. Soderberg has done the artistic Hard Edge stuff before, won Oscars, is at the top of his game. Ocean's 12 is light, commercial, fluffy, Steve's Day on the Midway, if you like. I'm generally no fan of Zeta-Jones, but even I have to admit that Kate is STUNNING in this movie. The screams of an upcoming trek are over and I will be one of the millions who watch 120 minutes of George and Brad and Matt through Clooney's excavations in Lake Como, while cheating a rich villain again and again. If we tolerated 3 Lord of the Rings rates, I ask if we can only drool Clooney's salt and peppercorns once more?
