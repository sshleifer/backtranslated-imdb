I was surprised how emotionally I invested in this movie. Peter Boyle is a tour de force as a socially conservative working-class fanatic, Joe. I actually felt sorry for some of his complaints. Of course, he does not mention the underlying historical socio-economic reasons for many of his prejudices. The film also offers interesting insights into the rapid transformation of American society at that time. Recreational drugs, occasional sex, and the challenge of parental authority have been in vogue, replacing the long-cherished traditions of respect for God, country, and age. The fans of Susan Sarandon will be thrilled. Joe is her movie debut. It also gives viewers a visual treat at the beginning of the film. Recommended, 8/10.
