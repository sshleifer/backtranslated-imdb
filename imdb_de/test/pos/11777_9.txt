I've just received the DVD for Hardware Wars in a shiny new package that looks irresistible. Put it in my DVD player to find a lot of extra fun. The extra content on the DVD is even longer than the movie. For those of you who (sorry!) Have never seen Hardware Wars, it's a fantastically stupid Star Wars parody (of course from Episode IV). Home appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuum cleaners, and a waffle iron) are available for Ty-Fighter, X-Wings, R2D2, and the Death Star. Instead of Princess Leia, there is Princess Ann-Droid with Cinnabon hairstyle. You have understood the point, I'm sure. Crazy stupidity and a fun ride for any Star Wars freak (like me!). Now the DVD - wow! A commentary by a director in which he basically deals with the movie and makes fun of him and the whole project. An interview with Fosselius about Creature Features (remember ?!) and hilarious "Director's Cut" and "foreign version" of the movie (all jokes, of course). Anyway, that's great. I loved Hardware Wars in the theater and I'm so glad I have the DVD in my collection - between MST3K: the movie and Thumb Wars!
