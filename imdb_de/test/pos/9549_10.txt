There are films that make a career. For George Romero it was night of the living dead; for Kevin Smith CLERKS; for Robert Rodriguez, EL MARIACHI. Add to list Onur Tukels absolutely amazing DING-A-LING-LESS. Error-free filming and as safe and professional as the above films. I have not laughed so much since I saw THE FULL MONTY. (And even then, I do not think I laughed so hard ... so to speak.) Tukel's talent is remarkable: DING-A-LING-LESS is so full of double intentions that you would have to sit down with a copy of that script, and check it line by line to fully grasp its width and width. Each recording is beautifully composed (a clear sign of a sure director), and the performances are all-round solid (there's no exaggerated scenery you would expect from a movie like this one). DING-A-LING-LESS is a movie whose time has come.
