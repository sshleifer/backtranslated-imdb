On March 17, 1974, a man is found dead in the toilets of Penn Station in Manhattan. Although known, he can not be identified because he has scraped out the personal information in his passport and his body has been held in the morgue for three days. It turned out to be the body of Louis I. Kahn, who is considered one of the greatest American architects of the twentieth century. He died on the way from India at the age of 73, where one of his largest projects, the Institute for Management in Ahmedabad, was near completion. <br /> <br /> One of the most influential American architects of the post-war era. Louis Kahn's architectural heritage includes the Parliament House in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Kimbell Art Museum at Forth Worth, the Yale Art Gallery, the Salk Institute in California, and some sort of mobile "Music Boat", which is used for concerts in the ports in various cities around the world. <br /> <br /> While he was an architect, he knew little about his private life. Besides his wife Esther and daughter Sue Ann, Kahn was survived by two lovers, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng, and their two children. All three families lived within miles of a suburb of Philadelphia, but their paths did not intersect until the funeral. His son Nathaniel, the director of the film, was only 11 years old and had few memories of his father's weekly visits to Harriet Patterson, Nathaniel's mother, in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, he embarks on a journey to confront his father by visiting Kahn's building, talking to relatives and colleagues, and visiting the places that have played a role in Louis Kahn's life. The most moving altercations are, as Nathaniel, his mother , a landscape architect and lover of Louis Kahn, asks why she played the second fiddle with his wife and never confronted him with it. Tears shed her eyes, but she does not regret it. "It was worth it." It is a very sad moment. She is obviously shaken and treated as an outsider at her funeral, which was banned. It's almost like she's having a replacement life. It all feels strangely unreal. Another interview with Edward Bacon, Kahn's architectural enemy, who was responsible for rebuilding his native Philadelphia in the 1950s and 1960s, nearly suffers a stroke when recalling Kahn's unappealing ideas about architecture. His son Nathaniel listens uncomfortably when a high-ranking bacon literally screams in rage when Kahn's name appears. The last scene is reserved for Kahn's biggest creation, the Capitol in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The completion lasted 23 years, a huge and extraordinary building that Bangladeshis are very proud of. It is one of the few national symbols with format in this impoverished nation. Some of the interviews with the locals brought tears to my eyes, especially when they found out who they are talking to - god forbid - the architect's own son! <br /> <br /> The film is just as personal a journey as it is a report on Kahn's great architectural heritage, and above all, the realization of the film itself and filming in general. Perhaps Louis I. Kahn has stalled as a father, but these shortcomings in his personal life make for a particularly interesting portrait in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
