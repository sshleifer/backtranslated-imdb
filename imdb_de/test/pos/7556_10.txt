The film follows four friends from the 1950s (when they are in high school) until 1981. They are Danilo (Craig Wasson), a Yugoslav immigrant; Georgia (Jodi Thelan) a "free spirit"; David (Michael Huddleston), who has no personality, and Tom (Jim Metzler) a tall, strong, handsome, robust guy. All three love Georgia, but she only loves Danilo. The film focuses mainly on these two - he describes his life, his love and his attraction over the years. Danilo also tries to win the love of his tough immigrant father. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, but it is not without its disadvantages. Thelan's high, squeaky voice is annoying (but you get used to it); the story jumps around very fast; The life of Tom and David is never explained (Tom turns up with a Vietnamese wife and children and David has a wife we ​​will not meet until the end); Some crucial scenes are poorly written, and there are some obvious pre-cuts to cut (probably to keep the movie at 2 hours). <br /> <br /> But everything else is so good that you can easily forget the problems. The story is captivating - you really get to know the characters and understand and always get involved in life. With a few exceptions, the screenplay (by Steve Tesich) is good - in fact Tesich himself was a Yugoslavian immigrant and is largely based on his own experiences. Acting is great - especially Thelan and Wasson - Reed Birney also has a strong, sympathetic performance as Louie, Danilo's college roommate. And Lois Smith is very interesting in her role. And look quickly for Mercedes Ruehl and Glenne Headly! <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a really great story about immigrants who grow up, who love America and the 50s-80s. <br /> <br /> This film was (wrongly) disregarded at its release. The studio did not know how to promote it (it's a tough movie to market) and the critics stamped on it (Pauline Kaels's review in "The New Yorker" was particularly harsh). It hardly played in cinemas (I was fortunate to catch it in its 1981 short running) and just disappeared. That's a shame. This film is just ripe for a new edition. I do not bet on it - but you never know! A very specific 10!
