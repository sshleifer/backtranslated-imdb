This biopic of early rock'n'roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The highlights of the film are Busey's stage performances, where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings so much energy into the performances that Holly's own performances are almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious, tough grin lights up the screen, creating an absolutely believable and winning personality, and his Oscar nomination for Best Actor was earned by celebrity and New York and his premature death in a plane crash. One thing I found interesting was Buddy's ambition - he had big plans to go beyond recording and performance to producing. As young as he was, he already established himself as a shrewd businessman and definitely wanted to take things to a higher level. We'll never know if he would have ultimately catapulted his early success into a business brand like The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The lyrics of many songs by Holly are quite youthful; Read the lyrics for "Peggy Sue" or "Oh Boy!" and you will see what I mean. This may be explained to a large extent by his popularity with youthful viewers, but his instrumentation and stage appearances certainly contribute to his influence on the following groups - both the Rolling Stones and the Beatles have confirmed his importance. <br /> <br /> Obviously, some freedoms were taken for dramatic effects. I doubt, for example, that Holly ever struck a producer in Nashville or that the audience in the Apollo Theater in New York reacted so directly to dancing wildly in the hallways. If you want to get closer to the truth, read the documentary "The Real Buddy Holly Story" (1985), produced and moderated by a very relaxed and dedicated Paul McCartney. This includes interviews with Holly's family, friends and bandmates (Holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in The Buddy Holly Story). Members of other bands such as Keith Richards and Don Everly offer opinions and stories and there are recordings of old Holly performances. The McCartney production can stand alone, but it's an excellent companion piece to "The Buddy Holly Story" and should be viewed for anyone who looks at the fictionalized story.
