Changi has a wonderfully fresh script, played equally well by young and old actors. John Doyle did a great job in making humor a tragic, true story. A sometimes sad story that is fun and captivating, especially for those of us who are not familiar with the events of World War II in Southeast Asia. John Doyle's parallel story successfully bridges the gap between past and present, giving the audience an insight into the long-term effects of the war on the inmates and their families, and provides the basis for an excellent narrative, both of which round out the stories individually and collectively , Doyle deserves praise for that. We have been very pleased in the past with his rich and quick-witted humor, which shows in his long-standing collaboration with Greg Pickhaver as "Roy & HG". <br /> <br /> When the series approaches halfway, we look forward to seeing how the story develops with anticipation.
