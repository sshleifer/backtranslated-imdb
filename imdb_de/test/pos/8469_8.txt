It was one day in 1891, when the Scottish inventor William K.L. Dickson surprised his boss, Thomas Alva Edison, with his remarkable work developing movies. After many experiments, Dickson was now able to capture real scenes with his camera and reproduce them with his invention, the Kinetoscope, as if a fraction of the time had been preserved in celluloid. Soon Dickson's Kinetoscope would become a tremendous success as a new type of entertainment, with many people willing to pay the nickel, who was forced to watch people dance, or acrobats through the "Peepshow" of the Kinetoscope stunts carry out. However, the invention was not complete, to capture real life, as we know it, on film, the sound in the films was required. Dickson continued to experiment, and this short experiment, Kinetophone's first film, was the result. In this experiment, the codename was simply referred to as "Dickson Experimental Sound Film" (director William K.L.). Dickson stands in front of a shot cone for a wax body (earliest sound recording method), with his violin on his hands and plays a song called "Song of the Cabin Boy". The idea was to record the song in the cylinder at the same time as the camera recorded its movements. To show that this is a movie, two of Edison's "Black Maria" lab decided to dance in front of the camera. Contrary to what the author Vito Russo claimed in his book "The Celluloid Closet," this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality, as it evidently referred to the labors of loneliness in the lab, much like the lonely sailors who the song "Listening to the Cabin Boy" was dedicated (the title that Russo says, "The Gay Brothers" is actually anachronistic since "gay" did not have homosexual connotations in the late 1890s.) Unfortunately, Dickson was not in the In order to achieve the desired effect, the kinetophone could never really produce the synchronized audio with images: while he had the cylinder with the sound and the celluloid with the images, the synchronization of the two elements was not exactly effective, and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Louis Lumières Cinématographe prompted Edison's team to focus on projection systems, and Dickson eventually left the company Unfortunately, in 1998 the Dickson cylinder was rebuilt with the sound of the film, and film editor Walter Murch restored the experiment as intended. Finally, "Dickson Experimental Sound Film" was heard in synchronous tone as its inventor intended. Although it was not a successful attempt, this outstanding film testifies to the enormous genius of Kinetoscope's father. 8.10
