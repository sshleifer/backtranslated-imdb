BIG FAT LIAR is in my opinion an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - "MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - "ALL THAT") were playing tricks on Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE), I smiled and felt good. I liked this movie best. In fact, everything that happened after Jason's essay that falsely landed in Marty's hands was hilarious. I especially loved Cameo by Jaleel White. When I saw him for the first time, I could not be sure, but when I asked my mother if he was, she said, "Of course!" Before summarizing, I would like to say, "As I said, there is a moral in this story, and that moral is always to tell the truth." If you are a fan of Frankie Muniz, Amanda Bynes or Paul Giamatti, I recommend this absolutely funny movie with a moral.
