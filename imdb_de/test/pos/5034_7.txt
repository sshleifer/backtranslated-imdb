This is another film of John Travolta's comeback, and if he continues with characters and films like this, his comeback will be felt. <br /> <br /> This is so cute ... disgusting if you are not in the romance comedy scene. If you are, this is an innovative RomCom. Each performance (including that of Skippy the Dog) was beautiful, with little more than a trace of disrespect found in Dogma. (Although, as the movies go, I loved dogma very much!) <br /> <br /> Travolta is not nearly as naughty in its performance as the previews would suggest. He is an angel and if you think he is well read then you understand that angels were anything but perfect. They are therefore not offended by this movie. Even those who are overly sensitive to such things should not be offended by this work, as Nora has made a great effort to make it the least abrasive in the face of the topic. I love that and love it more and more when I see it. It is beautiful and sweet, captivating and adorable. <br /> <br /> It rates a 7.3 / 10th of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
