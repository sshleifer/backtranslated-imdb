I saw Two Hands in Sydney a few years ago and it immediately became one of my favorite movies of all time. Action, adventure, comedy and romance are all in one (and a bit of Zen for a good measure). As with many Australian films, the storyline is easy to follow, yet wonderfully appealing. Jordan should justifiably take pride in his work Favorite comedy scenes not only of this film, but in fact every movie that has been cut out! If you are watching this movie, make sure it is the original one.
