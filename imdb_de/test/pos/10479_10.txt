"Babette's Feast" and "The Horses Mouth" are the two most revealing and accurate films about a true artist. The main lines in "Babette's Feast" are not, as some other commentators here have said, "an artist is never poor," but two lines that come before and after him: <br /> <br /> "I could do it happy if I have done my best ... All over the world a long cry from the artist's heart sounds: Give me the chance to do my best. "<br /> <br /> I spent nine years Producing experimental multimedia music theater in San Francisco and raising money for productions involving dozens of singers, actors, designers, etc. It was hard work to do their best. They were just like Babette: they wanted to get every dollar to do their best work. Babette's art is fine French cuisine, and if she performs her art to the maximum, it costs 10,000 francs. When, after years of political exile from France, isolated with two solicitous maids on a barren Scandinavian coast, she suddenly gets 10,000 francs, she does what every real artist would do: she sees that she has the unexpected chance to do her best , and she does it. She spends all the money so that she can do her best work as an artist. The twist in the movie is that we do not know that she is such an artist until she actually cooks and serves the meal. Up to this point, she seems to be just a French working-class woman, a bit negotiating with the artisans and very serious (her husband and son were murdered in 1871 in Paris in acts of violence). <br /> <br /> For such an artist, it is secondary to whether there is an audience for the art that is able to appreciate it. For this reason, the author has organized this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly understand what they are receiving. Babette did not cook this food as a gift to the two bachelors or to the religious community. It was not their goal to achieve a reconciliation or a spirit of good feelings among the members of the small religious sect. In fact, she never leaves the kitchen to talk to them. After dinner, she sits alone, drinks wine and does not pay attention to how the guests react. She enjoys the satisfaction of finally having the chance to do her best as an artist. <br /> <br /> That's why it's so satisfying and so important to the story that the general shows up unexpectedly - because, as Babette knows right away, a general will know what he's up to and appreciate it knowledge. For there is a kind of tragedy in a great work of art shown to an audience that does not even lack a person capable of appreciating it. She is glad, very happy, he came, in fact he is the only guest she mentions throughout the dinner, the only one she chooses for a special treatment - not one of the two bachelors. But she did not plan the meal because she knew that such a person would come to receive it. <br /> <br /> For all who had the opportunity to enjoy a first class Parisian dinner like me (my dad was Naval Attache in the 1980s in Paris and I had my honeymoon in France), this is The Dinner And Babette's satisfaction in making and the pleasure it brings to the guests is absolutely convincing. When an art has the power to drown the recipient with a sense of joy, it is a fine French meal cooked and served in France. This film lays claim to the transformative effects of great art on the recipients. Before dinner, the members of the small religious sect are quarrelsome and deepen old resentments. The old hymns fail to restore good fellowship. People ignore them, talk about them. But the shared experience of sensually great art - because people can enjoy the taste of food and wine, even if they have no idea that they are experiencing great art - they satisfy the people, put them into oblivion, reconcile them. By making them happy, she encourages them to love each other and thus has a god-like sacred effect of bringing peace. This is today's claim of the modern art movement - that art can replace traditional religions to make humanity more peaceful. Contrary to those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of the Christian faith, it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that Christian ritual can not. After all my years in the art world, I have to say that this assertion that art creates peace, that religion is not possible, is exaggerated and invalid. But it's a pretty fancy, and it's the second main theme of this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> One last note: As Babette arrives at the Spinner's Twirls, becomes a special French General, Galliffet, called Person, who in 1871 executed the husband and son of Babette and imposed a military rule that they flee had to. At the end of the film, when the general tells the story of the great food he had enjoyed in Paris many years ago (before 1871), at the end of some military maneuvers, it turned out that this Galliffet was hosting his meal. While the general tells the story, the French general Galliffet praised the cook of this meal as the greatest woman, the only woman for whom he would risk his life. Of course this woman was Babette. Ironically, the same French general, who said he honored Babette over all other women, was responsible for driving her out of France forever.
