definitely the best game for N64. I say most of all that I was very disappointed with tomorrow, never dies, but the world does not promise to be better than Goldeneye (according to website). I love Goldeneye so much that I have something to do every time I play it. I even came up with my own missions for the levels. Multiplayer are the best games, and the graphics are amazing even now. The first day I got that, I remembered wishing they would go back and turn all Bond films into games. Can you imagine driving this speedboat live and dying and doing incredible jumps, or fighting ninjas or jaws in the spy that loved me and the Moonraker? (I think fighting these games would be more fun than with the Aztecs). How about chasing Sanchez in the gas stacks or looking for St. Cerils just for your eyes? Alright, let me go back to the game. All levels are unique and fun for killing environments. There are many places to hide, so you can interact with people (especially the Statue Park). This game is not worth renting. You really have to buy it today.
