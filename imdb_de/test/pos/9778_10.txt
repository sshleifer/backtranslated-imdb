This must be one of Australia's best productions. I disagree with the comments of 'RamiNour101'. <br /> <br /> This series shows the depth of the Australian camaraderie and the lengths they have taken to help each other. Episode Five 'Eddie's Birthday' is a great example of this and really captures the Australian spirit. <br /> <br /> The music in the entire series only emphasized the situation men faced, their longing for home and their loved ones. The numerous amusing interpretations of The Road to Gundagai reflect the spirit of the men and the fact that they never forgot their home and that it was small elements like singing a song that brought them home for a short time. <br /> <br /> Regarding the comment that it is racist towards Japanese, one can only say that you can not change what has happened. The Japanese have treated the Australians in Changi very badly and to represent this, otherwise this would be very misleading. The comment on the accuracy of the script is also wrong. These six stories told in the series are composed of real P.O.W experiences. <br /> <br /> The actors were great; the best in my opinion Matthew Newton. His performance as David in the first episode was a rush. From a city boy to another nameless face for his kidnappers. We see him dramatically changing in the first episode due to his violent jungle attack. In other episodes we can see how this one event changed him. He is really aware of this and is always one of the first to help the other members of The Secret Nine. Stephen Curry also deserves a mention. His performance in 'Eddie's Birthday' is amazing, starting with the group's larrikin, getting sick, being weak and unable to take care of themselves. The portrayals of the partnership in this episode touch on an emotional level and make you proud to be Australian. It shows the true spirit of an Australian soldier. <br /> <br /> Well done to John Doyle, who has captured the spirit of Changi.
