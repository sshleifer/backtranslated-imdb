This is a movie that really makes you think about your life, our culture, family structures and situational actions. I will not give the story in this post, I think others have already beaten me. I hope that, although you have read the opinions on this website, you will seize the opportunity and see this movie for yourself. I have seen this movie with my husband and a friend and must say that after the movie was over there was absolute silence in the theater. After a few minutes, I looked behind me and everyone in the theater stared thoughtfully at the screen. This causes you to plunge deep into your psychological abyss to consider various things: <br /> <br /> How much does society influence my life and the lives of my generation? How long has someone? to pay for mistakes they made? <br /> <br /> If there is a second chance, will it ever be realized? <br /> <br /> Is it better to live in a box or not to live at all? <br /> <br /> My questions are not meant to show my approval or disapproval of Leland. I do not want my mind to dictate in any way what you're going to take out of this movie, so I'm not giving it. Convince yourself. I'm still lost in thought and try to answer my many questions from the movie. I enjoyed it very much and I hope you will too. This film does not try to answer questions, approve actions or promote punishment. This film tries to get us all to assess our lives and remove the pink glasses that most of us see the world through. <br /> <br /> Great movie. 9 out of 10 stars
