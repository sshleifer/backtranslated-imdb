French babbette appears in the modest house of two Danish sisters who are wet, cold and alone. Fleeing the revolution in Paris, she seeks refuge in an obscure religious community on the windswept coast of Jutland. Unknown to those who receive her so generously, she is a great cook and food artist. Babette gives herself to her adoptive community through thrift, productivity and common belief. She does not go until she wins the French lottery - 10,000 francs. She returns with an exotic charge, the achievements of a single meal reminiscent of the birthday of the sister's sister, the founder of the congregation. <br /> <br /> This meal is kept in the dark for the amusing believers, but their subtleties are translated by an aging military officer who, as a young man in Paris, has come to appreciate the sensory experience. Food is the culmination of the film, a love community in the temporary art of eating - tirelessly uplifting about art, love and the meaning of life.
