Let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original "Lonesome Dove" than me. Both the Pulitzer Prize-winning book and the miniseries based on it are, in my experience, moving, dramatic, credible and uniquely captivating. There is no comparison between "Lonesome Dove" and any Western movie - at least not since the legendary collaborations of John Ford and John Wayne. With real reserve, I sat down to watch this new miniseries, McMurtry's non-participation, and missing original cast members. After watching the first episode, it was clear that this is not a "Lonesome Dove". In almost every measurable way, this sequel misses the original. So what? I had not expected that it would be measured. As an independent effort, this film is appealing, entertaining and of very good quality. If it was a new story, not a sequel to "Lonesome Dove," I would have no question that she did not receive so many negative reviews. Jon Voight did a good job as Call, Barbara Hershey was a great Clara, and the new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well done and believable. Louis Gossett jr. Noteworthy is the horse man Isom Pickett. The movie made me take care of the characters, and I'm asking no more than an actor's. It is unfortunate that this worthy effort is in the shadow of its predecessor - worth looking at.
