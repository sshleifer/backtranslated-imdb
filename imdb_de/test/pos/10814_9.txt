[Minor Spoiler Following] <br /> <br /> Steve Allen said the current sense of humor about serious events could be considered acceptable by many, based on the formula: tragedy + time = comedy. 1939 before the German attack on Poland was hardly a jolly time, and subsequent events, including the blitzkrieg (after the seat war) that brought Germany into the English Channel, led to the heroic evacuation in Dunkirk and gave the world the miserable spectacle of a France that had put down his honor before the conqueror of the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Romance, comedy and a huge drama? Yes. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, with a well-matched and outstanding cast, creates in "Bon voyage" a pastiche of events and scenes from history and fantasy that is extremely entertaining. Viviane Denvers (the Sloe) Isabelle Adjani (France) is the leading actress in France as war clouds gather over Europe (which is an overloaded stereotype, sorry). She is an experienced bed-stepper with many issues, and her inner motivation seems to be, "Whatever is good for Viviane is good for Viviane." After a premiere of her latest film, a minister in Reynaud's incompetent government stepped onto Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu in an unusual role for him) signaling his interest in her, she only goes home to meet an ex-lover, who does not understand the word "no". However, she solves this problem decisively. Then the frantic fricadier Frederic (Gregory Derangere) asks another former Beau to deal with the chaos in his apartment. Frederic is an expected novelist. <br /> <br /> A funny accident, once almost Almost as in the public service, it stands out again how important it is to operate windshield wipers, which brings Frederic to jail for serious charges. Fortunately, the outbreak of Germans from their static positions forces prisoners to be shipped to southern France. Our boy escapes and goes his way there, rather than as a state department. <br /> <br /> The panic and fear in France, as the Germans won the victory, is well represented and a new twist enters history. Who should meet Frederic, but the really beautiful young scientist Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), who accompanies the obligatory Jewish refugee scholar, Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehle). Kopolski has some bottles of "heavy water" that he needs to get to England. Of course, Germans do not have to lean on this vital ingredient because you know what it is (this part is pure fiction - in France in 1940 there was never any heavy water - just Perrier). And Camille is as winning as he is dedicated. <br /> <br /> What's next? Peter Coyote as alleged French journalist Alex Winckler. Let him know his name. He is really an officer of the defense (German secret service: a spy). And he also used to put Viviane to bed (and would like a repeat of her affair). Apparently, the Art Kopolski is the only tall male figure who does not want to take on the actress. <br /> <br /> What follows is a series of adventures and glitches that are seamlessly integrated for a very fast result. an exciting and entertaining movie. Partially a tribute to and a little parody of "Casablanca". This is a remarkably funny movie (apart from the heavy Nazi pieces). <br /> <br /> Isabelle Adjani deserves kudos for the best presentation I've ever seen in years of a charmingly cute narcissism with few, if redeeming features. And Depardieu, unfaithful to Reynauld and ready to leap a ship and join the traitor Petain, convinces as a man whose passion for Viviane surpasses his watered-down duty to the Republic. Beaufort is a human being who is in power at a critical moment in French history, and is vaguely disgusting. <br /> <br /> Not shown in many cinemas, Bon voyage should soon be available for purchase or rental. Do you see it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
