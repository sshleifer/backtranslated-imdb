Vanaja is a movie of superlatives. It's an exceptionally well-designed cast, with Mamatha the crowning jewel, excellent production and possibly pre-production with Rajnesh in the lead, a fantastic journey through rural South India through the eyes of a 15-year-old, a remarkable mix of song and dance, Traditional and modern, perfectly mixed, and a beautiful backdrop of lush color flora and fauna that make up the great experience. What a great performance for a debut director !! The casting was absolutely dead. I wish India would release more of these films. This movie will be one of my top favorites all my life. 10.9.
