With some amazing and wonderful characters, a new mythology, superbly designed and executed sets, Nightbreed is a great movie. Unfortunately, the absence of a well-known leading actor has led to the movie finding darkness. <BR /> <br /> Maybe the homosexuality of the director has led to the film being unknowingly censored by the white public, and the film is being condemned. Nonetheless, the film is a treasure of the monster movie / superhero genre. <br /> <br /> A sequel to Highlander style flashbacks at various times in history would be interesting. <br /> <br /> Another idea would be the founding of the new Midian. Maybe in Texas somewhere or in the swamps of Lousiana with crocodile men and a wandering freak circus.
