This film is a fascinating example of Luis Bunuel's ability to tell stories. This is a comedy that is not a comedy, and a social drama that is not a social drama. Although I do not think it's funny, it made me laugh. Despite the fact that you can never take Bunuel too seriously, the film reflected on religion and its meaning in some people's lives. Bunuel tells the story of a Catholic priest who is devoted to his faith like no other, and the onlooker witnesses what happens when the priest's immortal duty to serve others is tested. As always, Bunuel's goal is Catholicism, but I do not think he's tempted to mock the church, as he often does. At least I did not understand the movie as ridicule of the institution. I think he's trying to give an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in today's modern society. Not because belief in itself is bad, but because people always manage to taunt the concept. Apart from the message, I think this is one of Bunuel's brightest works. Francisco Rabal is great as a priest. Definitely one of the best films by the filmmaker.
