I had actually considered investing in this film when Gorman used up the financing. I loved the script the most, but I did not like the end. Gorman insisted that the end be as it should be. <br /> <br /> When I saw the finished movie, I have to say that I am amazed. Reading the script, which I had not imagined for acting (and Gorman's direction), would be just as powerful and moving as here. The two leads did a great job. They were very credible and this movie is worthwhile only for the performances of these two amazing stars. <br /> <br /> Well, for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie, please do not read on I have to see the movie first. (I really wish I had never read the script just to see the movie first-hand.) <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---------- SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have two main problems with the movie. First of all, and I'm sure I mentioned this while reading the script that the woman should have died. If she were dead, the end would be much more credible. We have this guy who was bothered about a woman who left him years ago. If she has left him and he is still in love after such a long time, he must be seriously insane. But he does not look like that in the script. (There is also the problem of why he does not give all this energy to the woman he still loves.) If the woman were dead, we could actually believe that she had a fulfilling, reciprocating love, and therefore believe that the guy is so devastated that the end is reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, I do not buy Daphne what she does in the end. I would need a lot of convincing conviction to believe that this naive girl (very naive for a whore, but believable in Bohl's achievement) did what she did. The character is just not cold enough. And if she did it out of a kind of love or something else, then a whole piece of the film / story is missing. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie is reminiscent of "Sex, Lies and ..." videotape. "I think it could have been just as popular if Gorman had decided to give the movie a more credible ending. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and enjoy the performance, and decide even.
