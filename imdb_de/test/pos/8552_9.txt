I lived in Romania and was almost stunned by the very realistic backdrop of the scenes and the great care the director had for the local details. The performance of Anthony Queen is absolutely great and the rest of the cast is doing an amazing job to support him. The film needs some knowledge of the Eastern European context to be fully enjoyed, but otherwise it remains a great achievement with catchy lines. The end may be a bit too melodramatic, but that's the way people are in this part of the world. I think the script is great because it presents the horrors of World War II in an original way - no blood, no battlefields. Still, life is destroyed, and the smile that you get every now and then throughout the movie is quickly destroyed by the war realities that touch the characters.
