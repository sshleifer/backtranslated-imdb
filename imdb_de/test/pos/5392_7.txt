Gary Cooper and Marshal Change Identities, as both agree that Cooper would be more efficient against the criminals. What's notable in this movie is the costumes, both the Marshal and Steve Cochrans, who is the evil one. Cochran carries his rifles backwards, probably to criss-cross. The movie starts pretty exciting with a showdown with Wild Bill Hickok. Ruth Roman, very pretty-looking, is the marshal's fianc√©. There is a lot of action, never a boring moment, but you have to concentrate because the story is a bit complicated. Good entertainment.
