What can I say about Kramer Vs. Kramer say? It's rather simple on the surface, but it's about emotions that are bigger than life itself. It has many fantastic moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. They understand the characters and take care of them. Many films fail, Kramer vs. Kramer is a success. <br /> <br /> I think everyone would agree that the show is outstanding. If you are Kramer Vs. For Kramer, in most of the other films, the play feels plastic and unemotional for some time. The actors seem to get on well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen. There is some nice chemistry between them. I think the best performance of the movie comes from the young Justin Henry. He's different from any other child actor I've ever met. He is amazingly natural. <br /> <br /> There is also a kind of neurotic beauty in Meryl Streep. And Dustin Hoffman delivers one of the best achievements of his career! The story is very well written. It's simple, but at the same time complicated. The concept is the simple part, the feelings are connected with the complicated part. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, be sure to miss it! See it now!
