This film could easily qualify as a film that best promotes human understanding among people. <br /> <br /> It can be quite annoying to try to understand that a young Southern Jewish girl could resort to a refugee German prisoner of war. Kristy McNichol shows an amazing portrait of the unhappy young girl, thirsting for acceptance and love. Michael Constantine did a remarkable job as her difficult dad and Esther Rolle, while the maid, Ruth, delivered an outstanding Emmy victorious performance as a girl catching up with these events. Bruce Davison portrays the German who is allegedly not guilty of Nazi atrocities. This is how his role appears. He fled, but he joined the German army and he was possibly a member of the Hitler Youth movement. The action takes place in 1944 in Georgia in a rural area. The citizens are full of prejudices. Even the FBI inspector pretends to get something against the Jews. Note the opposite interpretation that while McNichol is in bed, Davison is tracked and eventually shot. It is interesting to see that the company considers McNichol a traitor because it housed a prisoner of war. The film is also about a very complex relationship between father and daughter. Konstantin's breakout at his daughter's end is a bit of acting. Since the mother Barbara Barrie has little to do. It was annoying that as a typical Jewish mother she is stereotypical with that loud lipstick on her lips. <br /> <br /> Memorable and worth seeing.
