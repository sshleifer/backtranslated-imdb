The marriage of an upscale couple from New York City with a child falls apart when the woman wants out of the house ("It took a lot of courage to go through this door!", Tell us a neighbor). The diligent, distracted husband takes on the "maternal" responsibilities and moves closer to his son, but soon the woman returns. A highly manipulative image does not give us a very realistic family unity (though the young Justin Henry certainly does not resemble the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), But the dynamics are intriguing and involving, and director Robert Benton keeps up the pace with a lot of cleverness, wonderful classical music, subtle editing and sure-fire humor. Streep's character was conceived as a cold, selfish witch, but I was ready to feel much more for her than Benton probably wanted. Everything has to be painted in black and white, good and bad. Hoffman learns how hard his wife has it, and he gets a second chance to be a good parent. The film never wavers from its preconceived path, and very fine acting almost saves it, but I'm not sure where Benton directed the film in the final act, and the final scene is terribly abrupt. *** from ****
