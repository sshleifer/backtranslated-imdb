This pleasurable Euro Western opens with a scene that preceded a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for "Once Upon a Time in the West" but failed to convince Clint Eastwood. Three tough-looking gunslingers arrive in a city. One is dressed like the man without a name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer of "For A Few Dollars More," and the third is dressed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulling a coffin with a machine gun behind him. Our hero meets them on Main Street behind a three-casket-laden car. "Any Gun Can Play" is a spaghetti western with a joke on spaghetti western as the hero here kills the three killers. Apart from a bit too much comedy, especially in the acrobatic combat sequences, this is an above-average idler. The notorious Mexican Outlaw Montero and his trigger band Happy Pistoleros rob an army platoon that transports gold coins worth $ 300,000 across the border. Director Enzo G. Castellari of "Inglorious Bastards" stages the camera from a variety of camera angles that bring you to the forefront of the action. The bandits grab the locomotive along with the carriage carrying the gold and separate it from the rest of the train that houses the US Cavalry. While Montero and his armed men hold on to the cavalry, Pajondo (Pedro Sanchez of "Sabata") commands the locomotive, kills the engineer and his crew, and tows them off, leaving the other pistoleros to their own devices. In essence, Pajondo Montero crosses and steals the gold for himself. Later, Montero Pajondo arrives at the Rio Grande. Before the bandit Montero can reveal the whereabouts of the prey, but shoots a sergeant of the cavalry Pajondo. Before Pajondo dies, he tells Montero about a medallion that serves as an indication of where he hid the treasure. The furious cavalry captain (Ivano Staccioli of "Commandos") locks Montero, but he can not loosen the bandit's tongue, even if he uses his whip. Angry at Montero's reluctance, the captain threatens to have the Mexican shot dead if he does not speak. Meanwhile, the prison guards have a priest talk to Montero, but he really is not a priest. The stranger thrown with six cannons (George Hilton of "The Ruthless Four") masquerades as the man of the cloth and rescues Montero from a firing squad. Unfortunately, before Montero is rescued, Clayton (Edd Byrnes of TVs "77 Sunset Strip") takes the medallion away and keeps it to herself. Clayton is the representative of the bank that was sent to protect the gold. He is appalled that the Captain wants to shoot Montero. Clayton's career in the bank depends on his ability to recover the gold. The stranger lights a fire in the fortress to distract the firing squad, and Montero takes the captain hostage and tries to escape, but the stranger shoots him from the horse. Before the authorities can prove that Montero is dead, the stranger demands the corpse for the handsome reward that he will receive, and he rides off with the Captain's grateful thanks. As soon as they leave the fortress, Montero's men appear to rescue him from the stranger. From then on, the strangers, Montero, and Clayton forge gold in short-lived alliances. Castellari and scenariist Tito Carpi, who has written a number of spaghetti westerns such as "A Few Dollars For Django" and another Castellari rater "Seven Winchesters for a Massacre", rely on skillful humor and surprises to keep the action fresh and keep it fast. In a cool scene, Clayton is sitting at a table eating his meal as he hears suspicious sounds behind him. Clayton pours his drink on the table and sees the armed men behind him with six-gun pistols. <br /> <br /> "Any Gun Can Play" lives up to its title. In fact, many guns are playing and at least twenty or more corpses pile up before hiding. This western is not so much a parody as it is a throw off of Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". But bad guys and good guys are as common in a bowling alley as pins, but their deaths are not portrayed in the brutal way of a Leone Western. "Any Gun Can Play" is not as serious as the previously mentioned Leone masterpiece. The three leads run back and forth for supremacy. Everyone has a piece of the puzzle that will lead them to the treasure, but they refuse to share their information until the shooting finale. The colorful widescreen photography by Lenser Giovanni Bergamini is spectacular, especially the opening shots of the train jerking along the train tracks, with distant mountain peaks rising dramatically in the background. Another great shot comes as Montero examines the stranger's unwavering calm. This scene occurs after the stranger rescues Montero and the Mexican henchmen arrive to rescue their chief's bacon. Montero confiscates the stranger's six guns and targets the ponchoed, tough guy, emptying the revolver and putting his well-targeted bullets harmlessly in and around the unwavering gunslinger. Bergamini, who photographed Castellari's "Inglorious Bastards" thriller from World War II, framed the scene with the stranger in the background and his pistol in Montero's hand in the foreground for a pleasant, three-dimensional style shot. Meanwhile, Francesco De Masi's lively orchestral soundtrack is as memorable for his idiosyncratic tunes as the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone for the Westerns of Leone. The opening song is reminiscent of a Hollywood Western of the 50s with catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. Although "Any Gun Can Play" is not an ordinary spaghetti western, it's always entertaining with entertaining plot twists and good performances, especially the indefatigable Gilbert Roland, who was 62 years old at the time!
