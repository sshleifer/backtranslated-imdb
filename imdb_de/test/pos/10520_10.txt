These immortal lines begin with the masterpiece "The Dion Brothers" directed by Jack Starret. The plot revolves around two brothers from West Virginia (Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest) who commit robberies in the hope of opening a seafood restaurant with the money !! What follows is quite an adventure, and many comedy events follow. The action scenes are all first class and consist of well-made shootouts. The latter is absolutely amazing and comes in an abandoned building, which is demolished by a demolition ball! The film was written by the now famous director Terrence Malick and features an early performance by Margot Kidder. All in all an excellent, hidden gem of the 70s and with ease one of the best action / comedy hybrids ever made. Hopefully there will be a decent widescreen DVD soon.
