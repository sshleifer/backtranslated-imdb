Susan Sarandon is incredible for lack of a better word. In my opinion (and yes, I understand that not everyone will agree with me here), she is one of the greatest actresses of all time and should have at least two Oscars. I mean, that was an amazing feat in Lorenzo's oil (but then I think each one of her performances is amazing) and they gave it to Emma Thompson ... what was it about ??? And when she got this Oscar, she had been in the industry for 25 years. I could not think of anyone who deserves it more, especially for a performance as brilliant as her portrayal of Sister Helen Prejean. But on the other hand, it's mostly the artificiality of Hollywood and does not need an Oscar - people know it's good anyway. <br /> <br /> This film contains some very deep, thought-provoking messages, so needless to say, it's not frivolous to take. Of course, Tim Robbins can not escape here either. You would think that the portrayals made in this film were not accurate because of his personal feelings about the death penalty. Both sides of the death penalty debate, however, receive a uniform weight. On one side you can see the interesting side of Matthew, the human side that makes the witness of his death more heartbreaking. At the same time, you see the way he has saved his victims and the constant agony of understandably distressed parents. A word for Tim - BRAVO. <br /> <br /> A brilliant movie and, as I said, a well-deserved and long awaited Oscar for Susan.
