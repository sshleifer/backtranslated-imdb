Morrissey, one of the loftiest American masterpieces, opens the film by sexualizing Dallesandro, his open mouth snoring on a pillow. We wonder if he starts from a heroin high. We only see his face, then flash, his body, flashing, his bare back. I can not think of another film that has used this flash-blip form of editing so well to create a hypnotic, drippy mood, a cutting method that works well both as a pacemaker and as a style. After this introduction, when Dallesandro opens his mouth, his accent is terrible - we expect him to be a kind of gentle androgynous; Instead, he has the voice of a street thug - Morrissey does not like leaving our assumptions under control. The long opening is very sexy and playful - it's a combination of fighting issues, Dallesandro's mesmerizing lip kisses and sexual escapades in the early morning; it all flows together, though not always smoothly, then emotionally realistic. <br /> <br /> What I got from it was the same as what I got from "The 400 Blows" when I saw it for the first time - this is like a sequel to that story. There is a sense of camaraderie between the meat sellers and the buyers; When Dallesandro goes in search of men (to finance his wife's abortion), there is a secret of a handshake when the boys bargain with each other. I never found it boring, though nothing happens - nothing happens brilliantly, the guys hang around waiting for tricks. The most important trick that Dallesandro finds is intriguing, using Greek descriptions and only touching his back, a form of man's aesthetic body worship. It's also terribly funny ("I'm not talking to an empty bed, is it?"). It's one of the most revealing scenes in the movie - in any movie, I think; certainly any movie that has sex and sex for sale. If Dallesandro's eyes look red and swollen, we can not say if he's drunk, embarrassed, or embarrassed. <br /> <br /> The conversations in the movie are interrupted - they do not matter. (The movie is dumb in some scenes, some of the most poignant and beautiful you've ever experienced.) But if Morrissey decides to record one as it contains it (we'll put it together somehow), it's amazing to have a conversation between Dallesandro and a freshman hustler - and none of them ever mentioned the word "gay" or "hustler." What follows is a scene in which we hear two transvestites while Dallesandro is being serviced - just after the newcomer has been told how to get used to the job. <br /> <br /> Dallesandro is a topic that deserves attention both from its clients and from Morrissey. He is less effective as an actor, in the sense of actors, but as far as uncovering something incredible, he is someone we want to feel right now, but we live through his experiences with all their complexity and we are forced to try and know. He's the kind of blank slate we're attracted to, but he can not believe it. And of course, he is incredibly impressive - he forgets everything else and is partly a testament to the beauty of the male body, Dallesandro's magnificent torso and erect nipples. <br /> <br /> The movie has a devastating scene, but like anything else you can not really master - a girl says she was raped, and her only self-defense is that when the rapist just asked for sex had wooed her, he would have been in a better mood. It's shocking. The film has a feeling for everyone, but even better: Not only is it sympathetic, it's actually trying to help us understand people - and not dictate what we should understand. She does not look down on the people in the movie, nor does she enchant her. It feels inclusive when we see Joe's arm around a transvestite. When he reads a letter (he talks about not getting past grade 8 at some point), he is extremely charming as he stops at a word ... then he says "woteva" and continues , <br /> <br /> You can learn something deeper from the interaction between Dallesandro and one of his clients in terms of gay-straight relationships than you can from any case study. Here we have the boy who smiles (his upper lip disappears) as a Korean war veteran with a 30-man turnhare runs his fingers through his hair; It's a scene that feels very deep, this adult man shares something with a younger version of himself - it's not two gay men together or a gay man paying a pure man, it's something else you're looking for can not put a finger on it; Questions of sexuality are not up for debate. (Never before has a pimple popping so lovingly.) Having shared something emotionally with each other (though with Dallesandro being there for money, it's never clear why he's there, though he's always honest about what his most disarming can be Quality), "So ... can you help me?" The man says for sure. "I do not mean my pants!" 10/10
