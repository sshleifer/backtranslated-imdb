James Bridge's "The China Syndrome" is a first-class thriller. a model for those who want to make a really scary thriller, but do not know how. <br /> <br /> Most thrillers end up in the standard shoot-em-up, chasing the bad guy for what he / she gets. However, Bridges understands that such a standard finale is not the case in some scenarios. "The China Syndrome" is exciting in a way that nobody would expect. It has a kind of end that is so unexpected and yet so logical. <br /> <br /> The film features three (then) current Oscar winners: Jack Lemmon (Best Actor 1973 for "Save the Tiger"), Jane Fonda (Best Actress 1971 and 1978 for "Klute" and "Coming Home ") and Michael Douglas (Best Film 1975 for the production of" One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest "). This is not your standard strip "spot the star" that has become so popular in the 70s: The acting is so solid and strong that we forget who plays the roles, and believes that the characters are real people. This is a testament to the collective skills of all three actors. They may be stars, but they are actors first. <br /> <br /> There is no music in the movie, apart from some background songs from jukeboxes or TV shows there is nothing. Bridges does not show a directorial style on the canvas, the material simply represents directly. With such a dramatic story, we need no score to distract us. It seems like a predecessor to the film series Dogma 95, founded by Lars Von Trier in 1997. It concentrates more on the characters and the story than on the style. <br /> <br /> The story is about a nuclear power plant in Southern California. ** SPOILER ** An accident seems to have happened and basically the movie is about Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas are trying to uncover the truth. In a way, this is not a spoiler, as the trailer, the TV spots, the video boxes and the reviews reveal this. But this seemingly simple premise gives rise to a surprisingly complex morality game, and the tension comes from human nature and human action rather than a villain framing another guy (though this is an element in the movie). That's what makes The China Syndrome so good. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
