I've seen this movie on TV back in the 60's and it's still good after brilliant performances as DI by R. Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett and even Frank Sutton (weird) on Gomer Pyle USMC. I was not in the service, but my brother had a picture of a drill instructor at the Air Force and it was scary. Other members of the family, who were marines, told me that Ermey and even Sutton fit in pretty well in their roles. The only thing in "The D.I." the language is missing. In 1958 they could not yet use profanity for movies, but Jack Webb felt pretty damn hard without it. I think it's his best role ever. He was pretty stiff in Dragnet, I admit, though not as bad as George Raft, but he only used it to work in "The D. I". They never forget the funeral for the dead flea! The romantic part only served to stretch the movie, but did not really interfere with the basic plot. Don Dubbins was pretty good, but he has never surpassed this film in his career. As for patriotism, Jack Webb was John Wayne on TV. He wore it a bit too far in some dragnet episodes, but not in "The D. I". After some 40 years, I hoped that the movie could withstand the people of "Full Metal Jacket" and others. and it did!
