Super original. Really great movie! James Franco and Sienna Miller really fit together on the screen. I really hope it comes out soon. I saw this movie for the first time at a show. Because of my age and gender, I was asked to stay for a "conversation". We all could comment on the movie, and many people did not seem to like it. I really loved it and I do not know why so many people did not like it so much. Take a look and decide for yourself! One thing you may want to do when you see this movie is to get involved without knowing it. I had not known anything when I went to the screening, as "Camile." It is really worth seeing.
