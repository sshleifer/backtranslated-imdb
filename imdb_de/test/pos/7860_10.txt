Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this movie. It's strictly turned, graphically, visually unobtrusive, well-handled by everyone involved, covering some of the most taboo topics of every day in a crafty, almost-expected normality that this reviewer has never seen before in any other film. I did not know what to expect sitting down: a civil war movie or a 70's soft-core peddler in which Eastwood came to a girls' school in the south. But really it's none of these things, but rather investigation, exploration and descent into the soul of men and women - a dark commentary on what is at the heart of the civilized. As mentioned in a reviewer, none of the characters at the end of the film are personable, yet each one of them is interesting, complex and puzzling. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a Union soldier found by the young Pamelyn Ferdin (you will recognize this voice as soon as you hear her), a girl in a manners school led by Geraldine Page, amidst the chaos of the Civil War - especially in the South. Soon, Page, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, handsome young seductress Carol, and even Ferdin (Amy) have emotional / sexual ties to Eastwood - each with their own needs, secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a nice man. He plays the girls against each other and always tries to gain the sexual advantage. In the unfolding, we get some really interesting things that are revealed from latent lesbianism to incest. The stunned is for me a masterpiece that has far exceeded my expectations in every creative aspect. This could be (except on invasion of Body Snatchers) Siegel's best movie. It's certainly one of Eastwood's best REAL achievements. The site is always very good and Hartman, Fe5rdin etc. are outstanding. The gothic manse for the school is effectively claustrophobic. Some of the sexually tense scenes disturb. And what's happening with Eastwood is a giant leap forward for scary, sinister, and demented movies.
