A wonderful cast into modern mystical romances for intellectual adults. Yes, they too need a love story to wake those hidden urges without the Hollywood fluff. All this under the masterful direction of Antonioni and Wenders, who both nail his characters in exotic locations and force them into the area with long, sweeping strokes. It's nice to see that there's lust in the midlife crisis industry.
