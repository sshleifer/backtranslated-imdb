I remember when this NBC miniseries aired when I was in high school. After reading the novel, I thought I would look at some adjustments. I did not expect much from a TV mini-series, but now I might have to try a little more. This is really outstanding and the best possible movie version that could be made. Author Simon Moore, who wrote the television drama for the original traffic miniseries on which the Soderberg movie was based, developed a brilliant narrative that blended the story very much: framing Gulliver's adventures as flashbacks with the actual story starting with Gullivers Return home (everything happened on a trip). Gulliver, played by Cheers' Ted Danson, seems somehow crazy when his wife Mary Steenburgen welcomes him to his house. Unfortunately, the house is now owned by the local doctor James Fox, who designed Steenburgen. Gulliver seems disturbed at first, but when he starts telling tales of tiny people, all this is the evidence Fox needs to throw him into a lunatic asylum. All four of Gulliver's journeys in this version are the same as the novel (this is the only time this was done on film). I love how his current situation reflects his flashbacks. Gulliver's little son, whom he has never met before, reminds him of the Lilliputians. The doctors, who observe him in his cell from a mezzanine loom, remind him of the Brogding Nagagians, and the doctors' scientific examinations remind him of the crazy scientific experiments and theories of the Laputans and professors at the Academy. When he is finally brought to justice, he remembers the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoo. The cast is amazing and includes Peter O'Toole, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest shortcoming of the mini series is that the spectacle is really uneven. They all have these good actors, but the smaller characters are often played by actors who were probably good in following from L.A. Law, but are not good at a costume drama. Ted Danson is not very good, although he has some sequences in which he excels. It's probably better that he did not try, but all the other characters in the movie speak English accents. Steenburgen is actually pretty good at it and overall is pretty good. Another mistake of the series is that the adventures happen too fast. It is unbelievable that Gulliver was away from home for eight years, it is claimed. But, in general, Swift's tone and purpose capture it very well, adding a new emotional level to its structure.
