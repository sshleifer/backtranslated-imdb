Apparently, this Australian film, based on Nevil Shute's novel, exists in more than one form. Watch for heavily cut versions, sometimes shown on cable or satellite, that take between 95 minutes and 2 hours. Only the full 5-hour mini-series version tells the story right. It is a very close realization of the story that suffers only from editorial mistakes that are common in television movies. However, this excellent cast makes the story very well, with generally good production values ​​accompanying their work. Yuki Shimoda is known as "Gunso Mifune", one of the guardians who accompanies the women on their agonizing journey. In the end, he becomes a friend. They will torture him when his loss of face leads him to his death. Helen Morse as "Jean Paget", pretty but not very beautiful (she resembles Sigourney Weaver), registers just the right amount of spunk and winning streak as the occasion demands. The mini-series emphasizes the beautiful love stories, three of them: "Joe" and "Jean", "Noel" and "Jean" and "Jean" and Willstown. Gordon Jackson plays "Noel Strachan" appealing, but as a slightly younger man than Nevil Shute stated in the novel. The third love affair I have mentioned is not emphasized as much as it is important, and the full meaning of the title is diminished. "Jean" is dedicated to bringing businesses to Willstown, which pull young women and girls and their civilizing influence into this godforsaken city. She wants to make it "A Town Like Alice"; Alice Springs, that's it. In some scenes we get only a few hints. If you only have five hours, this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience. Nevil Shute bases his novel on the cruelty of the Japanese military by moving a large group of women and children on the Mayay Peninsula from one place to another. According to Shute, this happened on Sumatra and not on the peninsula. The crucifixion of "Joe" by a Japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed the women is probably a fiction, but the cruelty of the Japanese in dealing with prisoners is certainly a matter.
