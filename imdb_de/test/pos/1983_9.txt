eXistenZ combines director David Cronenberg's traditional love for blood and blood and exploding minds with the more confusing aspects of a confusing David Lynch movie. And it actually works effectively. I will not bother to even summarize the bare bones of an act, as this only leads to more confusion. All you need to know is that the movie is a virtual computer game so incredibly realistic it's hard to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. The film seems to almost give up the technology fear point in the end, but then throws back the last phrase in the last line of the dialogue 'ports' into the protagonist, as well as some very rough drama by Jude Law. He manages to be naive and stupid and boring and every other annoying habit one can think of. Jason Jennifer Leigh gets off a lot better and everyone else can be described as a supporting figure, including Willem Dafoe in a functional, albeit unspectacular, role as a money-hungry mechanic. Overall, eXistenZ is a very effective science fiction film about the possibilities of technology and the possible consequences.
