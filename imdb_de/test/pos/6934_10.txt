I have just seen this again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. That's why these movies are made to entertain people, and Zombie Bloodbath 2 does it for me and for everyone I showed it to. <br /> <br /> The story is about a group of teenagers in a van running into a group of escaped prisoners who have taken over an old farmhouse. When a scarecrow (which is actually a demon, I believe) is disturbed, it becomes alive and revives the bodies of the local cemeteries. As a result, our heroes just flee and end up in the arms of two crazy murderers who are currently torturing some people in a deli in a small town. It will soon be a showdown with people fighting zombies. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie! From the various formats (black & white film, video and digital cameras) to very fast tempo and great music there was always something going on and you will never get bored! Sure, it's cheap, but you can say that a lot of care and hard work has been put into this film. I have read other reviews and all I can say is that these people missed the point. If you want 35mm full moon fluff, or if you like modern things like Urban Legend, then I'll say that. If you like low budget stuff like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I say, buy them now. <br /> <br /> The make-up and Gore are very good, the acting is sometimes uneven, but on top of everything is pretty good and the editing is very impressive. There is enough going on to fill two more films! It's actually one of the better B-movies I've seen in years.
