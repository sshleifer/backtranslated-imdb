We start all reviews with the following information. My wife and I have watched nearly 100 movies a year for the last 15 years. We have recently been honored that we have been able to get lifetime movie tickets at no cost! So we can see what we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS counts for NULL. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert really do not differ from you or me. The only difference is that they can write about the film and be forced to watch hundreds of films, whether they like it or not. Therefore, we believe that it is good enough if you enjoy your money for two hours! We never listen and read the critics. We only care about our friends and those we know as the same things as we do. Well enough. <br /> <br /> As Meryl Streep, director of the NSC in the movie "The United States Tortured," says he laughed about this movie. It is, of course, a lie that the Bush administration has repeatedly denied. It's a very good movie and it's scary what they can do to us if we lose all our civil rights. They can simply "grab" you everywhere and know that they did. In that case, they'll grab a man who has a name similar to the one who killed thousands on September 11th. He is of course the same as you or me. And so they take him to a secret location outside the US to torture and bring him to the water. <br /> <br /> Very scary. Well played by Jake and Reese and the entire cast.
