"The Buddy Holly Story" shows the beginning of the famous singer in the former Lubbock, Texas, to his rise to fame, to his tragic death in a plane crash. Strengthened by the fact that Gary Busey plays his own instruments as Holly, this film is the biopic in its purest form. There are a few things that seem a bit choppy, the people in Lubbock who see rock 'n' roll as devil music, but the masterly performances outweigh any weaknesses. If only one thing is certain in this big world, Buddy Holly's music will never stale. Whether it's "That's Be the Day," "Peggy Sue," or another of his songs, they still sound great after all these years. He remains one of the greatest singers in history. <br /> <br /> To show what Lubbock really thought of his most famous son, they did not name a street after him 37 years after his death! What a bunch of ingrates!
