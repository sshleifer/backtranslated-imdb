The Ator series is a shining example of what B movies should be. They fail in every way, but in such a funny way, that they are more fun than sad. "Ator l'invincibile 2", also known as "The Blade Master", also "Cave Dwellers", shows us the most popular Conan clone in Europe, Ator, where we left it in the first film, after giving us a detailed summary of all Events of the first film has shown. This time around, the world needs to be saved from "The Nucleus," a kind of bombshell that appears on the screen as a bright light (I think they could not afford any props). This shows invisible attackers and samurai. Like the first movie, a lot of stock footage is used (including a pretty obvious bit from "Star Wars"). Ridiculous and unforgettable bad through and through - this is an exception B movie.
