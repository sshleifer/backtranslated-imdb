"Children of wax", also called "killing places", is an interesting mix of genres. Some may think the purity of the genre can only be good, but for me the versatile symbiosis is very entertaining. It is also in its history the mixture of thriller and popular action as well as the combination of historical masterpiece and the ethnic plea for tolerance. This film was built with the star-like presence of my favorite actor, the perfect Armand Assante, but is also characterized by the acting of a shooting star. Hal Ozan. We have recently seen him in the TV series "Sex" on HBO. "Waxy Kids" is a conversation for the public, but at the same time it has a perpetual morality ethic. This is a smart way to separate welfare. Discussions about today's problems of our day can be made with attractive means. This is a very positive side of the movie "Children of wax".
