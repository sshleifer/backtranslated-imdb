I really liked that. (SPOILERS ??) It had a really good storyline, the main woman in this movie is really kiss. Despite the fact that she is the only surviving person and her lover is dead, it seemed to be a lot like Ninja Scroll. Another kick-ass movie. ;) <br /> <br /> In Japanese with subtitles. I do not know where the idiots are that learned English, but for some reason, all dubs get an F in translation techniques. The subtitles are more correct. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Repeatable: 9/10
