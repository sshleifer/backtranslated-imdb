The 1982 television-turned-out device is probably the best example of a filmed stage musical you'll likely encounter. It was released on DVD in 2004 as a remastered digital transfer and is pretty awesome. Hearn and Lansbury give performances of their lives and the rest of the cast is obviously entangled in the generated electricity. Of course, Sondheim's music and lyrics make this possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the "greats" of American musical form, listen to this. The sets are crass, as befits the storyline, and are adept at allowing for the required fast scene changes, and the cameras capture the action without neglecting the fact that this is a stage production. A central, movable and revolving platform is the pastry shop of Mrs. Lovett, the hair salon is located upstairs. Around it are various portals and moving stairs for the rest of the action to take place. The brutal story of injustice, which leads to revenge, murder and chaos, is generously seasoned with dark humor and comical moments. Sondheim makes for barbershops what Hitchcock has done for showers! An important work in American music theater is listed here electrifying.
