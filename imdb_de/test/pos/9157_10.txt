Hey, you are not alone! I remember Nichols! I was just 17 when it started. I remember that James Garner was one of the coolest actors, and Nichols was such a great show. I could not believe it was so short. I wish I could remember the last episode, I probably did not see it. At that time there was no VCR missed an episode that was gone forever, unless it came back at summer repeats. In any case, it would certainly be great if it appeared on DVD, but I do not think so many people knew about it. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Garner would achieve great success with Rockford Files a couple of years later and brought his buddy Stuart Margolin from Nichols to play his buddy Angel.
