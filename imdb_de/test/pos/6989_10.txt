Oh my God! This was one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, and honestly, I can not stand sci-fi movies. Vin Diesel and his colleagues have made this movie really enjoyable !! <br /> <br /> I have to say that Vin Diesel is by far the sexiest and most talented male actor I've ever seen. Keep it up, Vin! you are great !! As for all other good work. I thought the drama and the excitement really fascinated the audience. again, great work, all and I root for you Vin. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> Alexandra
