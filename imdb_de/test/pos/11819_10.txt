One of the pilots on the airliner I worked on earlier gave me a copy of this film. He told me it would make me cry. I never believed him and we even made bets. After watching the movie, I cried a bucket! Even after watching the movie, I found myself crying in the bathroom. It was actually the most touching movie I've ever seen. I like the part where Dexter's mother faced Erik's mother. The line went something like, "Your sons best friend died today, I'll kill you!" The last part in which Dexter took Eric's shoe was a scene that has not forgotten me to this day. Honestly, just thinking about it makes my eyes tearful. A story of what true friendship is all about. My girlfriend loved it too ... She hated me for letting her see the movie. I cried a bucket, she cried a river.
