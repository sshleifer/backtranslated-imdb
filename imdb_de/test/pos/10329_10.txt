Bug Juice has changed my life. I know it sounds weird, weird, weird. But it did. I'm from England, Bug Juice was never aired, but five years ago I was on vacation with my family and saw it on the Disney Channel. After watching this TV series, I was addicted. I wanted to go. It took a lot of persuading to let my brother and me go to Waziyatah. I am going since I was 12 and it was my fourth year this summer. If you're a teenager reading this camp, it changes your life. you become lifelong friends at wazi. It does not matter who you are or if someone at home does not like you, everyone likes you at the camp. You have so much fun. If you want to take a look, go to www.wazi.com and see for yourself. It's so much fun, I love it there. It is my home
