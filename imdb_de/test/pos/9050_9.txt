"Inki and the Minah bird" is in my opinion an enjoyable and charming cartoon. The artwork is not exceptional, but good enough. This cartoon has no dialogues, just sounds and music, but this combination works pretty well. The cartoon itself is good, funny, old-fashioned, creative, entertaining and amusing. <br /> <br /> This cartoon also makes the difference because it focuses on only 3 characters: Inki (the little black girl), the Minah bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion, both Inki as well as Minah wants to have breakfast - so he chases them both during most of the caricature. <br /> <br /> I think the lion is very pretty, funny and funny cool. I really like this lion. This poor lion is so stupid and loser that you have to regret it. The real enemy for me is the Minah bird, not the lion. At some point the lion almost eats it - too bad he can not swallow it because he deserves to be eaten. Back to this animated short, there is not a single fool or boring moment. At least for me. The only thing I think is stupid is the end, because the bird has a big fight with the lion, steals his teeth and puts them on himself. Apart from that, I have nothing major to criticize except for the fact that the steak should definitely be for the lion and not for the bird. <br /> <br /> This, in my opinion, is a very forgotten sight and underrated little gem that should definitely get more credit.
