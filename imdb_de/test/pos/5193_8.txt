I studied Western History during my studies at the University and saw that the views on World War II are rather uncomfortable and altogether completely wrong. World War II was the most graphic and bloodiest thing ever in world history. While the Axis powers have committed many crimes against humanity, which is still the view today, and many people forget that not every German soldier wanted to exterminate the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier wielded a samurai sword and flew kamikaze missions each Italian soldier was a fascist. Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you and I got into a terrible conflict and happened to fight for a country they loved. <br /> <br /> The Battle of Stalingrad was probably the deadliest battles in world history, with over 1,500,000 casualties over the course of the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader Lieutenant von Witzland when they are transferred to the Eastern Front to fight the Soviets in Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as a kind of main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They are all normal men and seem completely unaware of what's going on in Germany and Poland. The film follows the course of the battle. Overall, the film is very grim when it comes to depicting combat and soldier life during battle. Outside the battles, we are shown numerous cruel battles and violent acts of violence (including a firing squad sequence). All in all, the battles are the first examples that I know to show the loss of limbs and the total death and violence in your face. The inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's battle sequences seems to be much of this film. The movie does not want the German to be completely innocent of anything in the movie. Some of the senior officers of the army are presented in the usual view that most people consider evil. Most soldiers are normal people who often speak from home. The film quickly made it clear that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and the army were fully aware of the fact that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers of the German army were simply fighting for a cause they really did not understand and most just wanted to return home instead of freezing in negative temperatures in Russia. The movie really shows how hellish the war is. especially the Second World War. The battle scenes will shock you with their bitter realism and the story is easy to follow as you simply go on a train during the battle. As with most war movies, do not expect much luck after you've seen it. It will put you in a somewhat depressed mood, only when you see the life most soldiers face on the Eastern Front. Not recommended for children. <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
