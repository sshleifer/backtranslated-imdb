The heiress of the company, Susan Fletcher (Hopkins), and her wealthy father Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson) are upset that their young nieces Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) with their artist uncle John (Milland) have a bohemian lifestyle in China Greenwich Village live. after the death of her parents (Susan's sister and John's brother). Simon has given up persuading John that he and Susan can take care of the children, and he has used private detectives to either catch him in bad behavior or be unemployed and therefore unable to properly care for the children , Susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to Greenwich Village herself, posed as an actress, to get information and / or convince him to see reason. She discovers, however, that she not only loves the free and artistic lifestyle that John and his friends live for and that the girls are well educated, but that she quickly falls in love with John. Inevitably, her true identity is discovered, and she faces the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong to whom. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and found it very short. The running time (70 minutes) was the perfect time to shoot this simple, but gorgeous story. Miriam Hopkins, one of the great actresses of the 1930s to 1940s, is adorable in this movie. Her energy, her style and her holistic beauty really make her a loveable character, even though you know she's making a quick move to the people she makes friends with quickly. This is the earliest movie I saw in Ray Milland, and he was actually young and non-patrician. (And apparently three years younger than his co-star) His energy and carelessness in "Wise Girl" was a refreshing change in behavior that he influenced in his usual, darker films. Frankly, although I'm not usually a fan of children's performers, I really enjoyed the two young girls who played Susan's nieces. They were adorable precocious and were really the jewels of the movie. Unfortunately, I can not find any other films in which both were later, which is a pity since both showed a high degree of natural talent. <br/> <br /> "Wise Girl" was a movie shot three years after the introduction of the Hollywood Code was partly due to the quick, happy ending and ease with which the characters lived and clearly. The alleged Bohemian co-op party was indeed a beautiful dead-end street, where the artists lived in vain or for trading, and it's all beautifully tied up. Fortunately, this was a movie that was light enough, and the characters were so charming enough that they took into account the fluffiness and imperfections, and I could just take "Wise Girl" the way it was. a good old-fashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was lovable. Unfortunately, romantic comedy / drama films are far less intelligent and entertaining these days, or I would not always find my way back to the classics. 10.7
