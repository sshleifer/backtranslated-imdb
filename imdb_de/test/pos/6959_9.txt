I saw this movie for the first time on a sick school day about ten years ago. Compared to the Lifetime produced movies that I normally saw, it became an instant, obscure favorite. <br /> <br /> I may have seen it twice since then. I think some parts are a bit cheesy, maybe the plot could use a bit more action. <br /> <br /> Yet it captures the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth. The magical realism is comparable to that of Amelie and the heart to the miracle years. Despite the peculiar development of my taste, I still find the subtle magic of this film, the loveable characters and its simplicity still enchanting.
