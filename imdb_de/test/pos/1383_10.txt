IMPRESSIVE!! Talk about a movie that separates the audience! This is a real love or it is a movie. Personally, I really enjoyed it. I've noticed other reviews compare it to Pitch Black - that's kind of stupid, because the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can be really stupid. No, this movie is much more similar to The Thing (as people do not realize it's amazing - they even have the same basic music) Do not understand things Maybe the movie is a real classic because it gives preference to other Carpenter works , Not least Dark Star, with whom it has something in common. I would like to know how much it really costs? $ 8000? Is that even possible? Maybe it was based on a short film that cost $ 8,000. But I found myself strangely moved when the various space guys died. They are so underplayed that sometimes it's like watching a documentary. However, the script is a bit chunky and only about half of them can act and I'm not sure if the big man playing the captain is one of them. But his weapon is fantastic !! Give him a chance. If you like the early Carpenter, you might fall for it. Do not expect 2001.
