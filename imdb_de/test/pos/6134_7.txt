Yes, I saw this mini series with My Mom and Dad as a child. It was one of the few mini-series that my 9-year-old spirit could actually follow. I remember it was very well done and did not necessarily feel like a typical crap miniseries. It was more or less an original concept that really caught your attention. I would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of history and is planning twists. Although most twists in this movie are either spelled or predictable, it's still worth it. However, I have not yet asked if you can get it through netflix. I would not imagine. You should play it on the course channel or something.
