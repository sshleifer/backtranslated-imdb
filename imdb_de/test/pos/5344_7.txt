The original three movies had something that made them so special and adorable - probably the length of them. Unfortunately, it lacks charm, but it is still a funny movie. <br /> <br /> The bright, shimmering side is that our favorite plasticine characters are still doing good work, using good plasticene animations, there's a silly but well structured and entertaining storyline, an exciting scene. funny adventure, a good idea of ​​action (a litter rabbit and a huge vedgetbarer competition) and good new characters! <br /> <br /> Apart from the original charm, the only somewhat gloomy side of the film is missing. The humor, though good, is a little over the top, especially compared to the original films. <br /> <br /> The popular Giant Vedgetable competition is getting closer, and Wallace and Gromit are helping keep rabbits from eating vedgetables, now they're anti-pesto. They do a good job but soon there is danger. A wool rabbit is nearby ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for all Wallace and Gromit fans and for those who like plastic movies, enjoy "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Wererabbit"! :-)
