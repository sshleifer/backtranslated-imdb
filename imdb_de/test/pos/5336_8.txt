Although not half as funny as "Chicken Run," the new comedy by Wallace and Gromit, "The Curse of the Were Rabbit" (*** out of ****), laughs more than most live action comedies. British director Nick Park, who created the characters of Wallace and Gromit, and co-director Steve Box rely on the old-fashioned stop-motion method of animation - best known as Claymation - to make several visually appealing characters more than enough creating side-shattering scenes about a monstrously mutant hare devouring every vegetable in sight. The bizarre plot is amusing. The heart of laughter lies in the imaginative way Park and Company have painstakingly constructed characters and gags from a modeling clay called plasticine. Basically, every shot you see in "The Curse of the Were Rabbit" required patient souls who made minor changes to the clay figures for a series of individual shots that merge into a veritable compilation of merriment. Hollywood pioneered claymation as an animated form, as early as the silent films of the 1920s, before industry turned its back on the complicated process. The animators of Aardman Studio managed to produce only three seconds of usable material per day. For the protocol, "The Curse of the Were Rabbit" needed five years. The lumpy-looking characters with thumbprints clearly visible in their respective tone complexions look incredibly funny with their ping-pong ball eyes and overblown mouths. Interestingly, Gromit is the funniest character, a loveable mutt without a mouth, but an expressionless expressionless face that speaks more than most of the talking characters. Wallace and Gromit are masters and puppies. As a human half of the duo, Wallace is a homily that has no idiot, who somehow manages to build machines that do some incredible things. One of the funniest scenes is showing masters and puppies awakened by a system of slides, hatches and spring devices that attract and feed them. Meanwhile Gromit is the animal half. The joke is that Gromit shows more common sense than his genius of a master. As good as his ideas and inventions may be, Wallace did not succeed without the loyal Gromit helping him. Our heroes operate a pest control company called "Anti-Pesto". In essence, they have to protect every vegetable garden for miles with an impractical-looking device called Bun-Van 6000, which literally sucks rabbits out of their soil into a large glass container. No, Wallace and Gromit do not kill the animals. Instead, they keep her as pets and Wallace experiments with an invention of Mind-O-Matic that transforms rabbits into carrot haters. This "Frankenstein" meets "The Fly" approach gets poor Wallace in deep trouble when he swaps parts of his brain with that of a hare. Not long after, a mysterious, formidable terror infests the vegetable areas on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the village's 517th Annual Vegetable Competition approaches. <br /> <br /> At first, Wallace and Gromit appeared in Park's Oscar nomination. Film School Project "A Grand Day Out" (1989). Since then, Aardman has released ten more animated short films, including "Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave" (1993) and Academy Award Winners Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers "(1995)." Curse of the Were Rabbit "is not only different because it represents the duo's big debut, but it also takes a whopping 85 minutes: The first two-thirds of" Were-Rabbit "contain better gags than the last third, but Park and Company Do not miss a chance to slip In an adult joke that kids will not get, but attentive adults will appreciate it. "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were Rabbit" makes Bunny big.
