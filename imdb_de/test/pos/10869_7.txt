I've learned something: you have to take this movie like a funny time-lapse comedy if you do not want to be disappointed. The movie is fun because it's a tasty comedy. I think the over-hype has damaged it: the over-glorified Monica Bellucci appears in a few scenes and is not as good as one would have you believe. It sounds unnatural and wrong: the best actress in this film is Sabrina Impacciatore, who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines with Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very, very good: In my opinion, the most promising young Italian actor. Daniel Auteuil looks like Napoleon, but I preferred other actors. The most hyped performances were the worst. <br /> <br /> Costumes and production design are alright: Sure, American films are more accurate at these things because they have bigger budgets, but the Italian ability rewards the lack of money. A nice time comedy, in short, with a first class casting (except Bellucci and Auteuil).
