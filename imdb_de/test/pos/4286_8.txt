When I first read the world of John Irving years ago, I was astonished that most of the younger adults I came in contact with did not like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was a time and experience thing. I experienced some déjà-vu when I read some comments on this site, which were clearly written by younger audiences. Enjoying a separate read completely is certainly a time and an experience. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he is a successful lawyer - she is the perfect wife of a successful lawyer. You have a townhouse in London and a home in the country. Everything is fine until the "villain" appears in the guise of the son of the richest man in the village. This guy seems to be a cad from the word "go". He despises everyone and everything, including his own children. In the traditional form of nice guys who are last finished, the lawyer's wife enters into an affair with the frontier worker. You see, the lawyer is really a nice guy, but with the marriage that characterizes an organized perfectionist. Although he really loves her, he bores his wife to death. The bad boy is far more exciting. <br /> <br /> All this is implicated in the death of a man in the village, in which all the facts indicate that the Cad is the driver of the vehicle. <br /> <br /> It is easy to see that this Film does not lead to a happy ending, but it leads to a very satisfying ending, as the man and his wife will be able to lead their personal lives more successfully from their experiences and probably learning and growing. Three excellent actors play the main characters in this film, and there are performances that make the whole thing a pleasure. Tom Wilkinson is perfect as a husband. His portrayal shows us a friendly man who has so much control over his feelings that he has lost contact with the world. Emily Watson shows us a woman so caught up in the role of the perfect woman that she almost lost her knowledge of the passion. This passion is reborn by the character played by Rupert Everett. When you have reached the point where you understand that everyone has a foot of clay and everyone - even with the gifts of intelligence and opportunity - makes many wrong choices, then you will probably enjoy watching these outstanding actors who are watching life create three of such people. This is a beautifully portrayed and directed movie about realistic adults.
