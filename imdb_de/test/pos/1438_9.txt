Great book, great movie, great soundtrack. Frank Sinatra shows in this film that he could act if he wanted to take the trouble. The end is a bit sulky, but for the time being it is understandable that the studio wanted a happy ending. The graphic nature of heroin addiction (groundbreaking for the period) is a plus. Add the awesome soundtrack and you have one of the great American movies.
