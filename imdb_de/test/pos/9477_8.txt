This is what James Cagney is all about, wisecracks, cockiness, hard as nails and no-nonsense charisma. <br /> <br /> Although the plot sounds serious, the movie is anything but. Played in the 30s screwball comedy style, it works well with his "quarrel" with fianc√©e Mae Clark and his responses to the great stories of his colleague James Burke and the cast it delivers. Dialogues are good, but nothing, unless the delivery is just right and can affect the characters involved. This is done well by all. <br /> <br /> Good entertainment and thoroughly enjoyable.
