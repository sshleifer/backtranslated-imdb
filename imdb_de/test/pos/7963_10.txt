How often do we live our romantic life like on the big screen, in fierce affairs and passionate encounters? Almost never, when what I see as a normal life around me is something to judge. As already said, romances are hardly earthquakes that leave you at the top of the world or beaten and crushed. Romance, in its everyday form, as it has lived millions of times around the world, is a slow, subtle and quiet matter. Something that grows in you, so slowly, probably without you noticing, that it slowly takes over your being. Nobody can tell me when I'm in love. If somebody would do it, I would not believe him anyway, because nobody but me would know. And even then, it's just a feeling, some knowledge, that you feel that sublime emotion. That you want nothing more than the best for someone, that you never want to experience a sad moment. That you are ready to suffer great pain. I would not go so far and say that we are ready to die for your loved one because we are all human and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment lies ahead. <br /> Is the love between the main characters of the film so subtle and reserved, no less noble than that between Romeo and Juliet? The unspoken feelings, the unsung feelings, convey far more than any repeated shouts of "I love you." The reluctance of the lead actor, who is always shown so bitterly in the scene where he watches his love interest through the coffee window, though he has never moved to show it to her, was just heartbreaking. Would most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden, knowing that their feelings and feelings can not possibly be reciprocated? <br /> <br /> How should I deal with my own certain death? Although I can say that I was seriously ill, I can not quite honestly say that I have ever come close to death. Will I be so calm, fix all my affairs and give instructions to others to take back what I leave behind? I assume that I will be quiet because I will hardly have a choice. Can I be so selfless? Again, the answer must be negative. I can empathize with fear, knowing that your life is forfeit, that fate has dealt you a deadly blow, and that future events, so little left of them, are no longer under your control. <br /> <br /> Life is nothing more than a series of small events, the culmination of which may seem great to some in hindsight. But only very rarely.
