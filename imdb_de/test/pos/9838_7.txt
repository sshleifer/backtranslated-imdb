This is not a "real" James Cagney vehicle as its screen time is unusually low. Frankie Darro plays the tough guy Jimmy Smith, the leader of a gang of street thugs sent to school with a couple of his girlfriends. Cagney plays Patsy Gargan, a gang leader himself, who receives a symbolic position as deputy commissioner. When he firsthand experiences the brutal treatment of the reform school, he needs to make some important changes with the help of the reformatory nurse (Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> HELL'S MAYOR is fast paced and still entertaining after all these years. The cast is well rounded out with: Dudley Digges, Arthur Bryon, Farina Hoskins, G. Pat Collins and Allen Jenkins.
