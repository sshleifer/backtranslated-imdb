"Five Characters Seeking an Exit" is clearly one of the smarter and better episodes of the Twilight Zone ever created from their abstract ideas and a thoughtful plan in which the characters must seek identity and the surprise ends. They have a military major, a dancer, a bagpipe player, a clown, and a hobo, all of whom are awakening together at the bottom of a wall, and no one knows how he got there, and they do not know who they are. The episode starts from the beginning with a very interesting drama and tension. This makes the search for the interest of viewers so interesting that they want to get to know the true identity and background of the characters. The episode adds even more intrigue as it places different character types with different views and lifestyles, all sharing a common goal to escape and find identity, and peace that is very attractive to the viewer. Only in the end I do not want to spoil for those who have not seen a surprise case! Prove that you often want to stay where you are in your small sheltered world, and that you stay away from the masses of other people's worlds because you see the characters are loved by people in different ways. Really great and clever, a real surprise that lets the viewer see the unexpected and cruel fate that sometimes occurs in searching and searching.
