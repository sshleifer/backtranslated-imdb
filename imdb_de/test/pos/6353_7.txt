Hummmm, ... ANOTHER Keystone comedy in the park !!! It seems that the number one location in the same park was because so many of Chaplin's and Arbuckle's films are filmed here! And although this is another, it is different enough and well done that I enjoyed it anyway. <br /> <br /> Fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting Mabel Normand. I think she should be a little younger, although in her mother's eyes she is too young to care for men. Well, Fatty does not share her feelings and soon he and Mabel run away to have innocent fun. Things get complicated when the mother's clock is stolen. Fatty finds it and gives it to Mabel as a present ... and MANY problems arise. <br /> <br /> Decent pace and the fact that this movie did not rely too much on cheap slapstick, but a sensible act make a sweet and enjoyable little movie.
