I found this movie incredible. I absolutely loved it, even if my brothers did not do that much. The special effects were outstanding and this movie is about my favorite sport; Golf. The only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it's hard to watch twice or more in a row. This movie just surpasses everything else I've ever seen. It was everything I would expect from a movie. I just loved it. It was also pretty kid friendly. This movie helped me realize that anything is possible when you focus on it. I would give it a pure 10/10! It was better than The Legend of Baggar Vants and the two pirates of the Caribbean movies combined. Just unbelievable. I loved it.
