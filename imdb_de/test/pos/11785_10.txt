So funny is the perfect way to describe this 12 minute parody of the original Star Wars. Hardware Wars is incredibly funny. It will be presented as a trailer of the Space Epic Hardware Wars. The joke is this: Imagine Star Wars, played by bad actors and unbelievably bad special effects. Characters include the "intergalactic boy-wonder" Fluke Starbucker, the "mercenary and the intergalactic mercenary" Ham Salad, Darph Nader, "villain" and many other fantastic characters. It is impossible not to laugh while looking at this 12 minute treasure. It's stupid, but it's fun. You will laugh from start to finish, and you will feel the need to see it again and again and again and again ... and you will laugh every time you see it !!! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. The funniest 12 minutes ever made. You will believe that it took a minute!
