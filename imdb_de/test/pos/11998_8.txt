This is without doubt one of my favorite episodes in Columbo. The acting is very well done, the music is very catchy, the script is awesome and the direction is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk, who performs brilliantly in every episode of Columbo, plays particularly well in this episode. <br /> <br /> Also great performances by Stephen Caffrey, Gary Hershberger, Alan Fudge and Robert Culp. <br /> <br /> The end is absolutely awesome and I love the way Columbo describes it. <br /> <br /> This is a Columbo movie you should NOT miss.
