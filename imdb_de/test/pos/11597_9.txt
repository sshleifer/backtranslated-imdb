The experience is deeply rewarding and causes the intelligent viewer to make multiple reflections on the meaning of life itself. With 'Mar Adentro' Alejandro Amenábar has surpassed his best performances so far, and in his earlier films even made up for some deviations that were a bit directed towards Hollywood. This is not the case with this visual poem that belongs to music: Hollywood could never achieve the effect of this tingly-inspired, human-humane story. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should you interpret 'Mar Adentro'. as an apologia for euthanasia; This story, based on the real life of Galician fisherman Ramón Sampedro, is a deep-down cry for life and love, a quest for human compassion to understand feelings. Sampedro was a compassionate and intelligent man, who after a diving accident off the rocks of the Galician coast was condemned as a young man to live in bed for the next 27 years. 'Condenado a vivir' (2001) (TV) was the first version of this man I have already mentioned. Amenábar, however, has managed to portray this man in an equally articulate and intelligent manner with his constant, enigmatic smile and witty humor. <br /> <br /> And Javier Bardem seized the opportunity to meet the challenge leader -on with a Galician accent that creates an electrifying, captivating and captivating performance where actors and fishermen become one person on the screen. Here is indeed an opportunity to take off the cap and mumble softly "Chapeau". Bardem is driven by a great cast, notably Belén Rueda, Lola Dueñas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (left) and Clara Segura, Galicia and Catalan accents. <br /> <br /> Amenábar produces wonderful dialogues as these six individuals or groups rotate with excellent chemistry. This shows that the young, Chile-born Spanish director is an artist who knows what he is up to and how to get his results; His global concept of film includes his own music interspersed with pieces by Beethoven and Puccini on Sampedro's turntable. <br /> <br /> While watching 'Mar Adentro', I compared him to him a few times with Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece "The Hours" (see). I'm referring to the way the dialogues work with tension and passion, and the careful timing in each scene. <br/> <br /> Javier Aguirresarobe's photography is superb as always. As I mentioned elsewhere in the IMDb, he does not simply film the events and scenes - he even captures the feelings and atmosphere of the moment, deftly capturing the eye, light and shadow, leaving his work behind the camera is immediately another player in the story. An excellent artist. <br /> <br /> 'Mar Adentro' marks another milestone in the history of Spanish cinematography and ranks among the best five or six artworks produced here in the last 25 years. This film is next to film art such as "El Sur" (qv), "Los Santos Inocentes" (qv), "El Abuelo" (qv), "La Lengua de las Mariposas" (qv), "Las Ratas" (qv) 'A Los Que Aman' (qv), and I think I have to add 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' (qv). <br /> <br /> Well-orchestrated story of a real man and those who loved him around his bed: not to be missed.
