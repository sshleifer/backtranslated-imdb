Victor Sjostrom's silent movie masterpiece The Phantom Carriage was recently released on DVD with a soundtrack recorded by KTL. The duo, consisting of American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and Austrian laptop artist Peter Rehberg, has conjured an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the 1921 original film material. An ominous, pounding sound introduces every act and medley of drones and guitar chords, and the feedback ebbs and flows as the grim drama unfolds. <br /> <br /> As impressive as the new soundtrack is, the film remains the true star with its timeless rendition of a dark and dystopian tale. According to this story, the last person to die before midnight on New Year's Eve is sentenced to spend a year behind the reins of the Phantom Carriage of the same name, collecting the souls of the dead. This is the fate of the film's anti-hero, David Holm, who, after his untimely death and subsequent encounter with the driver of the coach, gets a painful test of his life. <br /> <br /> This movie is horror film is often referred to as a horror movie and although this is a fitting label, the real horror here is not in the supernatural elements, but in the representation of human suffering by others. Sjostrom offers a remarkable performance, while the drunken, mischievous and menacing spar in life and the miserable, scared spar looking back from the land of the dead and withdrawing from its previous actions, make impressive pictures of Phantom Carriage, more than compensating for the inevitably limited dialogue. The ominous slump of midnight is powerfully portrayed by the image of a clock face floating like a second moon alone in the night sky. Equally impressive are the dead with groundbreaking semitransparent images and the scenes of the phantom coach driving across land and sea remain a deterrent. <br /> <br /> Sjostroms film earns its place as one of the most cherished silent movies of all time and the new KTL soundtrack is an outstanding accentuation of its themes. This is a must.
