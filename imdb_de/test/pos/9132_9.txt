I think Melville wanted to define this movie as the definition of the cool. It has the cool approach of the late '60s / early' 70s thriller - the same discrete scurrility. LE CERCLE ROUGE, a bitter and fatalistic story, is also the playground of Delon, Bourvil, Volonté and Montand in defining roles. Bourvil is a police officer who has three cats and a daily routine at his home. Delon is a Hoodlum. Montand is a sick, failed policeman. Volonté plays a fledged suspect. Of course, LE CERCLE ROUGE stands far above a raid movie; Melville uses his techniques - long wordless, detailed depictions of all the steps of the robbery, etc. But this special action drama is far better than his other films - and it is very unlikely that it is so much better. The look of LE CERCLE ROUGE is very peculiar to Melville, very Melvillian. Delon was sharp and cool; Bourvil brings his craft and Montand may play the best role of this film; His performance has an unexpected warmth. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the characters are barely outlined, nothing more than absolutely necessary and personal. Or masks; Nevertheless, the presentation is inspired, but economically suggestive. <br /> <br /> Another movie that proves Delon to be a good, very good actor; and the fact that he is not a genius does not mean that he should be despised as a fourth-grade actor. He is good, he can bear the proximity of a Bourvil and Montand. <br /> <br /> Only ten years. Before LE CERCLE ROUGE, Melville was a boring, boring, bland noir pastiche in the late '50s (he himself played along), and after just a decade he's in full form with this pretty amazing action drama. Stylistically, this is a success. Before I saw LE CERCLE ROUGE, I was not a Melvillian fanatic. I think I'm more of a guy. LE CERCLE ROUGE is a drama, an action drama, one of the most demanding genres. Melville scores.
