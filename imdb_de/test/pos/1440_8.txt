From the crash of the opening theme "The man with the golden arm" is classic entertainment program of the 50s. No subtlety here, Frank comes home from prison with a monkey on his back and returns directly to the old neighborhood, where the old garbage bags are still lurking. This is a story about his dark ride with all his intact emotional luggage. The performances are all a bit overripe, but that's part of the fun of watching. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are memorable and almost steal the show. This and "The Manchurian Candidate" are in my humble opinion the two largest CEOs. Do not miss any of them.
