This film is about the crew of a spaceship, which crashes with three suns land on a strange bright planet. Among the passengers is serial killer Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel) and his nemesis Johns (Cole Hauser). While the survivors of the wreck orient themselves, there is a solar eclipse of all three suns. Shortly thereafter frightening creatures appear and begin to pick up the crew members bit by bit. During the solar eclipse, Riddick comes to his own as his eyeballs shine and give him night vision. The crew must rely on him to try to bring her to safety. <br /> <br /> This is a very stylish film in which the color of the sky changes scene by scene and gives it a very strange look. Vin Diesel is as brilliant as Riddick, really menacing, but forced to help people who would otherwise only see him as a threat. There is also an underlying sense of humor in his performance that gives the character another dimension. This is the kind of role that characterizes Vin, the antihero whose character is not as one-dimensional as it first looks. I can not imagine anyone else in this role, it could have been written especially for him. <br /> <br /> Roll on Chronicles of Riddick!
