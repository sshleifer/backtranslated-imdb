I do not know why people thought it was outlandish or disgusting. It's not like American Pie or something. I do not know why people are offended by the universal plugs. Since it is part of the plot, the advertising is excusable. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle joke, a good story, a good morale (thankfully not too sappy), BIG drama and a cheesy ending. <br /> <br /> (small spoiler) The basic requirement here is the classic story of a shepherd boy (Muniz) who lies so much that nobody believes the wolf (Giamatti) comes by. So he gets his best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and they drive the wolf crazy. <br/> <br /> Frankie Muniz can be annoying in other roles, but not as Jason Shepherd. He handles the polite self-confidence of his character very well, and what at first glance seems to be expressionless is really a perfectly executed nonchalance. <br/> <br /> Amanda Bynes. What else can I say? The girl got the gift. She is funny, talented, versatile and very, very attractive. (I'm only 6 months older than her, I'm coming to California soon.) In fact, the 'best friend' was originally a boy, but became a girl as soon as the creators saw Amanda's interest. Which works well, because the part would have been quite boring without the blessing of Bynes abilities. <br /> <br /> Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. While some would play Marty Wolf wicked and devilish, Giamatti not only made him a jerk, but a LIKEABLE fool, a jerk who makes the screen livelier, rather than purposely weakening it. And I doubt many other actors could go through the psychological breakdown Wolf is going through. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie. I loved watching Jaleel White mocking himself. I loved to see all the little references and those that were built into the movie. (One of the guests in the party scene is the director, Shawn Levy, another is Bynes's former co-star Kenan Thompson.) Loved seeing Amanda in these outfits ... Get the DVD if you can. It has all sorts of great extra material and the beautiful Mrs. Bynes guides you through the menus. :)
