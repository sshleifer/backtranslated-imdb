All right, I grant you that some of the insights in "Double Gang" (or "Journey to the other side of the sun") are somehow grim. The idea of ​​a whole planet exists undetected (because we can not see it) on the other side of our Sun) does not last at all - every student of astronomy 101 knows that another planet the size of the Earth causes gravitational disturbances in the movements of other planets would. Thus, astronomers have finally deduced the existence of Pluto, and so they regularly find comets, asteroids and moons. <br /> <br /> And the idea that a mirror image of Earth has somehow evolved almost parallel to our Earth, to English-speaking scientists and human counterparts for every human born on our Earth ... that brings things out of the world "hard science" fiction into the territory of the "Twilight Zone". This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it requires a comprehensive suspension of critical thinking to accept and enjoy. <br /> <br /> But man, this film has knocked me off as a teenager. I was still used to quite cheerful, optimistic sci-fi movies when the hero came through in the end - even "2001" could be interpreted as an "optimistic" ending. <br /> <br /> But in this case: Thinnes was trying to dock with his orbiting mothership so he could return to his own earth just to be thrown back from his berth (something about 'the polarities were not reversed' Lookalike 'did not do the same thing, apparently, Thinnes' doppelganger 'had decided that he was happy in his new home.) Thinnes' ship began the descent to CounterEarth's launch site, and I was sure he would somehow manage it Land safely and try again. Armed with the new information that would make him and his supporters successful. After all, he was the hero and the hero always wins out in the end. Instead, Thinnes could not keep control of the crippled vehicle, and the ship's subsequent crash into the launch pad was so terrible and devastating that it killed everyone (except the chief project leader) and destroyed all the records of that Project and the existence of Thinnes. Thinnes never came home, and he was useless, his secrets never revealed. <br /> <br /> Apart from the Planet Of The Apes series, I've never had such a sad and run-down ending, and I've always remembered it - especially the gruesome ravages of the crash scene just before the move began ( They knew that the spaceship NEVER would fly again!) And that at the very end. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie again and see how well it has lasted over the years.
