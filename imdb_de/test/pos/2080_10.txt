I saw several Hamlets and taught the game. When I observe Jacobi, I am tempted to think that he is as intelligent as Hamlet himself, so alive is he to every nuance of the joke of this character. He deepens each puzzle in terms of Hamlet's character, rather than solving it. It illuminates word by word line by line and shines light into this sparkling spirit. At the same time, however, we are frightened by the horror that Hamlet feels at his betrayal - far more than any other actor - because Jacobi feels the pain deeper than anyone else. And we shudder at Hamlet's own betrayal, for Jacobi is not afraid of the baseness Hamlet can come down to. In short, Jacobi gives us Hamlet in full, and Hamlet in full is the greatest character in the literature. That's why I'm convinced that Jacobi's Hamlet is the best performance I've ever seen of an actor.
