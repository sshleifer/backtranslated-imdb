To be honest, I found Wicked Little Things a very cool and funny horror movie. My friend had given that to me, and I really did see it as nothing but a shitty, low-blooded horror movie on very cool and very good, and while Ill says, it sometimes seemed a bit unnecessary, and though it may not be the best horror movie ever is still good. I found the acting very good, especially from the girl who plays the mother (she seemed very believable and very likable to me). And though it's a small clich√© and over the good it's good. All in all, if the Afterdark Horror Fest movies are not your style, then you should not pay attention to this. You like horror movies or a bad time watching Wicked Little Things. 8.0 out of 10 stars
