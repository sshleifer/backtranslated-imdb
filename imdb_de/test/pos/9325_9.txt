When it became known that the "King of Pop" was dead at the age of 50, a month before he was to launch a series of live comeback shows at the London O2 Arena, it was a great shock to millions of people on the planet the whole world. He was and will forever be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry, and he will be terribly missed. I decided to remember how wonderful he was by watching what was not just Jackson's best video (and possibly the song), but also the best music video ever made by director John Landis (An American Werewolf in London). The film begins with Michael and his girl (Ola Ray), who break their car, and after she has given her a ring, the moon comes out and he becomes a werewolf. Then we see Michael and his girl watching this horror movie in the movies, she's scared and goes out, and Michael follows her and sings the iconic song. Soon the voice of Vincent Price can be heard, and zombies crawl out of the earth and open coffins from the cemetery, and Michael and the girl are obviously surrounded. She turns away, and Michael has become a zombie himself, and with all the other creatures they make the iconic dance before turning back into his normal self, at least for the chorus. The girl runs into the near-creepy house, blocks the door, but the zombie Michael still manages to break through, and when he touches her, he yells that the normal Michael says, "What's the problem?" The movie ends with him taking her home and looking at us with evil eyes. Michael Jackson was number 14 in the 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons and he was # 6 on The Ultimate Pop Star, the thriller album was # 4 on The 100 Greatest Albums and this video was # 71 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments and It was the # 1 of the 100 biggest pop videos. Very well!
