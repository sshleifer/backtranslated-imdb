What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode alongside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle mysteriously dies and it looks like a heart attack on the bike discovered by his fianc√© Julie Newmar, who plays the role so delicately. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper, who is proud of her talents and scolds Columbos sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins here. Anyone who accuses the other of murdering his uncle for money. Well, all you have to do is watch and see the result, but I can assure you that it is always worthwhile seeing this for the cast and the crew.
