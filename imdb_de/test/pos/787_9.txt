Undoubtedly, Buster Keaton was most beautiful when shooting short 20-minute films, and they are no funnier than this gem. The dead pan comic is involved in a photographic confusion with a wanted criminal. This leads to his elaborate evasion of several street police and fellow travelers who recognize his face on the "wanted" signs. The Goat is a Choc-a-block with brilliant gags, from the opening scene on the bread snake to the wonderful elevator chase at the end. A Keaton movie never feels like it lacks the silence, because sound is never something you need with it. His films are explained by the wonderful (but incredibly dangerous) things he did to himself. It's not hard to see how influential he really was - the man is as impressive today as he was in 1921.
