Victor Mature, a barely civilized and mostly out-of-control mountain climber and trapper, may be featured on the poster, but Robert Preston, a failed Union chief who has caused his men to "cut themselves in ribbons" from the Shiloh Confederate Artillery Sent to a fort in Oregon because of his incompetence, the most interesting part married to a young and initially hard-to-recognize Anne Bancroft. The uncivilized elders ripen after the colonel's wife, who gives the film an interesting and even dark subplot that goes so far as to covet the wife of a man of James Whitmore who plays Mature's older and smarter mountain-godfather. Directed by Anthony Mann, this film loses with James Stewart in his more famous West, but even if you really do not need the Indian threat to make this movie a worth seeing movie, though Preston may prove his poor judgment as a commanding officer in a failed expedition to finally bring the Indians to submission, into a well-orchestrated attack between the woods that quickly turns into an escape.
