I really enjoyed the movie, especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful Gong Li as a concubine. <br /> <br /> However, it was a bit distracting, as if they had the Chinese-accented PLUS English subtitles PLUS voice with an American accent, although the synchronization was very well synchronized. The family name of Qin shi huiang di (The First Emperor of Qins) was Zheng, and his first name Yiong should have been referred to him in English as "King Zheng" or "Emperor Zheng" and NOT as "King Ying Zheng" as in In those days the two surnames were not used together. <br /> <br /> The condition of Qin is pronounced "Chin" "Not" shin "- too bad the researchers did not understand that correctly. <br /> <br /> I renounce it but it was over dismayed when the commentary announced that he was buried along with "Zai-an" his terracotta warriors, the city of Xi'an is pronounced as "sea-an," never as "Zai-an" - the American spokesman could certainly did right!
