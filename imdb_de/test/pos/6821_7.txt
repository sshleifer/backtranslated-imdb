Joseph Conrad's timeless novel Heart of Darkness was featured in the 1994 film. I've read Conrad's novel, and I have to say that although I prefer the novel myself, the movie was a great show. The sets and costumes brought Conrad's novel to life on the screen as we followed Marlow's journey. The drama also brought the characters to life through manners, voices and personalities. If you have read the novel, I recommend that you also watch this movie. However, if you have not read the novel, it may be harder to follow the movie. Conrad's Heart of Darkness is too full of action, emotions and information to turn it into a movie that lasts just over an hour and a half. So if you have not read the novel, the plot in the movie may seem too cluttered to follow. Overall, I gave this movie seven points out of ten. The basic plot of the novel was brought to the screen with large sets, costumes and plays. Nothing can replace the original work of Joseph Conrad.
