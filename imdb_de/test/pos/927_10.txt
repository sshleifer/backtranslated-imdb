Trilogies are very interesting. Some go out with a bang (Lord of the Rings), some get progressively weaker (The Matrix), some lose themselves in ambiguity (Blade, Back to the Future), but some uphold the genius floating seemingly ever-growing bright light over the surface of his immaculate exterior. Case and point: "Three colors trilogy". This last chapter of the trilogy is the most philosophical and thought provoking. In "Blue" we had a more visually stunning, character-based storyline, in "White" it was more of a carefree, narrative story in which we hear more of what the characters say than anything else. "Red", however, focuses on the "what if" and "how is it". It questions our own destiny and focuses mainly on the past and the future rather than the present. <br /> <br /> This chapter is about a young model who overruns a dog and returns it to its owner. She quickly learns that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge, who spies on the phone calls of his neighbors through advanced espionage equipment. All three films in the trilogies have very basic storylines, but bring much more into the story. In "Blue", look at the story of a woman who deals with the loss of her relatives. Ideas about contemporary French society are constantly being shown and how this reflects the behavior of the character. "Red" is not just about a young woman finding refuge in an older man's life, it's also about chance, hope and destiny. Irene Jacob plays as Valentine Dussaut first finding something the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant) we never find is extremely egocentric and disgusting. However, through self-reflective analysis and her voyeuristic intentions, she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her if he was only 40 years younger. Irene lives from another, younger judge who is very similar to the old man. This is the "what if" that is constantly circling in the movie. What if Irene was born 40 years ago? The old man would have been her perfect match. But what if the younger judge is actually their perfect match, since he is so similar to the older judge? Valentine does not know that, only we know it, and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every setting Irene is in. We are constantly with his presence on his face, which is almost an indication of Iran's fate. I mention that the old man has no name for a reason. This is because it is very symbolic of the overall theme of the story. We will compare the old judge with the younger Judge Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit) in more ways than one. We learn that the old man once had someone he loved, but she came away. In another scene, we see Auguste with a broken heart, as the love of his life disappears with another man. There are always memories of Valentine ever meeting this man or not. Although they pass each other without noticing every day. There is also the theme of the phone, for Valentine it's a way to stay healthy and update her life; for Auguste, that's what leads to his heartbreak, and for the old, it's the only thing he still has. These three elements serve to shadow the psychology of the characters. It's a kind of statement about who they are and who they are. All three "Colors" films stand for a certain principle, which occurs most frequently in France. "Blue" stands for Liberty (the personal being), "White" stands for equality (accepted by more than one) and "Red" means fraternity (socializing, learning). And although this last chapter is an obvious focus on the fraternity principle, Kieslowski ensures that he also brings in the other two to connect all three stories together. For example, we see the old man trying to reach Valentine and enlighten him with his spy equipment, reflecting the principle of equality. In the end, we also see that Valentine is looking for some soul and cares more about herself than others (she does not pick up the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of Liberty. And with all three principles Kieslowski connects all the characters in the last and the deepest exciting scene. <br /> <br /> You might have been "red" if you were older or younger. It's about whether or not someone is perfect for everyone, and whether or not a person can change their life. The final chapter of the most impressive trilogy ever made, this film breaks through barriers in governing as well as storytelling. It's not just about our modern life, it's about where life in our modern times could and should be. And though the film is more subtle than both "blue" and "white," he boldly praises a statement of love and compassion. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine that "Red" Kieslowski's last film was he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him, because Bergman, Fellini and Wenders are a remarkable director who has never been awarded an Oscar. Kieslowski, you were missing!
