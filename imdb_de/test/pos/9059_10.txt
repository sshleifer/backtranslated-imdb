On a scale of 1 to 10, "Suicidal Sweetheart" received an 11 from me and from everyone else on this show. The picture was incredibly funny. I said to my wife, "It's obvious that this man is going to water, but over a bed of fire, that's a bit much." This is one of the best mixes of comedy, satire and allusions I've seen since Mel Brook's "Young Frankenstein". I can not believe that this picture was not taken up by a big studio. <br /> <br /> This "Film Festival" audience was highly developed and could pick up on any comic sight visually, spoken or implied. The characters are real and the combination of a great script and a great casting was obvious. Max and Grace are real people with real issues that are treated regardless of the chances of success. It keeps you smiling while you are serious and laughing with all the indirect humor that is brilliantly incorporated into this production. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is a "must see" picture.
