The Monkees are surprisingly a big favorite of mine. Yes, it could have been the originally created rock band; A gimmick that was certainly surpassed in the 21st century. Their music, however, is considered one of the best of the 1960s. Last train to Clarksville, Daydream believer, I'm a believer, (I'm not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs written by good songwriters like Boyce / Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen / King and John Stewart Although they were not great musicians or songwriters, they had a likeable screen presence and a great appeal, and some of their own stuff was actually decent. Her TV show is dated in 2007, but I occasionally watch the show as a time capsule in life from 1966 to 1968. this magical and dangerous time in US history. <br /> <br /> However, as we all know, the Monkees, as a harbinger of things to come for Kelly Clarkson, do not want to be made and considered fair dolls for their record label. Despite their average talent, they wanted to write their own songs, produce their own albums, and get the best results from touring. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a disaster. especially when Peter Torks Jimi Hendrix was chosen as the opening act because he had stolen the show and rejected the sexual suggestions in his music compared to the content of The Monkees G-Rated. <br /> <br /> The last nail, however, In the coffin for the Monkees (until 1986) was the notorious movie head. Head was written by Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson while allegedly high on the Mary Jane. The film received bad reviews and scored at the box office only $ 16,000. Today, the film is a cult classic ahead of its time, conveying a message of what the youth was doing in 1968, the Summer Of Anger. <br /> <br /> Head really has no action. Basically, one to four of the Monkees dance from scene to scene without reason and rhyme. They go from dinner in a diner to Davy Jones, who is struck by Sonny Liston, a western, sucked into a vacuum, to concerts and so on. The film essentially offers wry opinions about what was wrong in American society. The Monkees compromise, the war in Vietnam, American politics, censorship, founding and greed. You have to read between the lines to see what the goals of the ridicule were. <br /> <br /> The Monkees spend a lot of time at certain points of the film, symbolizing how their record label has seen them. as nothing but toys for them to play when it was time to record another hit album. A scene in which they are 16-4 inferior in the Western scene, could be an icon for them. Against the session musicians, songwriters, record producers and what did not control their careers and the cannon they're firing at is their way of saying: Begone! , <br /> <br /> The movie is really a psychedelic journey. The eye-catching tie-dye colors, the hypnotic concert and belly dance scenes and the dramatic images are everywhere. The acting is actually very good, but that's biased, since I like The Monkees TV Show. A small soundtrack contains "The Porpoise Song" and three songs written by The Monkees themselves. <br /> <br /> The film actually contains occasional funny scenes; although maybe it should not be. Mickey Dolenz hit a Coke machine that gave him no lemonade, or his violent brawls in the boxing scene (I mean, he was a wiry guy who probably weighed no more than 135) and made me laugh at it. <BR> <br /> All in all, this movie is an absolute must for any Monkees fan. I think many people will feel that this film is indeed "over the head", but for those who are obsessed with the 60s and society, it will be a great time capsule.
