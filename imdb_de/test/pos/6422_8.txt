I was very impressed by this movie directed by (Luigi Bazzoni). The story was about a young translator who had suddenly forgotten the last three days and suffered nightmares from astronauts on the moon. She can not explain how it happened to nobody. One day a postcard comes to her from the island of Garma, where she visits. funny, although people seem to know her, even though she has never been there. Even her dreams of astronauts on the moon come back to her. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a very strange Italian movie that sometimes seemed very haunting, and there were also weird pictures in the movie that seemed to stay with you throughout the time you were in saw the movie. I would only recommend this film to people to see how good it is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
