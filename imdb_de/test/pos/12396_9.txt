This French study of dissatisfied adolescents from the late '50s (in their early 20s - actually "grown up" but not yet established in the adult world) probably has the limit of a mile in terms of an accurate representation of French youth Missing 1958 (Do not nearly ALL youth films made by adults - those who do not come to mind - River's Edge are rare), but director Marcel Carne of Les Enfants du Paradis is also an observer of humanity should give no insight into the nature of these characters. In a way, the details are not important - you could change the details and make the movie today and it would work just as well - but the loneliness and insecurity, as well as the superficial passion and self-righteous anger of the characters are well captured. The young Pierre Brice and Jean-Paul Belmondo are in supporting roles, but lead Jacques Charrier, Laurent Terzieff, Pascale Petit and Andrea Parisy with subtle and deeper roles. There is also a fine jazz score, which you can get on the CD JAZZ IN PARIS - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL. 2. Unlike some who have commented on the film, I do not really see director Carne as a judge of these characters - he seems to me to be an objective observer. Of course, these middle-class characters seem like people who are spoiled and can not hurt the viewers of the working class of the movie, and I think Carne is well aware of that. For this American viewer (I've seen a dubbed, quite literal version of these titles called THE CHEATERS), the film offers an interesting window into France of the fifties. It's also self-assuredly poetic (the scene on the Sims that saves the cat is just one example of that) and has intellectual aspirations in a charming way that only French films can get through - I can imagine that cumbersome, melodramatic the flat way in which this kind of material would have been processed by an American studio production and the sensational, moralistic and suggestive way this type of material would have been handled by American drive-in / exploit filmmakers. I feel that Marcel Carne has captured the essence of that time between graduation and the time when people at the beginning of the 30-year-old have essentially settled into a routine, whatever that routine may be. Those who are willing to watch the movie with open-mindedness and not shoot at the many simple goals it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties. And even if you do not want to, you can go into the other room while watching the movie and just enjoy the fine soundtrack, with great jazz and instrumental pop from the 50s, including the wonderful original score of an American "Jazz at" the Philharmonic - Group, including Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz ("Goetz" in the credits), Roy Eldridge and Ray Brown.
