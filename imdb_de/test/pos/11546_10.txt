When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was a very strange movie. But I know that the director almost always has a purpose in making a movie. So I decided to see it again. The second time I saw it, I realized that Albert Puyn is a very talented and very original filmmaker. In the beginning, the viewer was told that the film took place a decade after the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. But they had clothes and cars with a typical design of the fifties. They had plutonium, which I think is a symbol of futuristic trade. I think that means that the realtime of the movie is not specified. The music in the film creates a long music video that tells some parts of the actual story in the lyrics, especially for the intro and the outro. Albert Puyn uses red and blue background color when he shows the symbols for communism (red) and capitalism and the western world (blue). It can be stated that Ice-T has the name Mao (communism) and that when it is in focus, the background color is red. The American policeman with Burt Reynolds is always filmed in blue background color. The club where Mao and his gang are staying also has a red background color. Crazy Six shuttles between the red and the blue colors. <br /> <br /> The white puppy that Mao initially had symbolized, I believe, the controlling power. Mao had the dog in the beginning, but the policeman took it in the end. I believe that symbolizes the fall of communism and the replacement of capitalist thinking from the Western world in Eastern Europe. I think Crazy Six is ​​a very well made movie. Albert Puyn creates a science fiction / action film with political depth. It is another, but a very special film about the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. I look forward to seeing another spectacular movie by Albert Puyn.
