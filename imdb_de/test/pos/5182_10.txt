I saw FAREWELL TO HARRY at the Plaza Theater when I was in New York City and was pretty much taken away. The performance of William Hall Jr. is enormous. This is a movie for the classic cinema audience. Garrett Bennett's statement reminds me of the early works of Barry Levinson and Robert Redford. The film seems to transcend the typical independent film. It has a soul and a visual power that is unique. I've seen this with a small audience (400) who was thrilled from the first to the last credit, and although I did not cry (like the lady next to me), I have to admit that I had a bit of watering in my eyes ... <br /> <br />
