Some films want to make us think, others want to inspire us, others want to cheer us up. But sometimes a movie just makes you laugh, and "In & Out" certainly succeeds in this section. <br /> <br /> High school teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) from Indiana will be married to a fellow teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) in three days, but the whole city is more focused on the Academy Award nomination former resident Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) eagerly awaited. When Cameron wins an Oscar for playing a gay soldier, he thanks his gay teacher Howard for inspiration. What follows is how Howard fails in a hilarious series of glitches in a true way. Kevin Kline is great and radiates gay stereotypes. Joan Cusack really has a talent for screwball tricks. Debbie Reynolds is totally funny as Howard's mother. And Bob Newhart is also a hoot as a homophobic principal. <br /> <br /> The gay screenwriter Paul Rudnick really creates a delicate balance here. He knows the stereotypes and uses them in a way that is usually tolerable for conservative Midwesterner and usually harmless to the gay public. It is not exactly progressive, but it is funny and unofficial and definitely a step after the birdcage of the previous year.
