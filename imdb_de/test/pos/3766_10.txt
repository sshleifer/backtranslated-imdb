I came from the "Druggie" generation and found this movie hilarious. Jekyll & Hyde was brought up to date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed the whole way. Would like to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They do not have drugs, but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I saw it. I can only remember a few things. I'd say the funniest part was when Dr. Jekyll took a nap on his lab bench and inhaled the straw as he snored and then snorted at the powdered drug he had invented. Funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie.
