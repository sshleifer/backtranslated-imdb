I had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival. Herzog introduced the film and then spent an hour of questions and answers. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant "documentation"; Herzog later stated that he does not view his films as a documentary, since facts sometimes obscure the truth. Instead, he writes some scenes and ad-libs to introduce a new element that may have been missed if he followed the original outline of the story. The little Dieter is unlike Timothy Treadwell a real person who will make you fall in love with love; You cheer him, you feel the agony he feels. They admire the humor and joie de vivre that he exhibited here 30 years after he was captured by the Viet Cong. You are disappointed when you learn that Dieter died not so long ago. <br /> <br /> As in most Herzog films, the footage is breathtakingly beautiful and offers a wonderful selection of background music. Above all, a fight scene from the archives of the Vietnam War, which, however, fit into the plot of Dieter. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the movie, Dieter returned to the hellish jungle where he was POW and he's traveling with some locals. I can not imagine what he felt when he was tied again. <br /> <br /> One of the better films to portray and discuss the nightmare of the Vietnam War. It should be a lesson to all of us.
