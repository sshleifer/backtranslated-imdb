A messy man known as Bill lives in a small, desolate apartment with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall and his typewriter. Only the man can not imagine writing. He walks the streets and follows people just to see where they are going. Maybe that gives him an inspiration to write. He follows a well-dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. In a caf√©, the well-dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of Bill and asks why Bill is following him. The well-dressed man says his name is Cobb. Cobb then surprisingly informs Bill that he is a burglar and even begins to take Bill home with him to steal things; Although Cobb insists he does not go into other people's homes just to steal. He says he wants people to know he's been there, and interrupted the things they take for granted. He puts, for example, panties from another burglary in the pants of a man. <br /> <br /> The movie is sometimes also told in flashbacks. The director has used this technique in his recent feature film Memento on a larger scale. Bill finally decides to cut his hair and put on a suit on Cobb's advice. He meets a blond woman in a club that has an appointment with the owner, a bald man who is very dangerous, she says. We see a scene in which the bald man uses a hammer on the fingers of a man in the blond lady's apartment. These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us, and they will all fit together when we come to the surprising conclusion.
