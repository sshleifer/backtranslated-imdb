The second episode of the new "Lost" gives you exactly what the fans did not want - a lot of exciting action. In the first scene you will always see new features that you did not expect. It's the best proof that the series, which is in its fourth season, is still alive and hard. <br /> <br /> Although the producers are not baffling us with some more flash forwards this time around, the return to flashbacks is more than satisfying as it brings some shocking facts. The flashbacks introduce some fresh characters, and the familiar ones are surprisingly linked. <br /> <br /> The fresh characters dominate the whole episode and I can not say they are causing any damage. Their scenario parts and their performers are very good and give us an exciting feeling - right after the episode you'll find that the show really only needed such people. And here they are. <br /> <br /> "Confirmed Dead" is full of enthralling action and capitalized dialogues. I'm sure I'll be citing the best scenes of the episode for a long time - they're just so good that they stay in your memory. The episode is entertaining, smart and cheeky. You like "Lost", you have to see it. My voice is ten.
