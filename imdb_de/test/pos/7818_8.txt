A charming film that is especially enhanced by the musical and vocal background during the competition. I understand that there never was a soundtrack, but you could tell me through your sources where I could get information about the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song he sang. Your help would be appreciated. The song has touched me and my wife very much and we would like to procure a copy wherever possible, so that we can play it as background music when we have our family and friends for our "Italian Nights". If you can provide us with this information, we would be very grateful. Even if you can inform yourself about the studio contact, so that we can go directly. <br /> <br /> Best regards, <br /> <br /> John Payling
