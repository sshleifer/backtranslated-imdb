I was a bit scared when I saw this movie in the cinema. It's indeed always difficult to turn a comic into a movie, and the first episode of the adventures of the two greatest French heroes was good, but not fantastic. After all, it's very funny from start to finish with unexpected gags, some tricks, no timeouts, great effects, a great cast, great scenery and great background as they will be able to translate all the French names into English or German because it is certainly funny in French, but how will it be in another language?
