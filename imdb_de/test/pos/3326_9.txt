I can not help but notice the negative reviews this movie has received. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked mesmerized. Yes, I rented it after reading the comments of others. They are correct in that some of the actors leave something to be desired. You are also right that one of the best achievements of this film is that of Dr. Graves was. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the boy in a wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, maybe because I'm in a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> This movie is certainly worth watching.
