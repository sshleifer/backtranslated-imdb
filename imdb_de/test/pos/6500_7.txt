... scratch it. Just as Africa's rhythms created the jawbone of a donkey, and Virgin Islander's oil drums welded into ear-pleasing steel bands, the urban DJ chased after new methods of creative expression. "Scratch" is a completely unworn documentary that puts you in the heart of the hip hop / rap movement, exploring the genesis of turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl, and the ultimate DJ / MC contempo entertainment expression. The film unveils some surprisingly intelligent and articulate "Scratchers" with amazingly unique concert and competition skills where the beat hits the streets. Good things for anyone interested in grassroots or ghetto movement in sound art. (B)
