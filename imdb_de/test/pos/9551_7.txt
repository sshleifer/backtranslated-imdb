Man, I really enjoyed that, if only for Fred Willard's comment on the dog show. There are some dead spots and some gags that do not work, but overall the movie works very well. When I was younger, my parents bred dogs, and the people I met at these shows were not much less bizarre than the freaks on the show. I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie because of its artistry and for its commentary on how we tend to take frivolous things way too seriously ... I did the acting because of its accuracy (most of the accents were flawless) and its subtlety (I loved the way every person walked with their dogs) ... <br /> <br /> Borrow this movie if you appreciate the strangeness of human existence.
