I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a relaxed, fun, thought-provoking movie. The lack of sex, vulgarity and violence made for a very pleasant evening. I liked the Buffalo scene very much, but that's probably because I do not live far from it. Nevertheless, this film could have been produced in every city; It's the topic that matters so much here. I'm just thankful that Manna From Heaven fell on us. Try it ... you will like it!
