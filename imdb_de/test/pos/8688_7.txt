For the most part, I only enjoy the kind of film that lets you flee the current time into the future or into the past. This movie is pure escapism. Dancing starts almost immediately, and Debra Paget in her purple harem bikini dress just does not have anything in the movie, in my opinion. Her dancing, while sultry, is outdone by Fritz Lang's Tiger of Eschnapur, available on DVD, where she played the temple dancer Seetha. One problem with the movie is the closed shot. There are only a few exterior shots, and these scenes and other scenes are a bit claustrophobic. The same places are used again and again, but with some interesting secret passages and waterways. Their secret dual identity is absolutely incredible with beauty of this magnitude. Debra even holds a saber and keeps two opposing soldiers at bay on a flight of stairs, she could do anything. <br /> <br /> What works is Debra Paget as a princess. With her beauty, she would certainly be at the center of attention at all times in the story. This movie will be a must if it is hopefully available on DVD. All in all, with a bit of humor taken, I loved it. <br /> <br />
