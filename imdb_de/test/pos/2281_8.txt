I am very impressed by the reviews I have read about this film - usually well read, thoughtful and informed - obviously by people who love movies and think hard about it. I can not add anything to the excellent review tasks that IMDb members have already done. If I may, I'd like to correct a small but common misconception that crops up in many of the reviews: Mr. Baseball was American and ugly, but he was not an ugly American. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the 1958 novel by Burdick and Lederer, and the opposite of Mr. Baseball. Homer was an archetypal American and an archetypal engineer - he went to Vietnam to work with people, he respected and liked the people he met, he used appropriate, sustainable technology in collaboration with his hosts and he was well liked by them and respected because he exemplified democratic values ​​and American virtues. His ugliness was purely facial, only skin-high; His personality and humanity were deep and sincere. <br /> <br /> Mr. Baseball is an example of all the blatant, ignorant, uncertain implications that we Europeans and Americans often inflict on other cultures. Homer Atkins, the ugly American, was the other side of our coin and embodied our humanity and decency. I think the ugly Americans are still far superior to Mr. Baseballs; They are still our last, best hope.
