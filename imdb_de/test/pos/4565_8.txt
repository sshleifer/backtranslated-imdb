In the 1970s, there was a rise and fall of blacksploitation films. The term is more of an indication of a kind of broader catch than a true genre of film. In short, all Comedy, Drama, Adventure, Western or Urban Cops & Robbers designed and staffed to appeal to the great urban black people of the mid-20th century. In fact, this could include the broadest type of films as long as they had a tendency to black population in the city center. <br /> <br /> It seems that the idea of ​​producing these films, which are of particular interest to Black Americans, is due to its emergence with the Eastertime release of 100 RIFLES (Marvin Schwartz Prod./20th Century-Fox, 1969) ). The former American All-American footballer and multiple all-pro fullback for the Cleveland Browns, Jim Brown, had a co-starring billing in it. After appearing in several films such as RIO CONCHOS (1964), THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967), (ICE STATION ZEBRA (1968) *), it became increasingly useful for the "suits" of the studios. "Jim was a hot item. <br /> <br /> Now, these 100 RIFLES on Easter Sunday bring record numbers of black patrons to the central business districts of the big cities to watch Mr. Brown, why not start filming more of these adventure epics and other types of movies With more black players and stars, why not? ** So we saw a bunch of Cops & Robbers, nasty private detective movies, comedies that were all on our way, and finally we got some more family oriented, appealing films SOUNDER (1972), THE TAKE (1974), CONRACK (1974) and finally CLAUDINE (1974). <br /> <br /> In CLAUDINE we find neither a stigma nor a simple classification as "blackploitation", as the story goes is universal and easy ht as a story about people from a Every descent, no matter where, and not only in the US of the 70s. <br /> <br /> That the story was told by a SINGLE mother, Claudine (Dianne Carroll), who is after "... two marriages and two almost marriages.", is a far cry from a shooting Harlem style , The problems facing the citizens of our everyday life are confronted and examined under the sociological microscope of the old man. <br /> <br /> We also consider Claudine's psychological and physical needs as a woman. For "woman needs man and man must have his buddy", *** and we admit this point. (That's the SEX we're talking about, Schultz!) Claudine meets a very masculine, broad-shouldered, athletic guy in Private Scavanger Garbage Man, Ruppert B. Marshall (James Earl Jones), and they go on a date. <Br /> <br /> The big welfare state intervenes with the couple as Claudine's social worker, Miss Tayback (Elisa Loti), sniffs to see who this male, untethered man is who is suddenly paying so much attention to Claudine's family. <br /> <br /> After a humiliating experience of examining and "pulling down" the Welfare Office, which would be customary for the family, they decide to marry with or without the blessings of Big Brother. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Claudine's older son had some great talk but little to do with the Black Activist group. But with Ruppert's help, he and they all come through. A.O.K. <br /> <br /> It ends with a cheerful, optimistic and hopeful touch. We know that maybe it's not exactly "... Happy Ever After!" Is, but that everything is done together! If there is one single criticism we have to realize, it is sometimes the case that in a movie like this a misunderstanding is spread to a large part of the urban blacks. And that is the seemingly implied myth that all whites are wealthy and none of their kind ever need a helping hand, are unemployed or have any disabilities. <br /> <br /> Well, people, it just is not true! NOTE: * At some point, Jim Brown's career was a real hit as a tough actioner. He was even tense as "... the black John Wayne". NOTE: ** The idea of ​​making movies with all-black casts shot for all-black consumption was not a new idea. In the 1920's, 30's and 40's we saw productions by people like Noble Johnson, Spencer Williams, Jr. and Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> NOTE: *** This is "As Time Goes By," you know, Schultz, it's from CASABLANCA (Warner Brothers, 1942).
