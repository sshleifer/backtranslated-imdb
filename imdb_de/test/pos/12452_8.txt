Although films about Edgar Rice Burrough's famous Rousseauian hero Tarzan have been watched by moviegoers for nearly a century, this is the final version of the story. Greystoke is the real story of the origins of Tarzan, which Edgar Rice Burroughs laid down as early as the second decade of the last century. I was assured by experts. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and Sherlock Holmes are probably the most filmed fictional heroes in history. I really have no basis, just a gut feeling. The most famous Holmes was Basil Rathbone, the most popular Tarzan was Johnny Weissmuller. And films made with these two characters are critically criticized by purists. <br /> <br /> But Greystoke is the true deal, a faithful adaptation of Burrough's first story regarding the origin of his hero. I can not imagine another film showing that Tarzan learned French before English, but that's shown here, and that's only natural, since it's a French survivor of a massacre safari by Ian Holm who discovers Tarzan, which was raised by the monkeys since his parents, who had been shipwrecked on the African coast, died there after his mother had given birth. His parents were actually the son and daughter-in-law of the Earl of Greystoke and the surviving Earl, played by Ralph Richardson, is, of course, overjoyed to learn that he has a grandson. Of course, there are others who do not welcome the new heir in society. <br /> <br /> One person who does not do that, of course, is Andie McDowell, who of course plays Jane. She does not communicate with Tarzan in response to his grunts and monosyllabic orders. Tarzan is fluent in English, French and understands the language of monkeys. In terms of the language of love, Tarzan and Jane do not need lessons. <br /> <br /> Greystoke received three Oscar nominations for Best Ape Monkey, Best Adapted Screenplay and a Posthumous Nomination for Ralph Richardson for Best Supporting Actor. A nomination for the cinematography of the jungle scenes in Cameroun and the scenes of the British aristocracy in various landmarks such as Hatfield House and Blenheim Palace should also have been assessed. For Burroughs purists, Greystoke is the real deal.
