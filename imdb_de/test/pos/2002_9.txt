You have to see it to believe it. Shot in Hollywood on the Strip right in the middle of the filthy movie, it all goes back to the '70s, this cheap-made movie really needs to have packed the inner-city theaters back then. Then I bet it ran for a week. Actually, it's pretty funny. Acting is awful, the direction does not exist, but the hair, the clothes, the lazy pre-disco music and the general slowness of the story are overwhelming. Sleazy, it's very sleazy. Highly recommended (if you can find it)
