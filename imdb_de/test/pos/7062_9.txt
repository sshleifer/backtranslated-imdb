I heard that on TV someday and loved it. There were a number of lame comedies in the '70s that tried too hard to be funny, so this was a nice surprise. It's one of the best comedies of the '70s and the final summer camp comedy thanks to Murrary's outstanding comedy performance, which is still considered one of his greatest. This is the movie that attracted Ivan Reitman as a director. Reitman proves with this film that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. While this movie is funny and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that it's fun, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely terrible. Recommended for those who like STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.
