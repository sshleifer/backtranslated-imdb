This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro works in an animation studio myself, which is pretty interesting if you do not know how to run anime studios. Apart from Episode 3, this was probably the least risk, but it had a nice girl interest and a surprise reunion with others in the previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is that it seemed a little too short, but it may have been because it was the only original script for the series that was not based on any of the manga chapters. But it ended well and we had the nice feeling that Kentaro is constantly 25 years old and continues to study. Definitely watch the rest of the series all the way through, you can buy the whole series for about $ 17, you can watch all the way in about 2 1/2 hours, or your favorite episode when you're 20 minutes Have time (which I do when I have a lunch break at school.) Good show, take a look at it.
