OK, I do not fancy that this is the typical gay love life, but since when are there real romances in real life as they appear on screen? This movie is balanced with comedy and drama and I had a great time. It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman using his clients' homes for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander). And after seeing him the day before in Priscilla, the queen of the desert, he is probably one of the surest in her masculinity. :) Anyway, the plot went smoothly and the scenes with the men were a shout. Thumbs up! 8.10
