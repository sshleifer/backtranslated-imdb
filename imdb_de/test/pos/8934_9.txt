I've always loved Brenda Blethyn and "Undertaking Betty" was not a disappointment. I saw it on the satellite on a dreary Sunday morning. Life was exhausting and this movie made me laugh and saw things we normally miraculously consider stupid. I wish she would make more movies like "Saving Grace". Brenda Blethyn is a great girl approaching 60 to see in action. She is sweet, beautiful and full of life, without appearing plastic and unreal. There are not many actresses we can relate to realistically, weirdly and / or seriously. Brenda - if you see that - continue with such gems. We need more Mrs. Bennetts, Bettys and Graces.
