The songs are fantastic and the story is good. Like many other drama schools, my HAIR also produced. For most hair productions, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to do some act, but my production was completely dressed ... I do not think frontal nudity in a movie or in a piece guarantees artistic quality ... And the makers of the film were it also. The movie version is great with classic hits that follow each other as the plot turns into a chilling climax. A great cast of actors, dancers and singers.
