I'm a big fan of space and at the age of 44, I discovered this streak for the first time. I came by detours from the Space 1999, then the UFO. I went hunting for other Anderson creations and found that this was their first live action. What a home run! I actually heard about this movie years ago, but never knew what it was called, so I'm glad I found it by accident. <br /> <br /> These Andersons were just amazingly performing the most believable and realistic looking models, the quality of acting, etc. <br /> <br /> I do not think it looks outdated at all. Let me tell you ... I'll take good old models on the wrong CGI crap today, ANYTIME! Seriously, most rocket scenes looked pretty real. They had it to science! If you decide on what you consider to be real, it is not difficult to actually believe it. <br /> <br /> Also the amount of details in the stage sets, the beautiful photography and the whole look. .. man, i wish i could return to this time! They knew how to make great movies in the 60s. Personally, I've lost all interest in Hollywood movies today. Anyone with a budget can do CGI. I hate it! Bring the models back! Think of all the people who do this style! Anyway, I rant. :-) If you like good science fiction, which is very well done, you will do yourself a service by seeing this.
