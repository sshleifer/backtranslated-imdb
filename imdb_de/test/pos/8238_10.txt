A light, uplifting and captivating film. Watching Irene Dunne is a pleasure! If you watch her, she is no longer Irene Dunne and becomes Paula Wharton in every way. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed Irene Dunne in every movie I've seen and that's almost all. What a pity that most of her films have to be restored urgently. I hope that Irene Dunne's movie is restored before it's too late, that they are such treasures. Luckily that's not the case for over 21. <br /> <br /> It's a must if you like terrific plays and funny comedy serious overtones. I agree with a previous commentary on the speech "The World and the Apple Pie", it was one of the many highlights of the film. I read somewhere that Irene Dunne co-authored with director Vidor (Irene Dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life) and seems to be in her films!
