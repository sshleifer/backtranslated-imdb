I really enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of Lauren Ambrose will do that as well. Her character is much softer than her role in Six Feet Under and all performances are strong. I especially enjoyed dealing with the role of Emily, a mentally challenged scholar. Despite some other misinformed user reviews, the role of Taylor Roberts was carried out with no clich√©. Outstanding was also Fran Kranz, whose natural lightness supported the veterans of the season veterans well. Although there was a catch here or there, it seemed that the only problems were with an underdeveloped script. What might have worked well as a stage piece did not show up so well on the screen. But the beautiful camera of Paul Ryan definitely makes up for that, as does the speed of the movie, which is surprisingly slow. I recommend this movie fans of less than half a meter and also fans of good acting and cinematography.
