I've seen a couple of Fred Carpenter's films on Showtime, Pay Per View, and Video / DVD, and most of those movies have especially pleased me with a few beers favorites. I recently saw a promo DVD from "EDDIE MONROE" and everything from the cast to the story and directing went smoothly. (Doug Brown's music score was sensational.) I loved seeing Frank Sivero ("Goodfellas," "New York, New York," and "The Wedding Singer"), an astonishing and underrated actor, Paul Vario, Uncle Benny played, looked in the IMDb for his actors and found out that this was his first starring role. Where was this guy? Give Fred Carpenter the honor of discovering Great New Talent. It's just a matter of time how you will taste this guy with Pacino and DeNiro. As I mentioned earlier, Carpenter knows how to entertain and if you work on a budget, it's amazing what Carpenter can produce. MONROE "I've seen" Rocky Balboa "and" The Good Shepherd ", both great movies. "Eddie Monroe" brought me to a surprising ending because he had a very good script, good performances from the entire cast (Craig Morris is a movie star just waiting to happen, and lead actress Jessica Tsunis was hot!) And Doug Brown's Music Score As I said earlier, I have recently seen "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd." If I commented on these two films, I would say some of the same things I said about "EDDIE MONROE said the only thing that these two were very good movies have nothing in common with "Eddie Monroe", they did not cost a few hundred giants. Great movie and I have not even drunk a beer.
