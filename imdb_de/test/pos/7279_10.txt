Wow, I loved this movie, this movie was full of plot, good acting, great story and a surprising ending. To be honest, this movie was not overly bloody, but it does contain some gore, but more on the psychological side. I read it on the internet: The movie cost $ 3,000 and was shot in 8 days. Amazing!!! This is for someone who wants to think and make great movies. What begins as a terrorist thriller is slowly turning into something twisted, even sinister. I can not say much without revealing plot points that this movie exceeded my expectations
