I saw this movie today at the Phoenix Film Festival and loved it. The summary was featured in our program as "An Old Shakespearean Actress Invites His Three Children to His Suicide Party." I was not sure if I would see it, because when I read about it I liked the idea of ​​a "suicide party". It sounded very interesting to me, but the "old Shakespearean actor" worried me that the movie was friendly, dry and boring. But I decided to give it a try. I am glad that I did it. It was not dry and boring that the dialogue was great and funny, but not obtrusive and difficult to understand. Peter Falk was great in this role, he stole the show. I was also pleasantly surprised by Laura San Giacomo's performance, she usually annoys me, but I really enjoyed seeing her in this movie. I think Judge Reinhold's part could have been done better by another actor, sometimes he looked a bit cheesy and it looked like he was acting, not like watching this character. But the movie was so good that I forgave the awkwardness of an actor. I would recommend this movie to anyone and have already told some people that they should see it as soon as it's open to the public. Who would have thought that suicide could be so funny?
