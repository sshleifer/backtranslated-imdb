I'm probably a bit too old for this movie, 16, and since I'm a guy, the story is a bit too girlish, but I really thought it was a cool movie overall. All the girls in this film are such hot and really great actresses, from Alana to Adrianne to Deena to Kimberly, to the sweet girl playing Alana's little sister Rachel. I'm not a big pop star fan of the lovable songs, but I thought that Aaron Carter did a really great job here, and he seems like he's really involved in this movie. My mom liked all the older farts she grew up with, and that's cool too. I always thought that I liked a lot of people, and I wonder if I'll see them again. A sequel would be cool. I rented it, but I could buy it as well, as I have a lot of DVDs and I like to look back on something I've missed. I could not buy it from Blockbuster, so I do not know where to buy it now, but I'll take care of it. Anyway, I'm a 16 year old guy, I've already said that, I know, but I would take a date to see that. It's really good for all ages, really. I think even my little half-sister, 6 years old, could see that. That's what's so cool about it being something that any age can see. I'm sure that was deliberately done, but it really works. Girls can dream of being with Aaron Carter, and guys like me can dream about the hot girls in this movie. There is something for everybody.
