Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. When I see this movie, I feel stupid. But it's a great movie. Not very entertaining, but very fascinating. The film revolves around the wheelchair user Stephen Hawkings, a man who makes Einstein look average, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, galaxy, and black holes. Everyone comes at some point during a really intense high to a moment when they believe they have found out the universe and the cosmos, and they swear that once they are sober, they write down everything. Well, here is a man who has actually kept this feeling for more than six hours. Here is a man who, despite Lou Gehrig's illness, has become the greatest ghost the world has ever seen. Look at this and listen to how he has formulated theories about black holes. Brilliant. They will not be the same if you see it.
