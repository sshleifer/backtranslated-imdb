What can I say? I could not sleep and came across MTV. I started to see it intentionally to change channels when it got as lame as so many anti-drug movies, but I was drawn into this movie and could not stop watching. Nick Stahl has done a great job with his character and in my opinion he made the movie really worth seeing. I wanted to buy the soundtrack to the movie (or even the movie itself), and MTV.com was no help whatsoever, but I think Amazon.com is accepting the pre-orders for the release of the movie on August 5th on DVD. I know that I found it hard to track it down, and I'm sure other people might have the same problem. I buy my own copy so I can drool over Nick Stahl, while at the same time yelling my eyes thanks to the emotional action!
