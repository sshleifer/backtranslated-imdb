I never read the book, but I've always heard good things. When the movie came out, I considered seeing him but never did. Now it came out on DVD and I've been thinking about renting for a few weeks now. Last night I finally picked it up. I am very happy that I did that. <br /> <br /> In this movie the camera was amazing. The landscape etc. ... They felt like in Kabul. The drama was all very well, although I'm sure some emotions were lost in the translation. And the story itself was good and pure and uplifting. Yes, the story was very sad, but at the same time uplifting. <br /> <br /> And I'll be honest, as a white American, ... has shown me next to Kabul and Afghanistan, which I would never mind if I think about it. Show me an Afghanistan before the Taliban. Showed me a place that was beautiful. Show me a place with kindhearted people. I was a community that was like a family, except for a few thugs. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone. It's one of the best I've ever seen.
