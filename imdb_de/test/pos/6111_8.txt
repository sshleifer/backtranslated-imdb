"Pink Flamingos" was revolutionary in its day and still difficult to observe today. Not that I did not enjoy the movie, it's funny; But it is very disgusting and Jonh Waters pushes the envelope as far as possible. The story is about Babs Johnson (Devine), she's the dirtiest woman alive. She lives in a trailer with her son Crackers and her daughter Cotton. Not to mention the overweight Edie, who is obsessed with eggs and sleeps in a cradle. Then there's Connie and Raymond Marble, two dirty perverts jealous of Babs. They long to surpass her because she is the dirtiest person alive. This means that the janitor deported women and sold the babies to lesbian couples who flashed people in public and even sent Babs a shit by mail. Babs struggles to prove that she is the most confused person. This includes incest, murder and consumption of dog excrement and other ill sexual acts. A movie that is fun for the whole family. (depending on where you live?) Check out "Pink Flamingos", but do not forget your Barf bag. For more perverted, weird sex and body functions see also "Sweet Movie".
