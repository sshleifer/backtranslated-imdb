After seeing this movie, it's hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it's one of the top 250 ever, but it's a great movie in its genre. I know, not many people find it amusing to see a legendary story like "Robin Hood" turn into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things should not be laughed at ... they are wrong. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks did a great job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I've also seen the original Robin Hood movies, but I have never had such a good time seeing them as I did with this one. It's just a sequel to witty moments and parodies about famous people and movies (Winston Churchil, The Godfather ...). For those who think Robin Hood should not be confused, you're wrong, but you better not be careful because you're likely to get offended. I give this movie an 8/10.
