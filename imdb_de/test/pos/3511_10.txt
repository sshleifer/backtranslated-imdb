I saw this for the first time on net TV one afternoon in the 80's. I think I was like 9. (Picture shows a violent horror movie on regular TV these days). Anyway, I saw it again years later and it's, I remembered, a really good, scary movie. I think the reason why it might have gone unnoticed is that it did not come to an abundance of sequels; H. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and makes it better. Although this is a killer in the woods like Friday, it's more similar to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is because the film creates a certain atmosphere and a sense of anxiety even in bright daylight. And the killers feel more threatening than on Friday. There is also a lot of tension. I recommend it now to see that it will be released on DVD at the end of July.
