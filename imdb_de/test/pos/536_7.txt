Since I'm a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to watch the movie. I enjoyed every minute. It is very sincere. Throughout the film, it seemed Natalie was the mother and Susan the mother. Susan's character always made bad decisions and was burned for that. <br /> <br /> I've heard that there should be a love scene involving Natalie and some guy (he's in Outside Providence), but Natalie would only agree with the script if that scene was removed. And I think that's great. I think a love scene would have ruined the sound of the movie. <br /> <br /> Natalie must have a talent for choosing good movies because I have not seen her in a bad movie yet. Every film with Natalie Portman will undoubtedly be seen by me. <br /> <br /> A good movie. 10.7
