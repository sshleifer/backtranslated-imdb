The cast is superbly selected and balanced. This cinematography is excellent. The music is as delightful as the entire music of Burt Bacharach and fits the plot. Making a musical version of Hilton's story is a welcome change from a crude repetition. We see experienced actors who give real depth to the emotional content and meaning of each scene. I can not agree with the critics who overlooked this dazzling gem of a movie. It's a treasure of the canvas! Find it when you can - and let its magic carry you through the drudgery of everyday worries and inspire you to find your own "Lost Horizon".
