The Best Picture of 1947 also deals with anti-Semitism and is superior to Elia Kazan's GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT (the later winner of this year's Academy Awards) in virtually every department. Edmard Dmytryk's near-perfect alignment, John Paxton's concise writing, and J. Roy Hunt's expressionist lighting expert, are superbly supported by an outstanding ensemble ensemble. Although Robert Young (a carefree, methodical and very sympathetic policeman) and Robert Mitchum (who actually has the occasional funny remark) are the nominal stars of the film, it's the Oscar nominees Robert Ryan and Gloria Grahame - and Paul Kelly in the small but central role of Grahame's miserable husband - who gives the film the most memorable characteristics; Ryan proved so convincing as a murderous racist that he was eventually typographed for a while and excelled in such films as ACT OF VIOLENCE (1948), CAUGHT (1948), THE RACKET (1951), CLASH BY NIGHT (1952) , , THE NAKED TRACK (1953) and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK (1955). The film is also characterized by its atypical structure, as Ryan's "Flashback" sequence, a complete fabrication, is easily shot, while the actual truth emerges from the hazy, distorted memories of the film's real protagonist Not known beyond Not even played by the stars of the movie! In addition, CROSSFIRE should have originally treated homosexuality (like Richard Brook's original source novel "The Brick Foxhole"), but this taboo topic was unacceptable to the Hays Office at that time - far from the current situation, when (at least) 3 gay-themed films are available for this year's big Oscars on the program. <br /> <br /> The print used for Warner's DVD transfer sometimes shows regrettable signs of wear, but not the audio Commentary by noir experts James Ursini and Alain Silver is a good comment, even if I think so disagree that Dmytryk's career steadily decreased after his HUAC problems, such as THE SNIPER (1952), THE CAINE MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), THE YOUNG LIONS (1958), WARLOCK (1959) and MIRAGE (1959); 1965) prove in detail; His collaborations with RKO with producer Adrian Scott and screenwriter John Paxton - MURDER, MY SWEET (1944), CORNERED (1945, hopefully this will be part of Warner's next film noir box set) and CROSSFIRE are doing their very best. In my opinion, this film is definitely not only one of the key films of the 1940s, but also one of the best noirs ever made.
