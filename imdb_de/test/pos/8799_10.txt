Human Traffic is without doubt the most original and convincing movie I have seen in a long time. It documents two days in the life of a group of young people who are bored with their everyday life and dead-end jobs and ecstasy at raves on weekends. It is funny and extremely moving and sometimes very sad. In the same genre as 'Trainspotting' it has a great soundtrack and shows hot, young up and coming British stars. The film was made on a tiny budget and I'm looking forward to future offers from writer / director Justin Kerrigan when his talent is discovered by the great filmmakers.
