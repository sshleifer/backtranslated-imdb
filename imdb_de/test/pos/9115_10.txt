If you're like me and you bought the new Tenacious D album on the day it came out and went into the movie and got to know all the lyrics to all the songs ... then you'll definitely enjoy this movie , Yes, I'm biased as a huge Tenacious D fan, but I really liked this movie a lot, which made me giggle a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty much everything I expected. Comedian genius with great songwriting and some awesome cameos by Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. I especially liked Tim Robbins' part. <br /> <br /> However, if you are unfamiliar with the Tenacious D HBO series and the fantastic debut album, it may not have the same comic effect on you. I would still recommend that you look at this because it is still worth every penny of the ticket price and will make you smile, even if you are not in tricks all the time.
