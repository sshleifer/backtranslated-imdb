With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses, this was, in my opinion, the best series by David Jason. <br /> <br /> Right after his TV debut on 'Do not Not Your Set!' These 13 episodes showed a championship of comic timing no longer seen since the old silent movie days. In comparison, Porridge, Open All Hours and the terrible series "Lucky Man" did not come close. I think Jason banned repeating the series because it showed it on its roughest side. Shame on him. A new generation deserves to enjoy it. The series actually flopped in the ratings, but that's most likely the case because they were shown against 'The Brothers', which aired on the BBC at the same time before VCRs were common that his boring assistant Spencer was played by Mark Eden; Alan Bradley in Coronation Street. I am amazed that he did not try to assassinate Edgar Briggs !!!!
