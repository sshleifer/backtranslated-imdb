Love In Limbo is my absolute favorite movie. (Set in W.A) It's hilair and has an excellent cast, including a group of three great actors, Russell Crowe (As Arthur), when he looked hot the day he actually looked hot with short hair and no facial hair. Aden Young (Barry McJannet) and Craig Adams as Ken Riddle. Ken is a sex-obsessed high school student and is expelled for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates. He starts a new job at his uncle's clothing factory and gets close to another new man, Barry McJannet, who buys a car so they can go out and pick up chicks. They become comrades with rogue Arthur Baskin (Crowe) and the three boys drive to Kalgoorlie to defeat a brothel and lose their virginity. See, it's a classic !! I've been trying to get a DVD or soundtrack for so long. Everyone lets me know if he has them.
