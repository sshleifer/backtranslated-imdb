In 2004, I wrote the following statements in an IMDb forum when a user asked if "The Best Years of our Life" is a forgotten film: <br /> <br /> ***** For me it is like opening up to watch this movie a time capsule on. I think, in many ways, that "The Best Years of our Life" is probably one of the most intriguing character studies and looks very good as a glimpse into US life in the mid-1940s after World War II. I believe that "Coming Home" and "The Deer Hunter," both published in 1978, were the latest films that addressed the numerous issues of military returning from the war in "The Best Years of Our Life." <br /> <br /> What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many, if not all, college students applauded at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is still an eye-catcher, and I am very happy to read other posts in other posts that feel like a movie will definitely pass the test of time. ***** <br /> <br /> I am very happy that the movie was ranked close to the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI. Although it competed with a Christmas classic, it was a wonderful life. The Oscar victories of the best years of our lives, including Best Picture, were well deserved. <br /> <br /> I just saw the movie again in 2005 and after almost 60 years, The Best Years Of Our Lives is still a powerful, beautiful-looking and well-made movie.
