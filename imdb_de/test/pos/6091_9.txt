As you can read in many reviews, it is a movie you love or hate - apparently not so much room for opinions in between. I think that's a good sign. <br /> <br /> I've always loved this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (I never saw Titanic, for example). It shows how people can be different when in an exotic environment, as opposed to "home" (Katherine). It shows how destructive love can be slow, strong and extremely painful Affair, the pain of the retarded, how senseless you can feel to move on. <br /> <br /> Photography is simply mind-blowing, not to mention the actors' spectacle. The tempo is slow but up to date, and it does justice to the book, the timeline, and the depth / development of the characters. If formulated in 110 minutes (as some seem to suspect), this would amputate the complexity of this film. People are having trouble with the speed of movies ... as if they are in a hurry to get to work ... hey - make a living! ;-) Have fun ... <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4.5 out of 5.
