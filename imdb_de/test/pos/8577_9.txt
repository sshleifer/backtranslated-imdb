Personally, I think the movie is pretty good. It has almost an 8. I liked the ethnographic aspect as well as the beautiful photography. Colin Firth's character is not very likable, but he does better than good work with the role. The heroine, played by the beautiful Nia Long, is a well-known film heroine, trying to do what she considers the best child, namely to marry a respected member of her emigrant community, while retaining her magnetism for "evil." "Fight" man - one who is not a member of his community (the "outsider") .Most of the film is about this mother's struggle: should she do what is expected of her, what she considers the best for her son or should she follow her heart I do not want to reveal the end Let me just say that this is a feel-good movie, with great locations, exquisite African dress (the movie is only for the colorful African women's clothing and headgear The actor who plays Nia Long's son is bright and lovable.The plot is a bit formulaic, but the movie has I liked it anyway. If you are a Colin Firth fan, you MUST see this movie. If you like fancy stripes, you will see it. I think I'll see it again tonight!
