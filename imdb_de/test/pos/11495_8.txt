I have the feeling that Lisa Krueger is easy to miss. Personally, I found her first movie, Manny and Lo in 1996, as a wonderfully detailed character study and the performances were uniquely wonderful (with special thanks to Mary Kay Place). The movie played for a week or two in major city centers and disappeared. One or two critics really liked it, but many felt it was low. Krueger's second film, Committed, was released this year (2000) (after nearly two years of delay) and disappeared in a similar fashion. Once again, critics rejected the movie as insignificant and pushed the film aside, praising Heather Graham most, but rarely her acting skills. And again, Committed is a solid success for me. I feel Kruger has a real voice and a personal visual style, and these are characteristics that should not be easily ignored, simply because they work on a very cautious screen. The title has several meanings, but mostly it refers to the refusal of Joline (Graham) to let her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) jump out and leave her. She follows him from New York to El Paso and becomes one of the most attractive stalkers in recent film history. Her respect for her marriage promise leads her to Mexican mysticism and self-discovery. And yes, the conspiracy is just so simple and therefore easy to ignore. Joline is, of course, the crying voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate of nearly fifty percent. And for me, her personal revolution against broken promises and a legacy of deception is quite intelligent and powerful. Believing in the belief that people do not have enough faith in each other, Joline must inevitably find that their beliefs are not consistent with those of society as a whole. Her commentary has been described as one-dimensional in several commentaries, and I'm afraid that's a simplified reading of the film. Or maybe even a wrong reading. If Joline were just an innocent, she would not be interesting at all. The fact that she understands the world and refuses to play by the rules of the "normal" makes her so interesting. Sociologically it is a complete departure. Krueger sometimes gets into moments of cute dialogue, and her orientation in this film has a rather strange dependency on shots of clouds moving across the El Paso skyline. Their mistakes, however, are quite rare, and in this film, as in Manny and Lo, it is the performances that carry the day. Graham has never been better because she never had a character as perfectly tailored to her as Joline. For the first time in her career, Graham seems comfortable with playing an adult, even if he is in a somewhat restrained development. She wears the movie perfectly. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (as Jolin's brother) both have some nice moments, as do Alfonso Arau as Mexican mystic and Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo, the slightly psychotic truck driver. As in Manny and Lo, the characters are part of their environments, highly detailed, completely organic creations. These characters sometimes seem pointless, but they make sense in their context. Even Goran Visnjic, as an artist addressed by Joline's devotion, fits in strangely, even though the stranger to his character is never discussed. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a movie that looks back. Another commentator spoke here of the stereotypical Mexican representations. And again I'm tempted to call that wrong. Joline is looking for justification. She knows her commitment is out of control, but she's looking for a spiritual path that can help her understand herself. Arau's character understands that most people do not believe in him and he gives up his own belief when he sees a woman who respects him. <br /> <br /> I think I can understand how this film can be considered unimpressive. I would not agree. It's all funny, often funny, and all the characters radiate a warmth that's pretty wonderful. <br /> <br /> I'll give this one 7.5 / 10 and if I vote here then I'll do it. Get on an 8.
