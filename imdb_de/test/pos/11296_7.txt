I just picked it up in a decent, if not terrific DVD version for a dollar at Wal Mart. <br /> <br /> Get out and buy it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that this version is the short, incomplete version that was released against the wishes of the animator in the late fifties, but still it's an incredible bargain. <br /> <br /> This film was syndicated in small sections as a series to local television stations in the early '60s for the kids shows that almost every station ran on weekday afternoons - "Mr. Bill and Bozo", "Monty's Gang" ( Channel 4, Greenville SC) and "Captain Grady" (Channel 13, Asheville) NC - where I saw it). It made an impression on the twelve-year-old that I recognized it immediately when I discovered it in Wal Mart tonight and grabbed it. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. You should get it.
