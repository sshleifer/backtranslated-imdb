GUTS OF A BEAUTY is a bit better than its predecessor GUTS OF A VIRGIN. Although this movie is not really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first episode, I find that BEAUTY is a little bit stronger and better than VIRGIN ... but on the other hand that does not say much. <br /> <br /> BEAUTY starts out as a pretty rough and straightforward exploit movie. A few yakuza cats capture a young woman and begin to rape her in a rather brutal way. As this wickedness proceeds, the head boy tells the girl that they have done the same thing with her sister and sold her into slavery in Africa and that she will do the same to her. Then they shoot them with drugs and rape them even more. She somehow gets away and ends up in a clinic where the nurse hears her sobbing story. The Rapee freaks out of the stress of his previous experience and commits suicide. The clinic worker moved by the story of the young lady decides to avenge the gang by seducing one of the lower men and trying to hypnotize him to kill the Yakuza leaders. This whole plan fails, so now Mrs. Vigilante-Clinic-Worker is exposed to the same treatment that our original Rapee had received - only worse (some pretty rough rape occurs along with the necessary gang rape ...). It's also drugged, but the drug has a curious side effect on our seemingly hapless victim ----- it turns them into a raging hermaphroditic BLOOD DEMON !!! (no sh! t, this really happens !!!) This is the moment BEAUTY starts off with some great, crazy kill scenes - including a very classic rape in the chest that looks like a mixture of alien and evil Porn and my favorite - a head killed by demon vagina (complete with demon-vaginal-slime ...) that must be seen to be believed ... <br /> <br /> Definitely some promising Things in GUTS OF A BEAUTY, but still very disconnected feeling. BEAUTY almost feels like two different films are crowded together in incompatible ways. Still, I have to credit the movie - the rape scenes are very rude and misogynist, and the kill scenes are just totally off the wall. A solid 7/10 for another crazy "classic".
