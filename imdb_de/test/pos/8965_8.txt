... with one act. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson, member of the congress, a real character. In the 1990s, when Communism collapsed in the USSR, the Berlin Wall and the war against Afhganistan (with the Soviets). He did it, one refusal for money, and everything went under. He should be remembered, so here it is. His monument. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Funny, dramatic, snob, political or just boring. Anyway, it's a smart movie about political life, about world domination, and above all a lesson for the world. A lesson for any policy, a critical stance that applies to countries that support wars with money, weapons and words. <br /> <br /> Lesson Learned - The world is not a nice place to live
