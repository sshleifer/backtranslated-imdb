Alright, I'm 12 years old, and here you see the movie from the perspective of a teenager. I've also commented on Magnolia and Bicentennial Man, both great movies if you want to try it out. Okay, Here on Earth was a beautiful movie with amazing scenes and pictures that are very pleasing to the eye. The author (I do not know who it was, check IMDB) either worked very hard or appreciates love, poetry and drama. I cried four times in this movie, once more than 30 minutes. It was really sad, really nice and really meaningful. It's a great movie for anyone 11 years or older and not a fan of romantic comedy. Yes, it's romantic, yes, it's funny, but (in my opinion) it's better than "She's All That" or "Whatever It Takes." I never cry! It is a delicate story. Borrow it and record it :).
