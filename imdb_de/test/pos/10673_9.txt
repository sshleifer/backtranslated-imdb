I have fond memories of watching this visually stunning movie on Wor-TV (now Upn-9) in NY as a kid in the late '70s / early' 80s. Although a product of the swinging 60s, this film has barely aged. The effects are just as wonderful as in 2001 and in some ways superior (the model work is flawless). With an attractive cast, great color photography and stage design, and an impressive score, JTTFSOTS is a winner!
