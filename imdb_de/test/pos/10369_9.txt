As most other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of 'After The Funeral' is very good. Always one of my favorite stories of Poirot, I was afraid it might be "played around". Well, it was a bit but ONLY a bit and in the end the result was quite entertaining. David Suchet is as Poirot still almost flawless and the other star of this show is Monica Dolan, which was certainly not to be surpassed as Miss Gilchrist. I also really enjoyed Fiona Glasscott, who was just right as the cutting Rosamund Shane, but the casting was consistently impeccable! <br /> <br /> A point is cut off because the adapters can not resist stuffing too many revelations in the last fifteen minutes. The will and housekeeping business was all a bit unnecessary, though I did not mind how they tightened the structure of the Abernethie family. The last moments when the killer is revealed are really unbelievably good and I found the end quite touching as they all left Enderby. This is really one of the best of the previous Poirot series.
