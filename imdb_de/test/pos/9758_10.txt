I can not believe it's been 25 years since I saw this story on TV for the first time. I remember being touched and lucky to get the VHS band a few years ago. I saw it recently. I've been watched over and over again ever since. I must have seen it ten times in the last two weeks. <br /> <br /> The show is great, the story is convincing and I'm ashamed to say that I did not appreciate the talent of actor Bryan Brown so far. The playful facial expressions shown in the first half - when he gave Jean the stolen drug in Malaya - are such a contrast to his very low-key and nervous body languages ​​that are shown in the second half: in their first drink together in Caines and while hiking the farm. We have to wait until the wedding, especially the last dance scene, to see his open affection for Jean. The same dancing eyes that for the first time revealed his admiration in Malaya. Who would not like to be his wife Boong? <br /> <br /> As Joe turned from a cocky, almost over-life figure in the Malay jungle to a slightly self-assured average Joe in his own garden, Jean took the opposite street. Her war experience seems to have given her new confidence. She wasted no time in going what she wanted. She took steps to get what she could get, just as Joe had once told her. <br /> <br /> All these transformations show that this is more than just a love story - it's a story of growth, courage and fragility in life. The lawyer -Noel is both a sweet and a sad figure. He also gave Jean a lot - he gave his last hope for love. In the end he did what true love requires - he put his luck before his own. <br /> <br /> I found the fight between Joe and Jean, who was not in the book, very good. I thought it would be a useful and necessary complement to overcome the internal struggles that they had to deal with to make life together. Now I'm older, maybe I understand life, love and loss a little better. This story touches me even deeper. <br /> <br /> But I'm surprised to see that B. Brown has blue eyes on the promo photo on this site. He definitely did not do it in "A Town Like Alice". Well, 25 years is a long time!
