SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo? Yes, that's Elijah Wood again. <br /> <br /> Since the closing part of The Lord of the Rings, Elijah Wood has found it increasingly difficult as Frodo to break away from this lead role. Wood plays a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young Jewish American. Wood has taken every possible path to escape typing. With "Everything Is Illuminated" he would have finally achieved this. He plays a role that is not as radical as other efforts, and he really comes to the soul of his character. However, it's not that Wood does it alone. With a great adaptation of first-time director Liev Schreiber and a wonderful performance by newcomer Eugene Hutz, Wood has found a great production to spread his wings. "Everything is Illuminated" is a great, moving piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> The young American Jew Jonathan Safran Foer (Wood) travels to the Ukraine to find the mysterious girl who saved his grandfather and helped him to come to America. Arriving ashore, Jonathan meets all the talking, all dancing Alex (Hutz) and his racist grandfather (Boris Leskin). Traveling across the country, the three learn more about the history and relationships that Alex and Jonathan never knew existed. <br /> <br /> It's a weird feeling when the movie goes into its second chapter (it's actually split) in four in total). The first part, though sometimes a little funny, is usually serious and intense. So in the second part, if we get a short story about Alex and his family, it's a weird step to switch from serious to weird. It may not work out, but as the movie progresses, it definitely learns its lesson, as this mix of humor and sadness gets finer and finer over time. <br /> <br /> For the ultimate gratitude of all involved, as the story goes on, so we start to fall more and more to the characters. Elijah Wood is great, Boris Leskin is so intense and strong that questions arise why Hollywood never really noticed him. Most notable of all, however, is newcomer Eugene Hutz. Hutz plays a very restless character and is absolutely brilliant. He shows the division between his relatives and the real world with near-perfect skill, and when his character communicates with Wood, one connects to him on a deeper level. Without Hutz, the story is so strong that the movie would still be great, but with it, it reaches the next level. As a debut for the actor and director Liev Schreiber, the story is also a brilliant piece to begin with. As a passionate work (Schreiber's grandfather is himself an immigrant to America) he manages to really embrace the emotions of the content, and by presenting us with a truly beautiful landscape and great shots, he manages to really get home , Especially the last half hour is so beautifully laid out that it is a challenge for a viewer not to be in the eye of the beholder. It is a moving story, and with the help of Schreiber it becomes even more powerful. <br /> <br /> "Designed with love" by a passionate director, "Everything is Illuminated" is a beautiful piece. A slightly different road story that was wonderfully played and wonderfully written. It's a movie everyone should see, and it's the perfect way for Elijah Wood to finally put Frodo to rest.
