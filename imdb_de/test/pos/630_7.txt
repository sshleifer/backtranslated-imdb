This is undoubtedly one of my favorite horror movies of all time! I really can not believe that it did not become much more popular when it was released, especially when the main antagonists at the time were the usual Wes Craven sequels and copycat Horror Hitchcock / DePalma movie, paired with a very sharp black comedy and a great plot. It never promises to be more than a good popcorn and hot dog movie, but it's hard not to just enjoy the movie as it is. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Billie Hughes - a dumb girl working on the set of a horror movie shot in a Russian factory. Through a series of events, she is accidentally locked up and stumbles over the filming of a snuff film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the movie is the lack of screaming that seems to overcome any horror movie ever made. Because the main character is dumb, she can not make a sound - something that is a blessing in some phases of the movie and a curse in others. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have studied his Hitchcock very well. Even the opening scene is a funny nod for both Hitchcock's "Psycho" and quite generic Slasher movie scenes. <br /> <br /> Although acting can sometimes be hammy, the whole movie keeps them together. Not only do we bring along a few outstanding scenes that will take you right to the edge of the seat, but also some nice little questions at the end of the session film. <br /> <br /> All in all: a A tremendously overlooked, well-functioning and action-packed psycho-thriller that I could recommend to any desperate observer looking for anything other than the usual Freddy / Jason / Scream / Michael Myers / Damien Regurgitation hunters in Hallowe'en.
