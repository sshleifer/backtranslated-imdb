This is a good movie for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay, I'm sure it's not as good as the Child's Play movie, but that can be really fun and enjoyable, Chucky's laughter is weird. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Well, not a single doll, but two, which means double Jennifer Tilly played the role really well and definitely scored the best kill of the film It's a worthy film about your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen children's feature films before, this will be a fresh start. Of course, you have no idea how Chucky got into his current state (because I'm not telling you), but you'll find out why Chucky is so popular. <br /> <br /> All in all a very nice movie.
