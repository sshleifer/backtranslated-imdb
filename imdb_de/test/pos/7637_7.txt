"Cherry" tells of a naive, unmarried virgin who decides to have a baby, but is not sure how to proceed. This uncomplicated little sleeper is full of quirky characters and witty situational humor. Fresh, funny, mold breaking, I really enjoyed this movie ... for whatever it's worth. Recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something different.
