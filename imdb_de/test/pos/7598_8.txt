After watching this movie, I came to realize that Drew Barrymore is a great actress. This film would not have been seen without Drew. The fact that someone was as attractive as Drew really annoyed me, and she did when she was "Josie Grossie." Their attempts to "transform" the "cool" girls were very funny, especially when they danced in the nightclub. <br /> <br /> We also had SNL favorite Molly Shannon, who as Anita, Josies played a big role best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the movie was Anita, who was trying to teach sex to the class. This was one of Molly's funniest and best performances. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski also had a great role and I really felt for her because I know people like her were so tortured. <br /> <br /> This film is a must for Drew Barrymore fans because Drew makes the movie.
