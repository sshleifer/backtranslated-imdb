Long ago and far away you knew how to make a musical, and "Cover Girl" is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> A story about a dancer in a nightclub who becomes a cover girl and becomes famous. Here is the old adage: luck and fame do not mix. <br /> <br /> The dance routines are wonderfully choreographed. What is the dance and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly? <br /> <br /> Otto Kruger is the older gentleman who discovers Hayworth when he sees her picture showing a strong resemblance to the woman who left him at the Hayworth Gang. Grandmother Maribel. A jealous reaction from Kelly drives Rusty (Hayworth) into the arms of Broadway producer Lee Bowman. <br /> <br /> The picture is basically the story that repeats itself in the end. <br /> To make this movie even more beautiful, there's the always wise cracking Eve Arden and the funny Phil Silvers, who is called Genius in the movie.
