I've read about 10 reviews for this film, but none of them "taken to heart". Harrison Ford is criticized for everything from his haircut to his earring, and I really do not see what these things are about the movie. As I recall, he had bad hair and bad reviews in Blade Runner, but he is still a favorite among us videophiles. It's slower than most of his previous films, but does not deserve the trash it's received. <br /> <br /> I would like to pay $ 7.50 just to watch a smooth Harrison Ford mowing its lawn.
