I'm doing a thesis on the blurring of boundaries: the female crossdresser using Tipping the Velvet the Book as the main text, comments on gender and sexual identity, gender and sexual confusion, gender as performance, gender as fiction, gender images, crossdressing as erotic fantasy and as a revolution, the effect of the male costume, etc. would be greatly appreciated! But a little aside, Sergio Toledo saw the 1987 film Vera? It's about a young lesbian, possibly transsexual, crossdresser .. I really want to see it because I think it would be really helpful. Does anyone know where I can get a copy of it? I tried Amazon and a few other sites, but no luck ...
