Ahhhh, 1984 ... I was young and stupid and just developed a taste for these exotic cigarettes while living in Manchester in Moss Side in an occupied residential area, with the most incredible case of cockroach infestation. <br /> <br /> After some of these doobies this show was ROTFLMAO material - I was an avid fan. Then I look at the floor (or on the walls or just anywhere) and see my own collection of "little armadillos" that are frolicking. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it's the chemical improvement, but I remember thinking at the time that the show's apparent surrealism was fantastic - it was my second favorite thing on TV at the time (# 1 was the season of Luis Bunuel films shown by Channel 4). Radical art lives on! <br /> <br /> You also have to listen to this topic! .... I swear I will never drink more ....
