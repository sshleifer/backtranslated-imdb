I voted only excellent because this movie has taken two snapshots of Americana: one 1970 and one for every year thereafter. <br /> <br /> Nothing has really changed. <br /> <br /> Joe is actually an idiot, a stupid fool who is mad at all the other people in the world because he has his own idiocy. This is not really a spoiler, but the key to this movie is the big, never-corrupt man who befriends this half-troglodyte Joe, and he gets some sort of affirmation of his bigotry and stupidity of feeling wronged , <br /> <br /> Still, few would claim that the dealer friend deserved to die. And these kids should not have pulled off Joe and Compton. And Joe and Compton actually got into the hash and the young skin until they were torn off. A simple movie in many ways, except that in 1970 New York City was made a battle zone thanks to the care of Nixon and all the money flowing into the war in Vietnam. As I write this (25/02/2007), Netflix has a "very long wait" for this movie - which makes me happy because I believe there are people who want to learn. This was a pretty good snapshot - not exact, a bit of a cartoonist - but actually pretty close to the time. And the scary thing is that things have not changed that much. Sure, there is no longer any sense of well-being, but that just means that wage slavery has prevailed. <br /> <br /> Amazing how millionaires complain about not making enough money. Then they complain that $ 5.15 per hour is too much to pay their people.
