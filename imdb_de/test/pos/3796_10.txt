I rarely write reviews, but this movie just requires more attention than it gets, as it contains the hysterical kidnapping weirdly filmed in a wrong sequence. <br /> <br /> I only saw this once and thought it was the funniest movie I've ever had the privilege of watching. I laughed from beginning to end. It's a shame that it does not appear on DVD or video. <br /> <br /> You can only compare cinematography with It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or Promise Her Anything. Only this action is not nearly as complex as Mad World. <br /> <br /> I hope the movie will be released in the near future, as it would be a shame to lose such a comedy gem among the degs we have today.
