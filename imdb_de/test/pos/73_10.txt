Yes, I'm a kind of romantic who likes musicals and comedy and that fits. Julie Andrews gives a fascinating performance with the production number "Whistling in the Dark" at the beginning and at the end of this film. The seductive number she plays in the middle of the story, when she thinks Rock Hudson saw a dance / call girl, is breathtaking and will surely make you giggle. <br /> <br /> I just wish that this movie would be on video or DVD, as I would surely buy it for my home library!
