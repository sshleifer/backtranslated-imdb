It does not surprise me that this short (91 minute) b / w film made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period of "ottepel" or "thaw" has gained so much love and admiration among the Germans movie lovers around the world. It's great and filmed beautifully. Some scenes feel far ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematographic work and creative discoveries were incorporated into the textbooks and largely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love, destroyed by a merciless war, but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman. It is also the film about loyalty, memories and the ability to live when it seems there is nothing to live for; It's about forgiveness and hope. The film received (absolutely rightly) the Grand Prix of the Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was honored in Cannes as a special prize because she played Veronika, the young girl who was in love with the best man in the world movie earlier this year. After separating from her lover, who went to the front, the loss of her family during the bombing and the marriage with the man she had never loved and wished he would never exist, she turned to the shadow of herself and became inwardly dead. Her long journey to salvation, finally accepting her lover's death and learning how to live with it, is mesmerizing and heartbreaking, leaving no one indifferent. <br /> <br /> For me, the film is very personal and nice because I was born and grew up in the city where his characters lived and were so happy in the beginning. I walked through the same streets, squares and bridges across the Moskva River. Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one, but often more than one, family member through a fight or concentration camp or ghetto or through starvation, cold and illness during World War II, and my family is no exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healed the pain of loss, not just from the movies and the books. "Cranes are Flying" speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me deeply. It's a masterpiece of filmmaking, but it's part of my life - my background, my memory and my past.
