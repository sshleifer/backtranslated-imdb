Hayao Miyazaki has captured the imagination of young and old around the world. His latest cinematic artwork is "Ponyo," a fairy tale for children borrowing story elements from The Little Mermaid. Like other Miyazaki classics like "Spirited Away" and his last movie "Howl's Moving Castle", "Ponyo" is full of creativity that can only really be appreciated by adults, but this is clearly more of a children's story than these recent efforts. It is a magical story that is best described as beautiful and gracious. It aims for charm rather than conflict. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" is the story of a bug-eyed, childlike-looking fish of the same name, the daughter of an underwater wizard, who is longing to escape the sea and become a little girl. If she does, she quickly makes friends with a boy named Sosuke. In doing so, she gains strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea, and a huge storm drowns most of the cliff city where Sosuke lives with his mother and threatens to end the world /> <br /> Like "Howl's Moving Castle," Walt Disney recorded "Ponyo" for an American release and discussed it with an impressive selection of Western voices, selecting even the youngest siblings of the Disney band, Jonas Brothers (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (younger sister Noah) to Sosuke and Ponyo. Also in the group are Liam Neeson (Fujimoto, Ponyo's dad), Tina Fey (Lisa, Sosuke's mother), Matt Damon (Sosuke's father), Cate Blanchett (Ponyo's sea goddess mother), and a trio of funny older women played by Betty White hear. Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. The efforts are definitely there to make this film attractive to the American public and Disney is getting closer. <br /> <br /> But voices are of little importance in a Miyazaki film focused solely on visual creativity. A fan of transformations and animating fluid and fluid movements that create a fairy tale that is partially submerged must have been a pleasure for Miyazaki to work with, and perhaps even his entire motivation to choose this story. Highlights include water droplets that Fujimoto sends to Ponyo, who are moving like living waves, as well as a host of other great sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes making "Ponyo" a real highlight like any other Miyazaki movie. <br /> <br /> As a children's story, however, "Ponyo" focuses on being enchanting. The discovery of the true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is heartwarming, even though Noah Cyrus cries childishly when Ponyo excitedly embraces human life, this can get a little annoying. But as charming as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are, there is so little antagonism or danger. Past Miyazaki films have clear rogues, but the conflict in "Ponyo" actually shrinks with the story. Sosuke thinks he once lost his mother, and in the background is the idea that the world is getting out of hand, and that people should be ashamed of polluting the sea, but "ponyo" is mostly stress-free. Most blatantly, the climax is uneventful, though all the characters are sympathetic overall. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" will surely satisfy the fans of Miyazaki in every way with his imagination, and newcomers will still be thrilled with his simple but visual impression of ambitious storytelling, but this is clearly more a children's film, Best for families and others who love fantasy, regardless of their form or target audience. It's not exactly what you'd expect from Miyazaki, given his recent work, but it's certainly another of his beloved stories. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
