The film version of the Ruth Gordon game, which performed her experiences while trying to keep the marriage to Garson Kanin after he went to church, gives Irene Dunne over 21 one of her better later roles on the big screen. It also agrees with America's sense of awakening at that time that we would not mess up peace as we did in World War I and set the seeds for another global conflict. <br /> <br /> The play Ruth Gordon wrote and played in 1944 for 221 performances on Broadway and was simply confined to the bungalow that Gordon and Harvey Stephens, who had the male lead, had on a training basis. Looking at the list of Broadway credits, it is said that the production of George S. Kaufman was "staged" rather than directed by him. I am not sure about the distinction, but I can imagine that with a joke and as strong will as Kaufman, it must have been an interesting time to put together the production before the opening night screen rights, Sidney Buchman had some Do extensive script reconstructions to move the action beyond the bungalow. The film shows few traces of its stage origins. <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the husband and Charles Coburn the employer of Dunne and Knox, who are writers. Knox not only completed an editor, but also a columnist. His words and thoughts help sell the paper, and Coburn is in trouble. But Knox believes he must go to war, the crucial event of his time, to speak authoritatively about the kind of post-war world he wants. This was not an unusual topic in these years. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne has some good comic moments like she used to when she performed alongside Cary Grant. In fact, Garson Kanin directed both in My Favorite Wife a few years ago. Coburn is his usual old water buffalo of a boss, who finally has a good heart. Over 21 was an optimistic picture that was sad to say what the Allies and I all could bring to the peace conferences to create a better world. Hopefully a new generation will do it right.
