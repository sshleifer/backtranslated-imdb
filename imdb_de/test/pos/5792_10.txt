This film was groundbreaking in the former Soviet Union, because it was the first movie to be released there and contained a real sex scene. However, the film can be regarded as magnificent for many reasons, not least because of its true, bleak portrayal of disillusionment and pain in the family of a Soviet working-class family. I would definitely recommend it.
