... and usually I do not like surprises !! Watch this movie by chance at a motel in South Africa. The second week of a three-month motorcycle holiday in ZA. Apart from the fact that I shot and acted well, it helped me to understand the problems of the countries enormously. I was watching the "Million Dollar Baby" and had to visit Hillary Swank because the name sounded familiar and her acting was great. Did not know that she was the lawyer in the "Red Dust". Well, I do not have to worry that she will disappear from Clint sooner than so many other buddies. Now I'm asked to write ten full comment lines, which is pretty ridiculous because I wrote what I wanted to write. Ok, here it goes: I think if you come from a western country, especially from Europe, watching it will help you understand a little bit better why what happens there happens. That will hopefully fill ten lines.
