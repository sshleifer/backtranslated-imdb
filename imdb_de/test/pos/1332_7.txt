Soderbergh is a fantastic director, but nothing he could conjure could beat the amazing cast he garnered for this climax of the sequels. Obviously he knew that from the beginning. The term "star vehicle" is traditionally used to refer to a movie that builds around a star. What makes this movie is a whole herd of Hollywood hot shots and makes them shine even brighter than before. The last scene says it all - all stars are sitting around, NOTHING happens and NOTHING is said. We're just beginning to socialize her as if it were a scene from a reality show where George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Don Cheadle just hang out and are themselves. So the story is not important at all - at least the biggest joys of the movies do not come from it. If you want a clever robbery movie, you'd better stick to 11. However, if you're touched by staring, this will set your day.
