Friz Freleng's All Abir-r-d is one of the best New Year's Eve and Tweety cartoons. Unlike the series of repetitive cartoons that simply transplant the same tired gags into a new environment, "All Abir-r-r-d" makes the most of its concept. Tweety and Sylvester are pets that are sent unattended by train across the country. Sylvester has stopped working with an attentive officer and a vicious bulldog. The New Year's Eve and Tweety cartoons have always benefited from a few additional participants, and "All Abir-r-r-d" is a good example of how much these extra characters help. Although they are not particularly memorable creations, they throw some more obstacles in the way of Sylvester and make for a more interesting fight. This early New Year's Eve and Tweety push many of the right buttons, and though Tweety is often particularly irritating with his forced cuteness, there are some deliciously violent antics between New Year's Eve and the dog that culminate in a surprisingly brutal climax that unfortunately interferes with a recent calamity becomes Non-Quip by Tweety.
