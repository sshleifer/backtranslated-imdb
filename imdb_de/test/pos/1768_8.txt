I suppose the good things in life are as good as any other, I suppose, but until five years ago the opera was not suitable for my entertainment selection. Oh, I've made a few attempts to find out what the turmoil is all about. I had seen several television productions - especially parts of Wagner's Ring Cycle - on public television and hoped to understand the fascination of others for the art form. And I knew I might like parts of different operas (I remember being surprised when I was a child that I really liked the excerpts from "Madame Butterfly" in "My Geisha" and I liked the opera scenes in "Moonstruck" and "Pretty Woman "enjoyed). But unlike the characters in these movies, I simply did not "understand" it. Then in 1995 I saw a live performance of "Rigoletto" presented by the New York City Opera Company. I "understood" it. What a wonderful, glorious game of color and music and raw emotion! And I mean emotion with a big E! The key, I think, is that operatic music allows performers to act freely and credibly in a way that would seem stupid if their words were only spoken: of course, everything depends on the music, and if the music magical is, as in "Rigoletto", an opera can be a great entertainment / <br /> A sympathetic family member gave me a laserdisc copy of the 1982 television production of the opera, and I've found that I do not see a live perfom Can be regularly played live by "Rigoletto", this video version is a good substitute. Luciano Pavarotti is perfect for the Duke. Ingvar Wixell is excellent as his common jester Rigoletto; and Rigoletto's beloved daughter Gilda is played by the somewhat inconspicuous Edita Gruberova. The sets and costumes are elaborate, and filming on the late-film River gives the story a sense of drama that would never be found on stage. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen "Rigoletto" or if you think you dislike or understand the opera, I ask you to find it on videotape and to buy it or to rent. If you do not like it, if you can not gauge the power of the opera's art form with this production of "Rigoletto", then just give it up and move on to something else. But I suppose, if you're new to the opera like me, you'll be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Bill Anderson
