With "Anatomy" the German film producers tried to create something completely new. Usually there are only drama or comedy films - in the horror genre is (or was) completely new at the time. <br /> <br /> The story is also new and shocking. Franka Potente plays her role brilliantly and I bet you will not find out who the killer is. It is possible, but difficult. A really great movie with many talented actors.
