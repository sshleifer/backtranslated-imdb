I'm a college student and I bought this movie in a second-hand bookstore because it sounded very strange in the last description. Nothing would prepare me for the FUNNY FILM of all time! <br /> <br /> It is especially good to watch if you are an atheist, like me. Because then you can see how stupid these Christians are. They seem to believe that unbelievers live in really disgusting, messy houses and do nothing but drink beer and be mean to the neighbors. It's a LACHER RIOT! <br /> <br /> My mates and I look at each other every few weeks so that we can talk beyond our wildest imaginations! Watch this movie NOW! <br /> <br /> Let's hope that Rich Christiano does even more of these films to entertain pagans!
