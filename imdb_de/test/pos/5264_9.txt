This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy. One is a leader who reevaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year. The other is a Playboy who is tired of digging gold for young women, looking for a relationship with a vital, mature woman. If you have silver in your hair and / or romance in your heart, make the popcorn in the microwave, curl up with your honey and prepare for a feast.
