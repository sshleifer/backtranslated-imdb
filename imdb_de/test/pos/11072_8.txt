I lived in this area for about ten years (Hoboken and Jersey City). This film certainly captures the feeling of time and place. The dialogue is very good, the music is right and the scenarios are realistic. As said in another poster, it almost looks like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I like the way she humanizes these children, who were more likely to have been born in Westchester, but fall into the trap of falling in love with children. It's just that the area is pretty rough. <br /> <br /> They pretty much demonize the bulls, but that's to be expected. I would say that acting is also good all round. <br /> <br /> It gives the viewer a sense of how this idiocy is evoked and is out of proportion. Hopefully, the new mayor of Newark will make progress.
