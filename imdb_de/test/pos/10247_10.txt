Some people call "Cooley High" the same as "American Graffiti," but I would not do it. First of all, all were white in "AG", while in "CH" all are black. Also, this one has a Motown soundtrack. In particular, the film focuses on several working-class African American students in Chicago in 1964 and their antics. The film is mainly about private life and relationships. In their apartments we see that there is never a father around. But these young men always know how to live life to the fullest. <br /> <br /> One thing that truly distinguishes this movie from most other black people's portrayals is that the teenagers in this film are portrayed as very responsible and unsettling about missing school. Two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene and the one white in the movie. But the main star is the soundtrack. It's really one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have it on vinyl at home). A classic in the truest sense of the word.
