The film can certainly be a narrative medium, but it is by no means the ideal medium. Literature best carries an action because the reader can provide the necessary imagination to complete the structure. Film is best appreciated when viewed as it is: a series of images grouped together. What Soderbergh does in Ocean's Twelve is a combination of impeccable film technology and the flowing form of American films from the 1970s. After looking at the comments that were posted recently, most people expected a standard Heist movie, a la Entrapment; It seems that people miss the annoying stereotypes of romance that are disguised as a tension between the leads and ridiculous plot twists to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh's directorial talent is the only reason to see this movie, but close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones, which are forty feet high on the screen, do not hurt either. A real treat for those who love the flickering of the lights on the screen, and a disappointment for those who try to do something that is not the case.
