This sitcom was a big crowd puller in the years 1984-1985. At that time, people in the crowded Indian cities always saw abandoned streets when there was a sitcom on the Indian TV screens. All of this was the result of the establishment of television relay stations throughout the Indian nation. This was one of the key elements of the modernization of the Indian television network strategy, which was adopted by Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. She was also continued by her son Rajiv Gandhi. This series provided clean entertainment that saw a large majority of Indian television audiences on their black and white televisions. A funny thing about this series is that it was sponsored by an indigenous company that trades in ayurvedic products. A few days ago I saw some episodes of this series, but the general laugh equation was missing. This further proves that with the ever-changing amount of time, entertainment material may lose its charm and hold people's minds.
