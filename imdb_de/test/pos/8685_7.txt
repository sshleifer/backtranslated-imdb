The comment by algernon4, Ms. Paget's "ultra lovd dance in this film is the most erotic in the history of the film", is certainly an exaggeration. It's not even Debra Paget's most erotic dance. Their naked movements in Fritz Lang's "The Indian Tomb" make this number decidedly tame. As the most erotic in the history of dance. Well! Where should I start? Salma Hayek's performance as Santanico Pandemonium in "From Dusk to Dawn" (1996); Jamie Lee Curtis in "True Lies" (1994); Jessica Alba in "Sin City" (2005); Rose McGowan in "Terror Planet" (2007); Sheila Kelley in "Dancing at the Blue Iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I love the sequence and have included it in my "Cheesecake Dance" series on Youtube. I just think that the claim to be "erotic in the history of the movie" is really fragile.
