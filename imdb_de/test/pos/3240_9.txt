I got this movie with my BBC "Jane Austen Collection" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and did not like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen films: sane common sense. The nightmare scene, in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers, was particularly annoying. <br /> <br /> I still do not like looking at the fingernail scene, but I love to hear Mrs. R. dreamily as she sews, "My only acquaintance ... tore my dress." This movie is now my current Austen favorite. I have seen it 7 or 8 times so far. Acting is incredible for me. I notice good acting when I look up from everything I do (sewing, though not with my fingers, hopefully stitching together or boondoggling or whatever) to see how the character delivers his lines. It is the turn of expression, the attitude of attitude that brings the words to life - that makes good acting in my view. <br /> <br /> Well, I watch almost every part of "Northanger Abbey" because almost all actors with such a charisma play their roles. Peter Firth is astonishing as Mr. Tilney, the perfect blend of Bathian Fop and real, male hero - you're not sure if he's after Catherine's money or not. I love his (Welsh) accent. Mr and Mrs Richards are charming: the combination of their behaviors - in particular the high voice of Mr Richards, which gives a counterpoint to his wit and wisdom - makes them so real. Fascinating is General Tilney as the hard-hearted father who may be a murderer. And Captain Tilney, the grinning rake that enjoys himself so much ... and the greedy sister and brother whose name I can not remember right now - the two are so perfect, suddenly smart and dingy. <br /> <br /> The other reason I love this accommodation is that it is the most romantic of all Jane Austen accommodations. I know that this was one of Austen's weak points (well, that's for me): Although all her novels are love stories, it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are truly in love in the end. And if they are not really in love, what's the point? All the other adjustments I've seen (except the first one from Olivier / Garson) have pretty cold fish kisses in the end, if they kiss at all. I do not like sex in movies at all, but it's really necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end. And the final kiss in Northanger is a fool. <br /> <br /> The exaggerated approach to costumes, music and lighting works very well in my opinion. And the script is extremely clever - the way we get into gothic romance, highlife in Bath, Cathy's normal land education, etc., is very well done, as is common in BBC productions. I also like the part when the little black side makes the cartwheels. I think the Marchionesse was an absolutely appropriate and very clever instrument. Some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen was planning to do in Northanger Abbey - she thought she was having fun with Gothic romance, not promoting it. But I do not think she wanted to give up "Mysteries of Udolpho" and so on. It only expressed the point that you have to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney censures Catherine in his mother's room. Besides, General Tilney was a villain, albeit a prosaic one. This point should be determined.
