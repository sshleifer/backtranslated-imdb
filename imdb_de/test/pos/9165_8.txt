The Italian concept of "sprezzatura" was the grace and nonchalance in the social way that led to success in love, as described in the 16th century "The Courtier" manual. The film "Hitch" is worth seeing for the embodiment of the "Sprezzzatura" concept in the dynamic performance of Will Smith. Smith plays the character of Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a professional dating consultant to those who have little luck and confidence. The best scenes are when Hitch accompanies the painfully timid and malicious Albert in his search for the heart of a New York celebrity and in Hitch's own allure to Sara and a surprise for her on Ellis Island. In these scenes, Smith is supported with good work by Kevin James and Eva Mendes. However, this movie is fueled by Smith's charm and persuasive personality. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, Smith rises above the average comic script, making "Hitch" a highly observable and entertaining movie. I do not think there is another actor today who is able to deliver the charisma and perfect timing with comic moments like Will Smith in this movie. And his secret lies in the "Sprezzatura"!
