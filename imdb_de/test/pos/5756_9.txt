Okay, this may not be the most demanding movie you'll ever see. In fact, there is not a bit of "sophistication" * in it. It's pueril, youthful, unobtrusive, idiotic. And weird. Basically, Richie and Eddie run the worst hotel in the UK. Come to some ridiculous antics with the guests as they beat each other up. Try to pay the rent to the only dweller stupid enough to stay. And fall in love with the beautiful actress who comes to escape the press. Try it if you are a fan of Rik and Ade and their work. If not ... Do not understand the movie. It's that simple. <br /> <br /> * I'm not fat, this is a word from another of Rik's fantastic jumps in the movie world ^ _ ^
