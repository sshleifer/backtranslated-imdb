Teen Deviyaan is a great movie. A very airy entertainer and a very modern movie for his time in the 1960s. The music and songs are great, though the lyrics of Majrooh are meaningless in places. Dev Anand is a huge star and will live up to his role as usual. Kalpana is sexy and Nanda is fine. Simi is fine too. The film has a grandiose dialogue by Vrajendra Gaur, who has written most of Dev Anand's films, including Mahal, Duniya, Warrant, Jaali Note, Manzil, etc. - Mod Kalpana, Simi, and homey Nanda. He finally chooses Nanda. The story is about OK, but it was narrated in an enthralling way and the dialogue and the songs as well as the great Dev Anand are the highlight of the film. A must for fans of Dev Anand.
