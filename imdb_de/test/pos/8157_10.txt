Outstanding performance by Mary KAy Place, Steve Sandvoss, Jacqueline Bissett and Rebekah Johnson. A great story that immerses you in the movie, emotionally yet carefree. I own this movie and everyone I share it with loves him. Great for mixed companies with at least 18 spectators. <br /> <br /> Nice production, no cheap budget, well organized and takes care of your interest. Uses newer ideas for flashbacks, flashbacks, and holds the viewer at a point on the edge of his seat. <br /> <br /> No matter which area of ​​life a viewer comes from, he will opt for one or more shopping attitudes in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a sequel!
