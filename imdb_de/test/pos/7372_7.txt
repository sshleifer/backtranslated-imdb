"Campfire Tales" basically consists of three spooky stories told by a group of friends following a car accident in the forest after a concert. The film starts with the classic "Hook" story, and then we are introduced to the group of friends who go home from the concert. They crash their car, extinguish torches, and light a fire in a small, abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire. To pass the time, they decide to tell classic horror stories, from terrorized honeymooners, a girl who falls victim to a predator on the Internet, and a motorist who seeks refuge in a haunted house. As they tell the weird stories, every story becomes more and more frightening, but the real shock that awaits them is yet to come ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the last story they tell is probably the one scariest and had some real, terrifying effects. The first story was fine and the motorhome sequence at the end was a bit scary. The second story has created a lot of excitement, more than the others, but it was the fate of the natives, the downfall. I remember seeing this movie a long time ago when I was eight years old at HBO and the third story made that shit out of me, even though it's not scary to me now. You'll probably spot some of the cast here, especially Amy Smart from the first hook-interlude story, and Christine Taylor as one of the leading actresses in the movie. The twist end was also kind of interesting, I knew I did not see it coming, I thought everything was well put together. <br /> <br /> To sum up, if you're looking for a horror movie, well, rent this, you should be happy. It's a great anthology of some of the city's classic legends, and the whole movie has been neatly linked. It is much better than what you would expect. 10.7.
