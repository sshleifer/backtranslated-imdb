Words alone can not describe the beauty and power of this film. <br /> <br /> Think of "Toy Story". Now think of "Toy Story", around 1934. Now imagine that the animation looks realistic, as if it were fluid. Do not imagine the movie as something adults and children can enjoy, but imagine it as a film noire. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to do something like that as early as 1934. Somehow delivers "The Mascot". In a story where toys come to life and one tries to deliver an orange to their sick owner, Starewicz delivers a totally unexpected level of animation. It's so fluid that you'll wonder for a long time whether you really see stop-motion animations. <br /> <br /> When comparing "Toy Story" and "The Mascot", the plot is a pointless exercise: while "Toy Story" is a kid's story adults can enjoy, "The Mascot" a dark, chilling experience for adults. That means NO, your kids will not like it. A little bit. <br /> <br /> Get it if you can. You may find it next to "Vampyr" in DVD and LaserDisc. And let yourself be surprised what Starewicz could do with a few puppets in 1934.
