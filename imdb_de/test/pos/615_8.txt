In Francois Ozone's "Robe d'Ete" there is no boring moment. It's surprising how much this short film is. As she leans back on a deserted beach after a nude bath, a young girl is approached by a girl looking for a fire for her cigarette. She invites him to love himself in a forest area near the beach. On the return to the beach. They find that all his clothes have been stolen. She lends him a summer dress to cover his nudity, and asks him to return it the next day. He rides his bike back to the holiday cottage dressed as a girl. His gay companion is sexually excited. The next morning, the young man returns to the sea and says goodbye to the girl whose vacation is over. She suggests keeping the dress as a memento of her summer romance. It's a light-hearted movie that captures the spirit of summer vacations by the sea, but perhaps not for those who are ashamed of nudity or homosexuality.
