Sherlock Holmes films from the classic Universal era tend to vary in quality. This range goes from very good to above average, with none of their results being disgusting or amazingly brilliant. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon are well in the middle ground and, as always, it's an enjoyable experience that fans of the show like me will enjoy. This film sees Holmes in the middle of a WWII attack on the evil Nazis stealing the invention of a Swiss scientist, which could prove to be a key element on the battlefield. The World War 2 Sherlock Holmes' films are generally not as good as those of The Scarlet Claw, in which Holmes conducts private investigations, as they are usually followed by too much propaganda or a conspiracy more likely to be involved with the film Doing is war as the mystery. However, this film remains far removed from both and through the focus on Holmes and his investigation, the film works much better. Perhaps Universal has seen what has collapsed the previous Voice of Terror, thereby changing focus. Basil Rathbone once again delivers an outstanding Maverick performance as Ace-Detective and Nigel Bruce does not matter, it's nice to see him when he does. The two did not spend much time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best features of Holmes films. However, this gives Holmes more time to show off in various disguises, which is always a lot of fun. Dennis Hoey's Lestrade is definitely my favorite among the secondary characters, and although he is not as funny as usual; His facial expressions are great and his presence underscores how great Holmes is. His scene with Watson in a car dropping color on the street is my favorite moment of the movie. It's nice to see Holmes' nemesis, Professor Moriarty, come back, even if it looks like he's just been dumped to hell. The performance of Lionel Atwill is not as good as George Zucco's in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, as he never really convinces that he is indeed a brilliant mind. But it's fun to hear him with the protagonist, and it's nice to see him in the movie to make up for World War II issues that are never as interesting as Holmes. The movie begins more as a thriller than a mystery movie; But once it starts, it's hard to crush it, and this is a more than solid entry into Universal's work.
