Animated shorts just do not get any better than this wonderful Canadian movie. This short feature is full of Canadian references and therefore this movie is probably prized above all by Canadians. But the basic story is universal and is lovingly narrated by writer Roch Carrier. It's a funny story that I knew at some point, and recently I was fortunate enough to see it again so I just had to write a heartfelt recommendation for it. This is a masterpiece and a must, whether you are Canadian or not.
