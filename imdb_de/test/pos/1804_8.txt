Valley Girl is an exceptionally well-made movie with a great cast. Although the dialogue is now somewhat outdated, the film was very popular in the publication. To this day I know many people (including teenagers) who can not form a sentence without using the word "how". This is undoubtedly the legacy that this film will leave behind. A rating of 8 was awarded for this excellent film.
