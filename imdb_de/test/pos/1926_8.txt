"Ideas are dangerous." Comment by an interview partner. <br /> <br /> DVD rating: B + / 4 of 5/8 of 10 / Worth the time. <br /> <br /> A great story for adults / or youthful boaters not for kids None of the stupid violent crimes Hollywood has so often considered "quality work" these days. And it can be used as a trainer movie about what a proper boat preparation is or not before "the seven seas are sailed". The movie begins a bit slow to develop the story like most documentary films, but when he pulls the viewer into the saga, the emotions in the head seep away! The emotions include anger, sadness and unbelief. The era: late 1960s. <br /> <br /> That solo sailing around the world is dangerous is not surprising. Surprising are all twists that viewers would not expect. It's not your average group of guys in a sailing race! Each boat was different than the racing rules allowed. Each solo sailor had different abilities, as the racing rules allow. Among them were well-known sailors and a few lesser known ones. One was considered a Mystery Man because no one knew about his abilities. Each boat was allowed to leave at will, as long as they were all on the way. And of course that was before modern electronics that allow boaters to communicate with land about malicious storms and so on. <br /> <br /> Actual video and audio recordings are interspersed with interviews with family members and others. The mood of the interviewees is always gloomy despite the past years. <br /> <br /> The main character, Don, is the center of attention and how his journey is related to those he did not just want to beat but because of the circumstances of his own creation. He had to win. In the story, it was about what this circumstance had to do with his life, when he moved alone on the water southwest over the Atlantic Ocean for many years. <br /> <br /> Do not let the "peculiarities" of the "special features" of the DVD when the movie is done. The entire saga is not completely understood without looking at the bonus stuff. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you've looked at everything on the DVD, you'll probably just shake your head and shout: 'Impressive.' And remember, THIS is why the story has survived over the past 40 years. SPOILER: Do not forget to watch the "special features" of the DVD when the movie is done. A sailor who had returned to England after circumnavigating the globe decided on the fly, no, he would turn another round, and the film records his husband's views on this decision. The opposite story unfolds while another sailor wishes the race allowed two on board so he could take his wife with them and their photos demonstrate a very cordial connection between them. The interview with an ex-paratrooper from Burley, who had actually taken a boat over the Atlantic ROWED with a friend before the solo sailing race, was incredibly funny as he described that he did not even know how to sail, and that the bad things that happened to him were normal. 'Too many people believe that sailing on the open sea can be a romantic adventure without mishap. Do not be one!
