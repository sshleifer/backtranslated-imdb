This movie reminds me of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'Garden State', not because of the content, but because it's one of those movies that you do not hear about except through word of mouth or through the back of the DVD in the video store and think "why not". Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised (like the movies above) how good it was and how much I enjoyed it. Also best seen with someone or if you know someone who has seen it - would you like to talk about it! It's a beautiful movie that stays with you after you look at it. It's also a smart watch that requires little effort to find parts for yourself. <br /> <br /> Just enjoy :)
