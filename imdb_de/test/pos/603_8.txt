You know, it's very interesting to see that ... half of the people involved are dead now ... <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I saw it all have what Muppet has to do with it, but this stuff is pure gold. I'm a big fan of word games, and this movie has pretty well placed them, but one of the most amazing aspects of it is the tempo: it's not really fast tempo for kids where the filmmakers just happen to decide to move the story without delay The depth of the character is increased, it only moves along with the characters where they want. <br /> <br /> Kermit the frog is just a fantastic character. His voice and expression on his puppet face are fantastic. Above all, he points out why he is so popular - "he can also sing and joke!" - but better suited to why he is so adorable - he inspires everyone without effort to search for his dreams. In the meantime, he also has to deal with himself, which is an unusual topic in family films. <br /> <br /> It also contains a whole ensemble of comedians performing here and there, some with great effects, others with a little less (I think Mel Brooks part was just a little over the top, right?). Some parts of the movie are kind of strange. However, it is very resourceful and leads from a completely different direction to the same destination. <br /> <br /> Right along ... <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
