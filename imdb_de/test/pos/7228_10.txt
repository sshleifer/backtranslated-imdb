Wow, this movie is incredible. It's such an excellent movie. Has some sick scenes (not nearly as sick as Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie), some nudity, and this was the movie debut of the Penismonster! This has defined the scene for many of Troma's movies, this is a very Tromatic movie. It mixes comedy, romance and my favorite, HORROR / GORE! Not so much blood in this movie, but enough to please. This is the best adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Much better than any other version. They make it so entertaining and fun to watch. And we have Debbie Rochon ... hehe ... I like her. :) All I have to say is that this is a great movie, very funny and Lemmy is a good moderator for that. The acting is good and Kaufman conducts as always stylish. Must see for all TROMA-FANS!
