This is undoubtedly one of the funniest and most entertaining films I've ever seen. I really enjoyed the characters in the movie. They are all wonderfully bizarre in themselves. It's something I've never seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> The story is almost uninterrupted from start to finish. There are no boring moments. The movie totally captured me. And I thought the acting was great. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to watch a funny movie. You should look for The Green Butchers. A great movie. <br /> <br /> I give 10/10
