Thanks to the helpfulness of another IMDb member, I've just managed to watch this movie for the second time in almost twenty years, and I can honestly say he has not lost any of his kick. I can not believe that Channel 4 has made this channel disappear without a trace, as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moral attitude to the consequences of misguided loyalty. <br /> <br /> It focuses on a clique of friends over ten years and their relationship with two "outsiders" from the school; especially how they use one and the other torment mercilessly. As events unfold from the past and present, the tension gradually heats up, not unlike Shane Meadows' terrific revenge chiller Dead Man's Shoes. Acting, writing and directing are very daring for 1983, and despite the accents of the upper crust of the central characters, they are still an eye-catcher. Yes, it could take place in public school, but there are worlds that are different from Merchant Ivory. I have a government education and I can still draw countless parables from history. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you'll remember a long time if you see it - unless you probably will not, because Channel 4 (or FilmFour) has decided to bury it. On their own official website, they describe it as "an inexplicably overlooked gem from the early days of Channel 4" - by whom? This was one of the very first Channel 4 movies (which later became FilmFour through the success of films like Trainspotting), so somebody else has to have the masterprint somewhere. In these days, when you can get extended DVD issues from collectors, it's a bit moody that they can not give a movie the good publicity it deserves. <br /> <br /> So when one of the Channel 4 production flunkies reads this, stop creating programs that show people demeaning themselves to make a boulevard deal. Edition disk or something like that !
