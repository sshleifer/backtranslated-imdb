For years, I've been waiting for THE DEAD to appear on video. I pretty much tore my VHS copy to pieces. This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made for the holidays. It takes place on Epiphany (Twelfth Night) and is a simple, poignant character of characters participating in a dinner prepared by three Dublin women. At the heart of the story is a rather loveless couple, a woman who once loved a young man who died for her, and a man who wants to feel the same passion for his wife, but feels incapable. All the performances are breathtaking and the script draws beautifully between the different characters of the dinner. Of course, the source material is James Joyce's eponymous short story, and much of his narrative structure remains intact. John Huston's long career as one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film written by his son Tony Huston. Stars his daughter Anjelica Huston; and is dedicated to his wife Maricella. Many thanks to Lions Gate for purchasing the rights to this movie and publishing it on DVD. For lovers of all things Irish or for people who are looking for a literary, subtle and yet incredibly moving holiday movie, this is a true gem.
