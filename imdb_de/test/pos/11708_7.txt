I was very impressed with the latest production by Mick Molloy. As a fan of him I was used to a different kind of humor than shown here. He cleverly opted for a more subtle, broader style of Crackerjack comedy than his usual low-eyed bobbing. It is sometimes inconsistent and inconsistent, but a decent script works beyond that and provides entertaining viewing. Directed by Paul Moloney (who has staged nearly every imaginable Australian television series), Crackerjack tells the story of Jack Simpson, a guy who belongs to his local Bowls club just to park. If the club is in financial trouble, they are forced to overturn competitively to raise the funds to keep the club from becoming a poker machine port. A familiar and successful formula that is well managed. It is undeniable that the film owes its success to the great casting of Molloy. He seemed to have a great relationship with Samuel Johnson and excellent chemistry with Judith Lucy, and although the character is probably not far from his own personality, one can not wonder why he did not try his arm in the movie earlier. To smooth out the experienced performers, the adorable Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter assist and often steal their scenes. They are two good actors and the couple goes through their roles with ease. Had it not been for the great success of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," Crackerjack would have made it to # 1 at the Australian box office, but considering what the film is about and who is involved, even number one 2 was an excellent performance. All in all, a funny movie to feel good. A great cast, great crew and great soundtrack make up one of the better Australian movies of the year 2002. 7/10.
