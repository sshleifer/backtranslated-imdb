Okay, I marked this spoiler so do not be so excited when I finish it. Now I went to the movie and expected a very predictable movie. And I was right, because almost every horror strip I've ever seen was predictable, but not as bad as most. What helped, was the story, I did not expect that there would be a "WHY" to Kane's madness. But there was something and while it was a bit foggy, you came up with the idea and understood the insanity. Well, if you like something that will scare you for the coming nights, this is not the movie you are looking for. But if you're a fan of Saw or some other movies claiming their fame thanks to sadistic content, this is a movie you can watch. Now that I really throw a spoiler for a second warning. I may give this movie a 9 because I'm a fan of WWE and a fan of Kane, but who does not like a movie a little better if he has someone we love. However, this film could have been a 10 for me. , , (Spoiler) ----> At the end of the movie, when Kane was dead on the sidewalk. While a dog pissing in his eye was "CUTE", he could have been classic. The Kane / Undertaker sat down quickly and turned his head. A perfect 10 would have been forgiven if that had happened. It was a perfect opportunity, but either WWE did not think about it or a future sequel will begin with the sequence I mentioned. That's all. (9)
