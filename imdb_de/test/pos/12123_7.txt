I do not know if it's fair to check this. I am not a fan of unnecessary violence. I never understood that the movie industry is making mobs and cold-blooded killers heroes. When The Godfather came out, I thought they had broken the mold, but the decades have spawned a series of well-functioning mob films where main stars and directors do. This is obviously a low budget, but it is certainly well done. At some point I have the feeling that I want to take a shower. If such characters actually exist, it's hard for the soul. I always think that humanity is rising above these kinds of things. This kind of nonsense has to be stopped. I hope the people who go to such films are more voyeuristic and less representative. For Slasher movies I feel the same way. Why are we fascinated by death and dismemberment? To be fair, I rate that after acting and directing, and what it does seems to work pretty well.
