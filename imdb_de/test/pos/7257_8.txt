I tend to like historical (period) movies and get new ideas for costumes for my historical group, and a friend recommended them to me. I like Johnny Lee Miller as an actor, so I thought it was worth it and I was definitely rewarded !! His portrayal as a member of the English noble class was far more accurate than I have seen in the past. The comedic aspect hurt my sides, the costumes were not that bad, and historically I did not compress too much. I also noticed the fact that England did not have a proper sewage system until very late. However, those who can not go deep into the minutia of England's past will not notice or care. Absolutely worth seeing. I highly recommend this movie.
