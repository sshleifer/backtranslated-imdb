Whether you consider him a gallant cavalier on the prairie or glory-seeking egomaniac, the debates about the life and military career of George Armstrong Custer continue to this day. They died with their boots. On introduces some facts of Custer's story and has taken the liberty of others. <br /> <br /> He graduated from West Point and received this overnight action on the battlefield as Brigadier General. His record, which was led by the Michigan Regiment under his command, was brilliant. <br /> <br /> It was also true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the great love games of the 19th century. Libby and George were married for 12 years to the Little Big Horn. Today's public is not aware that Libby survived until 1933. During this time she was the administrator of the Custer legend. Through her own iron will and her personal strength, her late husband became a hero because she did not make him remember in any other way. I think Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity to talk about the Custer career in a flashback. Olivia DeHavilland should have come to Maytime like Jeanette MacDonald and tell the story of her husband and her marriage from the perspective of nostalgia and memory. Even then, the cracks appeared in the Custer legend, but if you looked at them from Libby's point of view, you could understand and forgive them. Sydney Greenstreet did a great job as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing to do with Custer. He was retired and replaced by George B. McClellan in late 1861, when Custer was still in West Point. I'm not sure they ever met. But Greenstreet has a good characterization of the clumsy and powerful Winfield Scott. A beautiful Mexican war story should have been what they gave to Greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old foot and feathers. The film is, however, by one of the great romantic teams of the cinema, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. This was the last of eight films they shot together. The last scene they ever did for the cameras was Libby's farewell to George when he went to his regiment to stand as the last field of his choice. Both appearances, especially Olivia, were a highlight in her career with Warner Brothers. We know through history that Custer is riding to his fate, and the fact that this was the last screen team gives this scene a special meaning. If your eyes do not moisten you are made of marble. <br /> <br /> As a story, they died with their boots to be desired. As a Western adventure that successfully blends romance with action, this movie is hard to beat.
