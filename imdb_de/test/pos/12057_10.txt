So many times Bollywood has been trying to recreate Hollywood hits just to make whole duds. Fortunately, Yash Chopra's interpretation of "Sleeping with the Enemy" is an extremely stylish and well-made film. Shah Rukh Khan is obsessed with Juhi Chawla (who looks best here!). When he realizes that Juhi has a fianc√© in Sunny Deol, he does not mind to make sure she belongs to him. <br /> <br /> Every frame of this movie is a pleasure to watch. Whether it's Shah Rukh singing his trademark, "I love you, K ... k ... k ... k ... kiran!" or in the feel-good, muddy scenes between Sunny and Juhi (which fit together perfectly), you will not get bored. <br /> <br /> Every song on the soundtrack is pleasant to hear. especially Jaadu Teri Nazar and Tu Mere Samne. As I said, Juhi looks like a goddess in this movie. Darr may not be the best movie by SRK (this honor goes to Baazigar), but he is definitely one of his flawless performances! Sunny is fine. He has played similar roles, but he is good. <br /> <br /> Overall, Darr ... g ... g ... g ... great! ;)
