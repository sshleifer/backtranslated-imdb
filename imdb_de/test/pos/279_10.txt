In moments of despair, they were ready to do anything to win. I loved the fact that the Maple Leaves futility was the metaphor for Bobby and Tessa. The drama was far superior to the Hogwash recording of the film industry. <br /> <br /> Great work! At the end of the short film, I found the whole thing to be somewhat incomplete, but also life, and that was the life and art that made waltzes a cinematic masterpiece. It's acceptable at certain times. Two scenes that I have to point out are: the bathtub and the couch scene. The couch scene for Tessa was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition. For all that short time, I saw her as a beast, but now we see her true reality. Her thoughts spoke before her heart. I have to say more about the bathtub scene.
