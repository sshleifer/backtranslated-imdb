I've seen this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and every time I look at it, I get drawn into the movie and come back to 1963! The Movie always takes me on a nostalgic vacation. <br /> <br /> I think it's important that I was here in 1963 15 and I remember, "before President Kennedy was shot and before the beetles." came. "I can feel myself saying something like," I've got a watermelon with me. "And then I realized how stupid that was! Jennifer Gray plays Frances" Baby "Houseman in Dirty Dancing, Baby will be starting college in the fall goes with her family (mother, father and sister Lisa) to Kellerman's holiday. <br /> <br /> One of the dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes), is played by another co-worker (one of the colleagues) pregnant boys Max Cantor) and has a chance of having an abortion, but it's one evening when she and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) want to dance at a nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> Penny Johnny becomes a filling dancer Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones) are convinced that he can teach Baby to do the dance in time for the show Baby is learning the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes! <br /> <br /> Babys father ( Doctor Jake Houseman, played by Jerry Orbach) Penny comes to Hil if the abortion is done wrong. Dirty Dancing brought me back to the story this time when girls got pregnant and had abortions in butchers' backrooms. At that time (1963), many girls actually died from this type of abortion - but for a girl, there were not many options at the time. <br /> <br /> Lonnie Price plays a big conceited grandson (Neil Kellerman) for Jack Weston's Max Kellerman Jane Brucker does a great job as babys annoying sister Lisa Houseman. <br /> <br /> The music is great and the dance is wonderful! The "Dirty Dancers" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can see babies amazed when she sees them dancing for the first time and says, "Where did they learn that?". Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles. Patrick's song "She's like the wind" brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a note, but you want to know what happens next in Babies and Johnny's life. Dirty Dancing brings something new every time - it fascinates the viewer with nostalgia, a feeling as if he wanted to be back in 1963.
