Roy Scheider is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood, but who is it? The Seven-Ups is still one of the better cop movies today, just behind McQueen's Bullitt and the Dirty Harry series, which is not a bad company. There are three things that seem to make a good cop movie: credible script with great acting, great chases, and some action. This movie has all three and the chase is better than Dirty Harry. Scheider plays the head of a group of policemen to seven or more years in prison for the evil of NY; hence the name Seven-Ups. Overall, not quite Dirty Harry or Bullitt, but far better than any cop movies since the Dirty Harry series. 10.9.
