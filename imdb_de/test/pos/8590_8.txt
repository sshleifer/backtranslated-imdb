The story of how the (Communist) leader, who freed the Congo from Belgian imperialism, was eliminated by the western powers through Mobutu's hand. A story of struggle and injustice, hope and the search for freedom. The story could be that of any African country. A very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty. If you only need to see a foreign movie this year, you will see it.
