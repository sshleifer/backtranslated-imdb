I just can not stress enough what a beautiful movie that is. Just <br /> <br /> just enchants me the memory of this movie. If you want to <br /> <br /> see a full epic of a movie, with wonderful actors in living scenery, with great conversations that would remind you of early America <could have been like [how the world had been then could be ...] well ... I can highly recommend this movie. Especially during a <br /> <br /> period of war and conflict in Iraq ... if our American image is not everything it used to be ... this movie takes you back to a time when we were just starting started. Being an American really meant getting off the bootstraps and getting started. At <br /> <br /> the world was an untamed and unknown place. Well, this <br /> <br /> movie has that ... and more. Enjoy.
