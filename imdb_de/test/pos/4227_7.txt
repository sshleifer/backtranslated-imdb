This film is an example of a certain kind of comedy horror that is strictly grown-up but distinct from the Troma movies (with which it shares certain qualities). The humor is rude and ready, but fast and furious. If the idea of ​​vile puppets with evil forces and twisted heads does not make you bored, grab the six pack of beer and enjoy the best "chucky" movie ever.
