This is really one of the best low budget B movies I have ever seen. I'm not one who stands up and cheers during a movie, but this movie was definitely worth it. Obviously, the premise is that there is a bed that eats people, well ... eats a subjective term, I guess, it actually pours out acidic blisters to suck the victims in and dissolves them in their sour goodness , The best thing about this movie is that William Russ is one of the main characters. The typical family man actually started his career with this movie ... and an Afro. There's a lot of nudity in this movie, so obviously not for the kids, but that should not stop anyone from watching this movie. I'm convinced that everyone in his life eventually needs a small deathbed, it's best to get it sooner than later.
