Late on BBC1 I was on my way to bed, but curiosity aroused a contemporary Irish movie, so I stayed a few minutes and then looked to the end. I have to admit that the main attraction was the only English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> This is a black comedy, which is one of the hardest things. It should be the perfect mix of horror and terrible laughter so you do not know why you're laughing in the end. For me Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) is the best example. Dead Bodies is more black than a comedy, but the plot rattles and pans toward further blackness. I have not discovered the last twists in the story, as was the case with some other posters, and I was accordingly surprised. <br /> <br /> As a snapshot of the Irish film industry in 2003, everything seems to be worthy. It does not look like they spend too much money, so she had a chance to get her money back. The script could have been much sharper, but the drama was pretty good on the whole. I'm glad I saw it, mistakes and all, I do not think I've learned much about Ireland today, especially about their police methods.
