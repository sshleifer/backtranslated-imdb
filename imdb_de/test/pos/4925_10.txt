You do not have to be a fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this movie. I first looked at it when I was nine, because I was a fan of the TV show, and my parents laughed as hard as I did. It's done in the classic style of yesterday's Bugs Bunny cartoons, and considering today's vulgar cartoons, I would think anyone would appreciate a cartoon movie more based on "wackiness" than vulgarity, a few laughs to get.
