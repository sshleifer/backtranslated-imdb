Rajkumar Santoshi tries his hand at the comedy and succeeds. One of the few good movies in which Salman Khan is involved. A very funny movie from beginning to end. All the characters contribute to the movie and believe me, there are many of them. Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karishma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Viju Khote, Jagdip, Deven Verma, Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel, Tiku Talsania and more. The direction, the editing and the sound are not up-to-date, but that does not matter, because the actors more than make up for this part.
