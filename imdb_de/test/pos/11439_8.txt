"The Gig" is a tense, funny and poignant short film about a group of friends who have gathered regularly to play Dixieland for fun. Unexpectedly, the group gets a really paid job in the language of the musicians. a "gig". <br /> <br /> You are traveling to New York for a two-week concert at a summer resort minus a member who is bowing to cancer. At the last minute, hire a specialist to take his place. Things get stubborn as a Frankie Valli guy going over the hills makes a comeback at the resort and tries to use the group as his band. When they signed up for the two-week show, they brought somebody the bread out of their mouths, who needed the job to feed their families. While pop, rock, rap, country and western and R & B stars make money from albums. Jazz musicians have to travel abroad to make a living. Almost nobody gets rich. The boys who live their dream also cost others a necessary income. <br /> <br /> I believe that almost anyone who can play a musical instrument has some dreams of one or another paying "gig", Woody Allen and Kevin Bacon are two popular examples of this crossover between amateurs and professionals. I especially recommend this movie to anyone who has ever played music professionally. My mother, who was a musician, loved it.
