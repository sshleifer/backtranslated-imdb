Crackerjack is a fun movie, everyone in Bowlo has seen it and everyone says the same thing. The cheese wheel was a big part of the movie, too, the loud speaker "dear sir, and so you left the right indicator on". Or when Jack goes home, lies down on the couch and cracks a beer, "bowls is hard work," has bugged me. And when his roommate shows interest by joining the club and calling the bingo number. Jack buys all the raffle to win the meat tray. Damn good movie when you're in the grass pots, how you can relate to it, if your non-turf forget it, I think. The Evans Head Bowlo would be rated as the best club in Aus, friendly people, great company. Hello to Evans Head Bowlo Steve
