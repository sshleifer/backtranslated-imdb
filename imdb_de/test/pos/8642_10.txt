The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: what should have been another excursion (after "Twin Peaks") in the rival field of the TV series, ended abruptly after completion of the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to risk an investment. Lynch used all the film and cutting material and started shooting again to complete a completely new feature film. The result: one of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade, which can be counted among the best works of David Lynch. His earlier films "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet" or "Wild at Heart" distanced themselves in an irritating way that forced the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot as here /> 'Mulholland Dr.' is a jigsaw puzzle missing parts, others were obviously taken over by 'Eraserhead' and 'Lost Highway', but it never seemed to be an unfinished work. On the Internet, I received many tutorials and essays to explain this movie. I know now that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely. All these detailed explanations of solutions are not just waste, but also the questionable attempt to give an answer, if not absolutely necessary. Imagine this scenario: a small child dissects his teddy bear to find out where this bear's secret and special is. Is it because it wants to destroy its toy? Is the secret in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child? Transfer this to 'Mulholland Dr.' It means that innocence is one of the most important conditions to observe and appreciate. David Lynch not only manages to imagine the surface of human behavior, but also deals with everything that lies beneath it. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - everything that remains unspoken; Emotions that are often suppressed. "Mulholland Dr." The intensity calls for a casting that deals completely with the substance. Actresses who are willing to selflessly pursue the director's visions. Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts and Justin Theroux solve their task so impressively that you can not imagine another cast. While the drama may seem a bit superficial in the beginning, you'll soon find that stereotyping serves the purpose of manipulating the viewer and confusing him as soon as the movie's red thread is visible. <br /> <br /> If you say the criterion of a well-made film is to be able to lose yourself and dive into what you see on screen, then Lynch has done a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifests the status of David Lynch as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present day. Like any filmmaker who crosses borders, he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynch's movie world. "Mulholland Dr." is more than just a sleeping one? It is a must for anyone who loves ambitious cinema. And, moreover, the film in Hollywood's form and content is a reward that has rarely been ventured into this distinction.
