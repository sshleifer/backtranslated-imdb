The Andrew Davies adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel was excellent. The characters of Nan and Kitty were excellently portrayed by Rachael Stirling and Kelley Hawes, respectively. The whole series was an absolute pleasure to see. It has aroused the imagination of everyone down the line, whether straight or gay. I wish there could be a sequel!
