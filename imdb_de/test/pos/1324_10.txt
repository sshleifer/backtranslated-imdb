One might think that a film based on the life of Japanese author Yukio Mishima would be a daunting, if not impossible, task. However, Paul Schrader has indeed made a film about Mishima that is both outstanding and complex. Although it's not a literal biography, Schrader and his screenwriter Leonard Scharder (his brother) have taken several incidents out of his life, including his success. Mishima's homosexuality is almost absent due to legal threats from his widow, but still the movie is still great and one of the best movies I've seen in 1985. I should also mention the important contribution of Philip Glass, who did this. The score, which gives the film an extra texture, is superior to that of Scorsese's Kundun. Noteworthy is also John Bailey's fine, crisp-beautiful cinematography and the great production design and costumes of Eiko Ishioka, who then made the unforgettable costumes for Coppola's Dracula, for which she received a deserved Oscar. Hopefully this movie will soon be available on DVD.
