If someone had me initiated after 15 minutes in 'Ray' and had asked what I thought in the title role of Jamie Foxx, it would have been time for a blank stare. What is this (fictitious) person talking about? That was not Jamie Foxx on the big screen. That was Ray Charles. This is one of the best services in recent years. Like the soundtrack, Jamie is an absolute brilliant as Ray. <br /> <br /> The blind Genius of Soul (who took a revolutionary step in mixing Gospel with R & B) died during production. The movie about his troubled life is good, not great. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's screenplay follow the well-worn biopic structure. Super talents fight against adversity, achieve greatness and destroy themselves. Then she gets herself out of the gutter for a happy ending. The film shows Charles' mistakes (heroin abuse, chronic female education, stubborn bastards) as he attracts you with his beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Kerry Washington and Regina King play the most important women in Ray's life, one his long-lived wife and the other his longtime mistress. Both actresses fit with Foxx step by step. But what takes him to another level is his deep understanding and his sinister imitation of the great musician. The entire cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren as his wayward mother and Curtis Armstrong as music manager. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and, better still, with more leading roles. <br /> <br /> I was not a Ray Charles lover before 'Ray'. Apparently the film has (like all biopics) missed a lot, but this acts both as old-fashioned crowd pleaser as well as dark study of a brilliant / troubled man. For those who whine that Foxx does not really sing (as if that somehow diminishes his performance), take a hike. No mere actor can sing like Mr. Charles anyway. You can not have everything. What the talented star in this picture does is about as good as "everything," as we'll probably see for a while.
