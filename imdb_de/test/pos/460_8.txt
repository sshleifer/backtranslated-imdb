This is the story of a group of foreign nationals who attempted to leave Hungary in November 1956 at the time of the uprising. Once the airport is closed, the title tour begins a bus brings them to Austria. It is obvious that they will be stopped on their way, encountering the almost flawless Yul Brynner, whose military might as Major of the Red Army was marked by loneliness, his inner struggle between right and wrong, his search for truth and the Truth his need to feel emotions for other people. He was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike, and he longed for social contact. Robert Morley plays the epitome of a stiff upper lip Englishman, no matter how serious he is In this role, Jason Robards has made an impressive movie debut that explains why he has had so many roles throughout his career. Deborah Kerr as lead actress shows the grace and femininity that we have associated with her, but brings with her the necessary strength and determination for her character. <br /> <br /> The film is about a very turbulent time In European history, it keeps reminding us that there is something good in all of us, and you can never fully judge a book by its cover. Fabulous scripting ensures that despite the seriousness of the topic, there can still be great one-liners and comedic instances that contribute to the film rather than affecting it. The chemistry in the cat-and-mouse game between Kerr and Brynner lets you understand why they appeared together in more than one movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, a thoroughly thrilling movie that I'd definitely go back to. 8.10
