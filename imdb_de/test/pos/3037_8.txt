Our America is multicultural with so many subcultures. This film simply tells the story of a snapshot in one of these subcultures. It's basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people who live their lives without the rest of the world. In general, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought and showed life that would not be seen otherwise directly in our own garden. Should be seen by all. I had lived all my life in the US and did not know that there were citizens here who did not know that they were citizens. This film illustrates the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern federal state. The obvious conclusion: If this is really real, what else is there that we do not know about?
