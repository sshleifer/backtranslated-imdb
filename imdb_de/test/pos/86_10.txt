This movie was anything but boring. It is the reality. If you think this movie is boring, open your eyes to the real problems of our society. Our children die. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse must not be ignored. I work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency consultant and deal with these issues on a daily basis. People of all ages and from all walks of life are affected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, injures people and causes serious brain damage, all kinds of health problems and death. It is all avoidable. This movie should be shown in every high school in the world.
