First, I have to say that I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I saw of director Michael Haneke and I was impressed by how good the director was. <br /> <br /> Haneke sure knows how to direct actors. What I found interesting is also the Haneke scenario. First, you have seen a woman who is very sincere and who seems to be a good piano teacher and is loved and respected by everyone around her. Then you realize that she has a mother who is a freak and is too much in her life. Now you know that she is angry, that she has emotional problems, but you do not know exactly what. And then you fall into their dark side, but their dark side reveals only when a student falls in love with her. She can no longer control herself. <br /> <br /> The roles are very complex and difficult to play, but Isabelle Huppert is wonderful in her role and she deserves the recognition she received at the Cannes Festival. Benoit Maginel is also very solid, but a little dark at Huppert's performance. <br /> <br /> I find it odd that the character played by Magimel is not very believable. He is too talented! It is rare for a person to be a piano virtuoso, but spend most of his time playing and studying hockey ... She considers it a weak point, but only a small mistake. <br /> <br /> I only saw the movie once, so I can not criticize it very much because I did not analyze the movie. I like what I saw! So I'm giving the movie an 8.5 / 10. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... last, Haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. A motivation one does not consider necessary to make films, but Haneke does it with style and precision, so his film is better than Baise-Moi, for example. Vince
