I am proud that I am a student at UW Milwaukee, where parts of the film were filmed. Yes, I recognize Mitchell Hall, where I attended a film lesson, possibly the same course as fellow student Smith. Our professor told us about it shortly before his release. To be sure, I was intrigued, but for some reason I pushed it for a few months (it must have been pretty good if it was still playing, at least in Milwaukee) I finally saw it and found it a fun documentary. It's not a masterpiece - it takes a little too long - but I find Mark's passion and dedication inspiring. I hope this movie signals the beginning of bigger and better things. Maybe his upcoming "Northwest" will bring him luck. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (by ****) <br /> <br /> 108 minutes / Published by Sony Pictures Classics
