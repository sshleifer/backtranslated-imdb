Not only is this 8-minute gem timeless, it's also a milestone in the cartoon. It's Mickey's third cartoon and one of his best. It's a cartoon milestone because it was the first with sound. And my goodness, even after more than 70 years it is still so good and gives the story a real extra weight. The black and white animation is excellent and the character features convincing enough. The music is wonderful, I love the soundtrack, the cartoon is even more fun, no matter how thin the story sometimes is. And the cartoon is funny! So many memorable moments, like the cow's teeth as a xylophone and the udder as a bagpipe. The characters are also captivating, Mickey and Minnie, two groundbreaking Disney characters, are well voiced by Walt Disney, and Pete serves as the "villain of the play". All in all, "Steamboat Willie" is just a timeless gem that everyone should see at least once. 10/10 Bethany Cox
