My God, Ryan Gosling has created many deep characters in his career, this is one of his wonderful acting jobs. For me, this is a very deep movie that needs a lot of concentration, not because it's hard to look at, just because you understand it when you put your shoes in this kid, even though everything has and the famous father who is a writer has a deeper one Mind, you do not understand why he kills this poor kid until you've really heard what he has to say, and you start to think, at least for me, that many things he says are true. A simple child, sweet, very gentle, in a normal way like any teenager, but it suffers because he begins to look at the world in a different way. Then you understand why he did what he did. I recommend this movie for those who like deep drama.
