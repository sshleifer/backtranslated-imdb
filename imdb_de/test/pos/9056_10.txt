I usually avoid film festivals and do not enjoy slapstick comedy, but I have to say this picture was great. I immediately recognized David Krumholtz from the TV show "Numbers" and Lorraine Bracco, Roseanne Arquette and Karen Black were in their usual form. This is an incredibly high level comedy with visual, spoken, and satirical interludes that have kept the audience and me together, laughing during a rather deep-rooted conspiracy. but real, subject in a way that can be enjoyed, but completely absorbed by its audience at every level of the intellect. The action is maintained throughout the movie, and the comic relief adds to the message without being so thick that it gets distorted. The mixing of Segways is beautiful and the overall product is wonderfully tasteful. <br /> <br /> I can definitely say that this movie is a long way to go, which should be seen by all ages. The problem is real and also the strong impact of this production.
