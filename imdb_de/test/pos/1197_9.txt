Hair is one of my favorite movies of all time. Although I was not part of my generation, I've seen this movie nine times already and I can not get enough with the beautiful message of understanding, passion, beauty and love. This film is against the Vietnam War and shows how people should be united regardless of color, background, religion and class. I love the characters Berger and Woof and I think the Central Park of the 70s is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen in my life. By the way: I still have this music in my head: <br /> When the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter aligns with Mars, then peace will guide the planets and the Love will guide the stars <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the Aquarian Age Age of Aquarius Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> Harmony and Understanding Sympathy and Trust abound No Falsehood or Decisions more Golden Living Dreams of Vision Mystic Crystal Revelation And the True Liberation of the Spirit Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> ps: I am surprised to see that the director of this film is the same director of AMADEUS. I love both movies!
