Dangerous psychopathic killer Jacob Goodnight is imprisoned in the abandoned and rotting Blackwell Hotel, alone with his nightmares, until eight juvenile delinquents join civilian duty with the policeman who wounded Jacob four years ago. If one of them is kidnapped The killer and his fate are not sure, the remaining petty criminals have to fight for their lives ... "See No Evil" was staged by the porn filmmaker Gregory Dark and the WWE superstar Kane as ruthless Psychopath staged There are no surprises, but here there is enough extreme violence and greed for Slasher fans. Overall, I liked this movie, and you should, too, if you're into pointless slasher flicks. Sure, it's a clich√©, but who cares? from 10.
