Not sure why the other comment on this movie was so negative, but I loved this movie. I study Asian art with a special love for Korean art, culture and history. I found this movie to be a very controversial and interesting character. Jang Seung-up is one of (perhaps most famous) Korean artists and is still revered as a master. Given the turmoil of the time he painted and his own contradictory nature, it is amazing that he has produced so many works in so many styles and with so much skill. This film honors his talent and casts a direct eye on his unpredictable and somewhat self-destructive personality. In my opinion, the cinematography was beautiful, many of the outdoor shots looked like Korean landscape paintings (which I found rather too artful), and I think that Choi Min-sik Jang depicted seun-up with the necessary intensity and unpredictability. I would highly recommend this movie to both art lovers and movie lovers.
