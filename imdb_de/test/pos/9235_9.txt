This movie proves that you do not need a Hollywood budget to see something that is fun. It remained with me how the crew from different locations could promise without wealth to do something just because they believed in it. I think anyone who makes low-budget films can refer to certain scenes, such as actors who can not get that one line, who will be disturbed by the police and most of the crew will disappear after the first week. No one was paid for, which means a lot for the people who had to travel abroad, and for the many hours they spent editing. After seeing Stuie selling his personal property, using his own money, and putting his house in the bin, I'm a little curious how close his wife came to. Good job for everyone.
