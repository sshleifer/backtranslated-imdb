Real love, I really enjoyed and loved this movie. It was fun, funny and inspiring. I have just seen it on DVD. How did I miss this, it's a winner! I mean, Flex was "That Guy". I wanted to marry him. This was my first time seeing him as a leading man and he pulls it off. I thought Tangi Miller was the best ever and I was also a Felicity head. A fearless woman who only fears her Nana. Thank you for choosing women from your color palette for your work and it looks great! Tasha Smith was a blast! Aloma Wright was invaluable as a Nana. This cute romantic comedy is "A Must See". Oh and the newcomer Marcus Patrick is worth the surprise ladies ... True Love. karen
