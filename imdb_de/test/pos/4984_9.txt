This was a very good Western of the 50s, one of the better ones I've seen in a decade where this genre was shown on screen and on television. There were certainly three big actors at the marquee: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. It turned out that Ford was the star of this movie, while the other two stars had supporting roles. Ford had the bulk of the dialogue. He was also the "good guy", while Robinson was the "bad guy" and Stanwyck was twice as bad as Robinson. She played the hardest part in this movie and the character she played was sometimes a bit too contradictory. <br /> <br /> Ford treated his star status very well, as he usually did - especially in westerns. He played a nice guy who did not want to fight, was a peaceful man ... but if you pushed him ..... Attention! <br /> <br /> The story had a nice mix of action and rest, not to overdo it. It had a vast western environment well used with the CineamaScope widescreen. It also showed realistic people in a realistic environment. The credibility of the characters, especially the supporting player, was very impressive. The men outscored the women in this film in their acting and character traits. Dianne Foster and May Wynn were weak - the only negatives of production. It's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars. <br /> <br /> Although over 50 years old, this Western is one that you would still find fast enough to enjoy, no matter how old you are or what you are used to seeing. For classic movie fans this is almost a must with this cast and a good story. Highly recommended.
