This movie was hilarious! It sometimes went too far, but do not we expect that from them? The theater roared with laughter and all the incredibly crazy stunts. It's rude, rude and sometimes terribly intense. The whole gang is back and more out of their thoughts, which in turn makes for great entertainment. I do not want to reveal anything, but the snippets of clips that go around the net are nothing compared to what comes afterwards. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that you can see with friends. Try to see it with a big crowd. You will not be disappointed. Just do not go with someone who can not take it (see above). It will not be good, you can be sure of that. But that's pretty obvious. If you enjoyed the first, you will love them very much.
