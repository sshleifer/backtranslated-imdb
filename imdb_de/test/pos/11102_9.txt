This film is an excellent job that leads us through the dark tunnel of espionage, from the introduction to the final reckoning. The effect of the film becomes even deeper with the realization that it is based on a true story. Timothy Hutton gives us a high-quality, unobtrusive performance, and Sean Penn shows why he's one of America's best living actors. As with Midnight Express, this movie should make us all doubt that we should do something we should not do in a foreign country.
