I enjoyed this movie very much, thanks to sharp scenes (humorous and ironic, some even "tragic"), credible performances, funny dialogues and a heartfelt rendering of what it is, or how it can be, heterosexual and / or homosexual & looking for fulfillment of your wishes. I am aware of the paradox here: homo a d hetereosexual ... that is something the film is about in the end, but never used for the caricature. If you are as open-minded as the people who filmed this movie, in the end, it does not matter to you whether those in your arms are the same sex or not. <br /> <br /> "mr. smith" from the Matrix offers an admirable twist as a gay house seller with a "weird" appetite here, but that's not the only thing to be amazed about. enjoy.....
