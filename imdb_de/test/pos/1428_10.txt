I saw this mini movie when it first aired, and he loved it! It's kind of weird to see how far people are going for money. "Whipped" enough to kill. I think the cast was great, especially the character Kristin. Without their smooth conversations and their deceptive looks, the movie would not have been the same stations. <br /> <br />
