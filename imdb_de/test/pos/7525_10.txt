The brilliant Chuck Jones, a comic comedy master by Warner Bros., brings us the first (?) Pepe LePew cartoon. An alley cat, tired to be pushed around, paints in the colors of a skunk and turns the tormentors on the tormentors with a healthy dose of Limburger. Then comes Pepe and you know the rest. Many of Pepe's famous gags were born here, including his chase, in which he jumps casually while his prey depletes himself. <br /> <br /> Warner Bros. cartoons were, in my opinion, less inventive and more ho-hum in the 50s. This toon of 1947 is one of the few examples in which Mel Blanc put his absolutely crazy voice in Pepe's mouth. But the kicker is the end where Pepe turns out to be an American "Wolf in Skunk Dress"! Something you must have seen! Classic Warner Bros ...
