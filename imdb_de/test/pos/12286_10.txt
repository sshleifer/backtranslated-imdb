"This is not a movie" works because it's so true what it's trying to say. If you ignore the dynamics of the plot and concentrate on the message, you will see something of yourself in the main character, Michael. Whether male or female, we have all come to a point in our lives to look back and review a situation or relationship. Did it really happen when we remembered? What went wrong? Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. Above all, he wants to feel better about how things have developed. Nevertheless, he is a sympathetic figure because everyone is selfish in relationships. Otherwise we would not be in them. At the end of the movie, I'm not sure if Michael learned something new about himself or not. Our best measure of the relationship is through his girlfriend Nadia. She is the soul of the film and reminds us that every story always has two sides. I found Michael pompous, arrogant and just plain ignorant. That's why I liked him. He is a real character. If you ever wanted to analyze a previous relationship then this is a movie for you. Finally, it's a movie for everyone.
