I can not stand people commenting on this program or other HBO programs as "too graphically" or "unnecessarily graphically" or "unnecessary nudity / violence / sodomy, etc." contain. Life in prison is not PG-13. The "gratuitous" graphic content in this situation is TRUE TO LIFE. The prison includes rape / killings / drug trafficking and showering inmates. If you do not like it, do not look at the program. I'm certainly not a fan of rape in jail, but if it were not shown on the show, I'd be surprised and less credible on the show. If the prisoners do not curse, that would be stupid. Sure it's a free language, but that's REALISTIC. <br /> <br /> The show is good, some spectators ... not so much, I think.
