I was not sure what to expect from "driving lessons" - not sure if Rupert Grint could play such a role, but in the first few minutes I was thrilled. The music, the acting and the scenery were absolutely breathtaking. Julie Walters performed as well as the eccentric old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, as well, did a fantastic job like the romantic Ben. <br /> <br /> I was forced from the start into involuntary wreaths, laughter, and swells of joy as Ben broke away from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend Evie. A very controversial story, probably a little over the top, but still one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good British movie and you're planning an evening retreat, then why not just enjoy yourself?
