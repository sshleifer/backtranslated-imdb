I am amazed and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not understand Black Snake Moan. It's not about black-and-white relationships or old / young relationships, although director Craig Brewer has purposely put both elements in two areas to optimize the imaginary taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, although Christina Ricci's character Rae makes them typical. It's not about folk religions in the black community, though religion plays a big role. It's not a love story, though there are not one but two happy couples in the end. And it's certainly not about the South, where "everything is hotter," although it's in the south and is undeniably hot; smokes holy, even the Tagline writers have not understood the point. <br /> <br /> Black Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they play about, how they heal. <br /> <br /> It's as if the film producers were sitting with an empty plaque asking "Ok, if we were going to help people to understand what the blues are all about, what would that look like?" So have They set it up in the rural South. Then they dream of two characters, one of whom left his wife to live with his best friend, the other who goes to war, and his maltreated girl who sleeps with everyone in the city. Then we throw in the world, which is only slightly touched by the folk religion (they know that Jesus wants their lives, and although they respect him, they know that they can not give him that), violence between men and women and many, many of steamy sexual pictures, including - ready to surpass the top? - a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl trapped at the end of a 40-pound chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it a real blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the storyline, beat clips with Blues-Man-Son-House on both ends and Voila - you have one modern parable about what the blues are all about. Even the climax of the film is not a character conflict, but the whole city dances to hot, slippery blues steamy dances. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is destroyed by uncontrollable lust and healed by Lazarus' (Jackson's) homely religion and fortitude (and do not forget the necklace). But then the restored Rae is shown us, the shrill to blues dances the end. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force or just more of the trashy behavior that originally ruined her? Brewer wants it both ways, but the blues are really about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suspect he would say that blues give both (sex and violence) a healthy expression without solving them both. I have my doubts. <br /> <br /> Not for the first time does Samuel L. Jackson play so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L. Jackson. The man is incredibly good. He even selects some of his own pieces, and his playing is authentic, dirty and hot. Christina Ricci is usually not so good either. Granted, half of her work does the costume that was not there, and her insidious figure, but she's a wonderful combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability. Bravo for her, she has arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher John Cothran Jr. I had to check the database to make sure he was a professional actor and not a real land minister. <br /> <br /> Parents need to know what they are doing when their children bring it home. The language is pretty far from the charts, the first half hour is full of graphic sex, and women are hurt in dozens of ways over the course of the movie (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, a woman chained to the radiator In addition, Ricci spends half of the movie dressed for sex. If you have teens, they half lick the screen in the movie. I do not recommend it for kids of all ages. For adults only, please. <br /> <br /> When told, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion and sexual abuse and tells a story that is in many ways redeeming. It's unorthodox, but time is worth it. And, my goodness, the soundtrack is hot.
