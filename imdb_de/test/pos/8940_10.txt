Betty and Boris are watching a junior dance when they are still kids, but unfortunately Hugh comes to her first and thirty years later when we re-live with them. Neither Boris nor Betty forgot each other, and when their paths cross again, they soon explain their feelings. <br /> <br /> But Betty thinks she can not divorce Hugh, a councilman, it would hurt him too much. What Betty does not know is that Hugh does not hurt at all. He rolls in the sheets with his beautiful secretary Meredith. <br /> <br /> Boris, a mortician, thinks he has the answer. They will fake their death. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken plays Frank Featherbed, an outrageous competing Undertaker in his medium-sized city - which causes additional problems for Boris and Betty. <br /> <br /> All sorts of complications occur when Boris and Betty try to complete this big coup. <br /> <br /> There are laughing scenes, some adorable dances and no curse word that needs to be heard. In short, the movie was a pleasure to have seen 10 stars.
