This movie was filled with great theatrical, great musical sounds that totally blow you away. Larenz Tate, (Darius Lovehall), "Waist Deep", '06 was a keen cat among the girls and soon met his Waterloo with Nia Long (Nina Mosley), "Big Momma's House", 2000. Nina has her heart and her Soul in this role and when she meets with Darius, the sparks fly first and then there is a kind of hate relationship. The entire cast of actors made this movie a very entertaining movie with lots of comedy, drama and lots of love and cheating. This is a very down-to-earth movie, and at the same time shows how everyone ultimately has their and their destiny in life and is in their little corner of this big world. Great movie, have fun!
