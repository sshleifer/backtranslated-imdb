I have been waiting since last October to see this movie! (it should be out October 98) and now I've finally seen it, I'm not disappointed. Damn wonderful! OK, it was a bit slow at first, but once it starts, it's a very exciting affair that distinguishes Robert Carlyle so much from Gaz in The Full Monty and Begbie in Trainspotting! And Johnny Lee Miller, no longer with his 'Trainspotting' blond haired Sick Boy, plays his raging Gentleman Highway man with the right to humor and empathy that Liv Tyler's Rebecca is easily in love. A great movie. As Hades would say in Disney's "Hercules": "Two Thumbs Up!"
