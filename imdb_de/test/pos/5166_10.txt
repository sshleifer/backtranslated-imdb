This is an excellent movie and I wish you would publish it on DVD for purchase. It's hard to try to watch it on TV all the time. How do you not know when one of the stations will decide to send it out? Can someone tell me which file the file creates so that I can write to them and see if they are made public? Yesterday I caught the last one and a half hours and only saw them once last year. My sisters and I are looking for it in all the stores where videos are sold. John Denver is a great singer and actor and the action is great. They have released some older films and I think that's great, but there are some that did not release them. I think if we could contact the producers and express our wishes, we could release some of them on DVD.
