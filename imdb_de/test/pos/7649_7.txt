I have not heard anything about this movie and was startling when it was recently shown on cable. Gary Ellis, the gifted director of "Tough Luck", wonders at the screenplay written by Bill Boatman and Todd King. The film includes the viewer from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Archie, the young hustler at the heart of this story, was involved in all sorts of petty crime. In fact, right from the start, we experience a confrontation that frees him from New Orleans as quickly as possible. It ends in the carnival hosted by the mysterious Ike. Archie falls in love with Davina, the woman he should have avoided. The result proves a disastrous verdict for Archie, who then becomes the object of the double crossing. <br /> <br /> The director should be recommended by the casting of Norman Reedus, who is obviously loved by the camera. Despite his nature, you feel for him because we know that his heart is in the right place. The beautiful Dagmara Dominczyk is perfect as the exotic dancer Divana, whom Archie, though she is Ike's lover, is tempted to fall head over heels with. Armand Assante is barely understandable with the thick accent he utters during the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> "Tough Luck" shows a new director, Gary Ellis, who shows he's doing bigger and better things he knows what he's doing.
