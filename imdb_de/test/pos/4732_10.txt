If you value your freedom! <br /> <br /> I first became interested in the David debacle of the branch after reading an article in the British magazine "The Fortean Times". To find out more, I rented this documentary and after looking at it, I was stunned by what I saw. This movie has sparked my interest in this topic and I have since read several books on the subject. This film is a must for people who only know the facts that are reported in the so-called "mainstream" media. The shortsighted lies, double talk, and contradictory statements of officials and politicians featured in this film will twice make you think of people who question the government's actions in this fiasco, "crazy," "loons," and "kooks." <br /> <br /> What is frightening is that I know some people who think of open-minded "intellectuals" and freedom-loving "liberals" who are still convinced that the Waco government has done the right thing and refuses to watch this movie or read any of the books on the subject. They still insist that it is not worth their time because they are all propaganda of gun lovers, Clinton's hatred, religious fanatics and right-wing anarchists. A publication of an organization consisting of many so-called "big minds", allegedly dedicated to the promotion of "reason", "common sense" and "rationalism" condemned the film, claiming that the film would be the brainchild of the Poison people. They even hinted that the Davidians had let it come. I will not mention the name because I am a coward. If you're one of those who read this (you probably would not read that anyway), all I can say is that it's a shame you will not open your mind.
