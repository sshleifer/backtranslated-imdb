Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> Luchino Visconti's film adaptation of Thomas Mann's short story is visually, if not philosophically, true to its origins (Britten's opera offers a closer reading of the Apollonian / Dionysian struggles that consume the aging writer). It's certainly one of the most beautiful movies ever made. <br /> <br /> The Visconti version focuses more on the physical aspects of the story. Venice has never looked more beautiful and tempting, more decadent and more mature. If you've read the novella, it's as if the descriptions on their pages come to life. Dirk Bogarde gives an excellent performance as Gustav von Aschenbach. Although he has little dialogue, he conveys the bitterness, the passion, and finally the miserable longing of Aschenbach solely through facial expressions. Bj√∂rnd Andresen, the young actor who plays Tadzio, the beautiful object of Aschenbach's wish, was perfectly cast. He also plays the role with facial expressions and gestures. The Tadzio character is central to the story, so every actor in that role has to arouse the passion and the desire. Visconti knew exactly what he was doing with his incredible eye for beauty. The change of Ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on Gustav Mahler and the subsequent use of Mahler's music, especially the Adagietto from the 5th Symphony, was another brilliant stroke. Although I read the man story before the film, Mahler's music and death in Venice are always inseparable. As well as the vivid images that can be seen throughout the film, especially the last of Ashenbach, who dies on the beach, as Tadzio slowly into the sea. One day, this movie will be fully restored in DVD widescreen format and its visual highlights.
