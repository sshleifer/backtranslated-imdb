If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli "Okkadu", you will find that this is very similar in the storyline, but Gilli has other songs and plays in Tamil Nadu instead of Andra Pradesh. Although this is a remake of "Okkadu", you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique film, Vijay and Trisha a great couple. A few negatives were when Vijay's character beat Trisha's character because he wanted to buy a gift for him. He never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end. Good action and good songs make this movie a great movie that I can recommend. <br /> <br /> I give him 10/10, one of the best I have ever seen.
