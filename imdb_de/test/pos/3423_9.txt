I was not sure of the film before I could borrow it, and I did so with the assurance that Hilary Swank has always performed well in her films. She seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact she does. And she did not prove me wrong in this movie. However, the film also had fantastic performances by all the other members of the cast, both speaking and non-speaking. I have to highlight Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor - the two main protagonists - for their outstanding acting skills and their portrayal of true human feelings and weaknesses. The entire movie was almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I must complain to Tom Hooper as director and to Avril Beukes as editor, that a multi-layered story is uncovered smoothly and dialogue and action remain understandable. The opening sequence of the South African landscape was striking and I had to press the pause button to enjoy the photography. Why can not a movie like this ever be nominated for an international award? It seems to me to press the highly rated button on all points. It was not just a movie, but a real life experience in a country that came from apartheid. A life of poverty was everywhere, but the dignity of the human spirit was celebrated.
