I have to say that from all modern Korean martial arts films worth this movie. It was not as epic as Musa-The Warriors and did not develop the characters so well, but there were many nice ideas. Simple Story: An elite soldier thought dead, returning years later to end Japanese rule in Korea in the Middle Ages. His counterpart was once the best friend he had, and now he wants to stop him. The fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to look at. The motifs of the characters are discovered shortly before the end. You may need to look at it again to make all connections properly. And I personally ... I loved the end. I could see it over and over again. Maybe a bit pathetic, but a real freedom story ... Humans can be killed, but not the ideas they stand for ...
