Hey, this Ralf Westhoff seems to know a lot about people! We have nine women and nine men attending a speed dating event. Each person has five minutes to talk to each other. A good idea to make a movie out of these conversations. And even better: it works very well! The dialogue is witty, original and authentic; every human being is subtly characterized without falling into the cliché trap, which is unusual for German films. Remember: Over the years, we Germans became stupid with contemporary zeitgeist comedies like "workaholic" or "talk of the town". <br /> <br /> But now is the time for young German directors to do their own thing and take the risk of producing films that are entertaining, witty AND intelligent and sensitive at the same time. The timing of "shopping" is also good: although it's mostly about dialogues, it retains the excitement and interest. After a while, you will actually be curious to see how this man and woman would proceed. Some of the participants later meet in pairs, it's fun to see them interacting in "real life". Of course, the film has a few drawbacks: It's not very cinematic (but can such a movie be?), The musical soundtrack could have been better, but that's only marginal. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie: We have damn good actors here. Imagine the following: All are still quite unknown here in Germany (most of them are from the Munich or Bavarian theater scene). However, I assume that of the 18 main actors in the film and television scene here at least eleven actors quickly become very popular. It's great to see so many fresh and talented faces. Well done! <br /> <br /> For all those who want to read more, here is an overview of all 18 actors: (spoilers!) <br /> <br /> Sebastian Weber: Silent waters are deep! Remember his "flower garden" monologue, with which you can win the heart of every woman. <br /> <br /> Anna Böger: A hell of a woman! Every time she opens her mouth, you can not help but laugh and feel good. Listen to how she pronounces "asshole" and calls the pink shirt guy a "bourgeois"! <br /> <br /> Felix Hellmann: The "Bürscherl" from above is fun. The inconvenient truth is that there are too many of these types. His eyes reminded me a bit of Flo Weber from "Sportfreunde Stiller". <br /> <br /> Katharina Schubert: This woman has everything: love, hope, despair, beauty. Her scene "Do you want children" is a classic. A great actress of whom we will undoubtedly hear again. <br /> <br /> David Baalcke: Is this guy a loser now or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in Sideways. I hope this is NOT a method play. <br /> <br /> Julia Koschitz: The "good-looking" woman in a circle. Julia played theater in my hometown, Kudos! I think she will appear in many TV series. <br /> <br /> Martin Butzke: The revolutionary man ends up with the cutest and most conventional woman. Would you like to share a taxi with this guy? <br /> <br /> Kathrin von Steinburg: Last year she gave an impressive performance in "Tatort". Her trance-like performance in this movie is no less. SEE her beautiful face and hear her dirty laugh. The best scene in the movie belongs to her. <br /> <br /> Matthias Bundschuh: I know these "write everything down" - boys from school. I'm not sure if the hot blonde has been allergic to him or his cat. Matthias's depiction of such a chicken is outstanding. <br /> <br /> Mediha Cetin: The sister-in-law of my ex-girlfriend was the same speaker she was. The day I met her was the only day in my life when I needed sedatives, so bad memories here. <br /> <br /> Thomas Limpinsel: The "nice and desperate guy" in a circle. Limpinsel has a strange talent that is far better than most so-called "comedians" on television. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wagner: The victim of Sebastian's flower garden metaphor. Lisa's face is funny and full of melancholy, her story has made me both good and sad, wow! <br /> <br /> Oliver Bürgin: The "good-looking" man in a circle. No wonder he caught Julia in the end. These two really fit together. I think he will appear in many TV series. <br /> <br /> Julia Heinze: The "sweet, conventional" woman. I hope she is not underestimated: Julia's face changes from naive to hurt too angry. <br /> <br /> Stephan Zinner: The "natural boy" from Partenkirchen likes to cook, eat ?? and good sex. Watch the body language between him and the hot blonde! Zinner usually plays CSU politician Söder on stage! <br /> <br /> Anja Klawun: The "Bargain Girl" has some good moments, but, like most actors, miss a drunk on the screen br /> <br /> Christian Pfeil: Play the arrogant and narcissistic guy. I could not believe that this actor owns two Arthouse cinemas in Munich. <br /> <br /> Tanja Schleiff: Play the girl who sleeps with every man nearby. I'm sure many male visitors will be looking for her. I've heard that she can also play dramatic roles, so I'm curious.
