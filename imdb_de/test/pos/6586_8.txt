For Estonians, Finland sometimes seems like a land of dreams. A country many of us want to go to work or start a business. Find love, start a new life, etc. But ... Aku Louhimies has done this brilliant piece, showing that not everything is so good in Finland either. This Finland can be like Paha Maa (the bad country) like any other country. It shows that people there can be as miserable in their lives as we are in other countries. That sometimes there is nothing good. This film shows very well why Finland is one of the top suicidal countries. It is not easy to live in the north. Cold climate changes us. The Finnish movies have attracted me more and more and this is very good. The spectacle is great too. Jasper Pääkkönnen has become one of the Finnish top stars. Beware of the sex scene (if you have small children) and a little depression that may later come to the movie! 8.10
