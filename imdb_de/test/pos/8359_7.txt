When the episode was filmed and broadcast, Eisenhower was president. Kennedy was the elected president. <br /> <br /> The episode was passable, if not serious. "The Professor" does not show much reach here, and the whole thing seems a bit rushed (many episodes of the TZ do not seem to fit the time window, some seem as if crowded and rushed, some with little or nothing it spreads over half an hour, and of course, some fit). I expect you expect a little more tension than being taken back and stunned in some rooms. But overall a decent episode. In fact, the "what if" motif of the time travel is a nugget in itself and sets the table of fundamental interest. and some much better.
