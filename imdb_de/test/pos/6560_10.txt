I'm a horror movie freak, and this must be one of the most phenomenal horror movies I've ever seen. The storyline is totally original (who would imagine a city obsessed with death to a certain symbol?), The special effects are amazing and the cinematography could not be better. Some may find it annoying, but that does not mean it's a bad movie. That makes a good point too. The spiral symbol is omnipresent. The spiral notebook, spiral seashells, spirals on cake. Of all the shapes that they could have used (square, triangle, trapezoid, rectangle), this was one of the best ways. If you can find this movie, you will definitely see it. It is certainly unique and unforgettable.
