*** SPOILERS *** Whatever may be said (or can be), SURFACE is superbly crafted. The cinematography is just stunning (to say the least) and the FX are nothing short of state of the art. Conceptually, the show has something of everything - and for almost all (parents, children, fantasy and / or FX fans). CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD ART by CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON with a bit of JAWS and GODZILLA, for example for a good measure. And there was not a single acid note that made a dramatic impact; some here surprisingly solid. This series by SURFACEd seemed to have come from nowhere and, through their straightforward narrative, brought the viewer along for most of an entire season. All in all a very good job. I just hope it reappears next season ...
