There were many films about people who came home from wars and had to get along, but "The War at Home" is worth seeing. Jeremy Collier (Emilio Estevez), who plays the Vietnamese veterinarian who has difficulty joining with his family in Texas, is likely to make you very nervous. However, nothing can prepare you for what will be revealed in the end. <br /> <br /> Part of what makes this movie so good is how it gives the viewer the feel of Texas and the generational gap. Jeremy's parents, Bob (Martin Sheen) and Maurine (Kathy Bates), obviously have a problem with their son's attitude regarding both the war and his rejection of Americanism. His sister Karen (Kimberly Williams) is not sure who he's dealing with. But after dinner there can be no neutrality. <br /> <br /> So, as Americans, we may never be able to completely overcome the Vietnam War, but this film can probably help us to seriously see how it has affected many people. Emilio Estevez did a good job with the director. Also with Corin Nemec and Carla Gugino.
