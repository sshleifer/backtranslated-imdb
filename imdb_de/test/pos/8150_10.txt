I saw it again last night and this morning - that's how I liked it. There's something about this movie ... When the movie was almost over, I just wanted to cry. I would highly recommend "Latter Days" to my friends - it's definitely worth a visit! I agree with those who say that some parts of the film do not look very realistic. For example, both of the main characters are totally cute and in perfect physical shape (though there's a shape around as well :) I rarely meet such people as singles and have never met in pairs. Other parts of the movie, including all these "coincidences," also do not look very realistic. BUT, after all, it's a movie, not a life story.
