Although it was a failure in the cinemas, especially Mylene Farmer, one of the top three stars in France, not the first role. The fans had changed their mind and waited for DVD. When it was released on DVD this year, it has a tremendous success! The others failed at the slow pace and incredible length (3h) at that time (1994), which has angered critics. But the melancholy story makes this slow and long time compelling. The moral of the film is that you can not escape death for which you are destined. It's the same theme as the movie "Final Destination" and makes it a gothic story. The atmosphere is very melancholy.
