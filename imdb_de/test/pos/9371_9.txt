**** SPOILERS THROUGHOUT **** This is a very strange movie - especially for its time - in every way. For six years American films had shown American soldiers as everyone's son, brother, father. <br /> <br /> In films like "The Best Years of Our Life" and "Until the End of Time" our hearts are torn apart by the difficulty The sweet returning soldiers have to adapt to peace and their families. In the same year, however, this film shows soldiers as a mixture of people who are rather inferior to the viewer - a message from this film is: "Include your daughters". <br /> <br /> Even the good soldiers - with a lot of time in hand - play all the time, get drunk drunk and are completely indifferent to whether they still have women. And her reaction to the police investigating a murder is - to conspire against her. <br /> <br /> Mitchum, the most sympathetic soldier says things like, "I do not know if my wife wants to try it now After the war I have not seen her in two years I'm not interested Maybe Let's try it, maybe not. "<br /> <br /> Another soldier is considered unusually sensitive because he would like to see his wife again after years. <br /> <br /> Later, when this soldier reports at the police station he spent In the evening with a whore - without knowing that his wife is sitting right behind him, there seems to be no question that it is his Woman is fine. In fact she is - I think it's "Hey, soldiers are becoming soldiers". The policeman plays Robert Young, who is trying to sue for a murder, convincingly and with infinite fatigue says about someone's account of their actions on the night in question, <br /> <br /> "I'm interested?" I'm not really interested in anything anymore, I've done that too long, I think. " <br /> <br /> A man appears in the whore's apartment. He says "I'm just a man like you who cares about the whore." Then he says, "No, that's a lie, I'm her husband, I would like to be in the military, I was previously rejected." Then he says, "No, that's a lie, why would I want to become a soldier?" He goes through another series of lies when the police asks who he is. Until the end of the movie, we have no idea who he is or why he is there! He is one of the strangest characters in the history of the movie! <br /> <br /> A man stands in a bar with his girlfriend and talks to four soldiers when a clumsy soldier toast drinks to his girlfriend. She leaves to change her dress - and immediately wears another, no problem. But the man does not go with his girlfriend, who just disappears, but follows one of the soldiers when he goes to another area of ​​the bar! The man then extrapolates from the minimal information he has learned about the soldier - to magnificently philosophize about the problems of repatriating soldiers - and invites the soldier home immediately because he is drunk and feels ill. That's weird. <br /> <br /> Similarly, a dancer girl is irritated by the sentimental soldier who wants to take her "for a real dance - and maybe dinner". Nevertheless, she dances with him - and immediately gives him the key to her home! <br /> <br /> In the late 1940s, did people always force soldiers to come to their homes after they hit them? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan kills his stranger, a stranger, as he resents the fact that the Jewish host is trying to get the drunk Ryan out of his house. The reason for the murder? "No Jew tells me how to drink". "How do I drink?" Huh What does that mean? <br /> <br /> This film is always outlandish, quite consciously - the soldiers are acting consistently with total rejection of the law, and all the characters are as cold and hard as any movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And yet the movie is absolutely exciting! You simply have no idea how these people will behave - or what new bizarre character will emerge - without anyone thinking that the person's actions are the least bit strange - eg. B. the behavior of the woman. <br /> <br /> Acting is all about the best I've ever seen - Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Gloria Grahame (who received an Oscar nomination), Paul Kelly, and other actors, of whom I was had never heard. <br /> <br /> I have never heard of this movie - and it is a real pleasure to have discovered one that I want to see again and again. It's really strange, but impossible to look away, because you do not know what these creatures will do next.
