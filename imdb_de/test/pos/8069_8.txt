La Antena, a daring film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, has been successful both as a reinvention of the silent film genre and as a gripping warning story. The scenery is a city that has succumbed to thoughtless television. People are deprived of language, except for a lonely and mysterious screen presence that is simply known as The Voice. To consolidate in power, the wonderfully evil duo of TV mogul Mr. TV and the mad scientist Dr. Y set out to kidnap The Voice and focus their unique talent on their own insidious goals. It's up to a young family and the nameless, eyeless son of The Voice to stop this evil plan. The result is a roller coaster ride of a story that is occasionally confusing, but no less captivating. <br /> <br /> This is a silent film that carries many of its influences on the sleeve; The obvious references to silent movie greats like George Melies and Fritz Lang are easy to spot for anyone who knows his job. Behind these tributes, however, are subtler references and symbolism. I especially like the fact that Mr. TV and his follower drive around in typical 1930s gangster cars that date back to the decade when the silent movie era came to an end and a whole other industry emerged. La Antena mines the clich√© aids and theatrical exaggeration common to so many silent movies, albeit in a very knowing and humorous way. It is the amazing visual style of La Antena that really sets it apart from the films it pays homage to. From the hypnotic TV logo to the menacing hill station with broadcasters, this movie is full of dazzling visual ingenuity that is the rivalry of a Studio Ghibli animation. and all this with real actors and handmade sets. <br /> <br /> Although the style is often deliberately cheesy and theatrical, it is still a disturbing, provocative and emotional image. The use of religious symbolism in La Antena gives additional resonance to the struggle between the TV empire and the diminishing power of words. At the same time, many of the strongest images are original, including the hypnotic swirl of televisions and the nightmarish television factory. <br /> <br /> I hate to end this review on an acid note. I think that the subtitles disappoint the English language publication of La Antena. The original Spanish subtitles are used with great effect, with a lot of words being played around on the screen. However, the English subtitles that accompany the original dialogue are frustratingly incomplete, with omissions and mistakes sometimes causing the viewer to put things together. Nevertheless, La Antena is a remarkable piece of cinema. A visually stunning experience that shows great energy and humor while telling a powerful warning story.
