Every role, down to the smallest, was brilliantly played and played. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary Jena Malone never makes a mistake. Her two co-stars are the same in this movie. Ryan Gosling is perhaps the best actor of his generation. Chris Klein gives his best performance so far. This is a movie that encourages thoughts and conversation and should be seen by teenagers and young adults. They think and talk about this movie for days. Highly recommended.
