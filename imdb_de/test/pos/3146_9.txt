In the world of "shorts" (most of them are not) this movie is a gem. <br /> <br /> A quiet, brief look into the world of a young woman reading a blind woman, here the stellar Elizabeth Franz - this film features the textures, layers, and visual narrative of a lavishly painted still life. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is minimal, the cinematography is breathtaking and the direction is sure, clear and captivating. I saw this movie at a movie festival in a noisy and crowded Tribeca bar - and within the first two minutes (and for the first time that night), the crowd fell silent. <br /> <br /> That says it all.
