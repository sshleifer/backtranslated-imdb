Instead of writing a paragraph, I will give four good reasons why 2001 is the best cinematic experience ever: 1) It's a visual odyssey that can only be told on the big screen. The special effects that gave Kubrick his only Oscar are the most impressive effects before this age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least the most accurate) representation of space travel. The silence that fills the space scenes not only serves as an accurate science but also contributes to the mood of the film (discussed later with HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the lunar landscapes before landing the Apollo is a courageous but fulfilling move. Many have said that it was a popular "trip" movie when it was originally released. I can not imagine another movie that offers such amazing visuals for its time and even for all time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's directing style is great. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as a means of dealing with the psychology of his characters and actions. His camera is not as mobile as other greats like Scorsese, but sits and watches the narrative. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick movie. Like classic films like M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological stance. Even he uses extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red "eye" to show the coldness and determination of the computerized villain. I could go on, but in summary, Kubrick is at the height of his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I fully agree with Gene Siskle's opinion on HAL 9000. Most of this movie takes place in space. By using silence and the darkness of the room itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and his crew are isolated between Earth and Jupiter and can not escape anywhere. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000 and you have the most fearful rogue you can imagine. Although I've seen this movie several times, I still feel my chest tighten in a particular scene. 4) The controversial end of 2001 always distracts people from this film. Instead of trying to express my opinion on what it means and what my idea of ​​the meaning of 2001 in general is, I would like to discuss the fact that the end will keep the film open. Kubrick has stated that he intends to put it up for discussion in 2001. He left his meaning in the hands of the beholder. Kubrick respected the audience's intelligence, allowing his film to be the beginning and not the end of a meaningful discussion of man's past, present, and future. The nice thing about 2001 is that the end does not have to mean anything deep, it can only be a purely action-oriented explanation, and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space. No other film except the great citizen Kane leaves open for discussion like 2001. It really is a surreal journey that includes not only the eye, but also the mind. Rent a widescreen edition of 2001, and do not wait long for the Phantom Menace.
