This is a remake of the 80s anime classic, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna and Priss are all back as knightsabers in their hard suits fighting against the robot boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well developed and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series also contains some wonderful songs. There is a lot of violence, but most of it is against robots and there is a fan service, but nothing too racy. The DVDs also contain many extras, including commentary, that really enhance the understanding and enjoyment of the show. A must for every anime fan. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: Burst Angel, Armitage III
