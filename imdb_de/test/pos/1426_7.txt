A middle-aged man, Robert Jordan, sits down on his Boy Scout troop after his predecessor has gone under duress. Jordan usually takes the pack to learn what the boys like so he can revive his dying radio program, which loses its appeal for the younger set. He has a tough fight with the boys, especially with Mike, an 8-year-old who makes a commitment to the older man that is anything but an interplay. Do things work for Jordan and the Boy Scouts? Take a look at this entertaining and amusing film from ancient times.
