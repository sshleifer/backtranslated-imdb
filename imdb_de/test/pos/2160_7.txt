Night Hunter starts '1968', when a young Jack Cutter (Chris Aguilar) unexpectedly gets the vampire hunter's family tradition when another vampire hunter Sid O'Mack betrays his family and gives them to the vampire to help Jack with his search , he gets a book that contains the name of every living vampire, or dead, whatever you look at it ... Jump to 'June 1995' & Los Angeles, where the now-grown Cutter (Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, also referred to as a co-producer, has only four names in the book, including Argento (Vince Murdocco) and Carmella (Sophia Crawford), together they are the last of the American vampires.All of them dine in a restaurant, Cutter crashes the party False as the King of Vampires Bruno Fischer (Nicholas Guest) calls in the last four remaining vampires from around the world the French Tournament (Maria Ford), the Asian Hashimoto (Ron Yuan), Ulmer (Dav id 'Shark Fralick) & Sangster (Vincent Klyn) to track down Cutter and kill him. Meanwhile, Detective Hooper (Marcus Aurelius) and Browning (Cash Casey) have no idea. A curious reporter named Raimy Baker (Melanie Smith) gets involved in the battle between Cutter and Vampire, where the fate of the earth rests! <br /> Under the direction of Rick Jacobson I thought that Night Hunter was a pretty fun way to pass 85 odd minutes. The screenplay by William C. Martell blends martial arts and horror with a good deal of success, it moves at a good pace and is never boring at all and does not seem to take itself too seriously. The character names that refer to other actor / actors of the horror movie, however, are a bit cheesy. Some may be surprised how much Night Hunter reminds of Blade (1998) but was made a few years ago. The lonely, boring coat of vampire hunter who happens to be an expert in martial arts, the scene in a nightclub and the Innocent Wife pulled into the world of vampires. Night Hunter does not really stick to the traditional vampire movie law, for example, sunlight only irritates the eyes, they can only brood in a solar eclipse (why?), Heart and garlic stakes are not a good way to kill a vampire in Night Hunter break his neck. I could have done with a little more horror and a little more blood as it's more focused on the martial arts side of things. The dialogue is appropriately cheesy and the characters are pretty likable in a silly way. <br /> <br /> Director Jacobson is doing his best to ruin the movie, the action scenes are fine, but something is missing & for some bizarre reason, whenever an action sequence takes place, he keeps shaking his camera It's like putting the camera on a full cycle of washing machine! Hey Rick, dude, it's not smart or stylish, it's irritating and annoying. The wound is disappointing with a few bloody gunshot wounds and a few spatters of blood. Unfortunately, breaking vampire's neck does not bring much blood. <br /> <br /> With a budget that probably does not matter too much, Night Hunter is thoroughly competent. Acting was bad most of the time and what about 'The Dragon' in Don 'The Dragon' Wilson's name? Did he change his name legally? Is he signing checks Don 'The Dragon' Wilson ?! Does he get mail to him in this name? I think I could do something like that, from now on I want to be known as Paul 'The Killer Klown' Andrews ... <br /> <br /> Night Hunter is one of the Crap movies that transcends its limitations and fear to become pure golden entertainment. If you enjoy your movies, Night Hunter might be for you, if you're looking for great thrills in a similar vein (! Vampire, veins & blood), then Blade & its consequences are probably the better choice. What the hell, I liked it so sue me.
