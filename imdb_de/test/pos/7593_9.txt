I am very surprised that so many people do not like this movie. I think it's a lot better than most teenage movies that have been released lately - Ten Things I hate about (can we say Teenie Bopper movie and what was the principle in writing these porn novels?) , Cruel Intentions (where a character was) gives up her virginity for a fun car ride) and She's All That (mediocre). If you're looking for something that's just fun, I say Never've Kissed. My mother loved it and she hates movies (one of her favorites is BEACHES). This is a great fantasy about what you would do differently if you could return to high school. People who have been ejected in high school will probably like this movie better. It reminds me of "Romy and Michele High School Reunion". And the end puts me in the best mood. Sure, the plot was made, but like many current movies you can honestly say that they were not made in any way. The cast is also charming. And for those who think that Drew can not be geeky - she just makes it great. Another good teen comedy I recommend and recently made is ELECTION, but it's more of a satire for school and politics.
