What a great little movie, many good roles of some random stars. Basically, there are those pot breeders, who engage in a strange adventure. In places where the movie makes you believe, everyone will be dead! What contributes to the comedy. If the character of John Lithgow (3rd Rock) reappears - it is impossible not to imagine the journey, it could have been like a total paradox. The movie is full of twists and turns that will let you guess right to the end. Billy Bob Thornton Astronaut Farmer) is brilliant, in fact looking back, the character is quite similar in the fact that he holds the family of pot breeders together. Everyone involved in this movie should hold a big thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Like I said, 'The last scene is a dream. but at the same time a nightmare. I love it when Hank Azaria (carter) says in the end that we should do that every year? I felt like I wished they would do it. <br /> <br /> I will not say that this movie is good for everyone, but as a lover of Stoner movies, I give it 10/10. - My advice has a joint ready; sit back and enjoy!
