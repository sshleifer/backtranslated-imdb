The first episode of "Man to Man with Dean Learner", which was just aired, was at least scratchy with most episodes of "Garth Marenghi's Darkplace" and had me on "My Maisonette". I hope it continues the good work of "faux terribles" on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new generation of "alternative comedy" (I hate that sentence, but I'm thinking too lazily of another.) Comedians on TV today "Garth Marenghi's Darkplace" was sold out across the board. Even from his brief stay in Nathan Barley, I knew that Ayoade was a serious talent and I'm sure he would have been great as Dixon Bainbridge in 'The Mighty Boosh'. As part of these programs, I also felt it necessary to expand my review to secure a place in this public domain.
