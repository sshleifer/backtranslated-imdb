Strangeland seems to have a love-hate relationship with many of his viewers. Personally, I loved the movie and everything about it. <br /> <br /> The play could be improved in some places, but filming adds to the atmosphere where acting is not possible. In some areas the dialogue is a bit cheesy and dramatic, but what do you expect from the late 90s? Overall, Dee did an amazing job writing one of the most frightening thrillers I've ever seen. It plays on the fears of many age groups - adults, parents and children. All parents fear that their children are too busy with chat rooms and strangers from the Internet. And it happens in the real world. And every child and adult is afraid of being kidnapped and tortured against his will; that happens in the real world too. What makes this film for many a sensitive topic. <br /> <br /> My only warning is that if you * know * that you are sensitive to things like strong violence, visible torture and injuries, then * I do not want to see this movie. If you are not sure whether this movie entertains you, read as many reviews as possible, ask other people who have watched the movie, and be prepared to turn it off at any time should you find it disturbed.
