I thought this movie would be totally lame due to the commercials I saw in the cinemas. When my sister borrowed from a friend, I decided to look at her because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. , I do not need to say ten minutes in the movie, and I loved it. Amanda was a great actor in the movie, her comic timing was perfect. The guy who played duke was hot and simple. My favorite scene was definitely when Amanda passes by the gardener and a classmate who is suspicious of her and she talks to her mother about dresses - pretending to be a guy! I've watched this part over and over again ... to make a long story short, the movie that I thought would be lame - I own it now.
