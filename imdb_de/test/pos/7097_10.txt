This movie was a very good Universal Monster movie. It again shows Lon Chaney as The Wolfman and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's monster. Oh yes, that jerk John Carradine is back as Dracula. I like every actor in this movie. Onslow Stevens I liked it a lot. Edelmann. (It's written with 2n) I thought it would be a good idea to ruin the kind-hearted doctor himself, as Talbot was. One scene that I think is very good is the scene in which Dr. Nobleman is in deep reflection during the change. Everything that worries him flashes before your eyes. The good doctor says no while his evil side says yes. That's the only reason why I did not want the Dracula character completely removed from this movie. I thought Dracula had no business in the House of Frankenstein. If his character was taken out, you would not miss him. In this movie, the doctor's blood is contaminated with Dracula's, giving him his curse on Jekyll and Hyde. I hate John Carradine and I do not think he should have played Dracula. I did not mind that other actors after the great Karloff played the Frankenstein Monster because they all did a good job. But when they make another actor play Dracula, it stops there. John Carradine thought he was so tall and powerful. They once offered him the role of the Frankenstein monster and he declined because he thought he was trained too high. I could only imagine Carradine arguing to The Monster with the director on set: "I do not have to take that from you, I did Shakespeare." John Carradine was not Dracula and he will never be. Sorry John, Bela Lugosi is the only Dracula. Thankfully they got Bela back as Dracula for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie. It will not disappoint you and you will enjoy it as you have already done. This is a very good complement to the monster movies. If you are a collector, you should not miss this one. <br /> <br />
