A review that I've postponed for far too long ... <br /> <br /> In short, 2001 is one of the best sci-fi movies to date, if not the best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a filmmaker and this is one of his best works. And although it is misunderstood or underestimated by many, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I have to agree. No one had ever done such a thing in 1968 and nobody since. At the time, it was a miracle of the break-through of special effects. With the effects being sustained today, it's no wonder why. The movie still looks wonderful after almost forty years! Pay attention to CGI people. By using large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick has developed some of the best special effects ever applied to celluloid. Alone, this aspect alone has created the cool emptiness of the space atmosphere, which is also attributed to the music and the realistic sound effects. I can not imagine another film in which you can not see anything in space, as it really is. The lack of sound effects in space is not only realistic, but is also cleverly used as a means of elucidating moods and works flawlessly. <br /> <br /> Aside from the great display of awesome special effects, there are other factors that play a role in determining the feel of the movie. The classically played music complements what the eyes see and lets you feel the significance of the journey of man through his evolution from ape to a space traveler. <br /> <br /> The story, though it seems so simple, is profound. One after another, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered that trigger certain events that are part of the film. What are you? Where are you from? What do you do? These are all questions that you ask yourself in following the story and are asked to find your own way. While most have a general idea of ​​what happened in the story, each one has to decide what it means to him. Any question that one chooses to answer this question leads to profound solutions. It is not entirely up to the interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for clarity. The end result is quite uncomfortable, regardless of your personal solution. <br /> <br /> Even if it's a long movie that sometimes slows down, it has to be to depict the human journey. It's not a topic that would have worked well in a shorter movie, a faster movie. Persons with a short attention span do not have to apply. <br /> <br / Finally, the epitome of a ruthless antagonist HAL 9000 is the computer. Never before has a machine had such a cooling screen presence. Which reminds me that there are surprisingly few dialogues for a film with such deep ambition and execution. Another sign of Kubrick's genius. All in all, one of the best movies ever made and one of the best science fiction movies. A personal favorite. Everyone has to see this movie at least once. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
