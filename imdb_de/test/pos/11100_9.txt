Christopher Boyce, who plays in Los Angeles in the 1970s, has just left school and returned home where his father gives him a job of monitoring intelligence documents. His old friend Daulton Lee is a crazy drug dealer and gets involved in a jail. He has to decide if he will become a drug dealer or face a long prison stay. If he is on bail, he jumps to Mexico City. Chris offers to partner Lee to be his envoy to sell secret papers to the Soviet Union in Mexico City for the shame he feels over the US government's control over weaker countries for their own benefit. Over time, however, the two clash with their motives and find themselves in something bigger than they originally intended. Director John Schlesinger has spun out films such as the handsome Midnight Cowboy, Marathon Man, Sunday Bloody Sunday and Grasshopper Day, while perhaps The Falcon and the Snowman may not be held that high there's no question that this gritty espionage drama (inspired by a real incident) is a grossly overlooked character portrait, all of which is a rather muted matter of no real size that makes a tremendous impact. "The driving factor of the movie was the amazingly versatile Featuring Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as the two ambitious young guys Chris and Daulton, Penn is especially good with his restless intensity that fits in well with Hutton's super cool and collected lap, which starts off as light, as the situation gradually breaks when the two amateurs are really out of their league, the highly detailed and symbolic H Action (predatory behavior) focuses mainly on the relationship of the couple and the reasoning of their actions, which finally shows the nodal developments that led to their demise. The plan opens like a wound to never heal properly due to the drug addiction of Daulton. The scorching political aspect is there, but he focuses on the themes of idealism (Boyce) and greed (Lee) to convey his point of view. Both do not mix and show results. Suspense is justified by its inspiring, cooking script and the interactions of the characters and all the visual gimmicks. Action is very little, but there is still a pressure-induced style for Schlesinger's assured and realistically gloomy direction. Pacing is usually well-controlled, although some sequences seem too long to roll, but it captivates you as it plays with its authentic paranoid tone, slowly evolving to an exploding ending. Aptly incorporated into the technical staging is a breezing music score and professionally moving cinematography. The cast is exceptionally good with Pat Hingle, Lori Singer, David Suchet, Boris Leskin, Jerry Hardin and Joyce Van Patten. Also watch out for Michael Ironside in a tiny role as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> A mostly outstanding spy movie that mainly benefits from talented lead performances and does not play the usual stakes. It's more of an emotional ride than a complex turn. Recommended.
