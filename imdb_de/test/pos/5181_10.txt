I watched the movie tonight and thought it was great. It has no special effects that cast a spell on you, and it's not violent or bloody, it's not terrorists or extraterrestrials, but it's brilliant. It's just nice, sweet and it took me to a different time, a much easier time where people could take the time to go down the street and look at the sea. I think it's beautiful and I recommend it. Nick was a great character and his friendship with Harry was one of the highlights of the film. Everyone has a right to his opinion, but I think everyone should watch this, usually when he feels bad or when he wants to share something nice with his friends.
