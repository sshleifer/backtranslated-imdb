The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the outstanding performance of Natalie Portman. She gave her rather ungrateful character much appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a good actress, is truly sincere as a mother figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable, a chemistry that could have been developed with a more elaborate script. I'm not saying that the script was in any way bad, I'm just saying that it sometimes seemed underdeveloped. I do not think it was the scriptwriter's mistake. The film suffered from excess length and sometimes blurred in the longer scenes. The movie looks beautiful, with a good direction and excellent performances. All in all, certainly observable, but perhaps more for an older audience. Bethany Cox.
