I started to watch this piece very tense because I had heard so many different things about it. I read somewhere that it was a child abuse drama and rated PG-13 for violence. Another reviewer said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of children (and I thought it was meant for kids too). Well, I've seen it so many times and still do not know which category to put it in. It is sometimes extremely funny, but in the next moment terribly sad and depressing. Because of the nice relationship and the adventures I would like to recommend this movie to all the young people I know, but I'm afraid the dark atmosphere is not suitable for children. Because of the perfect performance and the magic of the film, I still have to say: look at it, especially the kids! The last thing I have to say is that I hate the scriptwriter because he did not want to see poor Bobby again after he returned to the king (who did not even return to terrorize the missing Mary and Mikey). It's very good for this movie to not have a perfect happy ending because everyone is happy - and I did not expect it - but that solution made me very, very sad!
