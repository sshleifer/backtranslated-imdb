I can not understand why IMDb users would rate this movie at 5.2 / 10? It's really great, very funny. I would highly recommend this movie for everyone, adults, teenagers and especially children! <br /> <br /> The story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tells lies at home and at school. One day he had his homework to write a story with 1000 words. But he did not, so the teacher told him to write it and give it in three hours, or he would have to go to the summer school. Yes, he wrote it in 2:45. "Big fat liar", I think it was a story of itself. On the way to school he drove into the limousine of a famous Hollywood producer and drove with him. But the boy forgot the story in the limousine. He told his parents and the teacher, but of course they did not believe him. And the movie producer adopted the story of the child as his new movie "Big Fat Liar." When the child saw the movie trailer, he told his parents he had written it, but they did not believe it. So he and his friend had to go to L.A to prove one thing: the truth is never overestimated. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this great movie, you will not be disappointed. Do not trust the rate of 5.2 / 10, it should be 9/10! You can believe me! <br /> <br /> P / S: Sorry, my english is not good enough to give a better comment!
