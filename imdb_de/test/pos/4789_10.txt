Every time this movie was aired on Late Night TV in the late '70s and early' 80s, I always took the time to sit in front of the TV and watch it. The lovely Kate Jackson, the pretty Richard Long, the "great" Polly Bergen I've seen nowhere else except the TV movie, lovable Tom Bosley and another "great" I've never seen outside this movie Celeste Holme , This is really the love boat on a cruise to assassinate and mess and the boy was always good !! And every time I looked at him, I always forgot who the true murderer was. As expected, someone is already criticizing the film as if it really was a great help for everyone. This is a great TV movie and it's always worth watching. I can not say that about half of the films I've seen this month can be seen. <br /> <br /> If you ever get a chance to watch it on TV, which is not likely, then look at it. Considering that "The Girl Most Likely To" is finally released on DVD this year, there may be hope for a DVD release of "Death Cruise".
