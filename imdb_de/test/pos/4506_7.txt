Guilt and salvation are two of the key emotions and storylines of the heavy, powerful dramas the Oscars love so much (which is kind of weird because "The Kite Runner" was only nominated for the best original score - the lack of nominations was perhaps the one) Case.) Unfair). While most film versions of books (or other means) are generally inferior to their literary counterparts (and "The Kite Runner" is no exception), Marc Forster's filming is a good one. <br /> <br /> Most people are familiar with the story, the book has been read by millions of people. So I'm not going further into the plot than just saying that the book is pretty faithful to its origins. That is, if you do not know the storyline, see the movie, or better yet, read the book. <br /> <br /> The best that "The Kite Runner" has to offer (aside from its history) is director Marc Forster. Forster is a director with an epic scope and a unique vision that is perfectly used to bring the book of Khaled Hosseini to the screen. A small part of me was worried that he would use the same dreamy images that were in one of Forster's earlier functions: "Finding Neverland." Do not get me wrong, "Finding Neverland" is a wonderful movie, actually one of my favorites, but the visual tricks he used there have no place here. Fortunately Forster understands that and the brilliance of his direction shows his versatility. Although the absence of a Best Director nomination for his work here is not exactly a travesty, I see a number of statuettes for him on the street. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy is the adaptation of the script. It remains faithful to the source, but Forster's vision allows the material to be interpreted. The dialogue is not dumbed down. moves with Forster's direction at a solid pace. Like Forster, the lack of recognition for the screenplay script was not outrage, but I would not have complained if it was at least nominated. <br /> <br /> The dividing line between this movie is awesome and the show is great. Most performances are solid, but there are some who can not quite make the cut, and that hurts the movie. The most notable weak performance comes from Zekeria Ebrahimi, who plays the young Amir. It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's not as effective as it could be. He just can not translate the guilt that Amir consumes for the audience. I think I would have lost a bit at this point at this point if I had not read the book for that reason. He looks grim and sometimes vindictive, but we can not feel his feelings. This is a difficult part, and the young Ebrahimi asserts himself in large part, which is particularly surprising since this is his first film role. <br /> <br /> The best performances come from Khalid Abdalla, the adult Amir and Shaun Toub, who plays the wise Rahim Kahn. Although Abdalla is not a household name (although he was "United 93" in Paul Greengrass), his work here is amazing. He is a quiet, modest man and emits perfectly when needed. A less capable actor might have made the figure of Rahim Khan a cliché, but Shaun Toub uses so much subtlety and care in his performance that he does what the clichés want to portray. <br /> <br /> Excuse me if I say here, but that's something I have to address, and that's the film's PG-13 rating. The fact that this film received so low a rating is outrageous. There is no justification for that. Some might argue that the rating was bent because of the need for everyone to see them, such as the Gore in "Saving Private Ryan," some of which claim the film deserves an NC-17 rating. However, this exception can not be applied here. The scene only serves to tell the story. Forster (probably at the behest of the producers) tried so hard to tame the film's most painful and disturbing scene so that the film could sneak past a PG-13 rating, but the material is too disturbing to be portrayed in any way and get less than an R rating, regardless of whether "tasteful" is presented. Worse, this treatment robs the scene of much of their power, and by trying to make it less disturbing, the lower rating is insulting. In addition, some scenes of violence are incredibly disturbing. This does not contribute too much in terms of the time these scenes claim for the movie, but what is there at least deserves an R rating. The MPAA, whose film rating system has always been corrupt, has dropped to a new low by rating this film so low. <br /> <br /> But you should not complain about the movie. The film is a solid movie worth watching, especially if it's fans of the book.
