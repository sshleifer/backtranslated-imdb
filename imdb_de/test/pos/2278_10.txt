You must like baseball, and you must at least look like Tom Selleck, but if you meet these criteria, you should enjoy this movie. Selleck is a former major league star who is traded to Japan as his career wanes. Really well thought out and fascinating look at Japanese customs and behaviors. Great support from Selleck's manager ("Japan's Clint Eastwood"), his girlfriend Takanashi and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie, apart from baseball. Look for Haysbert as a teammate before he becomes a stubborn shake for Allstate. Film works very well. Easily in my top 50 of all time movies and maybe my favorite on baseball.
