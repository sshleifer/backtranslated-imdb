Nice Doco Stuie! <br /> <br /> Even if it did not work as you wanted with the original movie, you have a fantastic piece of work and great viewers. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying how much you invest in it. <br /> <br /> That's the same for everyone else. It's great to see the warts and all the accounts of the process without being "too pretty". <br /> <br /> I loved it! It's worth taking a look. <br /> <br /> Que pena, the author of the "Originals" film could not appreciate what you achieved. <br /> <br /> Also love the attitude. Great piece. I am looking forward to the next work. <br /> <br /> Keep it up! paully
