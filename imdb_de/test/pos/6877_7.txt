I remember watching that 1978 comedy on one of the cheap matinees when I was looking for a college break from college. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are effectively accusing Tracy Hepburn of effectively re-entering a newly widowed doctor into the dating game in this feathery trumpet play by the reliable Howard Zieff (he has named "Private Benjamin"). Everything is quickly sped up by the clever script of experienced scriptwriter Julius J. Epstein ("Casablanca") along with Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer. <br /> <br /> Dr. Charley Nichols just returned from Hawaii after the death of his wife. Upon his return, he realizes that he is an instant catnip for every single woman in LA. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile chief of staff, Amos Willoughby, whom Charley must satisfy to retain his residence. Enter Ann Atkinson, a transplanted Englishwoman who makes her living from cheesecake and has specific opinions about the medical profession she freely speaks on a PBS talk show. Of course, Charley is in the discussion panel of the show and sparks fly, they say. This leads to the usual complications of how seriously Charley is willing to worry about Ann. At the same time, the hospital faces a potential illegal death suit from the widow of a rich baseball team owner who died in hospital under Willoughby's careless oversight. <br /> <br /> It's just refreshing to see such a mature yet thrilling love story between two characters inhabited by actors delivering lines with the surgeon's scalpel skill. Matthau is his usual 1970s Curmudgeon swinger and a pretty sighted man with his lanky arms akimbo in his Power Walk. Away from her heavy, award-winning Elizabethan roles, Jackson is sardonic and charmingly vulnerable, like the vivacious Ann, who seeks all physicians as Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with predictable noise, while Richard Benjamin as Charley's colleague dr. Solomon friendly support. It's all very compact with a few nice kicks at the craving in the medical profession. There are no extras on the DVD 2005.
