Since I played it for the first time in 1998, GoldenEye is one of my favorite video games. I recently bought an N64 so I can own it and play more often! The game is almost perfect: The single-player mode does a fantastic job of immersing you in Bond's shoes, with different mission objectives, compelling weapons and great design. Even if the artificial intelligence of the enemies is quite basic for today's conditions, this only enhances the attractiveness of GoldenEye. The method of obtaining cheats (completing levels within a strict time limit) was also innovative when the title was released, and even now I have not cracked some of them! <br /> <br /> The game is wonderful The multiplayer mode for up to four players is not as advanced as the Combat Simulator in the sequel to the game "Perfect Dark", but it is still incredibly satisfying when Blow up your opponents with a barrage of RC-P90! ;-)
