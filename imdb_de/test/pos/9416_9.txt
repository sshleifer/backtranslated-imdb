This movie takes the voice of terror and makes it better. holmes protects an inventor in switzerland and is on the track of moriarity of the professors who has become a nazi. This is a better version of Holmes in a World War II world. rathbone does a great job with Holmes as a spy and a detective. See this, if you liked the voice of terror.
