I am an Australian who currently lives in Japan. I saw this movie here on television and was very impressed with the accuracy and honesty in depicting Western and Japanese ideologies. Who wrote and directed the script has to have a good knowledge of what it's like to live as a foreigner in Japan. The only part I thought about was Hollywood when Tom Selleck's character kissed the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him. Public affection is not acceptable here. Finally a movie that highlights the true "Gaijin" experience! 9.10
