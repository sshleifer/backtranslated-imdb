In the movie "The Hawk and the Snowman," as they led Christopher Boyce around the complex, the satellite in the background was the actual Ryholite satellite now in space. TRW allows indoor shots. TRW also allowed indoor and outdoor recordings for one of the original Star Trek TV series. (The episode is where Spock becomes blind when a series of satellite lights are activated to kill the aliens.) Christopher escaped the jail (Lompock) and was featured on America's Most Wanted. He drank in a bar when the show aired. He said, "Hey, that's me." Needless to say, he was captured and taken to a maximum security prison.
