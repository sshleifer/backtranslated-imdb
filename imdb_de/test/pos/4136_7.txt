It would be unwise to judge that this narrative or documentation should be more authentic than the other. Both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a real reflection of reality as producers try to reconstruct and tell stories from their perspective. Due to the complexity of the plots and screen time, both formats usually do not discuss some issues, so viewers are denied the opportunity to open debates and further explore and construct the true truth. Through the inability of the viewer to evaluate sources (such as comparisons with written history) and the logic behind the arguments, history can be distorted through storytelling and documentation. For most people, documentation can be considered true because they are usually actual testimonials from participants and real tracks. However, these visuals are selected and edited to arrange them so that the producers can present their version of realism to the viewers. In the story of The Real Buddy Holly, Paul McCartney attempts to establish Buddy Holly to remember his family and friends, and how Buddy has influenced the rest of the music world. The credentials may be distorted, as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make Buddy a legend. The documentary corrected the movie and covered other events, such as three Crickets members, and that Buddy's music was being heard outside of the US (he had to embark on a world tour!). However, there was no deep discussion about what happened to Buddy's wife after his death. Criticisms and / or negative discussions may not have been included in the documentary, as producers want to present a buddy that the world should have remembered. After all, we can not construct the whole truth, since we limit ourselves to the earlier "real estate" that the documentary tells us. <br /> <br /> Personally, I prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual images, which helps us rejoin the collective memory of that time. This gives the audience a more constructive structure of the story. This leads to a better memory for the audience when retelling the story. There is also an element of flexibility that allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on specific topics. Race problems were highlighted in The Buddy Holly Story, and viewers can certainly relate to these issues in current situations. <br /> <br /> Cinemagoers are constantly trying to reconsider certain emotions when they watch a movie and use these emotions. The audience can choose to have a personal connection to the meanings used by a filmmaker. In most stories, people tend to remember the struggles, the inspirations, and the end of the story. Through the story of Buddy Holly, we remember the fights Buddy and the Crickets had, how Mary had been a source of encouragement, and that Buddy Holly did a great job until the day he died.
