Considering that it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good movie about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey plays the lead role as Holly, one of the first electric guitars to use almost all his music. Secured by his crickets, Holly had a number of hits and became a real star before he died in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to fame, marriage to his sweetheart and later death. I like this movie and I think you too will. Charles Martin Smith does a great job in this movie as well.
