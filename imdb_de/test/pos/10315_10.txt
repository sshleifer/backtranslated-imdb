The Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors I've loved. I love pretty much every one of the shorts they made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the short films are funny and also face many other great actors and actresses, many of whom have been in many short films! In my opinion, The Three Stooges are among the best actors of all time and are the funniest comedy team ever! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Brideless Groom! All in this short film series are Dee Green, the beautiful Christine McIntyre, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great services here! There are so many funny parts here. This is a very funny short form. There is a similar Three Stooges like Husband's respect and I recommend both!
