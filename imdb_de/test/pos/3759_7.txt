The "all I have is $ 5 and my wedding ring ..." was a riot. I also laughed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horseradish and tossed the bird to the Japanese and said "Pearl Harbor Buddy." I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can not count that up. <br /> <br /> Funny thing, this 10-line request. Looks like they hit you for commenting too long, not too short. I hope I can not make it up to 1,000 words before coming to line 10. <br /> <br /> I'm still two lines short. Forgive me as I think and drink or drink and think. It depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind. Well, I think I made it to the 10-line limit. Thank you for reading!
