The idea of ​​comic pioneer Alex Raymond, "Flash Gordon", was the great father of all science fiction epics. This series is the first time that Flash came to life. Despite its low budget, this is a great space opera. The story begins with the apparent destruction of the earth as the planet Mongo races through space on a collision course. The strange scientist Dr. Zarkov approaches the approaching planet with a homemade rocket ship and is convinced that he can do something to stop the out of control celestial body. He has at the last minute recruits in the form of resourceful athlete Flash Gordon and handsome Dale Arden. Once they reach Mongo, their problems really start. They disappoint the evil Emperor Ming the Merciless, the conqueror of his world, who has ambitious plans for the earth. The rest of the series revolves around Flash's desperate attempts to save Earth; the different alien cultures that he encounters; the allies he makes; He flies spaceships; The battles he fights against and the monsters he kills. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly designed by Raymond, "Flash Gordon" presents classic archetypes from legendary myths and fables of antiquity. Here echoes of famous stories such as the legends of Troy and Camelot and Sherwood Forrest are shown. You have the dashing, pretty hero in search of the kingdom (Flash); The evil king (Ming); The old way (Zarkov); The beautiful woman in distress (Dale); the seductive siren (aura); faithful allies (Thun, Barin, Vultan); Plus monsters, dragons and various beasts. <br /> <br /> Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. Ming is Prince John or Aggamemnon. Dale is Helena of Troy or Gwenevere or Maid Marion. Zarkov is Merlin or Odysseus. (Or Gandalf) Thun / Barin / Vultan are the happy men or the knights of the Round Table. <br /> <br /> You have the idea. <br /> <br /> You can not help but notice how many ideas from "Flash Gordon" would reappear later in STAR WARS. The cloud city; The ice world; The forest moon; The scrolling start text (from the second series); There are others, but you have the key point. The entire science fiction genre is a great merit to this timeless classic. Buster Crabb is the perfect action hero, and I personally think he is better in this type of role than any other current star achievement. He also played Buck Rogers and Tarzan. Charles Middleton embodies devilish malice as Ming. Sure, it seems a bit melodramatic today, but that's what the audience expected from their bad guys in their thirties. <br /> <br /> Jean Rogers is our hero, Dale Arden, and I had such a crush on her when I saw this as a boy for the first time. I can easily understand why Flash always rushed to their rescue. She is the epitome of a good girl to counteract the seductive manipulations of aura, the epitome of the bad girl. <br /> <br /> The side cast seemed to have been perfectly chosen to emulate their comic counterparts, and despite the now dumb-looking FXs there was a lot of exciting action in this groundbreaking series. <br /> <br /> A thoroughly fun game and the beginning of the science fiction genre in the cinema.
