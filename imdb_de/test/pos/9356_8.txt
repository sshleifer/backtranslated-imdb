A man named Joseph Samuels is found brutally murdered in his home. It seems that Samuels was visited last night by a group of drunken soldiers, and since one of them has apparently disappeared, the evidence undoubtedly implies the missing soldier. But as Detective Finlay goes deeper into the case, he realizes that they may bark the wrong tree and that this crime has something to do with some desperate, sad and abominable anti-Semitism. Crossfire was born In the novel written by Richard Brooks, adapted by John Paxton and directed by the astute Edward Dmtryk, Crossfire {original entitled Cradle Of Fear} is a taut and gripping image that boldly tackles anti-Semitism. Since the creators were forced to weaken the story of the original source, the novel is about homosexual hatred as opposed to anti-Semitism. What remains, thanks mainly to RKO Supremo Dore Schary and producer Adrian Scott, is a kind of creeping discomfort dripping with Noirish style. <br /> <br /> The cast consists of three Bob's, Young, Mitchum and Ryan, with Noir's darling Gloria Grahame adding the emotional female heart. Only the third third is the whole picture of Robert Ryan. His portrayal as bullying, which fascinates Montgomery, is of the best draw and perfectly shows the talent he had in abundance. Ryan had a good reason to give Montgomery some of his best work, having served with Richard Brooks himself in the Navy. Both men had discussed the possibility that, if the novel was to be made into a movie, Ryan wanted to get involved and play Montgomery, the emergence of Ryan's career as a weasel guy! Gloria Grahame also makes a wonderful and affectionate turn, all the more remarkable as she was plagued by her abusive husband at the time. Stanley Clements was known to be violent against her, and his constant presence near the stage annoyed the others in the cast, but Grahame, who was probably channeling the emotions of real life, became Ginny, and did indeed shine a lot bright. Both Bob Mitchum and Bob Young come off bravely to really seal the deal, what a fancy-looking image Crossfire really is. Tho Crossfire was released before the other anti-Semitic image of 1947. Gentleman's Agreement and more than a million and a quarter dollars at the box office, something of the thunder was stolen by the Oscar-winning image from Fox Studio. Nominated for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor {Ryan}, Best Supporting Actress {Grahame}, Best Director and Best Screenplay, it won nothing, but critics of the times praised it as a brilliant change in American cinema, and today it's up. proud and dark like a brave and excellent job. 8.5 / 10
