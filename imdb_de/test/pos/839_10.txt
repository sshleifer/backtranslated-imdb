The third and final female prisoner Scorpion movie by Shunya Ito. The star of the series, Meiko Kaji, would complete the series in the fourth episode, Grudge Song, directed by the capable Yasuhara Hasebe (who also supervised Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The Original Female Prisoner # 701: Scorpion is one of my absolute favorites. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is almost as good. It is generally considered the best of the series, and I agree, I think if there ever is a better release on DVD (the original image is very bad). Beast Stable is almost as good as FP701 in my opinion. It is much slower, much more thoughtful. It has a certain amount of violence and malice, but the focus is more on the story and the characters. Sasori (Kaji) evades the detectives in the first scene (she is handcuffed and takes off her arm, fleeing in tow what must be seen to be believed!) And joins in with a freelance prostitute Yuki , Yuki is beset by a local prostitution ring that includes a dumb looking Madame with a cage full of pet crow. What really surprised me is how sad the movie is. Yuki's story, which is never solved, is heartbreaking. The pictures are amazing and Ito's direction is masterful. It's too bad he did not go anywhere after leaving the FP701 series. This is a great movie.
