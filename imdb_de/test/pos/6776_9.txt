This is by far the best movie I have seen in a long time. It is a very original and beautiful property. It is neither boring nor too dramatic. The characters are tangible and realistic, but do not take action from the hand. The fact that it is not in English is most likely the finishing touch. The end lets you be fulfilled as I have never experienced it in a movie. <br /> <br /> I wish I had found this movie earlier. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> More lines a much more lines come on, I'm done
