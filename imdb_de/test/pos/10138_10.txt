The fact that the film is based on a true story contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the film. The story is full of unexpected twists that always prevent the viewer from finding the end. In a moment you think something is happening to Coach Jones or Radio. It does, but certainly not what you would expect. <br /> <br /> The film never gets boring or sentimental and the acting performances by Ed Harris & Cuba Gooding Jr. are some of their best in my opinion. The end conjures up a long-lasting smile on your face, letting you wonder if what you are doing is right. Well, I think that's what Michael Tollin and Mike Rich tried. First class movie. <br /> <br /> Esbj√∏rn Nordby Birch. Denmark.
