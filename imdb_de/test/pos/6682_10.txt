The ever-adorable Kevin Spacey makes us question again certain truths in our lives. After making us believe he is a mumbling little time crook (just to reveal the real power of cinematic delusion), in the classic The Usual Suspect; this time, he leads us to believe that he is Prot, a sympathetic alien taking on a human form as he walks around the earth, being taken to Manhattan Mental Hospital. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) soon becomes interested in him and even wonders if Prot is indeed an outstanding being on the planet K-PAX or perhaps just a forgotten person with severe psychiatric problems. While the end can be seen and discussed in many ways, it remains a complex, enlightening journey that leaves a load of interesting / philosophical questions behind.
