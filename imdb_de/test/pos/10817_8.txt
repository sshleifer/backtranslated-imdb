I found this DVD in the library and from the notes on the jacket it might have seemed interesting: a black comedy from 1940 in France, just as the Germans were invading. ("Boy, should that make her roll in the cinema) Gears?") But it does! This is a clever, original, exciting and funny movie. I can not remember having seen something like this before. Foreign or USA. That the writer / director can find humor when we know that part of the result (the Germans will occupy France for four years) is remarkable. That he does it with so much charm is part of the joy. What starts as black comedy and fluff even have some serious moments? This included a race to clean up a "heavy water" (which was part of the preliminary investigation for the atomic bomb) and a short intro to the early days of the Vichy government, which was responsible for much of the southern French government was German occupation. * But do not let this put you off: The movie itself is funny, charming and romantic and races ahead with a consistent clip. <br /> <br /> One of the best things is the movie Combination of actors we've seen many times (Adjani and Depardieu) and others we've never heard of. Along the way there are two curves where stars can emerge: Virginie Leydoyen and Grégori Derangère. Both are impressive, but Mr. Derangère is special. According to IMDb he was in ten films before? But he also won the Cesar as the "Most Promising Actor" for this role, so apparently he was not well known even in France. He is a combination of romantic actor and comic actor? and he makes everything seem so effortless. Maybe you remember Cary Grant in "Bringing Up Baby" and "Arsenic and Old Lace"? It is difficult to make comedies in the movie because the risks are enormous that the actor looks unfit. But Grant has made it charming, and that guy does it too. I think we will learn more about him in the future. <br /> <br /> This movie will not please everyone. There is a bit of violence, though you do not see anything on TV every day. However, if you expect something original, you may feel that you have discovered a cinematic gemstone. <br /> <br /> * The so-called "spoiler" in this comment.
