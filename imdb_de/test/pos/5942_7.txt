I was a bit skeptical when I walked into the cinema to watch OSS117: French comedies are so complacent these days that only the stupidest at national box office score. However, I was surprised that the humor does not always reach the level of the Monthy Pythons, but the many references to the 1950s Frenchman's worldview that OSS117 represents are hilarious that time with an amazing fidelity. In short, a little surprise, not to mention the outstanding achievements of various secondary actors. And at least for once, the style of Jean Dujardin (which can annoy many people) fits perfectly with the character he plays.
