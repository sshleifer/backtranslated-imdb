In contrast to the commentary, which was published directly below, The Big Trail (1930) was not filmed in a three-camera process "similar to the later Cinerama". That was the final for Napoleon (1927), a completely different movie! The Big Trail was recorded simultaneously in the 35 mm and 70 mm versions (Grandeur). Both versions are shown from time to time on the Fox Movie Channel. So it's easy to compare one with the other. The grandeur version (Broadcast in Letterbox @ at a ratio of 2: 1) is kinematic more impressive with its wide-angle panoramas, but has the same problem as the early CinemaScopes, a lack of close-ups that compelled director Raoul Walsh to focus on focus issues. Individual scenes instead of crowds or long strikes are much more effective in the standard version because the camera can move closer to the players, giving the viewer a greater sense of involvement. When viewing the two versions at the same time, one gets an accurate idea of ​​which shots Walsh chose in the standard version for close-ups, but not in the Grandeur version. There are also some sequences with El Brendel: a shell game with Ian Keith and some deals with his wife and donkey, which are included in the Grandeur version, but are not included in the standard version. <br /> <br /> For The Record The Big Trail is the only one of three Fox Grandeur movies that has been preserved in its original widescreen format. (The other two are Fox Movietone Follies from 1929, completely lost, and Happy Days surviving only in standard format.) Other studios also experimented with wide-film at the time, but the only other one known in both formats is The Bat Whispers, shot in both 65 mm and 35 mm and released by United Artists. Other major films included MGM's Billy the Kid (1930) and The Great Meadow (1931), RKO's Danger Lights (1930), and WB's The Lash (1930), all of which are in their standard format versions at Turner Classic Movies. WB's Kismet (1930) was also shot both broad and standard, but seems to have completely disappeared. It is rumored to be lost. Why did Wide Film fail in 1930? Cinemas played a role in the impact of the October 1929 stock market crash and the rising cost of installing sound equipment and were therefore detrimental as they incurred the additional cost of installing additional new projection equipment and new wider screens. Only a handful of films photographed in different systems that were not always compatible with each other. It would not be until 1953 when Fox, now Twentieth Century Fox, would try again, and this time with the introduction of the widescreen CinemaScope.
