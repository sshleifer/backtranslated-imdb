If you have a chance, you see this Russian (how should I call her: gems, masterpieces, hidden treasures?), War films like this or The dawn here is quiet or Proverka na dorogah ... And right after that, look again the American war films or the international productions, the Allies and the Germans, etc. Or, even worse, watch Italian war films. Everything from the West seems flat, ridiculous compared to Russian films. I'm so stunned by the quality of the above-mentioned Russian war movies that I can not find the words to praise their shattering superiority over Anglo-Saxon war movies enough.
