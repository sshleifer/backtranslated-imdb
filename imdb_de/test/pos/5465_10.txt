I have just returned from Santa Fe. NM. I visited the Loretto Chapel. When I looked around the building, which was purchased by a private owner, I saw the movie version of the stairs again. It is an overwhelming mystique that occupies this building. It's about what can happen if you really have faith. The bookstore there has a narrative about the subject, namely the story of the staircase. I have read the narrative in its entirety. The atmosphere in which people surrounded themselves absorbed me. It was as if we were totally enclosed in a time warp, all with the same thoughts and awe. When we left, the silence was overwhelming. Everyone should visit the Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe. NM.
