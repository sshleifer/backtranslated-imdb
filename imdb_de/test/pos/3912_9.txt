This is the ultimate horror movie this year. "House of Wax" is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. This version really shames the Vincent Price version of the movie. I only know a few of the young actors in the movie. The always annoying Paris Hilton; The pain in which you know what seems more seductive than ever. At least she did not try to copy her shame. If she likes horror, she's better than Vanna White of Wheel of Fortune. She beats Vanna HANDS DOWN! And the scene where House of Wax was made was not fun. The house was made of wax, and the victims could get out there before being waxed like their friends. These two twins Bo and Vincent (the deformed twins) were maniacs from the start. The parents have educated her well, with the exception of Vincent. And I think they were equally spoiled. How come that one in the other pickup is scary, but not as bad as the other two? That's another story in the book. I think he had to follow his heart and not the other twins who turned Ambrose into a tourist trap for unsuspecting victims. This movie is like "The Phantom of the Opera" meets "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". And this movie is one of the scariest in 2005! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
