I've seen almost all of the Coen brothers' films now, and I have to say this is one of their better films. I would not dare to say that it's better than "The Big Lebowski", but it was very good. <br /> <br /> I sometimes found the story very interesting and hilarious. I loved all the characters, especially Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete). <br /> <br /> There's really nothing bad I can say about this movie, but this movie is not for everyone. If you liked the films of the other Coen brothers, you can be sure that you will like this movie, too. And if you liked what you saw in the trailer, you'll like the movie, but do not stick to it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope you like the movie the way I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
