My friend gives me these 3 huge boxes. "These are laser discs from Flash Gordon series," he says. "I'll have some huge coasters," I say. But not like this. This series rocks. (But I had to complain to almost everyone I knew to find a laserdisc player for them. <br /> <br /> In this series, there's really all in all: there are lion-men, falconmen, shark-men, Earthmen and I think you would call them mongo males.The sets and costumes combine greek, roman, oriental, egyptian and even armor like english knights.Great costumes.And part of it was a riot.These terrible tights with shorts that are worn by Zarkov can not be described, and the guys in the oven scene seem to be wearing boxers. <br /> <br /> It's also funny how they renamed the octopus into an octopus, the orangutan in Orangapoid and the tiger into a Tigron, there is even a dragon (a Godzilla-like creature that threatens Flash several times before it is killed). <br /> <br /> You like the invisible man? You like sword fighting, wrestling (so probably animals as well as men), fist fights? A lot for every taste. We have an underwater city, a heavenly city, a city on a mountain and tons of secret passages and caves. <br /> <br /> Hokey effects? Massive amounts. The sky city is supported by radium ovens, which were stuck like steamboats from ancient times. The rocket ships are "powered" by fireworks and have constant setbacks and / or hums. There are many wires visible to stop things (for example food, when Flash was invisible and of course rocket ships). There are clouds in the universe, but from Mongo none around the earth. "Giant" lizards appear for a moment. The fight against sea creatures allegedly threatens Flash & Co. on the way to the underwater city of the shark men. The "gadgets" in dr. Zarkov's lab rip me up. They seem to be the same no matter what lab they work in (he worked in Ming's lab and Vultan's). <br /> <br /> And yes, we have romance. Everyone wants Dale. Ming, Vulture, Flash. But at least one person wanted Princess Aura (Prince Baron), just not the person she preferred. In fact, many of the deals seem to involve intrigues of Princess Aura to try and win Flash. <br /> <br /> Man I think the characters are fantastic. This fat, laughing King Vultan was hilarious. How he made these wings was pure art. And Ming! What can I say about Ming? He was perfect. They should have had him for the Emperor in Star Wars. Ming must be my favorite character in this series. Princess Aura was also a pretty small character. And she did a good job. I think she's a much better actress than Dale Arden. Even the sneaky high priest had a characteristic role. Zarkov was good but not the strongest character - and he was always in the background during the fight scenes in which he held Dale. Now we come to Flash: Flash, of course, was the strength, the leader, the hero - and he did well. Crabbe is a good actor and this role suited him perfectly. <br /> <br /> After looking at it, I know where George Lucas had the main idea for Starwars. Look at that, you will see what I mean. <br /> <br /> If you have ever considered considering an old series (or a series of series), this should be your first choice. The only reason why I did not rate this as 10 are some story holes that could easily have been fixed, the way the huge lizards were just pinned there, and a few weak characters (King of the Hai Men & King of the Lionmen).
