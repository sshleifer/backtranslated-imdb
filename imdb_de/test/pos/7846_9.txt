The Beguiled is a pretty satisfying movie for those who are looking for the above things. For the hardened fans of Clint Eastwood this will be a disappointment. Although Eastwood does his best here in his untypical role (apart from the fact that his character is a charming womanizer with whom he is not so familiar), the ambiguous nature of his character, who is a kind of fallen hero, is a manipulative one and insatiable female eater (to put it this way) at some point it will be too much for him to see heroes play in the best western tradition, morally impure, but still without that dark side. I think he manages to play this unlikely role, but those who really steal the show are the two rival women, the headmistress Geraldine Page and the head of the students, played by Elizabeth Hartman that there is a potential devil in every man and in every woman there is a potential witch, especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire. Hartmans Edwina is the cutest, most innocent girl in the world until she falls in love with John McBurney and becomes possessive. This is the cause of the tragedy, as well as the secret desire of the headmistress, the forbidden fruit. She has a big and ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother, whom she obviously still adores. The fourth factor in this "unholy" love spiral is the evil Carol, played by Jo Ann Harris, who lures John of his love for Edwina and into her bed. <br /> <br /> The whole nature of the story conveyed This film is a kind of gothic feeling, which makes it rather rare in the Western genre, but is popular in the films of the 70s. A unique achievement by the Siegel / Eastwood team and a movie that is not for the faint-hearted.
