I was a student when I saw this movie for the first time. The next day I knew that all the students of our form were watching it, and everyone was fascinated by the movie the way I was. I think the same situation was in all forms of our school and throughout the Soviet Union. Later, I saw it every time it was shown on TV, and I want to see more. I think a comparison with "Back to the Future" or other science-fiction movies is not appropriate. "Gost'ya iz budushchego" is unique in many ways. Once you have seen it, you will never forget it. <br /> <br /> This film is full of faith in peaceful scientific achievement, full of faith in the beautiful future of our world. It is not just the movie, but also a prognosis of many scientific inventions and achievements. The time shown in the film is the year 1984 (the founding year) and the year 2084 (from which a pupil Kolya Gerasimov traveled for some time and from which his girlfriend Alisa Seleznyova comes). The year is now 2005, many inventions and achievements predicted in the film have not yet materialized. Like "Mielophone" (a device that can read the minds of every animal and every human being), expeditions to Venus and Mars (as easy as a weekend picnic), creating and launching the satellites as homework for students, flying machines (the car completely replaced), biorobots, "historical identification" of material or creatures that were done in a few minutes, and many others. By now, some of them are much more realistic now than they seemed in 1984! Just wait for 2084 :-) <br /> <br /> The film also shows typical Russian students (and does it so naturally!). With her ingenuity, her curiosity, her humor and her reverie. For example, look at Fima Korolyov, you could find such a character in almost every form of any school in the Soviet Union, a similar character was in my form! Alisa Seleznyova ... Myself and many of my classmates fell in love with her at first sight! Later, an actress playing Alisa became a scientist - I think she was as influenced by the movie as the people who saw him on TV. <br /> <br /> Beautiful idea, beautiful realization, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song "Prekrasnoye Daleko" ("The Wonderful Far-Away") ... Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ... <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is that various remakes and "new" versions of the song from the movie and even the movie itself were later made and aired on TV and on the internet, all are not even with the I should not even comment on it, my comment refers only to the original, so ask for the original and enjoy it!
