I had to call my mother (WASP) to ask her about it. Was it really that bad in the 40s in New York? Surprise, she could not remember. I told her to watch the movie. Arthur Miller, not in a script, but as a novella for a change, was 30 when he wrote this in 1945. It is a painful portrayal of anti-Semitism. Strangely enough, there is a delicate history of human relationships (Finkelstein, the Jew, mainly Newman, the non-Jew) that underlies the cruel story. The acting is competent and the cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can imagine is that it's not big enough in the theater that it is aaagh controversial br /> I actually give ten out of ten. Maybe a bit high, but it is so worth seeing.
