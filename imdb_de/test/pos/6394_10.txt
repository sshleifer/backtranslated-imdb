This show is great for many reasons. On this day, father and mother can communicate with their children when they are old. It's so great to see a real family instead of a stuffy, overreacting family. I have looked at this once and am addicted. It's great to see a black family on TV worth seeing. This show was abandoned too early, but on her way she was concerned with pregnancy, sex, drugs, bad dates, death, etc. The best part about the show was that she was engaging in a humorous way. Great show for the family .. I can not tell you how many times I saw this show late at night and sometimes laughed my head. Great pg 13 rated show. I loved Everybit from this show.
