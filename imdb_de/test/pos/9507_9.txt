They were an alternative before there was an alternative. The Residents are a band like no other, and I love them for it. This has all her classics, from "Hello Skinny", "Third Reich and Roll" to her homage to the great James Brown with a take on "This Man Man's Man's World". But this is just the beginning. As a bonus, there's even Renaldo & The Loafs, which are irresistibly beautiful "Songs for Swinging Larvae" and even include The Residents cover of it. Needless to say that I highly recommend buying this DVD, I would also recommend buying the latest album 'Demons Dance Alone', it's fantastic. Uncle Willie Eyeball Buddy # 502
