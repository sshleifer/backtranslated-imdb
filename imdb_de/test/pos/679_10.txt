Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed in the '30s,' 40s and '50s, the entertainment was guaranteed, even if the picture was black and white. Ida was able to captivate the audience and cast a spell over her until the end of her pictures. In this movie, as Mrs. Helen Gordon, "High Sierra," 41 along with Robert Ryan (Howard Wilton), "Golden Gloves," 40 lets her guess how the relationship will develop and how bad Mrs. Gordon will be able to to have a normal and happy marriage with love and genuine affection. If you liked Ida Lupino, who could play the role of a criminal in a women's prison and jailer who was hated, this is the movie you can enjoy. I am firmly convinced that Ida Lupino has not received the true recognition she deserves for her great talents in the film industry !!!
