You do not have to be a Tamil to appreciate this gem of a movie. I do not know a word Tamil and have only seen this movie because a friend recommended it to me. Understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite difficult, but I could understand the story because the main actors (and actresses) were really very emotional. And the little girl was really cute (in most Hindi films she was not irritating as a kid actor) Mr. Ratnam, because you tried something else. The relationship between the parents and their children is fairly realistic (I could identify with the characters in the movie). It was all a movie that will stay in my heart forever and I would not do it. Do not hesitate to recommend it to my friends. Even the songs are just out of this world! They were beautifully and meaningfully portrayed. If only I could understand the right meaning of the lyrics :(
