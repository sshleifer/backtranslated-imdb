The sub-genre "Old Dark House", which dominated the early talkies, rarely disappoints when we look at the oldies again today. Here is one that has so many suspicious characters that you have to wonder how they can tie all the loose ends in the 6-reel runtime. <br /> <br /> The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Colonel Walters (Berton Churchill), who has sent one of their ranks to jail. They decide he has to die that night. Meanwhile, the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs. This does not go well with Thelma (Irene Purcell) fiancee of club member Brand Osborne (Ben Lyon, late in HELL'S ANGELS '(1930) megobudgets), who wants him to leave the club and stop endangering his own life. Brand promises his resignation after saving the colonel's life. Everyone heads for Walter's newly acquired Long Island mansion to wait for the assassin. The colonel may be the new owner of Melody Manor, but it's an old dark house with eccentric neighbors (like Raymond Hatton) hermit) and maybe even a ghost. Top Rated Zasu Pitts is Nora, the housekeeper who expects to see a ghost on every corner. Throw in a cop (James Gleason) who's sure Brand is a criminal, and we've got a picture that's full of action and surprises. <br /> <br /> You will immediately notice that the writer lost. Too many dialogs are displayed because many characters repeat the same lines over and over again. Yoganda (C. Henry Gordon), a Hindu mystic (with which films of that time were loaded) says, "Evil is on its way." often and I have not counted how often Mrs. Pitts says "Something always happens to someone!". There are many suspects and two characters (Mr. Gleason as the stereotypical dumb cop and Roscoe Karns as Mr. Lyons friend) who serve as a comedy aid. The house itself looks reasonably scary (I think THE PHANTOM (1931) used the same set), with many secret passages and violin music coming from empty rooms, but somehow you never really get a sense of danger. Maybe it's because no one is in the movie, and I mean nobody! In the end, everything comes out; But if you want to go into more detail, this would be spoiled for choice. <br /> <br /> Make sure that Robert Frazer (by WHITE ZOMBIE) and Frank Reicher (best remembered as Capt. Engelhorn by KING KONG) are among the suspects. <br /> <br /> THE CROOKED CIRCLE is a funny movie. Some aspects of the plot are predictable, while others are not. I suppose you will enjoy it.
