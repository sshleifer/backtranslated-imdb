Well, I've seen a lot of B Grade films in my 15 years, and I have to say that was one of the better ones. I personally enjoyed the property and the plot, but she suffered from amateur plays (although Adrienne Barbeau did a decent job as Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms could not keep his role well enough to be considered good. The other performance that really fit the movie was that of Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). It starts with an eager estate agent leading an Asian couple through a house just to find out there is a dead girl in the shower of the show home. It goes ahead with detective speculation and introduces the key figures with appropriate grace. I think that for any person who expects a chuckle at the playwright the victim-brokers offer during the Gory scenes, a chuckle is really a gem ... XD Who am I joking? It's not great, but worth it if you are bored.
