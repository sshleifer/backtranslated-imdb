Safer indeed. Hitchcock is the whole pervert of the cinema; But we all know that his perversions are ours as well, so we forgive him. And we not only forgive him, but applaud in a clever way, inviting us to an unforgettable train ride. <br /> <br /> I've seen Hitch's in 1953, I Confess, a week ago, and I've brought both into the same category as part of his trademarks. These hallmarks were in his genius as he questioned and throbbed his artistic veins, spilling the viewer with psychological drops of blood, leaving no guilt, and instead a very subtle awareness of the sense of equality. The pen is always more powerful than the Ditch and Hitch wrote down the most questionable questions with his wrist. Then he held on firmly with his hands and held cameras with people always reflecting the thirst of blood people (most people), otherwise the comedy would not be a tragic thing most people laugh would not be so complex. <br /> <br /> The dark elements of "high society" with a wealthy psycho Bruno and an ambitious tennis player who wants to be a politician, the story of Guy of Hitch is the best built and run, inspiring many filmmakers not only with their plot, but also with tricky pictures that evoke a dark smile and happy nightmares. <br /> <br /> Hardly perfect!
