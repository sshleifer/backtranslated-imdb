Abel Davos (Lino Ventura) has been fleeing for more than ten years, hiding in Milan, Italy. In his absence, he was sentenced to death in his native France for his crimes. Disappointed with his life in Italy and the police approaching him, he decides to return to his old peat field in Paris. After sending his wife Therese and two young sons to Nice, Abel and his next commander, Raymond Naldi, made one last raid to finance their new life in France. The robbery brings in a meager half a million francs, far less than their sources suggested, and despite the police's persecution, they both manage to get to Nice, where they hide for a moment. After stealing an excursion boat from a local, they want to turn it into a tourist resort in San Remo, where they can interfere more easily, but they are stopped by armed customs officers on a deserted beach, a gunfight and Therese and Naldi both killed. A now wounded Davos with two children in tow is easily detected by the police. He calls on his old friends in Paris to send help, but they have moved on since their old friend has gone underground and not too gladly takes a risk themselves, so they send a little thief, Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo) to him to rescue. Davos is disgusted that such a modest thief is sent to help him, although he immediately starts off with the charming Stark and he finds out why he was disappointed, but the treachery does not stop there /> <br /> Classe Tous Risques (aka Big Risk) was screen-written by former detainee and crime writer Jose Giovanni (Le Trou, Le Clan des Siciliens), with Ventura already on board for the Giovanniwanted project was Ventura, who was unique to directing the project a director's assistant, who had drawn his attention to a previous project, a Claude Sautet, who was best known at that time, when he assisted Georges Franju at Les Yeux sans Visage. Sautet immediately agreed and the rest, as they say, is history. Sautet designed a fine gangster film that heavily depicts characters and relationships. Davos, who is constantly hiding, has plenty of time to think about his life, his past, his present and his future. His friendships no longer seem to be what he believed was her, his now deceased wife and what will become of his two young sons. Ventura as a character actor has always amazed me because he is both comfortable and compelling in both the police and the criminal brotherhood. Here, his world fatigue is sublime and powerful as his world shatters around him as the loneliness and loneliness of a man on the run to the kick. Ventura's former profession as a professional wrestler is widely used as he casts Pariser Hoodlums with absolute ease. Belmondo as Stark revives the film's other plot, his budding relationship with a girl he encounters on the road trip. With his sincere charm and purity for this woman in danger of being just a "Voleur" and "the only good thing about me is my left" as he turns down her attacker, it is also a pleasure to see her falls to him nevertheless the performance of Belmondo was overlooked at that time, as Godard's A-fight of Souffl√© was released only three weeks earlier. Godard had the merit of discovering the new kid in the block, his versatility in these two films that everyone could see and admire. Sautet's film is a noble affair, with many attractive locations, the film also has very sparse dialogues. Sautet prefers to let the actors do the work with the least glances or glances that bring the story forward Take a look at Sautet's work in the future.
