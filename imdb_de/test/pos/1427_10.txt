Clifton Webb as "Mr. Scoutmaster" is one of the greatest greats for comedy and reminding of a world-diminished innocence. I can not understand why the networks like American Movie Classics and the like do not show this movie, although I kept asking it. <br /> <br /> This film should now be shown to children as they show loyalty, respect, dedication and determination to achieve the best on an individual basis. There is so much self-esteem in everyday life today, but this film, along with many others, would be a wonderful learning tool for today's younger generation to see what can be achieved with common sense and decency your successes to improve yourself. Sad that this kind of movie does not appeal to the modern audience. It certainly appealed to us "Baby Boomer" generation of yesterday. OLD TEACHINGS ARE UNIVERSAL AND TIMELESS.
