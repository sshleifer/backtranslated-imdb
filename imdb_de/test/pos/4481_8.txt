I recently stumbled on a TV show of "Passion ...." (after missing the opening scenes). Mrs. Currier is praised for having the vision and the courage to bring such a strange de Balzac story to the screen. I am grateful to the entire cast and crew for their part in producing such a fine film. It must have been tedious to shoot so many scenes in the desert. And I can not understand how her coach demanded such a nice "achievement" from the leopard Simoon. (This advertisement is reminiscent of another exciting adventure, "Naked Prey"). Why is this movie not known? I hope I can find it on video.
