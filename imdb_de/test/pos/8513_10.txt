Let me diverge from many of the comments I've read here, saying that this film, together with Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia With Love, License To Kill, and For Your Eyes Only (the ONLY time Roger Moore actually played the role Of course, Sean Connery brings the whole thing together - as co-writer, co-producer and in his best performance since From Russia With Love - he's fit, energetic and obviously enjoying himself, his acting is mature, self-confident And filled with the right amount of humor, this contrasts with his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his sleepwalking gait through You Only Twice, and his wistful, limp-footed drill through the animated cartoon known as Diamonds Are Forever. <br /> <br /> This is an ingenious reworking of Thunderball without the sets and machines overpowering the characters and storyline far superior. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings his unique style in the role of the Largo, without relying on an eye-click, a SPECTER ring or a boring uniform. Kim Basinger is sporty and gracious, Barbara Carrera is dynamic and for once we have a great Felix leader in Bernie Casey. The depictions of M and Q are original, and the addition of the bumblebee agent Small-Fawcett is fun without falling into slapstick. <br /> <br /> Director Irvin Kershner uses his locations (the Bahamas and the French Riviera) without losing sight of his actors. Although an in-depth look reveals some mediocre special effects and continuity trajectories, Kershner keeps the film moving at a good pace, unlike Thunderball (which even his director Terence Young did not like). Obviously, fans will miss the Gun Run brand and 007 theme music, but they are Eon Productions. <br /> <br /> Although Michel LeGrand did not compose the most memorable score, it captures an atmosphere of location without being overbearing. It is not surprising that his best moments are in the south of France, where his French love song (in the spa) is particularly attractive. And tell me how many really remember the music for Moonraker? Personally, I would rather forget the man with the golden weapon and the look of a kill! <br /> <br /> The Eon people can taunt this movie if they want. (Yes, Octopussy has made more money.) At least Connery's mature 007 did not stagger through the jungle and blew out a Tarzan shriek. He did not joke with a Bengal tiger and did not fight against "Indian" snake charmer with a tennis racket. Despite Eon's desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and the late Jack Schwartzman have put together a beautiful film that Ian Fleming greatly appreciated in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But if you'd rather see James Bond Get a dwarf kicking your shins, do another boring fight with Jaws, jump into bed with Grace Jones or slapstick Firetruck through San Francisco, this is NOT the movie for you!
