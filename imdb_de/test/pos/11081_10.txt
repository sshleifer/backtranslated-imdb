... David Bovie sings in this movie. BUT IT IS!!! It's about America, so do not be ashamed to see it. Just think, if you can, to avoid more damage ... You know, you're the same normal guy next door, so be careful! One of the best critics of the "common" spirit and friendship. Still do not care Go to the music - it's worth a try, just close your eyes and Pat Metheny and David Bowie will touch you so deeply that you start screaming! And if you dare to open your eyes, please do not make popcorn and such. You will miss a lot. You may think it's not worth it, but think twice - and do not look at your neighbor's lawn. You never know what you need to find there. Try it! Just do not die or be happy about it ...
