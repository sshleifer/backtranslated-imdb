OK, so I admit that it often looks like most Sylvester / Tweety pairings have exactly the same story: Sylvester tries to get Tweety, but always fails and is always maimed with a bulldog. I think it's some kind of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner (in other words, mammals should never look for birds). "All a Bir -r-r-rd" has the same diagram and puts it in a train. In a sense, the best thing about these cartoons is to see what kinds of schemes Sylvester is up to looking for Tweety. We know he will fail miserably, but it's also funny to see how Tweety turned into a bad ass, a cruel track). This function is mainly used to pass the time. By the way, I thought I had seen, I mean, I stretch, I pull - Sylvester passes a piece of luggage called Friz Freleng.
