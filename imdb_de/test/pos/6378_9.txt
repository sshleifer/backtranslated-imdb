I saw Teen Devian broadcast on a Friday night in Doordarshan in 1993 and could hardly believe that such a remarkable movie was ever made in Bollywood. It was amazing? a movie with a "modern" plot, great music, three beautiful ladies and my favorite superstar Dev Anand. In this unusual plot, Dev falls in love with three women? the simple Nanda, the gorgeous Kalpana and the clever Simi. They too are in love with him and want to marry him. This puts Dev in a dilemma (which is the heart of the plot) - who should you marry? He consults a hypnotist who asks Dev to look into a glass ball. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully directed (most likely by Dev Saheb himself & not by Amarjeet, the official director) the B & W classic has evergreen music? some of the best compositions by SD Burman (with the kind support of RD Burman). "Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is probably the sexiest song ever written in Hindi films. Majrooh Sultanpuri should be credited with writing the memorable texts. Teen Devian is a breezy musical that fits in perfectly with Dev Anand's style and he did it justice. Unfortunately, Teen Devian has never received the recognition and popularity that earned it abundantly. <br /> <br /> A must for every Hindi movie fan. I will rate the eternal favorite 9.5 out of 10.
