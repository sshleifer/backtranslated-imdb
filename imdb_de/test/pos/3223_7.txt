Every time I watch this show, I just want to switch it off and curse the creators because I've wasted my time week after week. The dialogues or monologues, because everyone just constantly talks about nothing, are so boring. For example, the episode I saw yesterday started with a seemingly endless ramble about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into a war turn. And these were only a few seconds or so. <br /> <br /> So every time there seems to be many lines with absolutely zero content. The scripts they use must be enormous. <br /> <br /> But then something happens from time to time. The babbling stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent, emotional moments. For example, this week it was Lorelai's real estate agent. I just thought it was the best piece of television I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It's almost worth everything.
