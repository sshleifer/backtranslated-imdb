In the 1980s, Savage Steve Holland released three films, two of which are classics of a seemingly very small genre, absurdist teen comedies. The third "How To Into College" is not "Better Off Dead" and this one, mainly because of its lack of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (Save a tiny cameo). <br /> <br /> One Crazy Summer is an underrated movie with lots of great characterizations and gags. As far as I remember, Savage Steve's films were vilified as brain-stopping and after three movies he drifted into children's television. We could do more films of him.
