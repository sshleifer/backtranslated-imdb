This little-known comedy from Ruth Gordon's hit play is a pleasure. The piece-based script is spicy, rich and completely undated. Just like the actors, but I have to underline the work of lead actress Irene Dunne. Irene is just great - as usual - and lights up the screen with every frame she's in (and she's good at it, thank goodness). Director Vidor has also given her some unusual close-ups that are intriguing. What a girl! I do not know any other Hollywood actress from any time who has her versatility and is so compelling in any movie. Why she is so little known is a mystery. I've seen most of their films and this movie was a surprise even to a solid ID fan like me. See it all!
