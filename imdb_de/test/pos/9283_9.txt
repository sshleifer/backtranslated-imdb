Yes, non-Singaporeans can not see what the big deal about this movie is. Some of the references in this film fly over the heads of foreign audiences, and it is mainly Singaporeans who actually "get" it. But I beg you, foreigner, look at the other crap that was expelled from Singapore and compare it to this movie. It's like comparing a mule's diarhhoea chunk with a small diamond. This movie is the first to really show some of the lazy abdomens of Singapore - something that does not exist. And there is a part in the film where a gangster (ah-beng in our unique colloquial Ingris) curses in 4 languages, namely Tamil English Malay and Hokkien. Well, the truth is that most of us can always do that. The sad thing is that viewers from foreign countries will find it easier to get their small, oily claws on this gem. In his country of origin, it was initially forbidden to give him just an R rating and this with about 20 cuts to it. It's nice to know that one of the best, most creative, cool and original movies ever created is simpler, unadulterated to get uncensored films. halfway around the world than in your own nation.
