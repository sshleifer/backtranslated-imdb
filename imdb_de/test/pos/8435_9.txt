The China syndrome is a perfect thriller and neither slow nor boring, as some people say. The transitions from one scene to another are great, and the tension that builds up in the movie lasts for two hours at the edge of the seat. Jack Lemmon is great as always, as the somewhat nervous operator and Jane Fonda manage to bring real emotion back into the story. You can see this movie as a political statement of the time or simply as an intelligent thriller. In any case, it is definitely worth watching.
