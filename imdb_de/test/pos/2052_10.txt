I thought that would be a great action movie. A very good role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favorites next to Angelina Jolie. I saw The Long Kiss Goodnight right after seeing the new Tomb Raider movie. It made me think, Charlie or Lara? Which would win in a fight? In both cases, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun. Especially if they kick in the butt. I just hope to see Geena in another movie soon. Looks like she's been out of the limelight for too long. It would be nice to see her in another movie with Samuel L. Jackson. Now they are making a great duo. Watch this movie if you do not have one. You will not be disappointed.
