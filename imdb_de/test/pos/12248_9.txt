I did not really like "As Good As It Gets," but I'm a big fan of William Hurt and Holly Hunter's work, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most surprising thing for me was the great work of Albert Brooks. Here in Spain he is little known and only as a second division version of Woody Allen on the west coast. He played a great role, but also Hunter and Hurt were good, especially Hurt, a relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played the part that reminds me a bit of her role in Once Around (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991). <br /> <br /> Finally, the rest of the cast is great too. Robert Prosky, one of those familiar faces of American cinema, the ex-Bond girl Lois Chiles, placed pretty well in this role, I think, the always perfect Joan Cusack in her early years; and especially the short appearance of Jack Nicholson. Maybe he does not have a good scene, but it's Jack Nicholson anyway ... The best movie from James L.Brooks, great story (well done) and great cast for one of the best movies of the 80's
