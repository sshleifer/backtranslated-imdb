17/02/09 "More" (1969) Director: Barbet Schroeder <br /> <br /> For a movie that most viewers have agreed to, the average is pretty good. I am impressed by how many different interpretations were offered. I've been browsing the web for a very short time, and I've already been informed that "More" is a 19th century romance, an allusion to the story of Icarus, a simple movie full of boring people and just completed by Pink Floyd , So you can say that the critical reception is mixed. I would argue that these extremely different readings of 1969's Barbet Schroeder's directorial debut prove that "More" is anything but a fairly average film. <br /> <br /> Of course it's not a masterpiece either. I approached "More" when I did "Easy Rider" and Antonioni's "Blowup" as a "Time Capsule" movie, a snapshot of an era, despite the differences in tempo, style and content between these films. They all have similar shortcomings - either vague or downright unlikely characters, which seem somewhat deviant from reality, relaxed editing and abrupt endings that have outraged the viewers. These films never try to be convincing or meet the audience halfway - they are what they are, man. This is not a problem in itself, as long as we have an experience. Fortunately, "More" offers the viewer several really memorable images, sounds, and suggestions, and that is what saves him. <br /> <br /> Stefan is a young man who is coming to Paris from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he meets a group of French hipsters, accompanying them to devastating, cool and confident parties and bars before meeting Estelle. The two characters are sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow them against the advice of his friend Charlie to Ibiza. This is where the Icarus thing comes into play - it is the sun, it pursues it. You can now guess how it all comes to an end. <br /> <br /> Ibiza is an idyll so far from the bustling urgency of overpopulated Paris that naive Stefan knows he has to have a good cause. Estelle remains elusive and unpredictable, and the island has a less desirable abdomen. So far, I've paid little attention to these two characters and their unfocused pursuit of being truly free, but once the action has been reduced to just those two, the movie suddenly gets pretty moving. During a single nostalgic dialogue change in the secluded villa, where her fleeting love crystallizes, I was totally taken away by a fading optimism. I can not imagine many other films that did that. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and humane as we can see that it leads from life-affirming intimacy to disappointment and cruel cold. They take a lot of drugs and frolic naked on the terraces, the rocks and the beaches. Her life is about nothing but the beautiful Mediterranean environment. For a while her situation is the essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for her own sake. But Stefan is not in control and this is the downfall of more than just his future in Ibiza. <br /> <br /> Pink Floyd's score fits perfectly with the exoticism, intimacy and foreshadowing of "More". , It's one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito net around Estelles Bed and her hallucinatory exuberance around the windmill (which appears on the front page of the soundtrack). A scene in which they need acid to escape heroin withdrawal illustrates the couple's fundamental flaws - they can not land without crashing. Maybe they got too close to what they wanted. <br /> <br /> Stefan never makes contact with a family or friends before arriving in Paris. We can assume that they have no idea where he is. While other 1960s counterculture films have to do with debauchery, excessiveness, media, and voyeurism, Schr√∂der instead presents a story about a man retreating to a small corner somewhere in the world and silently disappearing.
