Flash Gordon is undoubtedly the best of all American series. In a time before 1936, Universal was able to make such an entertaining story, and twenty years later, when I saw it as a child for the first time, it involved me in a great adventure and a great emotion. Buster Crabbe was the hero we always wanted in our childhood, and Jean Rogers, the beautiful girl we always dreamed of. Dragons, octopuses, monsters, gorillas were also the attraction. Charles Middleton was a great presence as Ming, the Merciless. A true predecessor of George Lucas' starwars.
