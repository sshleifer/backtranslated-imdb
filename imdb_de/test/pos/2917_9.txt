After reading all the comments on this film, I'm still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a restored full-screen version on DVD. Yes, the story may be a bit inaccurate and certainly not as strong as the book, BUT it was Fox's second film shot in Real Cinemascope, and the production values ​​alone deserve restoration and distribution. I saw this movie in second grade and aroused my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian that culminated in my visit to Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of the movie about the imagination of a child, right? In high school, I read the book and made a promise to one day take this dream trip. Well, this movie was done in the "Old School" style, which means that the Egyptians were portrayed by pink and blue-eyed Brits. Has anyone seen the current HBO series "ROME"? Everything old is old again. It's hard to imagine why we still hurl actors as Mayfair aristocrats in Roman strain at this time. Not a single actor on ROM could go over for an old Italian. Nevertheless, the AMARNA period in Egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history. This film is extremely appealing (to borrow a word from NEFER) for its historical information (BEER! BRAIN SURGERY! IRON!) And its great cinematography and score. I have a horrible Taiwan DVD version that I keep watching and praying that someday a real restored widescreen version will be available. For anyone else interested in this topic, I recommend the historical novel "A God Against the Gods" by the author of Advise and Consent. If any of you film a friend who knows how to get in touch with Fox to encourage him, let me know!
