Hoot was great. The owls are adorable and the movie shows an interesting environmental problem that I did not know existed. There are so many funny characters in Florida, and the movie brings it to the screen. My children especially loved the different animals, from snakes to owls to alligators. It's really a simple story, but also one that you must hear at this age. When children are young, they really develop their sense of values, and yes, one of them has to care for our environment and all living beings living in it. I think it's great that the movie on the ride home even a conversation with them about animals and how they can help them, was triggered. It was just cute and persistent when I heard my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the little birds. All in all, it was really a great time and I would recommend the movie to anyone looking for something FUN AND meaningful.
