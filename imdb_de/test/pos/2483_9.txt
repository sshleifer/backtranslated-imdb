This extraordinary pseudo documentary from 1971 captures America's zeitgeist perfectly ... making it all the more scary and relevant. "Subversives" (college students, hippies, black activists, academics) are rounded up by the government and given long prison terms for the amount of imaginary crimes and social protest. As an alternative to living in jail, these convicted "criminals" are being offered for three days at Punishment Park. Your goal in the park is to get to the American flag, where freedom awaits. Not surprisingly, the Punishment Park option is a dirty lie. This brilliant film by Peter Watkins is even older than "Battle Royale" and "Series 7," though the angle of attack is obviously more political. It was taken in '71 and looks as fresh as it does today. The performances are exemplary and the direction is crisp. The narrative alternates between different groups trying to weather the harsh conditions of the park and the McCarthy-like processes that have taken them over. Today, this movie retains its power. In '71 there was nothing, but nothing like it. This is a masterpiece that succeeds on a dozen levels. It has the bullets that most people have lost today.
