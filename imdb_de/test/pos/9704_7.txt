Like the first team, the JACKASS team is back and trying to kill themselves as they see fit. Either it fits in a tractor tire and rolls down a slope worse. <br /> <br /> The first one was crazy, and that's the way to describe it. It was also a really hard laughing movie. But this movie is completely crazy. He has even more dangerous stunts and laughs even harder. I think it's the funniest thing to see dumb idiots kill themselves. <br /> <br /> Before BORAT comes out, I'll laugh my A **.
