I first saw this in the theater in 1969, when I was nine years old, and immediately fell in love with this theater. I find it sad that Sony did not release this DVD ("but one day, one day ..."). I recently received a VHS copy of it on eBay and viewed it 39 years later. I am happy to report that it still stands the time. The acting is perfect, John Williams' orchestrations are lush and the songs of Leslie Bricusse memorable ("When I'm older," "You and me," "Fill the world with love," "London is London") And not enough about Peter O 'Toole, Petula Clarke, Michael Redgrave and the acting of Michael Bryant. Terence Rattigan deserves an A + for his update of the James Hilton story. There's nothing like this movie. It is a good encouragement, glad that they have released the original soundtrack as a three-CD set with many extras. I wish Sony would hurry and do the same with the movie.
