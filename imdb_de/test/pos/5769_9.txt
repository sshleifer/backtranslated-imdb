A sign of what to expect in this movie came at the time I realized that this was the first (and probably the last) movie that had a "Vomit Technician" in its credits hours of silly gags, witty violence and excellent slapstick humor. <br /> <br /> This movie was exactly what you would expect from the bottom guys, and it's great to see them in top shape after Rik Mayall's life again. <br /> <br /> Richie (Mayall) and Eddie (Edmondson) are too similar to their bottom characters, if we can even criticize, and Edmondson does the movie surprisingly well too. <br /> <br /> This movie has already produced the predictable comparisons with Fawlty Towers that are simply not there, and the Guest House Paradiso itself is hardly Torquay! <br /> <br /> Pay attention to some excellent processing dialogue between all the violence and the chaos. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Bottom, you probably hate it - but I loved it.
