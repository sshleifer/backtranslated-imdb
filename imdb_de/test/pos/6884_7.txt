Yong-ki Jeong's "puppet masters with scary games" was the last Korean horror band I was allowed to watch. With the title "Inhyeongsa" in Asia, I immediately noticed this movie when I saw it online. With pictures that reminded me of Puppet Master, Childs Play, and other toy / doll-based horror movies. But for some reason, I did not think ... "Boy, this is going to be fierce," I imagined it was scary and funny. Toysome horror almost done well. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly but I like it so it was good. The score, almost as I found it at Acacia, was beautiful and reminded me a lot of classic horror scores of the past. I will not reveal much, but the story was strong in this story and I would highly recommend it to any fan of Asian HORROR. It's not extreme, it's not serious, but it's really good.
