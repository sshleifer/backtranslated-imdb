King of the queens is a funny genius. Kevin James, who plays as IPS distributor Doug Heffernan, is extremely funny. Leah Remini, who plays Doug's wife Carrie, is incredibly hot (# 19 on Stuff's hottest 102 women's list) and very funny. The true magic of the show However, the scenes with Jerry Stiller are the funniest on the show. Jerry, a funny genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, who lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold cellar. I have to admit that I did not see this show until 2006. Whenever I had previously turned it around, I never thought it was funny, but with the cancellation of Friends, Still Standing, and Yes Dear, I needed a new comedy. Actually giving the King of Queens a chance, I discovered that it was absolutely fantastic. So funny that I downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched each season in 8-hour blocks. I urge anyone who has not seen this treasure to check it. You will not be disappointed.
