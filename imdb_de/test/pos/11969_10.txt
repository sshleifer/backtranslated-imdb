In some places scary, though the effects leave something to be desired, unless you have poor eyesight or are afraid of the dark. Most of the plays, however, were convincing and most of the effects were well done. I thought the creature looked a little too much like a man in a gorilla suit for my taste. It reminded me of the original pink panther movie.
