I saw this movie in 1997 at the Telluride Film Festival, where one of the scriptwriters, Jos√© Giovanni, was honored. It is considered a great noir crime drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura. The attention given to each figure and complex psychological representations that describe loyalty, betrayal, love and hope are enormous. It's an excellent drama, an excellent thriller and an excellent movie. Up there with the best of Melville. (The English title "Class all risk", "Classe tous risques") is a pun on "Classe Touriste" and means "Tourist Class".
