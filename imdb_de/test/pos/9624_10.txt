This was the very first kung fu movie I have ever seen. The synchronization is not the best, but much better than some I've seen. The plot is much better than some done today. It is sometimes bloody, but that gives it a special boost. Oscar material is not. But if you like to see fights and a decent story in the background, this is for you!
