Since frame 1, you know that the good in a suit and tie is doomed to failure? He has no luck ("sort Nula"), so he believes with this music in the car radio and the dubious speech of his best friend and business partner, who leads him through a desert road into unknown parts. Alberto just wanted to be alone, fly abroad the next day, with? Well, someone we advise. <br /> <br /> The movie goes far? that will be short ?? to a final scene in which the man hears the same music in a taxi to the airport. In between, some lucky people have found different ways, some died, some were born, others were in desperate need. This time he is really doomed to failure? Or is he? The film is a kind of one-man show by director Fernando Fragata, who has left the sound recording and special effects only to other, competent people. Anyone who rejects typical Portuguese films because of sound problems and unclear voice recording, this time has to look for other topics to criticize this. The car accident (these are not spoilers, the movie is too smart for that) makes a great scene and was apparently made with cheap equipment. (Note US studios: You can save a dollar or two by hiding competent Portuguese directors!) <br/> <br /> The rest was done by Fragata, from script to dialogue, from camera work to editing. If one part of the dialogue has been attacked, it has to be congratulated again for the acting direction and the casting with mostly inexperienced actors. A large number of non-linguistic parts will be credited, but most of these people were used for the music video clip and the making of, which is extensively used in the film's advertising trailer. The cast has a dozen actors and actresses, ten of whom are relevant, and a large number of relationships. These are revealed step by step in an exciting and exciting way, reminiscent of the best genre authors. 'Alfred Hitchcock' (qv) and 'Claude Chabrol' (qv) come to my mind through the cat-and-mouse game between the director and his audience and the nature of his characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this thriller and this comedy to Portuguese speakers and, if the film is to receive a decent translation of its colloquial dialogue, anyone abroad who loves these genres.
