I came across this movie when I surfed the channel one day. and decided to give it a chance. To my surprise, I liked this Darkhorse movie. I felt a real chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. It was such a carefree and warm-hearted film that I felt a departure after the end. Sure, this movie was predictable from the start, but I give it high grades for the way it felt when it was over. I have to admit that I have never seen Challen Cates before, but I feel she can definitely act. If you combine her good acting with her cute face and her attractive figure. She has what it takes to become at least a well-known star.
