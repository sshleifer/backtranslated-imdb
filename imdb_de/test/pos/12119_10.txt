Samuel Fuller knows the war and is one of the few directors in American film history who has been able to portray the terrible experiences in a form like film. His pessimism and idealism, when it sounds a bit strange to mix, act as a storyteller for him, and at the same time, he is always anxious to tell the truth, no matter how brutal (or in melodramatic constructs) he can go. Forbidden, however, is concerned with the post-war experience, since in the opening scenes we are only witnessing the great upswing of WARKühnen. The opening shot is like a big exclamation mark that continues into the rest of the scenes: a dead soldier on the ground, the camera pans up, we see another soldier shot dead in a war-torn terrain. Simple, direct language. Then Fuller emphasizes the intensity with something interesting: The title song played as a lead both irony and sincerity and then Beethoven music in a shootout between Americans and Nazis. Sgt David Brent (James Best) is shot, the fight continues and then he goes over to him, who is being treated for his wounds. <br /> <br /> This might lead one to believe that this is going to be a somewhat conventional WWII film (something in which you could not normally find Beethoven and later added Wagner to those images), but that's not the case. Instead, Fuller turns the movie into a "coming home" movie, but not in the sense that "this soldier comes home injured, and so on and so forth." Instead of really going home, Brent stays in Germany as he falls headlong into the butt for Helga's wife (Susan Cummings, pretty good at dissuading the German accent), and he wants to work in a smaller position in the military What he does not realize is that a) she wants him more for money, so she can get food for herself and her brother, but this becomes emotional in the place of revelation over the somewhat naïve, but heartfelt Brent, and b) there is an underground The youth sect of Hitler called the werewolves, who want to continue immediately, where Hitler, despite quarrels within the group began small. He attacked the government, which is now anchored in Germany, to give them, as Brent describes, a "blood transfusion". "With this plus footage from the Nuremberg Trials and (as Fuller himself tells me) piece by piece with a quick, uncomplicated history of Nazi war crimes, we get a multi-faceted look at a society in dire need of an immediate postwar environment With the Germany Year Zero done in his own way, Fuller goes into layers: First, there is the love story or what is the tragic downfall of a man who sees nothing about what he thinks should be reasonable woman and a Child on the way he can not leave until the revelation that he was (partially) cheated Baker and Cummings, along with Harold Daye as Helga's young, confused brother, perform the emotions in as much detail as possible B-movie parts, although they could have been, then another layer is the political one, the fight one Society to control the conquest, and a mentality made sensational by Fuller to turn the Nazis into a total non-greyhound thing: they are evil, especially if they obliterate the cause to achieve their goals. <br /> <br /> And finally there is the style layer that absorbs strangely. This is probably one of Fuller's "most talkative" films, which is not bad considering it's one of his best-written screenplays because the characters do not speak simply or in too many platitudes (with the exception of a small scene, in) the two scenes are present) The characters speak of the Hitler Youth as juvenile offenders, which according to Fuller's autobiography is probably another layer that has to be considered in the subtext and in the 50s of the films. And Fuller shoots this almost in a real European style, unless he chooses fight scenes or battles, because the editing is not always very fast and sometimes a cut is not made for a full minute or longer. There is a strange tension that develops from it, especially when something is said of a figure who gets another wild or suspicious person; Fuller could easily opt for a big close-up, but there's a scarier, cold quality if you do not distract from two people in a conversation without a simple over-the-shoulder deal. But if necessary, like the big brawl in front of the American military office or the Nuremberg footage spun in Franz's memories of the werewolves, Fuller can be as stunning a stylist as ever. <br /> <br /> Very hard to find. But it's worth it if you're either a fan of director or WW2 movies shot in Germany - or just a history buff! is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional experience, with a cast that is better than expected from a B-movie, and an attitude towards the "other" that is equally harmful and thought-provoking.
