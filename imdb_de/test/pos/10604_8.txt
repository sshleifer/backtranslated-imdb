I saw this movie for the first time in a video library and had to borrow it as a Bam Margera fan to see what it was about. Since I have a big and stupid (with the word stupid) humor, I found this movie absolutely funny. Some parts are pointless and random, but that makes them so amusing. You have to think that things like blows to the face and blows to the head with a watermelon are funny to appreciate this movie. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by the acting. These people did a really good job. Nothing Oscar worthy, but good enough to overcome the amateur level. Adolescents and young adults would probably find this more entertaining due to the modern colloquial language and the situations used. I would not recommend seeing this with your parents and vice versa. <br /> <br /> All in all, the show was great, the script was funny and the story is really something to identify with.
