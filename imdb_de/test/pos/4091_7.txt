The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, directing and music are fascinating. It seems to me that the reason why so many rate the film with a low score is the devotion to the original 1937 version with Ronald Coleman. This movie - for a good reason! - has produced an incredible amount of commitment. I'm talking to people who saw the original when it first came out, and I think the influence was similar to the first "Star Wars" movie of modern times. I've seen it. It was and is wonderful. But that does not mean that this version is not worthy either. From the first scene the 1973 version loots you. The noise and turmoil are fantastic, especially as they prepare you for the tranquility of Shangri La. And Burt Bacharach's music is beautiful. So - definitely enjoy the 1937 version. However, do not let it spoil your enjoyment of this version of 1973, as if you were going to get the King Kong of 1935 to destroy Peter Jackson this year.
