Disney's Buena Vista Pictures presents a wonderfully told fact-based sports drama directed by actor Bill Paxton. The photography is great, but the story sometimes rumbles. This film is about the 20-year-old amateur golfer Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) and his competition at the 1913 US Open. What a story; a unique opportunity for an allegedly inept young man to play alongside the best golfers of his time, including British master Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus). One end of the picture book leaves a knot in the throat. The cast also includes: Peter Firth, Elias Koteas, Marnie McPhail, Robin Wilcox, and possibly stealing the show is Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowery, Ouimet's caddy and best friend.
