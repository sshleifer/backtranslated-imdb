It's less visceral than the only other Tsai movie I've ever seen ("Vive L'amour"), but the idea of ​​opening doors (holes) in the emotions and existences of others is vividly illustrated here, as Tsai Long-Shot set up for long-shot Usually with long takes, which suggests a sense of alienation in Taipei. The musical interludes inspired by Grace Chang are amazing, but welcome milestones that add new dimensions to the slowly developing relationship between the young man upstairs and the woman below. It's not necessarily a simple movie (though it's by no means burdened) so I would warn any casual viewer looking for "indie" entertainment (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you want to know about the isolation among the city dwellers of Taiwan and something more universal about urban alienation and romantic longing, then watch this movie right away.
