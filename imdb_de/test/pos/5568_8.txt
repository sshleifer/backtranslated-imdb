When I saw the premiere episode of Farscape for the first time, I had no idea what to expect. I was very impressed and satisfied with "Premiere". Subsequent repetitions, however, have made numerous defects visible, which I initially overlooked. "Premiere" is not a great Farscape episode, but it deserves credit for making the storyline successful and efficient and conveying the background stories of many normal characters. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with John Crichton (Ben Browder), an astronaut and scientist who wants to launch into space in the Farscape Module, a small spaceship perfected by Crichton and his friend DK. Crichton leads an enlightening conversation with his father Jack Crichton and then begins his test flight in space. Of course everything goes awry and Crichton is "shot through a wormhole" and meanders into "a distant part of the galaxy". After leaving the wormhole, Crichtons module is towed aboard a living space ship. From here, the characters and storyline of the Farscape series are presented in an entertaining yet fun way. <br /> <br /> The regular characters are properly introduced in the first half of the episode. Of course there is Crichton, well played by Ben Browder. He offers the audience a sympathetic character with whom he can identify. He is lost and has no idea how he can do anything of everything. In "Premiere" Crichton has to choose whether he wants to join the prisoner or the Peacekeepers. He knows nothing about both sides, but if he helps Aeryn (a captured Peacekeeper pilot) it's clear he wants to help the peacekeepers. He probably would not have been on the side of the prisoners if Crais had not been the Peacekeeper captain and declared Crichton a murderer for his brother. This puts Crichton in an interesting situation: He clings to bizarre, violent prisoners in a distant galaxy he knows nothing about. Crichton's lack of knowledge about the Farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist in the first season of Farscape. <br /> <br /> The side occupation is just as convincing. There's Zhaan, a blue Delvian and a former prisoner. She is peaceful and reasonable, unlike her captive Ka D'Argo, a powerful and hard-boiled warrior. Virginia Hey is totally wrapped in blue make-up and makes her character of Zhaan cool and convincing. By contrast, D'Argo's mega make-up is below average. He seems somehow stupid with his huge tentacles and his strange nose, and his eyes have something special. They look as if they have had an allergic reaction to their makeup. Farscape would make some improvements to his make-up in Season One, but the overall costume would remain a problem for me until at least Season Two. <br /> <br /> The dolls / digital characters of Rygel and Pilot are simply excellent. Rygel is a tiny Hynerian Dominar hovering on a kind of hovercraft. In "Premiere" he gets some good dialogues, but not much else. The pilot almost steals the show as a link between the living ship, Moya and the passengers of Moya. Even in the first episode, Pilot gives the appearance of being a real, living alien. He never seems to be a huge, expensive machine on the show once. <br /> <br /> The introduced Peacekeeper characters are also very interesting. The peacekeepers are made up of a race called Sebaceans that looks like humans. The main antagonist is featured in "Premiere" as Captian Crais, who believes Crichton has killed his brother. In fact, the death of Crais' brother was just an accident due to an accidental collision with Crichton's ship. Aeryn Sun, a pilot who helps Crichton escape, tries to explain that death was an accident, but Crais simply claims that she is "irreversiby" and refuses to change his mind. Crai's obsession for revenge, justifiable or not (it should be clear to Crais that Crichton is not responsible for it), is mysterious in "Premiere," but would be explained later in the season. Aeryn itself offers a very interesting character. By being forced to leave the Peacekeepers, she changes her entire way of life and is in a similar (albeit less severe) situation like Crichton in this regard. The actual episode feels, as already mentioned, something rushed and clunky. So much happens that not enough time is spent on anything. In addition, D'Argo (for now) looks foolish running around in his mediocre costume, trying to be threatening. Nevertheless, "Premiere" is a solid entertainment. The special effects (as in the Starburst sequences) are impressive. Most of the costumes and sets aboard Moya are original. Despite its shortcomings, "Premiere" is a must for Farscape fans. 3.4
