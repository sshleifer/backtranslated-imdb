I inherited it from my DVD collection when he went with my best friend (enough said), one night when there was nothing on TV (nothing new there) and got a very pleasant surprise. Very British (you have little budget, no faces you know or have seen), the accents were a bit too thick for my taste, but after a worrying start (a bit too close to my home in my case) he started to grow on me Apart from a few unnecessary jokes that did not really add anything, I found the film consistently uplifting, very real, natural performances, and I always wanted more of an ending that came too soon. Highly recommended!
