Magnificent, original, beautiful movie. The acting is great, the settings and decors are outstanding (Paris at its best - but then the real Paris, not the famous settings) and the music will do it too. A brilliant story, very detailed, which I love very much. <br /> <br /> The best French movie I have ever seen (and French cinema is very good)!
