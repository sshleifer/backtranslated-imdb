This is a brilliant movie. The story begins in Romania, where Billy Crystal acts as an agent who can persuade anyone to do something. There's a really funny scene in which Crystal is a kid, and persuades his father, who is a rabbi, to eat pork. He is mainly a talent scout and tries to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole movie has a terrible crew, he accidentally falls into a small river. Believing that he is dead, some big hands come out to reach him. He later thinks he is in heaven. He finds out he is not, but he is in a monastery. If he believes that God has saved him, he becomes a monk and seeks out the one who saved him. He later finds a 7ft 7 in the man he throws as the perfect villain (he also recites Shakespeare!). Watch the movie and find out the rest!
