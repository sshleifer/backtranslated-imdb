The plot shows the ulterior motives of American politics. While the theme seems generic, what makes the movie "is" the unconventional way the story is told. <br /> <br /> The characters are played with conviction. You feel the innocence of leadership and his innocence lost. The politician is the prince of Double Talk, a real snake. <br /> <br /> The camera work is impressive. It affirms the subtleties of acting and dialogue. The same applies to the music. <br /> <br /> The story uses a likeness style with Vingette's, in which the message is filled with double emissaries. A very clever strategy of the writer / director. The tension in the plot is transmitted to the last scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie was like a good mystery book. Something was "on foot"; They knew it was bad. You did not know exactly what it might be - you had your suspicions; and when the evil was revealed, you lost your breath, and you did not notice that you were holding yourself in it. Sad and shook his head. 3 Cheers to a young author / director.
