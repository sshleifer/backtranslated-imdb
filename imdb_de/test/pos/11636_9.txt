OK. To enjoy this quiet comedy, you MUST expose the unbelief of the main starting point of the movie. If you can not do that, you're probably going to rate this movie a lot lower. Charlie Chase has a HUGE overbite and his wife has a nose big enough to have their own area code. They are not sure, they have both saved for surgery to correct these defects. Apparently the plastic and dental surgery was better in the 1920s, as apparently none of these major surgeries had to recover and they looked good immediately !! Okay, remember, I said I should ignore that, right ?! Okay, then you have to ignore the hard-to-believe idea that both could meet and have no idea that the other is their spouse. Okay, well, now that you've taken care of those stupid assumptions, the movie is going to be really, really good. Charlie makes a pass against her and she makes a pass against him. Both are shocked and enthusiastic because no one has ever considered them attractive. Because of this new vanity, they agree on a date. But both sneak back home and do not want their spouses to know! However, they meet later and get dressed a lot. But what about the poor spouses supposedly at home? Well, both learn that the other is married and both expect their marriages to lead to divorce because they really want to be together! Later in the film, Charlie realizes that the woman is really his wife, and he goes through a very funny sequence in which he plays both the friend and the old husband - by changing clothes and inserting false teeth when he is the husband plays! It's really a laugh-riot when he sees jumping in and out of the room as he seems to be battling with another person! You really have to see it to believe it. However, the woman sees an ad on Charlie before and after photos and knows what's going on. In the end, both feel pretty stupid!
