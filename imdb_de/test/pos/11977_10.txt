This movie is without a doubt the best I have seen in my life. The Star Star Cast is just an added bonus to the amazing special effects and profound story and sublime choreography. The film is about an old love affair that fits into the modern world. Two lovers in heaven suffer the wrath of a great sage and are cursed. Then the woman is born again on the earth. During her studies, she is raped and commits suicide. The rest of the film essentially focuses on the hunt for the people associated with the rape of their lover, who possesses superhuman strength and mastery of several languages. Sonu Nigam delivers a very mature and deep performance in this film, and all the other actors do it almost as well. The action scenes with Akshay Kumar are overwhelming and must not be missed. You MUST just watch this movie !!!
