Less Than Zero could have been the '80s film that revealed the apathy of teenagers in their most extreme form, if they had actually stuck to the damned book. But where this was not the case, this film does its job and leaves a scary feeling when it's all over and was made into "kids" and "bully" with Larry Clark's movies in the late nineties. <br /> <br /> Teens expelled from society face a rather curious dilemma (they do not treat it like one) when their estranged friend (Daniel Roebuck) shows them that he's a young girl at the river's edge has killed in her suburb. Keanu Reeves is perhaps the only civilized character among the bunch, the only one willing to show any conscience, while the others either do nothing about the girl's death or help her boyfriend hide the body. <br /> <br /> I do not know who in this movie is more ill - Crispin Glover - who has become almost obsessed and fatherly as he tries to protect his friend and hide the crime by exposing him smuggled into the state. Dennis Hopper, a top-notch drug dealer (who clings to a female blowup doll), who befriends the teenagers (of course, as a dealer) and is suddenly involved in the events. Or Josh Miller, who plays the little brother of Reeve, Tim. He seems to be the most apathetic of all, at least until his emotional breakdown at the end. It's definitely not a dizzying 80s fare. And certainly the point makes it strikingly clear that these children (despite a bizarre series of events) despite numerous great performances (Reeves also proved to be acting) have a great distance. <br /> <br /> Help yourself to a comedy that will recover if it weighs you too hard.
