Rita Hayworth lights up the screen in this fun, offbeat and adorable musical starring Gene Kelly. Rita plays nightclub dancer Rusty Parker, who dreams of becoming a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately, her career in Danny McGuire's nightclub is not an issue. When one of her dancers says that she will take part in a cover girl contest, she decides to follow her dreams and enters. She reminds the publisher of her grandmother, whom he was in love with many years ago. But when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy about it. <br /> <br /> I had never seen Rita before, and I'm so glad I did! She has such a scene presence and is a very good actress. There are some good numbers here, not the best of all musicals, but they are melodic and easy to hear. One thing I did not like was Gene Kelly's character. He should have supported his girlfriend! But that may be the only criticism I have about this film. Cover Girl is a glorious, fluffy movie - perfect escapism. Not everyone is the ideal movie, but a wonderful movie because of the star power of Rita Hayworth. Great movie, really impressed.
