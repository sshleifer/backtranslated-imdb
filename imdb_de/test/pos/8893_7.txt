Billy Crystal is Larry, a writer who has not written and is suspected of murder in "Throw Momma Off the Train" and costs Danny Devito and Anne Ramsey. The phrase "black comedy" was invented for this madness, which is a start of Hitchcock's "strangers in a train". In fact, Owen (Devito) comes up with the idea that Larry kills his mother in exchange for Owen killing Larry's ex when he saw this famous movie. "I saw the movie, criss-cross," Owen tells Larry. Not that Larry knows what he's talking about until it seems it's too late - just like "strangers." Larry, a writing teacher, claims that his former wife, played by Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and wrote her name on it. She became a big celebrity and appeared on "Oprah," where she calls Larry "an animal." Owen is in the class of Larry. He lives with an abusive Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and has visions of poisoning her, scissors in her head - you name it. It is not long after "Strangers in a Train" that he is in Honolulu and is persecuting Larry's wife. As she leans over a boat railing and tries to get an earring, Owen stands behind her and sneaks up... Soon the police are looking for Larry to question him, but he is with Owen, where he is encouraged Bargain he had no idea that he had done. You know, "criss-cross". There are several scenes that were copied by "Strangers" and are very funny. I especially liked Larry's confession of sleeping Mrs. Lift, Owen's mother, much as Guy thinks he's talking to Bruno's stepfather. Crystal and DeVito dominate the weird dialogue and timing and they'll make you laugh a lot. Ramsey is repulsively funny - an absolutely "outside" performance. Griest is also Crystal's girlfriend, and Reiner has what a cameo means. <br /> <br /> The end is very clever and the whole movie will make you laugh.
