First of all, I've never met Dr. Who came in contact. Honestly, I have never had the opportunity to see one of the previous incarnations (pun intended), as it was never "big" here in the US, like everywhere else. <br /> <br /> That means, I have to say (obviously) that after the end of season two is one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now I watch a lot of sci-fi shows from everywhere and this show is striking. <br /> <br /> The first season was in the title role from the beginning with Christopher Eccleston and I thought he was great. Of course it was the adorable Billie Piper who adds so much humanity and warmth to the character of Rose that no one could have done better. Let's not forget Camile Coduri as Jackie and Noel Clarke as Mickey / Ricky who are just plain to see. Then there is David Tenannt. At first, I thought he looked too rude to play the character (his ears !!), but after seeing Season 2, it fits in well. His sharp and physical comedy is almost flawless. He's great in snappy dialogues and can get serious without batting an eye. <br /> <br /> Apart from the great spectacles of the cast, the spectacle is that of most guest performers who have appeared. Many of them are experienced actors, but some are new to me and are damn good. <br /> <br /> The production and direction of the show is first class. Occasionally there are a few cheesy effects here and there, but that has always been a factor in the original series and, like these episodes, is negligible. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about the series: The Stories. Writing people is always the key to good conversation. Russell T. Davies has written many episodes along with a few other authors and they have done a great job. They have managed to bring excitement, ingenuity, intelligence and fun with clever concepts and great dialogue. I also appreciate their ability to break through the old storylines of the older doctors and enemies (my friend explains a lot to me while watching the show) and respectfully. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to mention anything about season two and how it's been ending since the sci-fi channel just started broadcasting the second season. <br /> <br /> I do not want to ruin her. It's so much fun and excitement. They never want to avert their gaze or miss a word of dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's really that good. <br /> <br /> PS: Thanks to the producers for Nicholas Briggs! **DESTROY!**
