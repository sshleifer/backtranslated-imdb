Madonna has shaken the boat for over 20 years, and that brings a lot of experience - obviously - and a lot of knowledge. She was never the one who thought about yesterday, except Contraire, she seemed to know what will become popular tomorrow. She courageously takes with her all the latest trends and technologies and integrates them into her own actions. Her world travels were never "average". When Madonna appears, she gives 120% - everything is bigger, better, theatrical and meaningful. It takes inspiration from East, West and then makes it unique. Everything has a deeper meaning, and The Confessions Tour is no different. From the beginning you sit on the edge of the chair. She starts off with a bang, then she makes brave circus poses on a horse high in the sky and does her utmost to keep you entertained. She repeats her own songs and gives them a modern feel. She sings on a disco-cross, she's almost in the middle of the stage, and with her amazing dance crew, who knows no dimensions of fear, the show is absolutely more than you expected. It is a spectacle, an audio-visual orgasm that can not be put into words. Lucky are those who have actually seen Madonna on stage. At fifty, she is still in an incredible shape. The last Sticky and Sweet tour is even more groundbreaking, which proves nothing else than Madonna was, is and always is the only and only Queen of Pop.
