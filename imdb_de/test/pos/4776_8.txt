Mickey Mouse was founded in 1928 and was originally called Mortimer before Walt Disney changed its name (because his wife had convinced him). I always thought that cartoon was the first one in which Mickey was seen. It's actually the third, but it does not matter, it's nice for a six-minute animated short. In the story, Mickey sees a steamship until Captain Pete takes him off the bridge to pick up the cargo, and Minnie Mouse misses the boat. As she gets raised, she drops her sheet music and a goat eats her, Mickey helps her turn the tail and play the tune, and brings some other animals to percussion until Pete comes back to stop him and Mickey potatoes peel. Mickey Mouse was number 53 in the 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons and he was number 31 in the 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very well!
