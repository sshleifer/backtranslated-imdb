I can not praise this movie enough. There were a lot of such handheld cameras that I personally like (and some hate because they make them sick), like REC, Cloverfield, and Blair Witch Project. A long movie for its kind, but I did not even notice it because the movie was so interesting was. By showing only the material from a paranormal reporter's work, the film keeps the tempo up and makes it a real-time experience for the viewer. I have to say it is certainly one of the best I have ever seen. The fear factor consists of details in the images, camera shifts, and interrelated events that give the film a very mysterious and haunting tone. The horror is more in what is not shown, but is left to our imagination. The end is perfect, and be warned that you could have nightmares afterwards. A second visit is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Watch this video alone in the dark, do not expect anything and you will have fun.
