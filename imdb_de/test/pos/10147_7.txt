A pretty little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigan around a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, an awkward church, a strange conspiracy and some random taxidermy. Jimmy Stewart is still a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips to a cool climax at an embassy event, but lacks the menacing threat of Hitchcock's black and white, cheap original. Still a wonderful movie from the stable of the great master.
