I was reluctant to see this streak before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here. Why? First, because Mick Malloy's humor (in my humble opinion) can be pretty gross and exaggerated, as evidenced by his unfortunate hustle and bustle on a television program a few years ago. And second, because good Australian comedy films are unfortunately as rare as the Tassie Tiger. <br /> <br /> Reasonably enough, Mick has withheld his natural comedy in this surprising-looking movie. Who would have thought that a Bowls club provides the setting for one of the funniest Australian films in years. The cast is excellent with well-known local vintage cars, all of which bring credible benefits. <br /> <br /> Interesting to see how John Clarke plays the villain in this play. It's a one-dimensional part, but JC adds a touch of class, as always. Good to see that Judith Lucy also gets a Guernsey or should I see uniforms on the big screen. She's a real talent, too bad a bunch of her retorts was a target. Your own material is much funnier. Interesting character. Bowls reporter on a local rag. How deep can you be in the food chain of journalists !! Crackerjack may not be the funniest movie I've seen this year, but it's certainly a nice change worth looking at. Many other people obviously agree with me as it will be the biggest Australian movie this year. It's good to see someone finally make a bizarre, gentle comedy without trying to beat the laughter like so many Australian "comedies" do. <br /> <br /> Finally, a few little things. If you're wondering which Aussie Rules team supports Mick, check the flag on his workstation. Also watch out for his old criminal partner, Tony Martin, who makes the announcement on the final bowl scene. <br /> <br /> <br />
