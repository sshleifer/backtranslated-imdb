When I researched Susan Harrison (The Ballerina) for a Bonanza episode, I was reminded of this gem. <br /> <br /> This episode is the inspiration for Dylan's "All Along the Watch Tower" (Hendrix's cover is probably so you know and is one of his best), which is one of his best. <br /> <br /> So this episode is responsible for several "bests" - not bad for about 22 minutes of watching TV. <br /> <br /> But that's "The Twilight Zone". Another comment of the series is not required. <br /> <br /> '5 Characters' is typical of Serling. Intense, dramatic and aiming for an ending that is as unavoidable in retrospect as it is surprising when you first see it. <br /> <br /> This episode is spoiled in a sentence and too bad to spoil it. <br /> <br /> But you will feel ambushed. And you will never hear Hendrix again with the same ears.
