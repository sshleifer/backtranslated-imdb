"Footprints (on the Moon)" is certainly the strangest, most confused and atypical Giallo ever made. It may be a restraint for some fans of the sub-genre, but this film does not feature many of Giallo's usual trademarks, such as bloody knife murders (preferably with a masked killer in black gloves), gorgeously dressed beauties, and unpredictable red herrings. To compensate for all this? and much more ?? "Footprints" benefits from the indescribably mysterious and unceasing atmosphere that I've ever experienced in this kind of movie. The level of mystery in this movie is so high and unbearable that you literally feel uncomfortable and scared. Like the protagonist Alice Cespi herself, you have absolutely no idea what's going on or why, and this feeling of extreme powerlessness is undoubtedly the film's main strength. As a viewer, you long to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her, but you simply can not. Alice has a successful career as an interpreter, but her quiet and peaceful life is brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly realizes that she does not remember the last three days at all. She finds a torn-up photograph of a hotel on the holiday island of Gama and decides to drive there to investigate what happened. On the island, several people, including a lonely little girl, seem to recognize Alice, only she used the wrong name of Nicole, wearing a red-haired wig, pretending she was coming to the island to hide from some unknown danger. In the meantime, even the poor girl's nights are restless, as she's always dreaming of astronauts bouncing on the lunar surface, and of a sinister scientist named Dr. Blackman. The plot of "Footprints" is really bizarre and slowly brooding, and especially the cosmic negotiation is really hard to connect with the rest. Alice assumes that these are just pictures from a sci-fi movie she's seen a long time ago, which sounds like a reasonable explanation, but you feel it has a deeper meaning and connection to all of them other events there. Fans of suspenseful and stylish Italian cinemas can not afford to miss this movie. This is Luigi Bazzoni's psychological tour-de-force, with breathtakingly beautiful photographs and breathtaking music. Despite the lack of violence (or maybe because of it), the movie is really disturbing and the mental torment Alice is experiencing also affects the viewer in an emotional way. Unfortunately, this is too often the case in the Gialli Cinema, so the climax is suddenly quite abrupt and provides almost no watertight explanation for all the unpleasant events you've experienced over the last hour and a half. Nevertheless, the content of "Footprints" will be considered long after the movie ends, and its impact will only increase. Florinda Bolkan is considered a tormented leading actress and receives excellent feedback from the few supportive actors, including the young Nicoletta Elmi. The outstanding Eurokult star Klaus Kinski receives also a top bill, its role is however only an extended Cameo. In fact, this movie is much better than director Bazzoni's best-known (and much easier-to-access) Giallo "The Fifth Cord", so it's hoped that "Footprints" will soon also get a fancy DVD release.
