I found the story just enough of a thriller that I was not lulled by the wonderful music of Henry Mancici. Julie andrews was excellent and I do not understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out, because in the end it just makes me happy that everyone sings. and I'm always looking forward to endless endings that I think have this movie along with some traditional blake edwards humor ...
