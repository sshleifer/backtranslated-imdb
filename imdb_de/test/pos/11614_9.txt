Karim Hussain's masterpiece of art / Gore - this cat is definitely a talent to watch out for. We intersected several longer vignettes with shorter segments. All in all, this is a very powerful movie, based on its intense graphic imagery and symbolism, and is not suitable for all viewers. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a short story called OVARIAN EYEBALL. Very short segment on which a naked woman stands naked on a table. The hand of an invisible woman covers the face of the back woman with a red cloth and makes an incision in her belly, from which an eyeball stalk is pulled out. I have nothing too much to say about this film because of its brevity. <br /> <br /> HUMAN LARVAE is one of the films that Lynchpins starred on and it is an absolutely unflinching representation of a perverted act committed by a disturbed man who has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister. This is one of those things that one must have seen to be believed. I'll say this movie has some of the best effects I've seen in an indie horror movie, but the theme will make this an undeniably disagreeable experience for most (not me - I'm living for it!). <Br /> <br /> REBIRTH could all be cut out of this movie together. This is the weakest segment of the movie and there are a lot of naked people making bloody holes in a field and so on. Very short, but this kind of vibration affects the dynamics of the movie. <br /> <br /> RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM is one of the most profane depictions of religious images I've ever seen and that totally kicks one's ass. Think of "Piss Christ" or menses of the Virgin Mary. Very harsh sexual / sexually violent / bloody images are presented in this play and it is definitely not intended for anyone who is insulted by sacrilege. Subconsciousness Cruelty is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Banner of Extreme Horror It's going to be a very split movie between horror fans and the general public. Some call it garbage, others call it garbage. I do not see much middle ground. I thought this movie was damn original and I will recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to give it a try. 10.9.
