"The Dresser" is a small but absolutely wonderful movie brilliantly played by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. How in the world this tiny movie attracted enough attention in 1983 to collect five major Oscar nominations is a mystery to me, but it's nice to know that the Academy is occasionally to blame (sometimes with good taste) for giving it to them Price this year on "Terms of Endearment" - after all, they do not want to be accused of having shown TOO much taste. Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in a production of "King Lear"; Tom Courtenay is the man who works twice behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the headlights. It is both humorous and pathetic to see Courtenay's character showering Finney's attention and affection just to fully appreciate and disapprove of his efforts, even to the bitter end. Finney and Courtenay work wonders, and although Finney gets the most exciting moments (after all, he can recite Shakespeare), Courtenay is the heart and soul of the film. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
