Due to a very misleading advertising campaign, I saw this movie at the relatively young age of 10 years in theaters. The trailers on television portrayed the movie as a comedy and my parents bugged until they took me. After watching the movie, I was overwhelmed. I had no idea what to think. Quite different from anything I had seen before, leaving many questions to such a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. I probably had seen this morning for the first time in 2-3 years, and I still think it's one of the greatest movies of the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both in peak form, as a mysterious man who may or may not have come from another planet, and the psychiatrist who connects to him while trying to unravel his secret. Even the side occupations are almost perfect, every resident of the psychiatric institution is incredibly convincing in its own way. The open end was handled very well. There is much evidence supporting this, whatever you believe. How this film received at least one nomination at the Oscars this year is incomprehensible to me. If you have not seen this movie, go to Wal-Mart NOW. The DVD is usually in the trash cans, pick it up! <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
