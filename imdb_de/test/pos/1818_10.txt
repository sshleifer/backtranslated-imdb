20 years later, the movie is still hovering in size. Never before has a movie surpassed the incredible footage of Valley Girl. The film has encapsulated the 80s so perfectly that it could only be realized many years later. Nicolas Cage at his best. A movie that has so much character that you can see how sad Hollywood has become (in terms of quality). The Special Edition DVD contains many extras and is worth buying because you need to look through a lot of material. For sure.
