I'm not sure what to make of this movie. very funny, very artistic. not the kind of movie you look at because it has a compelling plot or characters. more like a kind of movie that can not be stopped because of the terribly intriguing things that happen on the screen. The first time my wife saw this she could not make it all the way ... too disturbing for her. is a bit long, but worthwhile for those who are interested in very dark films.
