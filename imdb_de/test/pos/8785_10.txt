I really enjoy this movie. It is a retrospective of the time when this nation of nations either attacked the war or broke out the war against us, d. Robert Cummings and Pricilla Lane were outstanding in the lead roles. The side cast ... Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevins and Norman Lloyd were also outstanding. The direction, the pace and the final kept my interest. So much so, that I bought my own copy. Luckily for Turner Classic Movies they show so many of the really classic movies, including this one. As an actor, Robert Cummings was certainly not a lightweight and though I'm a big fan of Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea, two of my favorite actresses who were first starred, I do not see what they would have brought to the role that Bob Cummings did would have exceeded. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that I like to watch and push others to watch.
