More a miss-miss than a flop, MR. IMPERIUM plays Ezio Pinza as Alex, heir apparent and later king of a small European nation that falls in love with the willing US actress and entertainer Fredda Barlo (Lana Turner), but played nicely due to machinations of the crafty Alex Shan prime minister by Cedric Hardwicke, the lovers are separated for 12 years before being reunited in Palm Springs, where their love is rekindled. Director Don Hartman, who is also scriptwriting, is unable to capitalize on his talent for nimble dialogue, because Pinza can only use English in a timid way, and the necessary rewrite, coupled with less than total rapport between the two stars, becomes something of a feat Rough sound leads to the script, which is exacerbated by the unfriendly editing of many scenes of the studio, resulting in a confusing ending. The overwhelming Pinza dominates his scenes with Turner, but both performers score well, while Marjorie Main impresses with her written pattern effects. Debbie Reynolds was launched by Louis B. Mayer for SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN her tangible performance here; Only Barry Sullivan is badly affected by the flagrant cut. Filmed primarily in Pebble Beach, California, and in other districts of Monterey County, the film features Pinza's iron opera bass in Solamente Una Vez and original songs by Harold Arlen and Dorothy Fields, who magnificently master the sound, recording and paying attention to the fine Decorations by Edwin Willis and effective costume designs by Walter Plunkett.
