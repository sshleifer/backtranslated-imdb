This film is basically a very well-made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its impact on those involved. It is always interesting to see the story for a change from the other side. This film focuses on a group of German soldiers sent to Stalingrad in Russia after fighting in the North African campaign, where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of World War II takes place. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see the other side of this battle as we mostly see Germans as just the "bad guys". In this movie, these "bad guys" get a humane face and a human voice, and you'll see to some extent that the only real enemy in war is the war itself, not necessarily the one you're fighting against. At first, it's hard to focus on the movie, because you always keep in mind that the Germans are the bad bad guys. But you get used to it quickly and adapt quickly to the Germans as the main characters of the film, and you even start to worry about it - and to be interested in them. <br /> <br /> How this story is told is not the best. It is difficult to track the story sometimes as it jumps from one sequence and one place to another. The film is not always logical in its storytelling and offers a bit too many sequences that remain too vague. It's also pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who's who. It's not always easy to watch this movie, but on the other hand, there are enough sequences and moments in this movie to make it worthwhile and interesting, just not the most coherent. In this regard, Hollywood films are always better than European films. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are high, with some good-looking sets and film locations, though the film was not even shot in Russia itself. It helps to create a good wartime situation. <br /> <br /> The characters are mostly interesting, even if they are a bit formulaic. But I do not know, for some reason, formula characters in war films always sound good and reinforce drama and realism. It also helps that they are played by well-staffed actors. All actors are not the most famous actors (Thomas Kretschmann was also a fairly unknown actor at the time), but each of them fits in well with his role, giving his characters a unique face and personality. All in all, not the best or most consistent drama of World War II, but definitely worth a look because of its original approach to the German side of the Battle of Stalingrad and its good production values. <br /> <br /> 7/10
