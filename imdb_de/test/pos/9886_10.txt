I saw the premiere of this film at the Phoenix Film Festival in 2005 and was very impressed with the ability shown by director Jeff Hare when he brought this hot topic to the screen. The cast of the characters was perfectly matched and enabled us to examine the question of a senior citizen who wanted to "die on his own terms" in a very warm and humorous way. Peter Falk was brilliant as Morris and the supportive group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles. The interaction of family, friends, and outsiders with Morris created a realistic view of how families deal with the issue of aging their parents and their desire to die with dignity. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is supposed to be a movie Jewish actor and his family, it's really a movie about all families. The jokes that crack the family and Morris while playing through the life of a "force of nature" are fresh and realistic. Rivalries in childhood, successes and failures in adults as well as the hope for the children are an integral part of this screenplay. While many ask the question of how to make the subject of suicide "humorous," I considered the treatment logical and timely. If you are not afraid to shed some tears or laugh at the jokes of a family struggling with this issue, you MUST SEE THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> The film was awarded Best picture at the Phoenix Film Festival.
