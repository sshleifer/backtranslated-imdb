This movie had everything one could wish for in his film in the late 1960s. It was immensely entertaining, providing a timely view of the many changes that have taken place in that time - and are still ongoing - in relation to the Black Power movement in Vietnam and the fleeting movement toward the calmer pre-war years of the 1950s followed br /> <br /> All this and one of the funniest movies back then or now. <br /> <br /> Recently, for the second time, I was surprised that it was as captivating as originally seen. His humor is just as funny and his message so strong. <br /> <br /> And if you look at it now, you will get all of this while at the same time enjoying the added pleasure of being a "historical piece". and an excellent chronicle of this historic, turbulent time.
