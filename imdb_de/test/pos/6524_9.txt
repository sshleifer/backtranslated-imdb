Fans of apocalyptic films will enjoy this well-made, low-budget thriller, which is essentially a remake of the 1951 1951 1951 George Pal classic "When Worlds Collide." A comet seeks a collision with Earth, and as his colleagues ignore the warning of downfall, eccentric scientist Peter Crawford (Dennis Hopper) gathers a group of private investors to secretly build an underground sanctuary. <br /> <br The story unfolds through the eyes of muscular Gulf War veteran Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati), who unintentionally discovers Crawford's hidden sanctuary and then decides that Crawford is wrong because he keeps his project hidden from the rest of humanity. As the comet approaches, the subject of who lives and who should die turns into an interesting drama. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are not in the same league, I enjoyed the story more than Spielberg's War of the Worlds because I find the script better. A certain suspension of the scientific reality is required, but it is worthwhile for the development of a good story. I highly recommend this movie to fans of the genre.
