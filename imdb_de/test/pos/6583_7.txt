This was a movie that I read the reviews over and over again; and although it's played in the Filmmuseum and not in the Pathe theaters? I decided to try this movie. The reasons were many? In the reviews he was compared to Pulp Fiction, there were several parallel stories in the film and finally he had already received 17 international awards in various categories. I was really looking forward to this film and because of my day off at Greenpeace I decided to make myself happy by watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a story that takes place in Finland. I think it reflected the current life of people in general? Drugs, crime, sex, anger, fear, fear and guilt. Every emotion was captured brilliantly in the film. There are several characters and stories that are interwoven, but some characters come back in the last half. make a link to the initial sequences and that brings the story forward. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends? one of them is a computer geek and the other is a drug addict? Son of an abusive father. The drug addict is trading with a 500 euro mark? printed by his friend? buy back his music system, and in return he receives a huge cash refund to buy more drugs. Trading 500 Euro notes is still bizarre. from the shop dealer to a car mechanic sperm robber ?? to a car dealer? to a vacuum cleaner seller? to a prostitute? to a policeman? then to her family and her children. How the beginning of a small thing? creates a chain reaction that leads to a depressing last note even after 5 years of this first incident? which I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> The direction is excellent. The character development in the film is first class. The character who remembers even after leaving the film is the seller of the vacuum cleaner. All sections of the film are treated well. Here I would like to make some critical comments. First, during the sequence of events leading to another, I felt that the coincidences were too fast and forced. But this script writing mistake is forgivable when you see the entire screen. Secondly, the trace of one character leading to another somehow leads back to the first two characters, and that again was a compulsory decision of the paperless recorder. There was no need to see the same characters again when there are different causes that lead to different effects in such a large city. <br /> <br /> But after you said that? It is an excellent movie! It's a dark movie with many sex scenes. The characters have the black, white and gray nuances and emotions that are different from any other situation brilliantly captured by the director. <br /> <br /> A top movie! It has all the ingredients to become a cult movie. I hope that only such films should not receive the status of cult films and receive many awards, because without crime, sex, violence, drugs, etc., you can also make fantastic films? Bicycle thieves and Pather Panchali are the prime examples? The only thing is that it was a long time back and times are changing and I think movies reflect the current times.
