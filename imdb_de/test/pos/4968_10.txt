The movie Jennifer with Ida Lupino and Howard Duff is movie noir splendor. This is a largely unknown movie that all Noir fans should watch sometimes. I love the black and white noir films. Film Noir in color is not that good. The cast and the script are outstanding. The rather scary music is fun. Ida Lupino is one of the best and most talented actresses ever staged. I've never seen a staging she did not like me in. Not only was she breathtakingly beautiful, she was also a good actress. The first movie I remember seeing Ida Lupino was Roadhouse with Richard Widmark and Cornel Wilde I've never forgotten the movie or her. I watched her last films like "Eating the Gods" and "Women in Chains", and although the movies were not her usual fare, she was still charmed as an actress. Howard Duff is always great to look at. I highly recommend this masterpiece I have this movie on VHS tape.
