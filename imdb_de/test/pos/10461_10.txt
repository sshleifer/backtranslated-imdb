This movie offers many joys and surprises. When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from "Don Giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the film, they appreciate the subtle layers of this outstanding film. The story unfolds in Jutland from the 18th century and the use of historical music played on historical instruments is just another fine touch. You share the exquisite pleasure of General Loewenhielm attending Cailles en Sarcophage, even if you are watching a movie - but you only want a small selection. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist whose medium she is food. Perhaps no other art form allows the artist to communicate her creations so directly. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this film is the potential that sharing food has to change the way people see each other and how they see this world is almost the same as the theme of "Chololat", but "Babette's Feast" does not hit you with his message. The citizens are conservative Puritans, but not overly oppressive. You will understand and respect them and ultimately appreciate their humanity. <br /> <br /> Many questions are raised that should make you think: the nature of the arts, the consideration of paths and paths that are not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the impact of Environment on the behavior that take life to give life, among other things. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment for me was the speech of General Loewenhielm, which was held at the height of the meal. I expected deep observations from the bottom of my heart, but I got some unclear mystical shaking. The speech had so little influence that I hardly remember it. <br /> <br /> But this understated movie leaves a lasting impression. The heat it produces is in contrast to its severe backdrop. They will leave the theater to dance under the stars.
