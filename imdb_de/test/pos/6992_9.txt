People who thought THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK sucked more than the black hole that EVENT HORIZON swallowed probably did not see the movie that had produced Vin Diesel's close-killer, and probably have no intention of doing so. Too bad, because PITCH BLACK actually kicked his ass. <br /> <br /> Directed by genre veterinarian David Twohy (from WARLOCK and the excellent but underrated DOWN) and siblings Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK begins with an 'alien-like' Prolog'. If a combined cargo / passenger ship is badly damaged by a crazy meteor shower (which also kills the captain), co-driver Carolyn Fry (SILENT HILL'S Radha Mitchell) has an important decision to make: unload the cargo or passengers? Near the crop over the occupants, the crash landing nullifies their ultimate approach. No matter, the catastrophic landing was made on a predictive rock that once had a mining colony. Among the survivors are a few settlers, Shazza (Claudia Black of FARSCAPE) and Zeke (John Moore); an imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say "red shirts" for boys and girls?); an antique dealer named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); a "boy" named Jack (Rhianna Griffith) and the most controversial members of the group: a Marshall named Johns (the extremely slimy Cole Hauser) and his prisoner ... a dangerous killer named Riddick (Diesel). <br /> <br /> The impact of group dynamics is causing a lot of dramatic tension, especially because of worries about Riddick and the number of people he could throw if he ever gets away. But no one comes out alive, as the saying goes, and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get along with each other than how they will survive when they discover the unthinkable. You are not alone on the planetoid. Things that are hungry, tense and fast slip to where they can not be seen, living in the dark where they can survive and thrive. They want the flesh of the newcomers to quench their appetite, but they can not step into the scorching daylight to search for food. <br /> <br /> Does the phrase "total solar eclipse" make things a little more interesting? You can bet on it. Hence the more than matching title. Vin, more monosyllabic than Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry on his grumpiest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day here with a character that's really worth one or two sequences, and Hauser infiltrating the menace and bile as well as his father Wings on the screen. Surprisingly, Mitchell, however, keeps himself and can be strong and sympathetic as Fry. They would expect no less than a strong show from Black, who was once Aeryn Sun, and she does not disappoint. (Too bad that her role was not greater, but that's all I'm going to say.) And David makes his usual, indelible impression as the holy man whose faith is truly tested in hell itself. <br /> <br /> The tempo moves faster than Riddick slips with tongs in his legs behind his prey, and as darkness sets in, the fright and tension never subsides, as in other classic sci-fi / But if imitation is truly the sincerest form of flattery, then Dave Twohy and the Wheats deserve big setbacks because they vengeance this with all their might and put an end to us that is anti-Hollywood to the limit , <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil the surprises, so I will not say much more, except if you saw CHRONICLES first and were not too happy, give PITCH BLACK a chance anyway. And if you have not seen one, be sure to start with it. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Vin's up to now, but he could certainly be worse than calling these guys again. I would like to see what they would dream of next ...
