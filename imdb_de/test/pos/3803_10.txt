Although this film never achieved commercial recognition, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-made artistic expressions often fail to find mass appeal. The plot shows a boy who steals a car and starts a surreal, dreamlike adventure with a very low base in our conception of time and space. Anyone who tries to see this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will probably be disappointed. it should not be "realistic". However, it is intended to be metaphorical, with a comprehensive symbolism that is evident to those who have great attention to detail. Moreover, the symbolic representations of interpretations are open, which can be said of many great works of art. Do not be fooled by the cover (if you rent or buy this movie) - the movie is not what it might appear on the surface.
