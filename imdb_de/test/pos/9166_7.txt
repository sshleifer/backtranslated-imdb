This movie was much better than I expected. After a few films by Will Smith, who were not as great as me, Robot, he is sympathetic and fun again. Smith plays, Hitch, an appointment doctor. Most of the film revolves around him, teaching Albert how to be himself, and meets with Allegra Cole, a famous celebrity, with whom he collaborates. Albert is a jerk and a fool and always stumbles on his feet or not. All Hitch teaches is teaching him how to behave cooler and not be so nervous about Allegra. Meanwhile, Hitch meets Sara, a gossip columnist who has sworn men. Hitch charms her, so of course they go out. But Hitch can teach other boys how to make the girl fall in love with her, he does not believe in love. He never really had a girl since he was dumped in college. But he likes Sara and goes after her. Sara's girlfriend is injured by a guy whom she believes has gone to an appointment doctor. So Sara goes to see the doctor just to find out about the trailer hitch. Of course she believes he is a pig. Then it's up to Sara and Allegra to explain what he's doing, and they both end up forgiving. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Well, has some laughs and is entertaining. I recommend it.
