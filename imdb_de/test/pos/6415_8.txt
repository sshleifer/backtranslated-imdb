* MINOR SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Need more evidence that Tsai Ming-liang is one of the most original and provocative filmmakers working everywhere today? Watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Based on minor variations on a theme that runs through most of his work, THE HOLE is a study of alienation and loneliness - in this case between a man and a woman, the upstairs / downstairs neighbors are - and how varied (real or psychological) structures of modernity distinguish people from each other. Here, the woman (the neighbor on the ground floor) tries to endure, while her apartment is flooded by a huge leak from above. A plumber tries to find the cause of the problem and disappears after making a big hole in the ground. Already isolated and desperate (both characters are among the few inhabitants of a residential project who have not fled a mysterious, apocalyptic epidemic). The hole that connects the two apartments initially acts as another in a long line of indignation, but soon assumes a meaning of almost mythical proportions. Tsai's sense of humor and sense of film history is portrayed with a little more openness than usual - while the woman's occasional daydreams revolving around her upstairs neighbor are visualized as musical numbers (tuned to the music of Grace Chang), which explode in short, sensual, surreal romance and humor from the screen - it's quite reminiscent of the big screen PENNIES FROM HEAVEN. And with all the boredom and alienation shown here, Tsai's penchant for the tensions of the late '90s is humorous, absurd, and gives this film a very responsive stringency. The final scene is extraordinary. In the meantime, Tsai - typically - undermines most of the usual expectations or prejudices that Western visitors bring to Asian cinema with a casual, casually revealed directness, both of which are absurdist tendencies of the human mind and the absolute virginity. There is an almost nonchalant demystification of almost everything about his characters, the background story or most of the cultural features (which enhances the isolation of the characters), which makes THE HOLE - and its other films - rather disorienting, but always fascinating and enlightening.
