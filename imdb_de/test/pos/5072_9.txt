Some movies are just meant to entertain you, others to make you laugh, or to make you cry or lift you; others, like this one, try to provoke, make you think, and make you angry. I was angry at this movie, not at the movie, but at the fact that it is true that the free American torments the illogical view that he is doing so for the common good. The torture scenes in this film were staggering, the indifference of the people was staggering, the film was convincing in its argumentation and showed how wrong it is to torture people. Of course, this is what makes me a "bleeding liberal" label pushed by people who deal with the facts, that this is and should not be the case. People who do not know that, as the movie said, ten or one hundred people stand up for each person being tortured to carry out acts of revenge. You get an ever-increasing cycle of violence. This movie did not make me hate America, though I can see how it can achieve something, but I hated the way America reacted in its world after Sept. 11. There is an important quote in the film shortly after we learned that 19 people died in the bombing scene and 75 were injured. The quote is "An American is dead" - that makes the difference. You can not kill an American, America can kill thousands, but you can not kill a single American, or they will do anything they need, including torture, to achieve justice. This is obviously the American way. Call me liberal, call me naive (though I think people who think torture is naïve are naïve), call me, you call me anything you like, but this film is a brilliant example of that which is wrong today in America and in the West. I wish this movie would be shown to all students at least. This movie will stay with me for a long time, part of me wish I could forget it, because I wish it had never happened, but I know it's the case, the other part of me wishes I would Never forget because we need to Remember those shameful events to prevent them from reoccurring. Whatever happens to me, this movie will be with me for a long time, and I will tell everyone I know not to entertain it, but to provoke it, because sometimes we all have to be provoked.
