My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film, which was first released on DVD in the UK for the first time, was more than rewarded. Peter Watkins has excelled in his audacity and technical ability. This pseudo documentary is certainly ahead of its time and still scary relevant and up to date. <br /> <br /> The film is inspired by the upheavals of the late sixties in the US when the government reinforced its legitimized use of force and oppression, while the anti-war movement is increasingly violent and radical. In order to circumvent both the overcrowding of prisons and to train special police units, the government has set up the so-called detention centers. Convicted "criminals," mostly activists, have the choice of either being imprisoned for years or spending three days in one of these parks, either gaining their freedom or imposing an even longer prison term. The situation in the parks, however, is far beyond their worst expectations. It reminded me of a kind of realistic version of Battle Royale (2000). <br /> <br /> The film's structure is extremely effective, reminding of parallels to the Cannibal Holocaust, which is made almost 10 years later. Both films are engineered and filmed in such a way that the viewer is mentally and emotionally challenged to actually watch a documentary and is therefore shocked, even though he is aware that this is a movie. Both confront us with the inherently violent nature of humanity, but where the Cannibal Holocaust has no deeper meaning (above all, it is an exploitative film in the truest sense of the word) and raises no critical questions about the state of the world, Punishment Park does That's what it was. <br /> <br /> I was deeply impressed by Punishment Park and find it hard to believe how such a powerful and important film could be so long rejected and marginalized. Maybe that says enough about the truth of its content, about the way power structures work in this world. I do not agree with the criticism that Watkins makes polarizations and stereotypes, because the film shows activists and the preservers of the legitimized power structures, which in reality are just as polarized as here. If this were not the case, there would be no conflict and therefore no change in our societies. In reality, confrontations between these two groups often take on a stereotyped form, regardless of whether you place them between activists and branches in Latin America, Russia or New York City. If these groups were not polarized to these extremes, the activists would be part of the silent majorities that silently complain but at the same time remain in the injustices of the world. <br /> <br /> As Peter Watkins informs us When introducing the DVD, the actors at Punishment Park are mostly amateurs. Most of the children were real activists from LA, most of the police were part of the national armed forces, and even some members of the tribunals are part of the social and political establishment of that time. Unless you introduce both groups before shooting the scenes that take place in the improvised courtroom, this increases the spontaneous and improvised feeling. Parallels to issues of the day, such as the repression of Black Panther members (one of the black prisoners is supposed to resemble convicted charismatic BP leader Bobby Seale) and the trial of the Chicago victors of seven I admire Watkins's obvious and straightforward confrontation with injustice and its concern for human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments (today in the name of the "War in Terror") to silence those who are unanimous and brainwashed. The Punishment Park is still a very important movie that should be shown in schools and seen by anyone who shares these concerns. Maybe his marginalization can finally be made good.
