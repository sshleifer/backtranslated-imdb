Once again John Madden has given us a great movie. A simple but beautiful story in a real paradise, and the music can not be better. Stephen Warbeck rejoices us again and good deeds, but ......... why on earth is Penelope Cruz in this movie? I also asked myself that question when I saw this movie. Of course, her Greek accent is not believable, she is unable to be decent even in a scene. Not even at the end did she do a good job after so many events. After years, she finally saw Corelli again and she could not change the same face of stupidity we had to endure throughout the movie. Anyway, Cage was very good at one of his best characters; Hurt is also great in his and the rest of the cast has all done a great job. The end result is a movie that is really worth seeing. This is a beautiful movie that even Mrs. Cruz could not spoil. So far, I think Madden is the best work, so no fan will be disappointed.
