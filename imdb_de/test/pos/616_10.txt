I'm just beginning to explore the hitherto wonderful world of Monsieur Ozone. I've only seen 4 movies so far and the last in the series reminded me that they were all lonely women and their actions. Not a single lone female character of 12, and all of them have a strong impact on the environment. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the only one (out of four) where this influence is good. <br /> The gay theme is almost standard in Ozone's films, so it does not set the accent (though the characters' looks may work). Pay attention to the feelings, not to their objects. <br /> <br /> Very nice and ephemeral, really like a summer romance, and while relaxing for the mind and spirit, it gives something to the soul.
