I wonder how anyone could talk about this movie. It is based on an actual story. It's not necessarily about "rugby" itself, so the one who posted here, that they have to do a "real" rugby movie, you've missed the point. This is not a typical sports movie in which a team is shit. They hire Emilio Estevez, turn the team around, win the championship and give everyone the warmth and velvety. It focuses on a story. It shows how someone can change their lives for the better. In today's movies, it's all about sex, drugs, parties, etc. That's Hollywood. I'm a big fan of movies, but I have to say that this was an inspiring movie with a great message. If you consider yourself a "tough guy", do not watch the movie, it will not meet your needs. If you want to see a good, inspiring movie, this is a good movie.
