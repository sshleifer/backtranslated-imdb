This was easily one of the craziest Ernest films, especially in terms of production design. What was wrong with the pink guards? Unfortunately, this movie probably destroyed the Ernest series and made the series a direct video series. However, Jim Varney performed better as he played Nash, his criminal alter ego. A misstep in the series, but not so bad in most respects (the Electro Man routine was classic)
