Traffik is an excellent miniseries dealing with drug trafficking in Europe. This is the PBS series produced in Europe, which is based on the Oscar-nominated film Traffic. If you love traffic, trafficking is a must. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone who is interested in drugs from a social perspective. The script is exciting and unexpected as it goes through the lives of drug traffickers, traffickers, farmers, police and police officers. In contrast to other films that make the subject of drugs sensational, Traffik presents it as it is.
