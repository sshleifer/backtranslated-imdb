I had never heard of this movie and only got it because I'm a fan of Martin Sheen. Now I am amazed why it did not receive the praise and recognition it truly deserves. All four characters let you feel, the father tries to enforce his authority, the mother is still clinging to the traditional family values ​​and both try, despite the total fragmentation of their family to keep the appearance, the daughter wants her own life and the Son pursued by his experiences in Vietnam. One said this was a scenario that must have been played after Vietnam in thousands of "ordinary" families. Emilio Estevez as Jeremy was awesome - totally unaware of his wartime experience that no member of his family could identify with. The screen chemistry between him and his real father Martin Sheen was amazing. There were times when Emilio's tormented face was similar to Martin's in Apocalypse Now. I'm sure that, just as Martin Apocalype is one of his best films, Emilio will also be one of his best. The scene with the weapon was totally stunning, with all the emotions on the faces of the family. Brilliant play by Estevez, Sheen and Kathy Bates. I saw the movie for the first time last night - and today the main story was in the news of a Gulf War veteran who had shot several members of his family. How many young men are their lives destroyed by the war?
