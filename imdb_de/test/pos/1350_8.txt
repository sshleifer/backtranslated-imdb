I had read the movie and thought it was cute, a Saturday night movie. I did not expect anything great, thought it was mostly fluff, but hopefully not a completely bad experience. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and things went well. Ash Christian was perfect. His ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was beautiful. He could have turned that character into something we've all seen before, but he moved away from clich√©s and focused on the character's wit. It was wonderful to see Jonathan Caouette again, I did not know what he would do after Tarnation. Ashley Fink is a jewel, a great young character actress who hopefully will get more work. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the film that might need some work, but all in all not a bad time in the cinema. My friend described it as a gay Angus / Napoleon Dynamite, but it's more than that. It's a character study on how it is to grow up gay in a small town. The pain is there, but the humor behind this pain (which only makes age clearer) is intensified. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Ash Christian, Ashley Fink and Jonathan Caouette soon.
