This is a sweet movie featuring spanky, alfalfa and buckwheat from the Our Gang comedies. During the Civil War in the South, Buckwheat, as a slave to Spanky, plays a bit odd, but this movie is as charming as the best of shorts with the same cast. This was the only Our Gang movie I can highly recommend for the 1994 remake of The Little Rascals.
