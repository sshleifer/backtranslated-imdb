Forever strong is one of those sports movies that you can actually see. It reminded me a lot of Remember the Titans because it included comedy, sadness and just generosity. I saw it at a preliminary exam and all my friends liked it and put it in their top 2 sports movies. Acting is great in the movie. Although it remembers Remember the Titans, this movie is something very unique. I think that is definitely Oscar worthy and will receive many awards. Everyone should definitely watch this movie and it's worth your $ 10. I'll have to see it again if it comes out because it was so good. I can not say anything bad about the movie.
