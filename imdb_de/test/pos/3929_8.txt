While HOUSE OF WAX can never be confused with Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, it tries and ultimately manages to be a worthy addition to high-quality horror film. There is enough excitement and enough implicit gore here to please today's young audiences, and there are also enough explicit Gore to please some of the purists of yesteryear. All in all, it's a pretty good movie that should be fine on DVD. <br /> <br /> Six children on the way to a football match are stranded in a DELIVERANCE environment, and what actually looks like it may have been a discarded Deilverance sequel taken out and the backwoodsmen Hicks seem to mock the group. At some point the group has to leave and half of them go to the desolate city to get some car parts. The other half of the group stays in the camp and this is the second half of the movie. <br/> <br /> House of Wax has many strengths. The first is that it is blessed with a very sympathetic cast. Paris Hilton is good at her role, but she is a long way from the focus. Chad Michael Murray, Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors, and their presence in the film adds some dizziness, some credibility and a touch of flair. I had never really heard of Chad Michael Murray, only that he was a teenager who was a teen guy. But he has a presence with him. He fills an immaterial one for him, which seems to translate into his performance. He is instantly sympathetic and has a strong character trait. I enjoyed his performance much more than I thought, and when he was on the screen, the movie was flowing. <br /> <br /> The question is, "Is this movie a worthy horror movie?" And the answer is a clear YES. As I mentioned above, the same class is not a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE ON LEFT or even THE RING, but it's relatively tense, pretty graphic, and there are some very ingenious death scenes. This is not the WAXHOUSE your parents told you about. Vincent Price is nowhere to be seen, and when you see fingers being cut and hot wax figures in a coma, it's clear that this movie is a bit on the edge. <br /> <br /> I would like to see an uncut movie X-rated version of the director. I'll bet there's someone out there who is a lot more violent than this one. Anyway, this is a very good introduction to the horror genre and it's head and shoulders above weak movies like I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT LAST SUMMER and DARK WATER AND ANOTHER DATA. It's definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> 8/10
