I saw Lost Horizons, the film lost in 1973, and read many of the reviews for this film. I agree that the move had plenty of room for improvement, but unlike anyone looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something else, and this movie has given me. I have not seen this movie as a critic, but as a person looking for a bit of hope, a little applause, a bit of a liberation from my everyday life, and that's what I got. You can look critically at the singing and dialogue, but that's not what I'm looking for when I go to a movie. I am looking forward to a little salvation from my daily life, to a time when I can sit back and imagine a better life where people love one another and help another. It's a shame that we can not enjoy a movie for what he tells us and stop reading it like an English teacher reading a fifth grade essay. That may be very simple, but it would not be nice.
