This was a very nice softcore movie for men and women. A lot of nudity / sex, but without the general assault you normally find. They could not have done a better job casting because the entire ensemble was stunning. Trust me, guys, if you want to get your wife in the mood, get something with Bobby Johnston! I'm sure pretty Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for every heterosexual man. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene with each other. If you know where a movie is, please make a PM. I would like to know. The photography was much better than usual. That's the story. Predictable, but nice, kind and romantic. At least it was not one of those annoying, predictable murder secrets, filled with blond-haired women with huge fake breasts. I give this 7/10!
