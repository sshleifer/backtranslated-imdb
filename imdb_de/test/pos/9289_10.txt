Everyone is a genius in something. Albert Einstien was a genius in science, William Shakespeare was a genius in literature, and the guys from the Chasers war against everything are truly weird geniuses. Her satire TV show is a constant hit in the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). After a small start as a satire newspaper, the popularity of the chasers rose when they got their own TV show. The controversy with the performers must not be long in coming and will do anything, even if arrested. Chris Taylor goes to Sunrise, a very popular morning live television show that challenges his partner to say goodbye, build a fake motorcade, drive into APEC's high-security area and make a very funny satire on an Australian ad about nicotine, by following the smoker's shout "NO GARY NO NO GARY NO". The show is controversial, but it is always funnier and worthwhile for the years to come.
