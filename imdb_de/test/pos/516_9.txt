I did not watch this movie until it appeared on TV because I had doubts about comic flicks. Since the "Batman" series, "Spawn", "Judge Dredd" and many other wretched bombs, I have dumped everything at any cost. I wonder, "Why can not anyone make a movie rated R and stay true to the story, how difficult is that?" And finally, my prayers were answered with Blade. This movie appears on the screen with violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, the good against the evil, and so on. But not Blade, the film was filmed just right without going overboard, delivering a good length and never being boring. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic films I've seen in a long time.
