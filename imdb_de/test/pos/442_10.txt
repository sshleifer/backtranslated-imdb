This is my favorite Renoir from the fifties. It is the story of how Henri Danglard built and founded the Moulin Rouge nightclub; We see the local workers doing the construction and training the dancers. Finally the dizziness of the opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing. Financial problems and the ego-representations of the interpreters are described. <br /> <br /> Gabin is in great shape as an uncomplicated Danglard - he sees his humorous approach to Nini's violent friend. Gianni Esposito moves as a wistful prince courting Nini. Maria Felix, with this Amazonian body, impresses as selfish Lola, Danglard's first lover. After all, as Nini, Françoise Arnoul is the scrub girl who dances for Danglard and becomes his girl, simply mind-blowing; Their loveliness and their seductive charm will convince you. <br /> <br /> A bonus: We receive Edith Piaf, Patachou, André Claveau and other stars in Cameos who play the stars of a century that ruled the Moulin Rouge.
