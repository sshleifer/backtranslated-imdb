Although the action of Cover Girl is very thin and tired, it serves well enough as an anchor for the music numbers Kern and Gershwin. After signing in Gilda, Hayworth decided to play in this tailor-made musical. Not only does she look beautiful, she also impresses with her dancing. Gene Kelly, loaned to Columbia by MGM, makes her dance, and the order in which he plays with his own shadow was nice. The secondary characters were also competently traded. Personally, Cover Girl was not as fun as the musicals that Hayworth did with Fred Astaire. Cover Girl, however, is still very entertaining and easy to recommend. My score: 7/10.
