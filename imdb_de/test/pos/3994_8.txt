Awarded Kwon-Taek's Best Director for Cannes 2002 (in conjunction with PT Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), this film is about a nineteenth-century Korean painter who has the roots of a simple artist and a significant influence has on the Korean painting. One of the movie's strengths is that Im trying to see us with the eye of a painter, so we see several scenes and objects that inspiration our drunken painter friend Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik) receive. <br /> <br /> The costumes and art direction are impressive and the acting is even good. It's not a movie that moved me, but it was one that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice in it. That's pretty cool. It is also interesting to see a version of Korea at this turn of the century, where Chinese and Japanese powers are in Korea and the kingdom of Chosun is coming to an end. There is more than one revolution and political ideology in the film, but they are never the center of attention. It is firmly on the painter. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a well-made film about the life of a painter. However, it does not exactly have the regular structure representation with three files. So you need to be able to take a non-standard Hollywood story to watch. Yay for the art! 8.10
