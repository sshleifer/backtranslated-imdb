When the physically superior, ugly-charismatic actor GÃ©rard Depardieu was born a Frenchman to play, then it was certainly Cyrano de Bergerac and the orator Georges Danton. Here he dominates the film both by the width of his shoulders and by the power of his voice; His charisma plays the role, although it is made clear that the figure has as much blood on his hands as anyone else. Danton celebrates while the people in Paris starve to death ... but he is the only man who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the dreaded Public Security Committee in the name of "freedom," and he is portrayed as hero of the film - Despite the fact that the source play idolizes his opponent Robespierre! <br /> <br /> For those who know the characters of the story, there is interest in identifying the smaller pieces: the frog face of Tallien, Couthon the cripple, Fouquier-Tinville, the prosecutor of the tribunal, the stinking fellow St -Just, the epic painter David. But the script does not diminish in this regard. Names often come too late when subordinate characters are even identified, and there is no Hollywood-style "info-dump" to ensure that audiences can classify events in their historical context. The film takes it for granted that you know what has gone before and what's going to happen - sometimes it's too much of a matter of course, as if relying on a precise knowledge of dates to see the tail in the fact that Robespierre followed Danton to the scaffolding. <br /> <br /> Viewed as a movie, it's not completely satisfying as it fades towards the end. The structure of the story leads to a great confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or to a dramatic climax of the trial, which never really happens thanks to history. Things just happen: there is no revolt, no overthrow of tyranny, no seizure of power by the victor, no victory on both sides. It may be historically correct but not quite satisfactory as a result of a screen scenario - it seems to be a strange place to stop. As others have commented, it might have been more logical to follow up the events until the end of the terror and to position the case of Robespierre.
