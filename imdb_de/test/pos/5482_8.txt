Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a bomber terrorist who literally believes he will not get caught. To kick off the popular modern serial killer "John Kramer" (Tobin Bell) from the Saw series. Through skillful planning and influence Frank Mendoza (Bell) can arrest. This is followed by a series of chases. Malkovich is a huge actor and incredibly versatile. Once again seeing another role in this film, he amazes me with his ability to exchange his characters with the next film Of mice and men as tragically challenged hare lover Lenny, to name just a few. He plays a very intelligent bomber terrorist, who is very sensible, but gives the impression that he could escape his capture. Clint Eastwood is not a special person. He's too old to really do a lot of action in movies. The only thing that really baffles him is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simple and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo plays Eastwood's love interest in the movie and captivates me with her support, which in fact plays a bigger role for me than Eastwood's. <br /> <br /> Even if this sounds like an action blockbuster, it is relatively slow and plays with anticipation. They have to wait for the construction and the end, and that will pay off in the end. On the way you will be fascinated by Malkovich and Eastwood's chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse.
