While the bullets did not bounce off his chest, the Lone Ranger was the symbolic symbol for me as my other childhood hero - Superman. He represented truth, justice and American style in a classic TV western setting. He lived on the principle that he would never kill with his weapon, while he searched with his faithful Indian companion Tonto the American Southwest to put every single outlaw to justice. The emergence of television provided the perfect opportunity for a post-war generation to find it an enigmatic masked man committed to law and order while providing unprecedented entertainment for five years. <br /> Today I had the opportunity to see for the first time how the complete three-part origin episodes end without the usual opening and closing sequences interrupting the continuity of the story. For fans of the Rangers, this is the big father of all western legends. He tells how Texas Ranger John Reid survived the Butch Cavendish Gang ambush and how he was nursed back to health by an Indian friend from childhood. Tonto (Jay Silverheels) explains his companion as a "trusted boy scout" and calls him Kemo-sabe. I have read several interpretations of the origin of the term Kemo-sabe, but I am satisfied with Tonto's explanation. Too much reading has a negative impact on the story, as does the English translation of 'tonto' from Spanish, which I will not reveal, because it's just better not to know if you can help him. <br /> <br /> I thought it was pretty wise how the original story spawned the mysticism of the Lone Ranger, like the sixth grave that gave the illusion that all the rangers had died in the backyard of Box Canyon. They never see the face of the man who becomes the Lone Ranger, as it is always turned away or hidden to hide his true identity. Even the origin of silver is brilliantly handled. The voice of the narrator of history, in which the wild stallions are described. Would that relate to sterling, silver? I got the biggest kick out of it. <br /> <br /> Of course, watching the Lone Ranger episodes over time provides a glimpse at how straightforward the show was beyond the original story. Some of them are almost embarrassingly stupid, especially when it comes to a Lone Ranger showdown, when he shoots in the midst of a lot of vicious boys to knock a gun out of the owner's hand. And what about this little wave he gives Tonto whenever he wants to raid the bad guys? It's always the same gesture, but Tonto always knows what it means under different circumstances. Then there are the episodes in which Clayton Moore discards the Ranger mask to create another disguise to spend another character serving the story. He even went into hiding as an actor when he portrayed President Abraham Lincoln to reveal a villain, a top hat, and everyone else! Few fans I meet know that the actor John Hart replaced Clayton Moore in 1952/53 season in a contract dispute that Moore had with the producers of the show. If you have ever seen the episode "Happy Days" in which Fonzie adores his childhood heroes, you'll find it was John Hart in the credits. It's hard to tell if you see a Hart episode or not. The key is to hear the voice. Moore's is so distinctive that it's a dead giveaway. <br /> <br /> If you ever get a chance to try some of the season's final episodes, you'll be looking forward to something. The renderings I've seen on VHS are absolutely great, although I do not know if commercial prints are available. Most black and white episodes have been repackaged by any number of distributors in different configurations. It is therefore no problem to get these in your hands. The must-have is of course the tripartite origin, and if you do not see anything else, you have all the flavor and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the West's most famous heroes. Hello Yo Silver, Awaaaay!
