Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, lets his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) does not respect him and loses a patient he is operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers that her husband cheated on her. They both have to get away. She watches over a beautiful seafront inn in Rodanthe and books a room at the same time. They are all alone. You can find out the rest pretty well. <br /> <br /> This is what's known as a woe horse or a women's movie. It is beautifully shot with a romantic backdrop and many quiet scenes. There is tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting end (a kind). The great spectacle of Gere and Lane helps make sure this movie does not really mean much. Every single piece of representation is predictable. At some events I rolled a lot with my eyes. It's also way too short - I did not believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second. When coming from nothing and moving very fast. The movie is still working. The inn itself is absolutely beautiful and I ended up in tears with most of the spectators. So it's a predictable but beautiful movie with wonderful acting. It does not deserve all the criticism it gets. I give a 7.
