That was a really nice surprise. I woke up late last night and could not fall asleep. I did not think twice, I turned on my TV and HBO was on and this movie was just starting. Luckily I saw the whole thing and I am very happy about it. Because this movie was very good. The actors were well-staffed and did a surprisingly good job. Kris Kristofferson delivered a solid performance, behind his lines was a lot of substance. In this movie, I realized that he is a good actor. Brian Keith was great as his father, just as Trey Wilson played the Colonel (this was Trey Wilson's last role before his untimely death too bad, he was a good actor and seemed like a nice guy). Jobeth Williams also did a good job as an American wife of Kristofferson. Regarding the direction, I had no idea that Franklin J. Schaffner was the director until I read the review in Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide (this was the last movie he ever shot). Now I understand why this movie was so good. Schaffner also directed Patton, a really great movie (I did not see his other great movie, Papillon). As I watched "Welcome Home," I told myself, "This director really knows what he's doing," without knowing that Schaffner had directed it. There is a really nice scene in a Thai orphanage, enough to bring tears to my eyes. This was not only sensitive, but also very economical and taut. Nothing is wasted with Schaffner's efforts. The script was one of the reasons why this movie is so good. The writer does not burden the actors with too many lines. It was written very simple but very effective. It just shows you that you can say a lot in a few words. This movie also made me proud to be an American and at the same time showed how beautiful ALL people are.
