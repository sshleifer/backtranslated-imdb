"Subconscious cruelty" is one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. "Salo" and "Cannibal Holocaust" did not bother me so much, but there is a strange psychological element to "subconscious cruelty". This film conquers your subconscious with shocking taboos, surreal images and one of the most disturbing film scores and sound designs. Sometimes repugnant; Yes, but his visual flair can be compared to Avant Gard directors Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Dusan Makavejev and David Lynch. Take the most extreme elements of these four directors and take the graphic violence of a film by Luico Fulci, and you may be able to guess what you're up to. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into 4 parts. The first part "the ovary eye" is really short. A narrator tells us about the parts of the brain and its functions. Then a naked woman opens her stomach and an eyeball is pulled out. The second part "Human Larvae" is similar to the movie "Eraserhead", but with incest. It's about a man's sexual obsession with his pregnant sister. Where is it when you need it? The third part is my absolute favorite. It reminds me of "Begotten" and James Broughon's short film "Dreamwood" from 1972. In this segment people have sex with the earth. Men hobble bloody holes in the ground, girls masturbate with branches. The branches bleed when they are broken. See with horror how a man gives fellatio to a knife that sticks out of a woman's vagina. These people really know how to get in touch with nature. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie is the most disturbing and sometimes it borders on hardcore pornography. This part of the film made me think of Jodorowsky's "The Holy Mountain", "Sweet Movie" and "Cannibal Holocaust". I've never been more disturbed in my life by what I've seen. A businessman has his private ones ripped off by fishing hooks. Yuck and ouch! Two women urinate on a Christ figure and continue to eat it like communion bread and dry it off with a branch. Poor guy. The last part was so extreme that when I look at the movie again, I can close my eyes or move forward. Karim Hussien and Mitch Davis are obviously very talented. They thought they had done this project in the early 20's. Hussein went on to direct the Tarkovsky-influenced movie "Ascension" (2002), which is a much better movie, and he wrote the screenplay for Nacho Cerda's after dark horror masterpiece "The Abandoned." "Subconscious Cruelty" is a fascinating and disturbing journey. with images that come from the unthinkable realm of everyday human life. Well, that's about it.
