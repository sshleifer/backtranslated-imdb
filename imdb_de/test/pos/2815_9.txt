I miss the cable TV and I have no more "DirecTV". As a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. As a lover of blondes, but not for blondes, I have not only "Barb Wire", but also "Stripperella: The Complete First Season". I have not found "VIP" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the DVD "Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding". I have the issues of "Playboy" in which Pamela Denise Anderson posed. I could go on. I love Pamela! There's nobody or anything that I could feel guilty about when I enjoy Stripperella. But there are certain elements that I do not like, but with whom I live together, because other series sometimes also show smoking and alcohol consumption. But these are my personal preferences and I try not to let them ruin the fun of a series like this one for me. I was also surprised by the change in the animation style, but I adapted. The female nudity, however, decreased, and this is a great disappointment, since you expect a lot in a series with such a premise. But then I adapted. One of my favorite episodes of "Mork & Mindy" was when they met Robin Williams! One of my favorite episodes of "Striperella" is, of course, when Pamela & Tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin! If there really is a "Season 2", I hope I can find it, because as the most complete I have to complete my collection. I recommend it to other admirers of female form and lovers of blondes. (Hey! Psst! "Blond" and "Blondinen" are the feminine form for the spelling of "Blond"! Your software should already know that!)
