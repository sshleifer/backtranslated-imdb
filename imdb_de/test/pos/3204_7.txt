Normally, Alan Alda plays characters that are too "soft" and too verbal. He probably lives. This time he fits the figure. However, he exaggerates when the sentence is pronounced. <br /> <br /> The 1971 Attica Prison Rebellion and the New York State response are recalled to many of us as a frightening event. Few journalists have told the true story. This film offers a quick insight into the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica Uprising / Rebellion. Attica had a big influence on this country. Maybe the movie will encourage someone to research the story. <br /> <br /> I can not remember a movie taken from the prisoner's point of view - though there is a great PBS play with the actual Attica survivors / participants. The perspective of the hostage guards is explored in "Against the Wall" with Kyle MacLachlan, Samuel L. Jackson, Clarence Williams III and Frederic Forrest. Earlier we called: "Attica"! Attica! "It was nice to hear it in the movie, brought back memories. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is the natural wigs that Morris Chestnut and the other African Americans wear." It would have been easy for these people To build "Fro".
