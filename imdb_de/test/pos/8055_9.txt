"The Phenix City Story" is a brutal, hard docudrama about what was once called the "worst city in America." The film documents the events that led to the murder of Albert Patterson, a lawyer in Alabama, through the crime in Phenix City, which has applied for the Attorney General's Office, to the vice and corruption that plagues his hometown. to eliminate. His son, John Patterson, took after his death after the death of his father and won the post. Phenix City was thus a central topic on his agenda. <br /> <br /> Director Phil Karlson has created a film that possesses this ability to shock even today. The cruelty is so relentless that the movie is actually hard to see. We see the crime syndicate hit and kill to get what they want - the beatings and killings include women and children, and especially a scene that revolves around the death of a little black girl is particularly troubling. It's not exactly an entertaining movie because in the end it pays off very little to reward the viewer for playing through the exciting events that led up to it, but it's a well-made, intense and intense movie angry energy. <br /> <A 15-minute prologue includes a series of interviews with the actual inhabitants of the city of Phenix, some of which are portrayed by actors in the fictional part of the movie. This gives the film an urgency quality that fits into the narrative, so we feel like we're watching a documentary all the time, a feeling that's helped by Charles's decision to film in current locations. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie, but it's one of those films that will fill you with a sense of righteous indignation, and then you'll be helpless because you can not help it. <br /> <br /> Grade: ONE
