Jolene (Heather Graham) runs a nightclub in NYC and lives with her husband Carl (Luke Wilson), a photographer. After about 500 days of marriage, Jolene comes home to find Carl a message that he needs "some space" ... and a bouquet of daisies, her favorite flower. Jo puts the daisies promptly in the blender and presses the button. Soon afterwards, she sets off to find Carl somewhere in the west, because she has signed up to Carl after all. When she finally locates him in Texas, Jo first camps near his home, hoping to find evidence of his decision to leave. She meets a beautiful sculptor neighbor (Goran can not spell his name!), But Jo discourages his attraction to her. When she learns that Carl may have a new girlfriend, she decides to seek advice from a Mexican-American mystic (Alfonso Arau). Jo is determined, but does that mean something for Carl? This is a very imaginative, rather humorous look at the marriage vows. It's a quirky script and an unusual style is downright contagious. Graham is just great like the cranky woman who has a hard time letting go. Wilson does not give his best performance, but is sufficient as a mixed husband. The rest of the cast is pretty nice, but with Goran the Gorgeous as a sexy neighbor. The scenery in both New York and Texas is beautiful and the costumes are fresh and fun. If you like romantic comedies and independent films, they will be made to order. It goes to another beat that is the most attractive but still delivers the ultimate happy ending category.
