Lucio Fulci has done many great films throughout his career and the way many of them were equipped with a Gore scoop has earned him the title of "Godfather of Gore". While you are not torturing, a duckling was made before Fulci became known among the Gorehounds, and is not all so bloody; It's certainly a vicious and vicious little thriller and for my money - the best movie Fulci has ever made! Do not be tormented by the fact that a duckling has a big head start in terms of production values ​​compared to many other Giulo genres, and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this giallo is great. The plot focuses on a small rural community where corpses have appeared. The murders are even more shocking because the victims are only young boys. Shortly after the police convicted an innocent man of crime, a reporter named Andrea Martelli arrives in the village and decides to investigate the murders on his own. Martelli soon meets several suspects, including a sexy young lady named Patricia, a sinister priest, and a local witch who likes to make wax figures and put pins in them. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not contain much gore, there are two of Fulci's most unpleasant sequences to make up for it. Worst of all, a woman is brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery, while the image of a man falling down a cliff and striking a series of rocks on the way shakes his stomachs. Do not torture a duckling with an absolutely great Italian cast. Barbara Bouchet (a personal favorite of mine) is incredibly sexy in her role as Patricia and can move her acting muscles more than in many later films. As always, Tomas Millian is excellent, while the rest of the cast is well crafted by artists such as Irene Pappas, Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel. The exhibited cinematographs are breathtaking and Fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into every scene. The story is slow, and it's always interesting, because Fulci never lets the movie deviate too much from the central plotline. There are not many secrets about the identity of the murderer; but Fulci almost manages to guess until the end, and Do not Torture a Duckling reaches a climax. Overall, it's a shame that Fulci did not make such films anymore. Do not torture a duckling is his best work and I insist that every Giallo fan sees it!
