From the perspective that it is possible to make films that will not offend people with strong moral values, this movie is definitely worth it. This is the second consecutive Bruce Willis film that has managed to tell its story without nudity, dissimilar humor, obscenity, or unnecessary violence. (Of course, I'm referring to The Sixth Sense.) Both films deal with more than one level. This is also suitable for children, although others have indicated that it is not suitable for children. <br /> <br /> It bothered me that the time traveler controlling this act is never explained, except that we know that Russell himself initiates it as a 70-year-old. Why does his dying mother have to go to school if he wins the fight? So if, as his older self says, he has to fight this child over and over again in the next few years, his mother does not have to come every time to fetch him, and why he does not learn to step on it. I also found the score quite annoying and not always appropriate for the action on stage. <br /> <br /> Good use of the red plane as a metaphor.
