I've heard a lot of different opinions about this movie and then figured out that Paris Hilton was there too, did not give me the best impression of the movie. Then he was dragged to the movies by a group. When I was sitting there with my friends and expecting a pile of pants, I was shocked to be afraid of the whole movie ... it was predictable, but the buildup of deaths and the whole atmosphere Really frightening for me ... I watched all the way through my fingers. So, say, look at it and decide for yourself. If the fact that it's a scary movie does not convince you to look at it, then Chad Michael Murray, which is not bad for a few hours, does it?
