I give this movie a total of 8/10. Visually, much of it is stunning: the dream mix of an art director from Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo, and Georgia O'Keeffe - and valid proof of the film's power as a serious art form. The use of color, shape, imagery, environment and fabulous decorations combined with the latest computer graphics. So 10/10 for that! Wow! <br /> <br /> The plot line is well predictable. They know that they will save the girl and end up with the killer, but the story is still interesting and fast enough to involve and keep you there. 6/10 for the. <br /> <br /> lantern factor ... I will not rate that, but the movie certainly wound me, and I saw it on video on a TV screen. Of course, this would have a big impact on a big screen. Graphic violence twisted, erotic nature in a surreal landscape - even if it is beautiful - is highly unpredictable. The world in the killer's mind is - thank God! - not my world. Since I saw this movie on video, I was able to repeat a few sequences and found the second time much admiration, if I was not so nervous where the scene would go, and I think the whole movie would be worth it a second time, only for the "visual art". <br /> <br /> General suggestion: Do not bring children or conservative grandparents, but if you prefer the visual look of films, like surrealist art, it does not bother you, it's a bit confused, and you just want a " Thought Trip ", this is a winner. Oh, and if you like girls, Jennifer Lopez is pretty hot. <br /> <br />
