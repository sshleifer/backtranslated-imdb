A couple of students make a new promise to stay in a spooky mausoleum. Of course, the recently deceased is not long dead and hell breaks loose. "One Dark Night" is an entertaining horror of the 80s with some ghastly dead bodies dominated by the mind of a dead mental Raymar, no gore and nudity, but the atmosphere of a mausoleum is very scary. The drama is solid, but the script takes too much time to develop the characters until Raymar breaks the last 20 minutes from his grave. The cinematography is impressive The mausoleum is a great place for the climaxes of the climate. The movie lasts until it's up and this is his main attack7 out of 10.
