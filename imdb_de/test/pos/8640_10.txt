Mulholland Drive, the ninth feature film by David Lynch, is a deeply moving tale of betrayal and jealousy. If anything, he brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes for the often bitter truth. Each frame of this movie has meaning and is connected to other parts and to itself at the same time. Nothing is what it looks like first, and it remains a real puzzle to you when you try to put the pieces together. It is a movie that does not compromise and does not fully master the sophisticated form and camera language, as it did in the past on Lost Highway. <br /> <br /> Although classic Lynchian motives are clearly recognized On devices, the film remains very original, even if it's a Lynch movie. Lost Highway was a new way to tell a story. an unconventional means of bringing emotions to the screen. With the Mulholland Drive, Lynch not only mastered this technique, but also took it to new levels, making it much more complex and multi-dimensional. He creates a framework of different time levels and the human mind. In a press conference on the Cannes Film Festival in 2001, David Lynch said that striving for perfection can at best lead to a result where the whole is more than the sum of the parts. To talk about such synergies is for Mulholland Of great importance, where the different processes and many details contribute to the total. Dreamscapes and parallels intertwine to create the story. For some artworks, beauty is simplicity. This is not the case with Mulholland Drive and has never been the case with Lynch. It is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds Lynch creates, the same complexity that characterizes the real world. <br /> <br /> It is never enforced, as, in my opinion, for example, Memento communicate in an original way with the viewers. When I compare Mulholland Drive with other films, I think he proves David Lynch to be the master of his work, bridging art and film production in a way no one has ever done before. Compared to Alejandro Jodorowsky or contemporary Matthew Barney, I believe that Lynch is more successful in not allowing the artist to dominate the filmmaker, or rather, David Lynch understands and realizes filming as an art form. <br /> <Understanding the storyline is not trivial, but Lynch's work with sound, perspective, chronology and form paints a work of art that is so dark and frightening that sometimes it looks more realistic than in real life. The Lynch cinema is often and especially in the Mulholland Drive a wave of human emotions. Working with emotions is a delicate craft that requires understanding and depth. Lynch puts it this way: "A little too much, and the emotion goes away, a bit too little, and it does not happen." On Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has no problem establishing that balance. Lynch's portraits span all sorts of dimensions and have different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. Seeing Mulholland Drive is a journey through the subconscious. It is a true and nude movie with undeniable artistic value. That's why I love Mulholland Drive and what has brought it to the pinnacle of cinema history. The ultimate movie.
