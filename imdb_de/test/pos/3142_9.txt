John Ford paid the car its toll of a special image, 'Wagon Master', made after two great epics of the Indian cavalry ... It's a beautiful poetic film, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneering spirit ... It did not have that To top the big ones who were about to top ... <br /> <br /> It's extremely easy to shoot ... The camera only moves once or twice throughout the movie, and never when a director has managed to move To resist a shot ... Ford even defies the temptation of following his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women marching tiredly in the dust behind their cars ... They come and go while the camera is motionless remains audience remains on the way of history, not a participant in it ... Of course, if Ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically, as in "Stagecoach", he knows exactly how to do it ... But "Wagon Master" is a tender, nostalgic look backwards ... <br /> <br /> Filled with traditional Western songs by The Sons of Pioneers, it tells of the Walk West to Utah (1879) one of Ward Bond plays the role of Elder Wigg's listed Mormon freight train and two young horse traders (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr). And in a series of beautiful pictures, in which the wagon train fights criminals, Indians and nature to reach the "promised land", the modest "Wagon Master" manages to capture the history and legend of the West ... <br / Ford himself said that "Wagon Master" (from which he wrote the original story) was one of his three films that came "closest to what I wanted to achieve." <br /> <The career of Ford as a Western director was amazing ... More than anyone, he could use the genre to protect his feelings about family, society and the American way of life ... Ford saw the border as a land that must be subjugated by a special class of settlers and lawyers whose great victims protect the land from those who come afterwards ... These early Westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they deserved, and the civilized citizens who followed them, they always had to hold out of fear and respect ... Fords Westerns often use flashbacks that underline the history All the authenticity of his approach ... <br /> <br /> In 'Wagon Master' to For example, folk songs on the soundtrack tell of the strains of the pioneers a century ago, and Ford shows them to us almost documentary ... In a sequence, the train encircles and the settlers besch let's do a square dance ... To make a dance floor, they have to lay boards over the desert sand, and with this ritual celebration Ford shows the defeat of the wilderness through the metaphor of boarding over the land ... <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful-looking movie, full of amazing carefree optimism, and it's easy to understand why Ford found it so satisfying? It never breaks the belief in the mood and style of the first sequences. One wonders, however, whether the ultra-romantic best fits the chosen theme. <br /> <br /> The experience of the waggon train must have been one of the most strenuous and nerve-wracking sufferings of this man (with his wife)) ever self-employed ?? It must be riddled with doubts. Was I wrong to sell everything and come? How can we hope to survive? How do we want to face the other end? Almost every second painful step on the way. <br /> <br /> However, in "Wagon Master" nothing of this feeling really comes through. The journey - that's the general eternity - does not happen to be particularly dangerous. It could be natural that the Mormons were so "high" in the religious spirit that it was more of an anesthetic. In other words, their reactions were not those of normal human weakness ... If so, Ford was right and the doubters were wrong first meeting of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey jr. This is the essence of a carefree adventurous youth, especially that one feels by western teenagers of these extraordinary times? It is a remarkable relationship and remains anchored in memory?
