I just saw the DVD of this award winning movie. One Life Stand is a blatant drama that draws a very convincing and honest picture through tempo, black-and-white shots and atmospheric music. It's a story about the dilemma of life for power, sex and control, highlighted by a few sad, lonely lives. The mother (played very well by Maureen Carr) is excited and withdrawn. The father only appears on the sidelines and yet is a strong and crucial part of the drama. The money is hidden in boxes and shoes. <br /> <br /> The writing was superb, and I liked the sensual close-ups of details like nails, red lips, a candle, mirrors, etc. Just as the camera was used it was very intimate. It's a shattering story with sexual overtones, while the Glasgow drizzle on the dark streets adds to the despair of the sad characters. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable shots that are simply conveyed by a walk or a dropped shoulder - like Trise walking under the bridge. And the stunned and hurt look on Trise's face at the call center, who hopes to help people by using Tarot cards while listening to a caller who talks about their own abuse. <br /> <br /> In the beginning we see John Paul, wide-eyed and innocent, took pictures as he tried to model. Trise, his mother, is deceived and makes bad decisions for him, which in a sense push him away as she tries to hold him. John Paul's modeling becomes an escort job, and the boss of Trise offers their money, and finally they go on a date. There are also moments of humor and subtle irony. An excellent scene is when they eat a fairly ordinary meal and begin to open something when the Father appears with his dark presence and clouds everything. But this and other things offer moments of hope. <br /> <br /> I sometimes had the feeling that the tempo of the movie is too intense, but this is a small detail in another, challenging and memorable movie and a little bit different. It stands in contrast to most American films, which are either total fantasy or the real world when seen through spoiled glasses. This film shows life with all its rough edges and shows unforgettable pictures. <br /> <br /> This is not a 'light conversation' but a thought-provoking and real drama. <br /> <br /> One Life Stand is a really engaging and emotionally honest movie.
