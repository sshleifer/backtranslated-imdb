The mere presence of Sam Waterston as Indian is enough to put this film in the category "must". He is both beautiful and very subtle, without any lines. He is tender with his kidnappers, and yet we can see that he is one of the proudest of all young Indian men. Martin Sheen is just a stupid cluck challenging Waterston (White Bull) for a beautiful white horse. Other negotiations are really unnecessary. I do not understand the role Caroline Langrishe played as the poor girl kidnapping White Bull ... I do not know how she keeps her hands off this beautiful Indian! It's a lot of fun; especially if you are a Waterston fan. Man, he looks good in this !!! Harvey Keitel's role is not even worth talking about to tell the truth! But rent it and enjoy it! I really believe that if the music had been better, it would have been a more dramatic movie ... The music is so bad, it distracts. Nevertheless, there is Mr. Waterston!
