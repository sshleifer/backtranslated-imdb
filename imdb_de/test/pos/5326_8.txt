Before I saw this movie, I read the comment from someone who does not like it very much. I have to admit that I was worried about dedicating 1 hour and 48 minutes to my life, but I'm glad I did. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor. I especially loved the believer. Don Cheadle was fantastic as well. The film offered an interesting view of life and death. It was very touching and very sad, but I was interested in what most touching stories can not. It's a movie that is reckless, whether you like it or not, you should see it. It was unique and I do not think anyone will ever be able to copy it. All the young actors have surprisingly beaten in the face of the theme and the emotions that must have gone into them. I was positively surprised.
