... the last time I laughed so much. It's a testament to Rowan Atkinson's ability to create a multi-layered comic with a well-defined personality - without saying a word. The overall success of the program lies on Atkinson's shoulders, but he wears it with ease. Despite the fact that the show ran for only one season, anyone who vaguely explores pop culture recognizes the gummed social tard. Mr. Bean is sometimes annoying, sometimes lovable. He's an innocent, unfortunate guy who happens to be incarnate too. The brilliance of this character can not be put into words, you have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the show gets almost too depressing, like in the infamous New Year's sketch or when Bean celebrates his birthday when he goes to a restaurant alone, offers himself a greeting card signed by him and gets a stake, he is not exactly imaginative. Still, there are times when you can not help feeling impressed by the inventive methods that Bean finds out of trouble, such as eliminating that mission in a number of clever ways, or turning into swimming trunks, without take the pants off first! Whatever your reaction to Bean and his unorthodox lifestyle may be, you'll inevitably start laughing when you see him. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to point out that although "bean" is classified as a program for children, it is just as enjoyable for any adult with a sense of humor. As the more "adult" jokes go beyond the heads of the little ones and the smart slapstick (yes, there is such a thing) is funny, no matter how old you are, "bean" is the true definition of a family show. This is rightly a classic and it always brightens my day.
