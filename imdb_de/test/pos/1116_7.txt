This is a great family movie that deals with down-to-earth people who enjoy their local interests, especially in equestrian sports. Lloyd Bourdelle, (Walter Matthau), is a farmer who also raises quarter horses, and has a small son named Casey Bourdelle who loves horses. Lloyd is able to raise a full-grown horse, which he calls "Casey's Shadow" after his son. This horse breaks all speed records and may be a winner of a million dollar race. Sarah Blue, (Alexis Smith) is interested in this horse and offers to buy the horse for $ 500.00. However, this horse suffers severe leg injuries and Lloyd receives a serious setback that upsets the entire family. Walter Matthau has done a great job, and this is a great movie to watch and enjoy.
