"Caribe" is in no way a masterpiece. However, it does provide an absolutely enjoyable story along with great cinematography. The narrative structure is arranged around two narrative axes, one of which embeds the other, each element having elements that are in excellent harmony and exist side by side. History never loses the right tempo and shows a very good mixing of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a figure in itself). Acting is great, and we owe it to up-and-coming director Esteban Ram√≠rez. In addition, the characters are very well written and masterfully complex. Once you become familiar with them, you can perceive their feelings without them even saying anything. I can not say that I liked this picture because of all the hustle and bustle (in Costa Rica), but rather because of the way in which it really manages to show an interesting portrait of what happens when you balance the life of the Affect people. Hopefully, Caribe will create a reference for future projects in Costa Rica, as this is a very good example of good filmmaking.
