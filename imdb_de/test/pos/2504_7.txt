Apart from being mostly filmed in Rockport, MA, a beautiful town where my mom once hired a small business and I spent so many pleasant summers as a kid, it's a fun and cute little movie. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I did not feel like actually seeing this movie, although I have a weakness for romantic comedies (I do not know why). The trailers I saw were not appealing, the cast did not look so interesting and I had no idea what the plot was about. In the end I found it an interesting meditation on relationships and family. I am very amused and have to admit that I thought this movie was one of the most overlooked gems of the last year. I am disappointed that so few people have apparently enjoyed the "humanity" that this film has presented to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I've read a lot of bad reviews about this movie and need to admit a certain level of shock about the cynicism that prevails in them. As a student, I think I'm pretty cynical, but this was a beautiful little movie that deserves a lot better than he deserves.
