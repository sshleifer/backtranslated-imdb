Surely this movie is not for everyone - but for anyone who has a sense of humor and a love for the epoch movie - buy it now! Where else is there 70s fashion, beginner vocabulary, karate-trained hookers, crime, a rap about the sinking of the Titanic, gunfights and a co-star named Queen Bee (watch out for her stirring wine scene early on) at the Guardian Office!) You can not go wrong with a movie that's a mix of pornography / Dawn of The Dead / and Car Wash. This is one that you must observe over and over again after putting the children to bed.
