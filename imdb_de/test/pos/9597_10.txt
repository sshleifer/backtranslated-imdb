This is a true gem of a television movie. Based on a totally untrue story, it follows the run of the run-down football league club through its progress in the English FA Cup, where chaos follows and players all play in the style of the Seventy. The end is unexpected, the performances are great and Nick Hancock shows he can do something different than host sports shows. I only regret that I did not record it.
