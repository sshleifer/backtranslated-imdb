Hynkel, dictator of Tomania, is a spoiled child who gets angry when he can not get what he really wants ... And what he wants is nothing less than the world ... In one of the most extraordinary scenes of Chaplin Art Hynkel performs a ballet with the "world" that explodes when he thinks he has it under control ... <br /> <br /> Chaplin also has some snappy words about war and war movies. In a scene at the beginning of the film, which takes place in the First World War, the messenger of the Tomanier crashes the plane and thinks ... He is about to die ... In a state of delirium he begins to say ridiculous words ... The empty double talk continues to rise to a brilliant start in all the heroic death scenes of war films ... <br /> <br /> In another scene where he becomes a refugee in the Jewish ghetto and takes command of the resistance, who is stoking the rebellion among the old men, he plans to kill the dictator ... One of the group must kill the merciless conqueror of Austerlich ... Who is selected, of course, will die, but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will be in The story of Tomania's history shining like a star ... <br /> <br /> The order in which he and four other characters eat cream cake to determine which ones sacrifice His life to assassinate the dictator is a bitter he-he-he-over With all its disappointing shortcomings, "The Great Dictator" is still a major film for the film's ironic tone of adding something that neither Chaplin nor anything else could have given: the irony of history ... The need to assassinate Hynkel, presupposes the attempted murder of his generals against Hitler ... The power of the original satire is only surpassed by the imitation of history art ... <br /> <br /> "The Great Dictator" is Chaplin's first talking film with a grandiose sequence like the duck-hunting accident that causes the dictator to be confused with the humble Jewish barber and vice versa. This time 'Charles' and not 'Charlie' want to say more through his film and not through an amusing comedy, the last one in which he uses his famous 'tramp character'.
