This movie reminded me to watch the old black-and-white movies with my dad. Lifelike characters who are looking for love, in love and lose it. Old story fresh view. Larenz Tate was as stylish as Cary Grant, as the character was in a Clumsey situation, but the actor prevented him from looking stupid and looking like a cardboard box. Nia Long has always been a favorite of mine. She's cute, even if she's tough, almost like a Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best works and shows that he is better than always playing an angry black man. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic, great actor, well written, a real love story that takes place in Chicago, and much more Can you ask for SuperB Black Love Story? <br /> <br />
