This is a really dark movie. Noir indeed. The title character is Pocken, who unknowingly brought Evelyn Keyes to New York City. <br /> <br /> She is on a mission when she arrives and on a hard after talking to her no longer innocent sister. But she herself is not intentionally a murderer. That does not mean she does not kill. That does not mean that their presence somewhere under eight million other people does not stir up the city. <br /> <br/> Keyes is excellent. The side occupation is also very good. It involves several little-known people - including the director. Do not be put off. It's a movie to be reckoned with! (And how nice to see a Columbia picture Colombia and the Republic have released wonderful comedies and noirs, but we barely see them anymore.)
