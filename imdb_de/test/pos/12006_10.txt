Probably grossly underestimated by all those who have never lived under the communist regime. Although it seems hard to believe that everything happened, the reality was even worse than the movie. It's like Orwellian fiction, but that's not fiction. John Hurt is excellent as always. Yes, the script is not full of action, but it's not life either. The plot is breathtaking. Yes, people were shot, yes, thousands. Their "crime" was that they wanted to leave communist "paradise" without government approval. Sometimes the film drives tears in the eyes. We need more films like this to really appreciate what America offers for us. Excellent movie, highly recommended! God bless our country, USA!
