The film is based on a Jules Verne book that I read about ten years ago. I remember that I liked the book very much, and this movie is good at telling the story. The most important thing in this film, however, is not the story, but the very original visual look. <br /> <br /> The visuals are absolutely beautiful and seem to be achieved through a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animations and sets painted to resemble an animated movie. Combined with Jules Verne's own unique versions of airplanes and submarines and the good directorial credentials of Karel Zeman, the result is a very successful and convincing visual style that keeps the attention going until the end of the movie one of the underwater scenes may end up being unnecessarily time-consuming, as the story went through pretty quickly in the first part of the movie. None of this is important as the movie is always very enjoyable. A jewel that deserves to be known to today's audience. A recommended movie for the whole family.
