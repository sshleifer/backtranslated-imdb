They loved The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Vertigo, Oldboy ... And I guarantee that you will love these more. It's a brilliant thriller. The story is so simple and yet so enthralling. It keeps you at the edge of the seat until the end. For slow scenes, simple music adds more perfection to the movie. it is so real. The performance is first class. The direction of the sequences ... they are too perfect. If I could, I would put it in the top 10 thrillers ever made. The most entertaining thriller I've seen for some time ... ***** / ***** My voice helps me get this movie to the top of the 250.
