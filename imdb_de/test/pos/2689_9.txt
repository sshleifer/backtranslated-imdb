I'm not really a t.v. Observers - except between the ages of 6 and 8 and General Hospital had Luke and Laura - but there are a few exceptions and I definitely think that "King of Queens" is one of them. Every decade has classics and I think this show will be among the best of the decade. His comedic timing is fantastic and can sometimes be quite strange. With a more "serious" note, the actors manage to convey more than subtle - and not so subtle - complexities in their characters without becoming too hokey. One commentator wrote that it may take a few episodes to get involved, and I agree; It's definitely one that will grow on you, but once you're inside, you're pretty addicted. For good reason!
