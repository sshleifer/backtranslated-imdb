Francis Ford Coppola's first "personal" film, completed and released in 1969, was the last film he shot before The Godfather as a largely unknown director. He stands in stark contrast to this film and the rest of his bumpy career. It is supposedly a road movie in which an unconnected young woman, bored with domestic life, is pregnant. She is pregnant with a child who is not sure if she wants it. She flees from her boring marriage and seeks the free road in search of freedom. On the way, she befriends a nice man, a former footballer who suffered brain damage through a traumatic head injury, unexpectedly played by a young James Caan, and decides to help him, even though he is frustrated with his easy ways , Their efforts to get rid of him fail either through guilt or coincidence and finally lead them directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded policeman (Robert Duvall), who has his own ideas. The plot is worn out, but Coppola is very good at describing the emotional lives of these characters in detail, and uses cutting techniques to pass on background stories that were not at all common in American films of the time. The shots are simple yet extremely effective. They convey both the capricious devastation of the open highway and the emptiness of American city life, which is filled with a soft melancholy of film music. Coppola also deserves recognition for addressing the issue of domestic dissatisfaction from the woman's perspective in the culturally turbulent sixties. All in all a rather cautious movie, which the audience does not expect from Coppola, but a small triumph in his calm, modest way. 7.5 / 10.
