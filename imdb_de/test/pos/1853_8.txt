When I saw the trailer for this movie, I did not say to anyone, "This film is going to bomb." I also said that about THE MATRIX and see what happened there. Now I'm not a box office guru, but I usually have a pretty good sense of what's going to be good and what's going to be shit. In this case I was blinded by my utter apathy towards David Duchovney. Let me say it another way: I do not like his person (from what I've read in interviews from him, he is unbelievably preparatory and he is full of himself, considering everything he's done X's -files) or as an actor. GOD'S GAME was a really bad movie, but he figured he'd made a lot of money on the big screen for some reason. But I am pleased to say that while "Return To Me" is sexy and that his heart is in the right place, even if these things may still be true. Bonnie Hunt has staged a beautiful story and she has told her with class and grace. This is one of the most romantic films I have ever seen, and although it seems a bit sad and maudlin in its premise, give it a chance and you will be amazed. <br /> <br /> It must be said (and that hurts me) that the movie works so well because it has history and cast. Duchovney and Driver are so wonderful and believable here that I honestly wanted to cry with them. There is a particularly powerful scene when Duchovney comes home after his wife's death and he collapses on the floor of his house. As always, the family dog ​​looks to the door and waits for his wife to enter. She does not do it and with his bloody shirt collar Rob (Duchovney) says she will not come home. Then he calls the dog over and they seem to share a scream. The dog moans and then Rob weeps. And this is one of the most realistic moments of pain I've ever seen in a movie in a movie. You can feel his pain and at that moment I forgot that I was watching an actor that I generally dislike, and I felt like I was watching someone I knew was screwing up his lover's loss. This is a strong stuff. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the movie is the understudy. Bonnie Hunt has combined an ethnic melting pot of Irish and Italian characters that have a common bond. They share a pub called O'Reilley's Italian Pub. This is a delicious name for itself. And the diametrical scale of cultures in conflict is Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia. These are two proud old men who love their homeland, but their granddaughter and niece (I think so). And that's the character Minnie Driver plays. This scenario is ripe for the comedy and Hunt misses nothing here. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi also share some fun moments with each other when the middle-aged couple and Belushi get top marks when he cruelly submits to humility and laughs at his rich stomach. Since his family consists of three or four children, he and his wife have little time to spare time. And again, Hunt handles with perfect elegance. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful story of how to find true love and how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family. Return To Me is a wonderful romance, and although I still did not particularly admire David Duchovney, I have to admit that he was perfect in that role, and I could not imagine anyone else playing his character. He was sensitive and believable and the movie was good because of him, not just because of him, but he certainly contributed to it. <br /> <br /> If you are a good guy for a good romance and want to have a good taste cry then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10 I'll see everything that Bonnie Hunt does with her on the director's chair.
