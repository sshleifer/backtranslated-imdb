This movie always hits me emotionally in the end. Although the themes of the film - interracial romance and adultery - were controversial at the time, this film goes far beyond the narrow parameters of groundbreaking novelties and groundbreaking uniqueness. Here is a true love story written by the woman involved in this love affair. She is narrated in a brilliant aggressive style that distinguishes the virtues and glory of crazy passionate love. I "love" this affirmation of the only emotion that makes life truly worth living. Jennifer Jones is full of grace and William Holden is just great in his role as a reporter. A wonderful movie that only people who have been in this kind of love can appreciate and understand. And for those of you who are not in love already, the hope that one day lightning can strike for you makes life worth living - because love is worth it, even if only for a short time - even if you lose - because love is the "stuff" - the essence - of life. This movie works for me. A warm feeling!
