I've seen the entire first season now and I can say that I have not enjoyed a show with this standard for a long time. It's great to see such a show in the pipeline. I hope many are on their way to the season finale Best Bar None can not wait for Season 2, as far as I can remember, things can only get better, as Milles continues to change, his family will come back and how will they come from the church roof When they act on this level, it's easy to understand why the show is such a big hit with people as long as people do shows like these. I will continue to watch. I think it's hard to come up with an original idea because so many shows cover a wide range of topics as original as this one is refreshing
