As already mentioned, the short film "Every Sunday" (1936) can be regarded as the first music video. This was a lucky coincidence due to the fact that MGM had to use its feature-length footage to crank out a variety of short films for the show. They had a couple of fresh young vocal talents (Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin) at their disposal that were essentially a mixture of musical styles to form a kind of Norman Rockwell concert in the park. <br /> <br /> At that time, who would have dreamed of capturing the best picture collection since Eisenstein's sequence "Odessa Steps"? <br /> <br /> It's Sunday with some inattentive people sitting around a small wooden band in the park, while a tired-looking ensemble plays Strauss. The events begin and next Sunday Judy and Deanna save the day. The opera Deanna sings "Il Bacio" (The Kiss) and Garland follows with the contrasting "Waltz with Swing". The climax adds the two styles together to a duo "Americana". <br /> <br /> A must. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
