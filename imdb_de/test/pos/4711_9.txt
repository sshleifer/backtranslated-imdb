I'm afraid I have to add my name to the long list of people who are still amazed that this movie has not yet been released on DVD (September 2007). It's one of those puzzles that astonish the mind, especially considering the number of DVDs available today with material that should have been bundled years ago. I still have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam stereo. So my concern is more a principle than a frustration that I can not see the movie. As far as the movie itself is concerned, this is an excellent allrounder with good picture quality, more than satisfactory soundtrack, vivacious plot that involves tension, emotions, grief, frustration, a good feeling and an exotic environment (for a European). How Correctly Does the Film Fit The Reality In Burma I have no idea, this is less important, the important thing is that entertainment is a success. One is quickly connected to each of the main characters and I admit to have my heart in my mouth during the last river crossing. It is a shame that we hear so little about countries like Burma, and this film gives at least a glimpse of the country. Has the situation changed since 1995? The events that will occur later this month seem to answer this question with a clear "no," and the existing regime seems to be as brutal as ever, without sparing the lives of monks, let alone women or children !
