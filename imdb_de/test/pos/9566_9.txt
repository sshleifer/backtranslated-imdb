This movie is not a comedy but an exhibition. I've always hated dog shows, considering how ridiculous the people the dogs are and the idiotic names they give them. The reason for my uncontrolled cackling while watching this movie. I get a kick when something is taken so seriously, even if the profits are small and insignificant. It's like mini golf, jump rope championships or the need to set an obscure world record. Acting was much more sophisticated in this film than "Waiting for Guffman," largely due to the fluidity of the characters, who feel more comfortable with their specific actors in the film than the previous ones. Eugene Levy was great, as were Michael McKean and Fred Willard. However, it was the dogs that eventually stole the show. But who wants to see a bunch of people in a movie about dogs?
