I loved the movie, but I like to read the true story behind the films based on a true story. Does anyone know the names and locations of the real characters the movie is based on? I did a full internet search and can not find any information about this case. I only get the movie information and the fact that it is based on a "true story". I can not believe that a judge would change his punishment immediately in the courtroom, even after such a warm speech from his brother (great John Corbett), but overall the story was very gripping. If anyone knows the real "real story", I would be glad if you share it!
