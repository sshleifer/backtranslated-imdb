I looked at it because a friend told me it was damn good, and I watched a video, so I really wanted to see it. I saw it, and damn it, the fight scenes are really good. If the boys can not fight like that in real life, they've really deceived me. I have to say, there are not as many fights as I want, but the fights in the movie are quite spectacular. They do not show much, but you can say that it's violent and cool. But there is also the plot that revolves around a love triangle between the main characters, though it is a bit twisted. Tae-sung is a carefree guy who loves getting into trouble, as well as fighting. He is the leader of his school and the rival of Hea-won, the leader of his own school - a bit of a playboy, a hot head and a rich boy. Then there's Han-kyung, a girl who does not look for her much - her dad just died and she's moved back with her mother, the guy she liked goes out with her old friend - and then she meets Hea -won, she goes to her school and Tae-sung, which she calls "nuna" (older sister). Eventually, she discovers that Tae-sung is her brother, fruit of one of her father's affairs, and he loves her despite her kinship. Meanwhile, Hea-won falls in love with her and takes her as his friend. But she's torn between her boyfriend and her little brother, who confesses her love. All in all, it's a wonderful movie, but when I was really depressed after the end, I just could not help but think, Damn, are all the Korean movies I see about fight / death / depression / incest? Because that was the case with Old Boy and Temptation of Wolves. It's a very good movie, but people have to be ready to cry in the end.
