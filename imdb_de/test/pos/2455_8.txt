This film has a deep insight into the relationships between a mother who grew up in a Christian environment and learned that looks are everything. She and her son, who recently returned from Vietnam, collided in very tense situations. The relationship has no intimate relationships and is a very accurate representation of what it is like to live with someone who is wrong and only looks at the surface of problems. Kathy Bates is an excellent task to portray a woman of false faith who either does not know her cruelty, is forgetful or just does not want to be confronted. Jeremy's anger is never feared and leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his father's love for him. This is a very honest look at the family dynamics after a traumatic event has led to despair.
