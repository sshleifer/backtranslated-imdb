The Wagonmaster's reputation probably does not lead to deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, such as The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and The Grapes of Anger's Awe and Deep Contentment. The story is very simple: Two cowboys decide to get a Mormon wagon train to California. On the way they meet a medicine man whose mules have run away, a group of bank robbers and some Navajos. The road is full of adventure and excitement and the movie is full of fun and beauty. The music is absolutely beautiful. The landscape, also from Monument Valley, is more beautiful than ever. And how can you do something wrong with James Arness? Although the wagon master is not one of John Ford's best-known films, it's still a must if you get the chance. 10.9.
