The Argentine music poet Atahualpa Yupanqui once said that some folk music is similar in every country in the world. They look the same, but everyone sees them as their own folk music ... <br /> <br /> This film is, as I feel it, the same music that pops up at any point in the history of any country repeated throughout the world. At first, some people hear the game and try to hear it from others. Then some people think they hear, but they do not. Then nobody says anything and some people seem to hear it. And others realize that they heard it, but did not think others could hear it. After all, they all hear the same music, and suddenly it does not sound anymore ... Love and poetry, as true nationalism and the inheritance of a father to his children ... Why should he call the movie The Dead if nobody dies? The Spanish translation of the title declined to follow the same rule, and we call it Dubliners, after James Joyce's title ... <br /> <br /> A beautiful Irish postcard from 1900!
