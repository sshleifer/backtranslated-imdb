Despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war, this movie is not too sticky and rosy, because love is like a rose: with thorns, then. The four leading actors set their characters realistic and with sense and balance between tragedy and down-to-earthness. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of the Cabaret / Chanson Esquire songs (sung by Keira Knightley himself) draw the viewer deeper and deeper into the film, from place to place between the brutal war and between the two peaceful love. Some people may consider it too much biopic, but it's mostly a romantic story, though it follows the life of Dylan Thomas and the love triangle that is marked by joy and jealousy. <br /> <br /> London is once visualized from a different angle. The bohemian life of Dylan during the bombing of the Germans plays in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. The independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly trapped in feelings of love and anger. <br /> <br /> Maybe the end is too twisted and it's a bit off the rest of the movie, but all in all this is a great romantic story.
