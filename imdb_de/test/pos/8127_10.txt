I enjoyed watching this movie for the first time a few years ago, and when it airs somewhere again (which happens occasionally on European cable TV), I experience the same thing. I am touched, entertained and want everything there. There were more films like this. <br /> <br /> It's all about Leo (Kevin McKidd) and his group of friends who live in urban London, Leo as a gay man who follows a friend to a hilarious New Age male group and falls on the straight Guy Brendon played by James Purefoy, who finally does not turn out to be so direct. As secondary characters of the equally great Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving are seen whose side story alone is worth the movie. Simon Callow is the leader of the Men's Group, which as always shows a great performance. It's really hard to find people here because every character, including the female ones, like Jennifer Ehle, Julie Graham and Harriet Walter, are played exquisitely. Even Kevin McKidd may look pale compared to his co-actors, but it does benefit his somewhat subdued character. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this film is a simple one: there are never any black and white classifications Difficult and can not always pass the test of time. <br /> <br /> Leo identifies himself as gay, but ends up looking for a woman who turns out to be his teenage girlfriend and Brendon's longtime girlfriend. Brendon starts straight away, but learns that gays are more than an option for him and that bisexuality is not so bad. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Weaving) are gay and love, and even the straight people in the movie, like Angie, the roommate of Leo, get their share of love and fun moments by the end of the movie. The comedy pieces (especially Tom Hollander, who is just funny) are funny and punctual and the emotions are believable, as confusing as they sometimes seem when reading this summary. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is its really positive performance. Whether you are gay, heterosexual, bisexual or just not sure, in this movie you just feel OK to NOT be safe and that "being unsure" can also be something valuable! Sexuality is portrayed fluently in this film and none of the main characters seem to have a real problem, apart from the struggles between gay and straight camps that sometimes feed you in other gay theme films. I can only fully agree with the subtext of the film that what you feel comfortable with one day when you think you would look very gay, heterosexual, however, as a whole on another. I have never (bisexually?) Portrayed bisexuality, or perhaps just the absence of the need for separation for sexual classification, in such a heartwarming and lifelike manner. <br /> <br /> This movie dares to go where few movies are, gay or straight films, by not playing labels and making and relying on stereotypical assumptions about sex. It goes on and assumes that sex is possible after known classifications, and I think the times are more than ready for that, and for other films exploring postmodern topics like this one! <br /> <br /> And for all those who do not care, damn it, it's just a fun comedy worth seeing on a rainy Saturday night with popcorn on your hands. Try it! <br /> <br /> Loved it!
