At the opening in London during the Christmas season of 1969, this musical version of James Hilton's famous story was stunned by the critics. The same reception greeted him when he opened in the US, and MGM pulled back the status of "roadshow" and cut off almost all the songs. What a mistake !!! <br /> <br /> Years later, as the trendy world of the 60s and 70s turned on itself, this version of GOODBYE, MR.CHIPS is a total treat. As "chipping" Peter O'Toole gives one of his greatest achievements. To see him change from the hated, cold, emotionless Latin teacher at a boy's boarding school to a man who can finally see the colors of the world (after falling in love with and marrying music star Catherine Briskit) is a genius at work. (If you can, look at LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, LION IN WINTER, MY FAVORITE YEAR and CHIPS over several days or weeks.) Then you'll see what a really great actor O'Toole is and how great he is in CHIPS.) <br /> <br /> Catherine, as played by Petula Clark at the peak of her popularity, is always a man's dream; beautiful, loving, understanding and with a great voice. Most of the songs are beautiful and fit perfectly with the story, while the director of the late Herbert Ross brings the process to life wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie may be a bit too romantic for some people, but for those looking for a beautifully played, sung and directed love story, it's no problem. (If you can get the widescreen version of the laser disc in your hands, even better, I'm looking forward to the debut of CHIPS on DVD.)
