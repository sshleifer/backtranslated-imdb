Oliver Stone is not afraid of a movie or theme. He endeavors to confront people with their fears or show them their ugly faces in the mirror. Check his CV to prove it! This movie is no exception, on the contrary, it's another gem that unfortunately many have not seen. <br /> <br /> While controversial films are going on, this is one thing you should be grateful for. A movie that should inspire you to think about you, the people around you. The prejudices that exist and that each of us has in some form. We either like to admit it or not, but it's easier to categorize people and be like, "Ah, he's 'xyz', yes, he has to be like that ...". Now maybe I read too much about it, but I do not believe it. I believe that Oliver Stone is a very intelligent filmmaker and that he was aiming for these things. And if you want to discover something (as a movie or in yourself), then watch this movie and be excited!
