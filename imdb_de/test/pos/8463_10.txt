Ever wondered where this episode "Tuttle" came from in the middle of the first season of M * A * S * H? Well, now the cat is out of the bag: you got it from this Soviet film, a satire about the tsar's stupidity, because a pen has leaked out (the phrase "the lieutenants ..." has turned into "Lieutenant Kizhe") " which is meaningless) and no one is honest or brave enough to contradict him and just tell him the truth - Kizhe does not exist and never did, so they make an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him - and 40 years later David Ketchum and Bruce Shelly borrowed this crazy conspiracy and essentially gave us the same story, just on the other side of the Cold War, proving that people in high positions could be stupid regardless of their loyalty!
