Call all D students! Grab your friends, go to the theater and see the hell out of this movie. From the opening sequence until after the credits you laugh yourself breathless. <br /> <br /> This film is a wild journey through the history of D, not just a list of the fools of things they did, but a record of their rise to power. I'm a big fan of Rage Kage (Kyle Gass) and Jables (Jack Black), so of course I loved the movie. <br /> <br /> It helps to know about the show and its first CD, but it's just as funny if you do not. From the witty and vulgar lyrics, the rock rhythms, the huge pot-smoking and the cameos to the madness that is the story, this is a movie for D-students and newbies. <br /> <br /> Many of her songs, such as Two Kings, Tribute and Kielbasa are referred to their many audio tracks such as cock push-ups. Any fan in the audience will say, I remember it as well as new. Comers say, "This is F'ing hilarious!" I can recommend this movie to any body that has ever rocked. This film is certainly in a tough competition for the next "This is Spinal Tap". One of the best ever.
