I've been strangely drawn to this movie since I saw it on Showtime in the early '80s. I say weird because it's more of a ridiculous touch of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in Plot completely alien. What is achieved is a wonderfully hypnotic and quite pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and the wonderful score contribute to a curious and extremely interesting exercise in a kind of filmmaking that is rarely seen today. It really is one of my big "guilty pleasures". I was fortunate enough to find it on an old laser disc and looked at it more often than I thought was healthy. A rewarding mood piece.
