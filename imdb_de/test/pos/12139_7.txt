I agree with all the strengths mentioned in the other reviews, but here are a few beats that cling to the genre of thriller or film noir and keep it from being a big drama that goes beyond the boundaries of the "elements" Film Noir - not to say that the great movie noirs are not / are / should be big dramas, but this is not the case. <br /> <br /> One more note of the music in the movie is used sparingly, but I would say it is used to emphasize the action more often than the woman elements. Great attitude for this movie, by the way, with an abrupt kind of ending, which is either right or wrong depending on it. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow some specifics. <br /> <br /> The big change in the story is that children see their mother die, or it should be the big moment. But the kids never react either way. Neither does she cry or ask her father what happened, the kids are good actors and in my opinion the father's reactions are what matters, but that's a big misstep. This is the heart of the story, and the children are mostly empty in their reaction. They really do not have any, in the next scene they look as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> Similarly, there is a connection that forms between Belmondo and Ventura's characters. Belmondo says he knew the killed partner - but that is never explained and has no dramatic impact on Belmondo or others. The romantic Belmondo subdivision also impairs credibility, though it has been convincing. Ventura's character just lets Belmondo incorporate a completely strangers into their escape plan for no reason. He does not even comment or seems to notice. Another gap. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie, and I will not ruin it, the ending happens off the screen with a fleeting voice to let you know what happened. I suspect this is trying to make life more alive, but like these other missteps, the drama remains off the screen. <br /> <br /> What good is it if you do not deal with these issues? I do not know, unless perhaps the film's goals were limited to giving the audience what it wants from a crime melodrama - suggesting some deeper elements and then ignoring them. <br /> <br /> Badly too, there is a lot to recommend this movie. Ventura is very good, but too bad, it could have been both a great drama and a crime story - like the IMDb favorite movie of all time THE GODFATHER. This movie had potential. Making a good remake, if there were more problems in the US, would probably bring the film down, but in the hands of the right director this would be a good remake, though it is questionable if Ventura's performance could be surpassed , <br /> <br /> Well worth seeing, but frustrating overall
