A notorious big budget flop on release. This Robert Altman-inspired comedy has some great moments and an occasionally inspired cast. Although it takes too long and loses its focus completely, there are enough fun moments that will keep a curious onlooker watching until the very end. If you're a fan of character actors and actresses, this will be a treat for you; You will recognize so many great little-known performers in this movie (you may know their names, but you know their faces), even the boy of A Christmas Story will appear in a small part. Rent from Netflix, if you read this, I bet you will enjoy it.
