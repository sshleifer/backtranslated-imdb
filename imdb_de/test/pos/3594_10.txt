What I liked best in this movie was the landscape of Corfu. As a Greek, I love my country and the flattering perspective of the director. Based on a true story in the years when Greece was on its own legs due to wars, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love, but the times are tough and they have many sacrifices. Nicholas Cage, who looks good in a uniform, gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love. I loved that Christian Bale Mandras, the heroine's husband, played. He looks very good as a Greek, his personality was that of the Greek patriot! A real fighter there or what? One of the films I want to buy and keep in my collection ... forever!
