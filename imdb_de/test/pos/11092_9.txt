Based on the true story of Christopher Boyce (Hutton) and Daulton Lee (Penn) and their involvement in the sale of US secret government documents to the Soviets in the 1970s. Boyce works for the government, and his job is to protect those specific documents, ultimately disillusioning him with the affairs and practices of his country. Then he asks his friend drug dealer Daulton Lee, who becomes a wanted man, to be the messenger for these sensitive documents. Lee infiltrates the Russian embassy in Mexico and makes contact with Alex (Suchet), and they both begin to play the espionage game. Lee's interest relates solely to money, while Boyce plays out of anger towards the anger system in which he is involved. Alex believes that Lee is the insider of the American government. Things are starting to break down as Lee's drug addiction and reckless behavior in dealing with the messenger position compensate Alex and Boyce. Lee becomes more paranoid and the initial espionage game becomes deadlier and more consistent for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is a real spy thriller without cheesy action. The characters and the analysis of real motives are sympathetic, but very well written, and the film skilfully combines real events with the underlying political themes about the predatory behavior of humans. Where a larger nation uses its political power to control the smaller nations. Correctly directed and in parts intense, especially where the protagonists in the spy play immeasurably in the head. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give amazingly exciting performances in a film that questions authority, yet there is no easy answer to the political message or complexity of this system. The plight of the protagonists becomes the underlying message within "The Hawk and the Snowman," making them a clever political thriller with a poignant element about society, human relationships, and the American system. Great movie! <br /> <br /> **** 1/2 from *****!
