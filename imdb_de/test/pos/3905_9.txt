I remember watching an Elizabeth Montgomery movie when I was maybe five years old (though) and to this day I can remember this movie (in part only). It was the movie that I remembered all my life because I was so scared. I think I remember the part of the story and the house was always dark. The main part that was the craziest for me was Elizabeth, who was running around the house in the dark and then someone outside. At the time, I thought I was an old witch, but the memory of it is now much blurred, so I can not really remember who it was, but it was definitely someone lurking in a field outside ... most. I really wish I could see this movie again. If anyone knows how to get a copy, please email valid908@yahoo.com
