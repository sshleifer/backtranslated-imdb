This is a really great and nice movie. The underlying theme of this film is the innocent child (Heather Graham as Joline), who strives to voice na√Øve desires on how the world should make sense while being steadily depressed by the real world. However, it is not an unlucky film - just the opposite. It's a funny movie with a sad side, but when I think of the movie, I feel so happy. At the beginning of the film, the pretty, vulnerable Joline faces a drug addict who tries to break into her friend's car. She has reasons for him, persuades him to seek help, and gives him $ 30 as a start. At the end of the film, he reappears to repay her. He explains that he has no drugs, that he is fine, and he thanks her. I can hear the cynics moan. Of course, that would never really happen. This movie does not take place in the real world. It takes place in the world where we wish we were alive. The sad part is the realization that we are not living there. The happy part is knowing that there are people who want us to do it.
