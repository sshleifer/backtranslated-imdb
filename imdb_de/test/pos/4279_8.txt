Fellowes drama about the marriage of a couple who is threatened by a younger third who is interested in the wife of the house (Watson). Wilkinson plays the role very well as the disturbed husband, who can not control his wife's cheating, and deals with the problem. I also like Rupert Everett very much in his role as William Bule, the man with whom Watson has the affair. Although I think Emily Watson is a great actress, I had a bit of a problem with the way her character was written She had no reasons behind her). The script was perhaps the weakest part of this drama, though Fellowes had a good direction and the performances were pretty good too. This movie is better than "Unfaithful", but by no means a masterpiece. IMDB rating: 6.7, my rating: 8/10
