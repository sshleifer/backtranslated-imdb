I thought that was a very good movie. Someone said it was "sick" so they could not see it. I think if you know that his R is rated then you will be prepared for nudity and drug use. It's a good story and the spectacle is incredible. It just can not be a prudent to appreciate it! Basically, it's about a mother who's taking drugs and wants to get clean, so she calls a very wealthy old friend and he pulls her onto his property and crazy things happen. I think it's a drama. I'm just so sick of people who do not like movies because they cuss or are naked. That's the world we live in. You obviously do not feel comfortable with you when you can not see such things. And it's rated R. That should tell you from the beginning that they are not all peachy happy rainbows. I liked it. I think you will too
