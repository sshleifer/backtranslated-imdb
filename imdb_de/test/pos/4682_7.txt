My reaction to this remake of "The Italian Job" is probably hopelessly mixed with the events in my life when I saw it. This is the first movie I saw after finding a job just after 8 months of unemployment and returning to school for retraining. The money was still tight, but I no longer had to decide if I would watch a movie in the cinema and pay bills (or have lunch). The feeling of relief and gratitude that I felt then was enormous. As a result, my enjoyment of "Italian Job" was probably out of all proportion to its actual value. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I picked it up a few weeks ago as a DVD and watched it again, and I still enjoyed it very much. I have never seen the original (though I've heard it's an absolute classic), but its modern counterpart is great to see if you look at the modern production values ​​used on older movie plots and themes. <br /> <br /> What initially inspired me about the movie was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the softest, most textured and pleasurable soundtracks. IJ starts with a sly, funny, pulsating arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonies, brush work and quiet moments - it convinced me from the very first second. And the whole movie is like this - I have not heard that kind of sounding, sounding and pulsing soundtrack since Stewart Copeland left the police and started making soundtracks for movies like "Rumble Fish". There are at least a dozen irresistible recorded motifs, along with some pop-song remakes ranging from "okay" to "inspired". For people who care about the soundtrack, this movie is a pleasure. <br /> <br /> Continue to the movie: I can take Mark Wahlberg with me or leave, but he is fine as a leading man and the film does not challenge him to do something he can not do well. He's the weakest "lead actor" in the movie, but that's because the rest of the side cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron are all solid and fat free. Norton seems to be mainly involved (rumor that he did not really want to star in the movie), but he is still a natural at half potency. My only criticism of casting and acting is the character "Wrench," who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His role seems to be involved in the film, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (though one can blame for the character's role and the character's "late walk"). If I were a cynical guy, I would wonder who the actor slept with to be included in such an extra role in this film. Well, never happens ... <br /> <br /> Production values, camera work, stunts, plots ... everything is cooking pretty well and Gray and his production crew pull things together quite seamlessly (with the exception of the "wrenches", see above) ). <br /> <br /> The dialogue has a nice, light touch that rewards your enjoyment, and there are several satisfying main and subplots that arise along the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he just lost the element of surprise ...) Wahlberg goes to the cold cock Norton with a right cross and asks him, "Were you surprised?") Hmmm, maybe you had to be there .. .) <br /> <br /> Of course, the film needs some level of "disbelief suspension" to work, but if you just relax and get involved (and do not think too much about it, if you want to crack a safe underwater or the likelihood of someone successfully hacking and manipulating LA traffic with a laptop, you have a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job": It's easier summer fluff, but it's very good for that's what it is and it's not trying to be anything else, it's not good enough for an "8", but I would give it a "7.5".
