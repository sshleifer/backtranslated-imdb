Andreas arrives at a strange, inhumane place where everything seems perfect. He has done a good job, everyone is nice to him and everyone and he does not bother to find a nice friend. But in this city without a name, Andreas soon finds that a perfect advertising world is really not a paradise. Truly one of the better movies I've seen this year. The attractive storyline is perfectly supported by an intelligent orientation in which each component (cool unsaturated photography, cold symmetric design, unobtrusive action, slow, highly controlled camera movements) helps to create a unique comic atmosphere that captures the audience until the very end in suspension. A sarcastic, ironic, bitter comedy that made me laugh, as only the best films can. Probably nothing new in the analysis of modern de-humanizer civilization, but really a smart work with great surprising ideas that are hardly forgotten by who was lucky enough to see them. Just great the great scene in the subway.
