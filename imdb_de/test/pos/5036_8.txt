This is one of my favorite comedies "Capra-esque". This film should only be enjoyed, not deconstructed, analyzed microscopically. It is not a religious comment. It is fun. It is fantasy. The surprisingly negative comments (IMHO) reflect the expectation that professional film critics have led to the belief that every film has to be a part. <br /> <br /> Others have described Travolta's role (which is why you watch the movie again and again) and the excellent side cast (including Sparky!). <br /> <br /> Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; Sometimes a movie is just fun. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
