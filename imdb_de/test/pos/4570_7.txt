This caught on recently after he had noticed the name James Earl Jones in the title. It was better than I expected. Of course it's pretty old - made in the early / mid 70's, but it's actually a decent drama. It takes about 90 minutes and shows good performances by James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll. The plot is generally conventional, but through the perspective of a single black woman who has 6 children and tries to deal with all the problems that concern the well-being. This gives an interesting point of view ... also in the fact that the script was not too sentimental or overdramatized - it's almost like looking at a piece of the past. All 70s models are available in abundance. The end is a bit crazy, but without the theater it would probably have worked better.
