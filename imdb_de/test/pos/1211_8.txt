In the 1980s, the world of wrestling was easy. Hulk Hogan picked up Roddy Piper or Bobby Heenan's sidekicks or Ted DiBiase and won more often than victorious. He occasionally got an ally like Randy Savage in 1988, but mostly it was just Hulk Hogan against Bobby Heenan, and so it was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> But that night was about to change, a new master, a man the WWE believed was the 90s man, was crowned. It did not work. But WWE was right about one thing: Hulkamania was ready and a new order had to be established. <br /> <br /> This historic Wrestlemania, the first outside of America, was defeated with Rick Martel defeating Koko B Ware. Koko never had much luck at Wrestlemania and was knocked out in no time. <br /> <br /> Next, the two, Andre the Giant and Haku, entered their tag team titles against Demolition Ax and Smash and lost. New day team champions crowned. <br /> <br /> In the next game, the earthquake defeated Hercules. Hercules was another guy who was not really lucky in Wrestlemania. Good luck for Brutus Beefcake when he finished the unbeaten run of Mr. Perfect. Well, I think someone had to finish it. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown fought for a double counter in a slow but entertaining match. Next, the Hart Foundation defeated Nikolai Volkov and Boris Zhukov in 19 years seconds. Unfortunately not really a match. The barbarian then defeated Tito Santana in a short game. <br /> <br /> American dream Dusty Rhodes and sapphires defeated macho king Randy Savage and Queen Sherri in a chaotic mixed tag match. This was the only female wrestling that really took place in WWE at the time. Next was an entertaining game as rockers Marty Janetty and Shawn Micheals defeated the Orient Express in a fast-paced encounter. At this time, there were many good tag teams. Jim Duggan then defeated Dino Bravo in a non-combat. <br /> <br /> Next, Ted DiBiase put its most treasured possession, the Million Dollar Championship, against Jake Roberts on the line. Roberts was distracted by Virgil and scored, which allowed Ted to maintain his title in a fun match and one of the longer matches on the show. Next, the Twin Towers collide when the Big Bossman briefly defeats Akeem. To achieve this, Rick Rude won a short game with Jimmy Snuka. <br /> <br /> Finally we come to the main event with Hulk Hogan putting the WWE title against Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior on the line. This is an entertaining back-and-forth game the warrior won after Hogan missed a leg throw. The crowd was exceptional and the match was a great spectacle. <br /> <br /> So the torch was over, but would the Ultimate Warrior prove to be the champion the WWE hoped would be him?
