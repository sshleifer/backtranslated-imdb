I wanted to see this movie because I'm a big fan of Abbott and Costello, and I liked it when I saw it. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, not hysterical, but funny. I mean, I laughed at many of the funny parts and it was just fun. <br /> <br /> Although it's not the best of the Perfect Straight Man and the Perfect Buffoon, you should really see this I love Abbott and Costello. <br /> <br /> Of all the Abbott and Costello films I've seen, I can not say I saw one I hated. That's decent, funny and entertaining. At least Abbott and Costello made pretty good films in their later years. <br /> <br /> All in all I liked this movie, it's not one of the best, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
