All the characters in this cartoon were funny. Norman, the Viking guard, had some memorable expressions, and the skull-man, the villain, always vowed to kill Max with a mad laugh. Writing is the best. <br /> <br /> I stuck to the set when this would happen when I was younger. If they released a DVD of all the episodes they produced, I would be forced to buy them. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most underrated of all the big cartoons. I saw these cartoons on Channel 13 in the Los Angeles area. <br /> <br /> I remember that the owl was always scared and Max warned that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one. Max did not think he was the chosen one and always gave the owl trouble. Norman was less talkative, but his simplicity was funny. He said things like "I eat monster for breakfast" when he fought with them. And then, when he fought zombies, he said, "I eat zombies for ... forever." Classic Comic Comedy and Action. <br /> <br /> I agree to send Mighty Max again.
