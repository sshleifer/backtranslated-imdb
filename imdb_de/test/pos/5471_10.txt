I'm from Texas and my family went on holiday a few years ago with my brother in Sante Fe. He suggested visiting the church by the stairs. I was really excited about the miracles that took place there. The movie is great - Barbara Hershey and William Petersen were perfect for the parts they played. It is incredible, absolutely incredible. If you have not personally seen the stairs, it is worth to see them. The wood is beautiful and the architecture is amazing. Being alone in the chapel gives me goose bumps! Reading the history of the chapel and seeing its beauty is breathtaking. Watch the movie - it's great! Then you will see the stairs in person!
