I saw this movie three times. Back to video recorders in the '80s and last night (February 11, 2010) again on the Encor channel. Based on a true story that I remember being in the news in the early 1980s, I decided it would be annoying to keep looking at it. Nevertheless, it is difficult to look away from a car accident. The scariest character is Joshua John Miller, who plays the little brother of Keeanu Reeves. <br /> <br /> (The story this film is based on can be found anywhere on the web - just on Google, it's Anthony Jacques Broussard, who murdered Marcy Conrad in 1981 in Milpitas, California.) The Characters are portrayed Generation X pre-grunge borderline sociopaths, with the exception of Keeanu Reeves, who gains a conscience. Old hippies did a great job promoting this generation. <br /> <br /> For such a boy, I thought Joshua Miller was excellent as a serial killer in the maker's figure. In fact, he went to Yale and wrote screenplays and directing. His acting skills in this film were amazing. Just as he treats his little sister by drowning her doll and tearing her doll's grave, it shook me. It gave me nightmares. Despite today's events in our world in 2010, it is still the most degenerate film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The apathy and dysfunction of these families is enough to puke. This thrilling kill makes the Manson killers almost pale in comparison. <br /> <br /> Crispon Glover has gotten a bit too much character. He came to David Lettermen to discuss his role and almost kicked the host in the head. Glover, after portraying his character, had to seek psychiatric help. <br /> <br /> Also fight the good fight for the great Dennis Hopper. You are one of the best!
