1904. The North African nation of Morocco is bound by tenacious independence as the various European powers - France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Spain and now the United States - argue for influence in the region. The sultan (Marc Zuber) is a weak puppet. His uncle, the Bashaw (Vladek Sheybal), manipulated by the French and Germans, is the real power behind the throne. Berber Chieftan Raisuli (Sean Connery), the leader of the Rif tribe and "the last of the Barbary Pirates", who abducts an American missionary, Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), and their two children and takes them hostage. Back in the US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) threatens because of the problem: "Pedecaris Alive or Raisuli Dead!" - Seeing the theme as the perfect way to practice his "Big Stick" diplomacy, though Secretary of State John Hay (John Huston) is not so confident. The Raisuli, however, have less scary plans for the Pedecarises, who are more than capable of dealing with themselves in any case. <br /> <br /> John Milius' great historical film, loosely based on a true story (ie Pedecaris was a middle-aged man) is a wonderful escapism. It has some amazing action scenes, a witty, well-written script, a good cast that is amusing with the material, and does not exaggerate the greeting like "Pirates of the Caribbean" or "Lord of the Rings" movies. It's not really an epic movie in the strict sense, but it's one of the best action-action movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Although the historical context is shaky, the plot is interesting, as some critics say. So it's even more important today than it was made. President Roosevelt says, "America is like a grizzly bear" - fierce, strong, but sometimes a bit blind and ruthless. At the time of filming, America had just emerged as a superpower on the world stage after his overwhelming victory in the Spanish-American War - and Roosevelt uses this incident to prove America's value. It did not work that way in real life, but it works well allegorically. The script of Milius is written from a right-wing perspective and judges America and its place in the world pretty well. He admires Roosevelt and his method of "big-stick" diplomacy and rightly acknowledges (in Roosevelt's words) that while America may be feared and respected, it is never truly "loved" by the world, no matter what do . And there are some scenes - like Roosevelt's aim to shoot at European leaders, and the almost comic surprise attack of Marines on the Bashaw's palace - that show the ruthless and violent side of America, while others - the Clashdown with the Germans - their heroism demonstrate. <The film's historical / political context, of course, is nothing more than meat on the bones of an essentially rousing action / adventure movie. There are some brilliant action scenes, such as Raisuli's rescue of the pedecaris from double-crossed tribesmen, which offers some of the best sword fights of any movie. The opening entrance of the Raisuli and the aforementioned march and the attack of the US Marines are brilliant bravura standards. And the final battle, which combines elements from "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Wild Bunch", while a great historical fantasy (a threesome between Germans, Americans and the Rifs) is a great staging of adrenaline sequence. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast offers wonderful performances. Everyone seems to have a fun time with the movie, and that shows. As a Berber with a Scottish accent, Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing, but manages to evoke his interesting, well-drawn and chivalrous character, to respect his hostage and abhor modern, civil-society warfare. Candice Bergen, an actress I've never loved so much, performs excellently as the spirited Eden Pedecaris, who is as tough as her kidnapper. Brian Keith is an incredibly compelling TR - you really have the feeling that he must have been like that, an athletic, bubbly, but practical and intelligent man with an admirable self-confidence. The scenes of Roosevelt boxing and target shooting during the debate on foreign affairs are some of the biggest "ass-feelings" in film history - and who can spoil lines like "Why the beauty of the thing with legality?" To forget. John Huston offers solid support as the tired, cautious Hay serves as the perfect foil for the much bolder Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> Among the outstanding supporting cast members are Geoffrey Lewis as Samuel Gummere, the cynical ambassador caught in the midst of political intrigue, and Steve Kanaly as the Gung-ho Marine captain cheering for and leading "military intervention!" as a dull and easy solution to the entire complex situation. Other well known faces like Vladek Sheybal, Nadim Sawalha, Roy Jenson, Larry Cross, Marc Zuber and Darrell Fetty are also doing good work, no matter how small their role. Fans of Spaghetti Western will recognize Antoine Saint-John ("A handful of dynamite") as the German general and Aldo Sambrell as one of Raisuli's tribesmen. <br /> <br /> "The wind and the lion" is omnipresent. a wonderfully made adventure movie. It has something to offer everyone: wonderful weapon and swordplay, lots of humor, a tough, lively heroine (and her two sweet children), a beautiful (if not consumed) romance, and an interesting (albeit imaginative) political / historical one Context. It is not a masterpiece, but it was not trying to be. I give "The Wind and the Lion" a rousing nine stars and my highest recommendation.
