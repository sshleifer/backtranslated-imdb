I have seen King of Queens from the beginning and feel it is overlooked in the awards. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk a lot about the work because I work in a company like IPS (DHL) and we love the Teamster plugs !! Carrie is my heroine, she's the best, she just puts it out, no matter what the topic is. Arthur, what can you say? He just tears you up and really gets things going. Doug, well, he's just so adorable and funny, the three characters and all the friends complete the show. This is the best comedy on TV !! I would say up there with Seinfeld, and hey, there's nothing wrong with that ... Excellente !! as Doug would say.
