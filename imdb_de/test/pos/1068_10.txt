From the perspective of the hectic, contemporary world in which we live, the so-called "good old days" are seeming ever so relaxed and innocent. An idyllic era of which we have only memories and shadows left hanging on the canvas, such as Christmas In Connecticut, a warm and loveable film by Peter Godfrey. Barbara Stanwyck plays the lead role as Elizabeth Lane, a popular Martha Stewart columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe at the heart of the story. One of her biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, the publisher of the magazine she writes for. Yardley never visited her farm, and in response to an idea he formulated in a letter from Nurse Mary (Joyce Compton), he decides to spend an old-fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband, her child and as a special guest, a certain Mr. Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor who had just recovered after spending fifteen days on a raft at sea after his ship was torpedoed. Of course, Elizabeth can not refuse her boss, but there are problems. Not least because she has no farm and writes her column conveniently from a high-rise in the city. This poses a precarious situation for both her and her editor Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), because Mr. Yardley demands absolute honesty from his staff. What follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that takes the audience back to a seemingly easier time and place to share a Christmas time with a warm fireplace, good food and friendliness. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck sparkles like Elizabeth, with a smile and a presence warmer than anything the grandest stove could offer, and absolutely convincing as a city girl who comes completely out of her element on the farm , Morgan is also doing well as the somewhat na√Øve sailor whose confidence in his fellow man is admirable. Despite the deceptions that are played around him, he's the type you know he'll somehow land on his feet, and in the end, it's Elizabeth you really feel like. However, one of the true delights of this film is Sidney Greenstreet. His Yardley has a rough exterior, but you undoubtedly know that this is a man with a heart as big as Texas. It's an uncomplicated, honest presentation and it's a pleasure to watch him at work. The most memorable scenes of the film belong to him. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), grandiose Una O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge) Crothers). A felicitous movie that performs well during the Christmas season (though it would work anytime of the year), "Christmas In Connecticut" is a memorable movie that never takes itself too seriously, is uplifting and makes a good impression on you Your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world a good place. It is a true classic that you do not want to miss. I rate this as 10/10. <br /> <br />
