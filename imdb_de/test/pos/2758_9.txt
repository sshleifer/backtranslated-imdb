The pro skater 2x by Tony Hawk is no different from the previous games (except Tony Hawk 3). The only thing new in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is the new range of levels and optimized graphics. The pro skater 2x by Tony Hawk offers a new career mode, and that's the double career. The two-time career is basically Tony Hawk's 1 career as there are only about five challenges per level. If you've missed Tony Hawk 1 and 2, I suggest you buy 2x Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x, but if you've played the first two games, you should try this one anyway. Overall, there is nothing new, but it's still fun to go through the game. Hopefully this test will benefit from your needs. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10 All in all, the clean image is not really one of the key features of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x. The atmosphere of Tony Hawk 1 and 2 has changed a lot and the character models look a little better. If you look back at the old PS1 from Tony Hawk, remember that these old graphics are ugly. In Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x the graphics are MUCH better rendered. The character models are no longer filled with Jaggy's, the textures are smoother, but not as far as possible. The graphics of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is not comparable to the graphics of Tony Hawk 3, but Activision probably did not want to give Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x extraordinary graphics. Overall, the graphics earned an average score of 7, since not the full power of the Xbox is used here. The graphics are nice and clean, that's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Sound: 8 out of 10 The sound effects do not give you much imagination, but the skateboards that pop up from the ground sound great. The main reason I rated the sound factor was that you're under no obligation to listen to the below-average Tony Hawk soundtrack, as there is a custom soundtrack feature. The sound effects sound much better than the sounds in Tony Hawk 1 and 2, mainly because they are clearer and only that everything sounds good. One of the main reasons I bought this game is the custom soundtrack. The grind sound effects still sound the same as in the first two games, just a little bit sophisticated. One of the main problems of the sound factor is the fact that the song you just listened to will NOT return to the next song when the song is over. I do not like the soundtrack in the game, but like I said, you're not obligated to listen to it. <br /> <br /> Controls: 10 out of 10 The controls are the best part of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x. The controls are surprisingly comfortable and take some getting used to. On Playstation days, people thought the controls were the best they ever had, but 2x seems to have done a better job with the Xbox Dashboard. Surprisingly, it is very easy to do tricks with the joystick. Activision has done a great job with the controls of Pro Skater 2x by Tony Hawk. They made the Xbox controller the best for Tony Hawk games. You will not be disappointed with the control style, and that's a guarantee. <br /> <br /> Gameplay: 10 out of 10 Apart from the fact that the pro skater 2x by Tony Hawk is basically Tony Hawk 1 and 2. The game is still a lot of fun. The game factor has changed a bit. This time you get a lot more air than in the first two games and it's much easier to do tricks. In Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x, each character has three career modes, consisting of Tony Hawk's 1 career, Tony Hawk's 2 career and 2x career. Tony Hawk 1 career is pretty easy, because in the first game you get NOTHING for air. The career of Tony Hawk 2 offers the same difficulty as the Playstation version. The only difficulty for the 2x career is figuring out where all the items are, but after that 2x career is not difficult at all. There are three levels in the 2x career, and the first two levels consist of finding the secret bands, collecting S-K-A-T-E, and completing other tasks required for that particular level. The third of the three levels is the level of competition where you have to get a certain number of points to get the gold. The first two levels contain the secret cassettes and the collection of the letters S-K-A-T-E in both. Overall, the pro skater 2x by Tony Hawk still retains the old pro skater atmosphere of Tony Hawk. <br /> <br /> Story: - <br /> <br /> Fun factor: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is by far the funniest game on Xbox. I played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2, and I did not like them then, but for some reason, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is really fun. There really is not much to say except that Tony Hawk Pro Skater is by far the best 2x game on Xbox today. One problem is, if you've already gone through the game once, you will play it a few more times, but it will repeat itself. <br /> <br /> Repeat Score: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x delivers a high replay value. There are many cheats that need to be unlocked, and many character videos. Overall, the Pro Skate 2x by Tony Hawk offers a lot of repeatability, especially because it's so much fun. <br /> <br /> Best Feature: You are not required to listen to the crappy soundtrack in the game. Worst Feature: The custom soundtrack is a bit confused. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Many people have complained in the past that they did not like Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x, because there is nothing new, but they should stop complaining because they charge for 50.00 USD get a lot of game. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 of 10. Sound: 8 of 10. Control: 10 of 10. Game: 10 of 10. Story: N / A Fun Factor: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 9 out of 10.
