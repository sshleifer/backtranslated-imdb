I caught this movie on local TV. At 4:30 I had no expectations, but after the opening credits, I knew I was up to something good. <br /> <br /> There are situations that are left to your interpretation to "figure out," so your attention is a crucial factor. <br /> <br /> The whole psychological thriller situation has a lot to do with character development and the way things are done by the main character. <br /> <br /> Your subconsciousness also plays an important role, as you can interpret and get an opinion through a series of events and dialogues. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are very good. Really good indeed. Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and she is a feast for the eyes, though she is in her white clothes most of the time. The fear factor is almost nonexistent, but there are many secrets and tensions to dig from. I would recommend it to those who like supernatural and psychological thrillers.
