Sam Lion (Jean Paul Belmondo) discovers that he has to take a break because everyone around him relies too much on him to stage his own death. When he discovers that he has loved and is still in need, he is supported by Albert Duvivier (Richard Anconina). In search of his own past, according to his own wishes, this fabulous film by Claude Lelouch is the search of a mature man. <br /> <br /> Built like all Lelouch movies, the movie can start with constant flashbacks Be confusing, especially in scenes where Paul Belmondo (who looks very much like his father) plays a young Sam Lion while Sam Lion is in the same room - a Flashback sequence that takes a second to complete. <br /> <br /> One of the most artistic works of Lelouch, the children's door L'itineraire d'un is a must for self-realization.
