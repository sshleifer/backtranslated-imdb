Not much, but a confirmation of the values ​​of the small town and the embrace of a mentally handicapped young man in his heart. I read some of the reviews and was surprised at the hostility he caused. I felt that Cuba Gooding acted the role with dignity and respect, as opposed to Sean Penn's drooling idiots in "I am Sam". Sport is being taken seriously in American high school in the small town (and elsewhere, I suppose), and I felt those competitive students open their hearts to a less fortunate person, at least to me. <br /> <br /> The Trainer was never forced to choose between his daughter and the radio, but came gently to the decision under the loving and open ways of the radio. Very well done to all. <br /> <br /> Debra Winger, we need more of you in pictures!
