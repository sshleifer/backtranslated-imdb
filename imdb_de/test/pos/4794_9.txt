Luis Bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was indistinct to me. My first experience with him was The Discrete Charm of Bourgeoisie, which was often considered his greatest work, which made me so frustrated and bored that I finally shut down the band. Belle de Jour, who is certainly his best-known film and generally considered to be one of his many masterpieces, did not interest me at all. I did not hate it as if I was discreet, but I did not like it. Third, I saw L'Age d'Or. Finally I had come somewhere. Fourth, Los Olvidados, too good. Neither L'Age d'Or nor Los Olvidados blew me away. Great movies, but no masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel and I just like it a bit more than these two others. It is about a priest from Spain who now refuses to live in the luxury in which most priests live in Mexico. He wants to be more like Jesus and lead a life as gentle as possible. He is also willing to forgive everyone for everything and to suffer without protest. I'm pretty sure Bunuel does not sympathize with the character and consider him quite self-righteous. However, I'm only assuming that, based on my knowledge of the director, whose most famous quote is "Thank God, I'm still an atheist", which he apparently said in an interview about this movie (I get that information from John Baxter book on Bunuel, if you are interested). The interviewer who took these words out of Bunuel's mouth must have been confused even about Nazarine. One who believed more in religious beliefs, and who knows nothing of Bunuel, might regard the priest as a heroic figure. This is especially true when the viewer criticizes his criticism of organized religion. The priest may be self-righteous, but he seems to be basically a good man. If he harbors a violent prostitute in his room to protect her (and presumably to save her soul), people start to find out that their relationship is sexual. His superiors assume and punish him for it. Later, he is even worse punished by clerics.
