Talk about your classics! Ernie Fossilus (the Foss from here) has released a cute and creative trailer that totally spoofs Star Wars. This gem is so packed with tributes and gags that I laugh every time! Not only that, but when Star Wars did a remake with new special effects, Hardware Wars did the same! Talk about a parody that just will not die! There is a reason why George Lucas calls this his favorite parody. He was so impressed that he even hired the Foss to work on "Return of the Jedi" (Do not believe me, check his entry in IMDb!) <br /> <br /> This must be first and in my opinion after the best parody ever made. I think the Special Edition was a little over the top, but thinking this, I think it's PERFECT for the new release of Star Wars and proves that sometimes it's wrong to compete with perfection. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's well worth your time. <br /> <br /> They'll laugh, they'll cry, they'll kiss $ 3 goodbye! Maybe 15 for the DVD, but you will be really happy.
