For years, I remember a song "JUST A PAUPLE IN A CASTLE" ("Number 20 Moonbeam, just a couple in the Castle of the Air"). I could not find the song, but I remembered that it had to do with cartoon mistakes. I found a reference to the movie on the web. I had seen the movie when I was only nine years old, in the theater of Ligonier PA. I was pleased to learn that Kenny Gardner, the singer of Guy Lombaro (I'm a Lombardo fan). And then to see that it was produced by Fleisher Bros., who made another very good cartoon movie of "Gullivar's Travels" (also in good memory). The songs have also been associated with Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, who are among the best. No wonder I remembered the movie, the song and the colorful animation. A full-length musical, this is a movie that should be remembered as one of the finest of the early full-length musicals. Well, as I remember, the storyline may not have been earth-shaking, but has been well presented and makes it easy to watch a delightful movie.
