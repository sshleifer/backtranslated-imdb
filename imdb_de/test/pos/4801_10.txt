Octavio Paz, a Mexican poet, writer and diplomat who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, said to Nazarin: "Nazarin follows the great tradition of the crazy Spaniards that was founded by Cervantes, his madness is to take serious ideas and to live accordingly ". A modest and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a wonderful performance) tries to live by the principles of Christianity, but is expelled from his church for helping a local prostitute by sheltering her after committing a murder would have. Nazarin roams the country roads of the turn of Mexico in the 20th century, offering help to the poor and begging for food. His two followers, the murderous prostitute Andara, and her sister Beatriz, who is a desperate love murder and desperately seeking love, consider him a saint, but they do not hinder him in hating and humiliating both the church and the people he travels encountered. He is beaten in prison and begins to question his beliefs because he can not forgive his attacker. <br /> <br /> Bunuel tells the story in a sort of Christian parable that masterfully and uniquely combines admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and profound as well as beautiful, ironic and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> I consider Bunuel to be one of the best filmmakers of all time. I have seen twenty of his films and they all belong to the different phases of his life, but they have his magical touch, the masterful combination of bitter realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his curious mind, his sense of humor and his sense in common, his dark and luminous fantasies. With great pleasure I add to the list of my favorite films little-seen and almost unknown, but surprisingly open and touching surrealist tragicomedy "Nazarin".
