The title suggests that this film is a sequel to "An American Werewolf in London." None of the characters in the previous film returns and is not even mentioned by name in this movie. So if a sequel, AAwiP, fails, one would say. <br /> <br /> I dare say the opposite. <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a charming, effective horror movie. It's one of the better werewolf films I've seen in a long time. And I've seen a lot, like An American Werewolf in London, The Howling, Wolfen, The Wolfman and the Underworld Trilogy. <br /> <br /> The story tells of three Americans who visited Paris on vacation. On the Eiffel Tower, one of them rescues a woman trying to commit suicide. What begins as a romantic relationship is slowly becoming a nightmare when the dark secrets lurking in the city are revealed. <br /> <br /> I really liked the acting in this movie. Especially the two stars of the film: the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her. They have a good chemistry together. But the other two Americans play their roles well. I really did not find anything annoying about acting, so thumbs up for that! <br /> <br /> The effects on the werewolves are nice. It does not look too cheap or spurious for me. Of course, opinions are shared on the subject. But let's just say that I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of humor in this movie. There are some really funny scenes that you will probably remember for a long time. <br /> <br /> To sum it up: An American werewolf in Paris may not be a direct successor to his predecessor, but he still makes fun of film. Perfect for fans of werewolves! 7 out of 10 stars!
