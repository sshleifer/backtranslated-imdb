Bonny Hunt makes a coup with her directorial debut. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have the indescribable something called chemistry. Surely the plot is unlikely, but that does not stop you from enjoying this movie. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other great character actors play his cardmates. Jim Belushi is hilarious as a down to earth husband of Megan, part of the extended family. Faith, family and marriage are respected. A few sexual cues and salty words are used, but in context and with gentle humor. <br /> <br /> And in the background the wonderful Dean Martin Martin - "Return to Me" Recommended.
