Excellent and moving story from the end of a singularly intimate affair. The sense of the film to formulate another comment is again that any relationship can be unique and intimate. A really high-quality short film that caught me at my busiest and still had the power to pull me on the sofa and to look fixedly and quietly for the duration. Bobby and Tessa are moving characters, and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this movie a cathartic exercise. In addition, the idea of ​​"film in a movie" with this cast plays a very good role and is quite exciting, if somewhat melancholic.
