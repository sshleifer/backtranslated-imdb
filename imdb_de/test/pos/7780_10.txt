Love Jones portrays young African American men and women in a smart, positive and realistic manner. I think all the actors and actresses were great and did a really good job of catching the mood. Nia Long and Larenz Tate have worked well together and I hope they will work more. In fact, all actors / actresses have done such a good job that it would be great to see another romantic comedy of them. This movie can be compared to most well-written romantic comedies. If you have not seen this movie yet, I strongly suggest that it definitely give you a different perspective on life and love.
