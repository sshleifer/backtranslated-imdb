Dirty Dancing was one of the best movies of the 80s. He was a low budget movie with high budgets. With a soundtrack that invites you to get up and dance, a love story that all of us wish we could live (at least if you're a woman), this is a movie you want to see over and over again. <br /> <br /> The music that drives the movie is optimistic and blends well with the emotions drawn by the viewer. From classic hits of the '60s like "Love Man" by Otis Redding and "Big Girls Do not Cry" by Frankie Valli to the hits of the 80s like Eric Carmen's "Hungry Eyes" and Frank Zappacosta's "Overload" is Dirty Dancing a mix of fun and sensual, she shows the transformation of a young girl from a shy teenager into a blooming woman, all in front of the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that we all hope and desire, that will become more. <br /> <br /> Dancing in "Dirty Dancing" is not to be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny, a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and supple gymnasts. Patrick Swayze does more than just a fantastic job and shows more and more of his abilities, not only as an actor, but also as a dancer and singer. And Jennifer Gray shines as a baby, while her transformation in dancing also represents her transformation in status. All in all, Dirty Dancing is one of the best movies ever, and at least worth seeing once. It is doubtful that the first beats of Ronette's "Be My Baby" in the opening title will not grab your attention and lead you into a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment.
