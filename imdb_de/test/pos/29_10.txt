<br /> <br /> What more can you ask for? A great script based on one of the most beautiful pieces of the second half of the 20th century, two fine emotional performances by Courtney and Finney, a realistic wartime vision of London, a great side cast. This film takes you through humor, grief, loss and fulfillment in an emotional roller coaster ride. If you are in the theater, it is even more effective. This is a real 10 on the rating scale!
