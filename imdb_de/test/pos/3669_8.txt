Ignore the comments of everyone else on this movie and watch them (like me) on pay-cable or lend them out. You owe it to yourself. This movie is (actually) about movies. Hard to categorize (and God knows how this was called a "high concept"!), But this is one for the angels. Listen. What do you have to lose?
