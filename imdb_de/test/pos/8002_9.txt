I really wanted to equip this movie with a 10. I thought for a long time that he was my favorite of Batman's four modern live action films (and maybe it will still be like that - I still have to watch the Schumacher movies) again). I'm starting to worry if I'm somehow unconsciously contrary. You see, I've always liked the Schumacher films. As far as I can remember, they were either nine or ten to me. The common belief, however, is that the two films directed by Tim Burton are far superior. This time I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman - I ended up giving a 7 - and apologized if I could. I just could not help but feel that Batman Returns has too many little problems in terms of direction, plot and script scattered throughout to justify a 10. <br /> <br /> But Burton _almost_ trumps the problems with the sheer power of style, and though there are many small flaws, Batman Returns is still a great movie, especially if you're a Burton fan Batman Returns has as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as anything else in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off strong, with the Cobblepots having a baby. We see their consternation - people go with horror from the birth room and are ready to surrender. Later they have the baby in a small cage. Finally, they take it out for an evening stroll and throw it into the Gotham City River. The baby becomes the Batman villain The Penguin (Danny DeVito). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the movie's "evil capitalist," akin to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He plans to cheat on Gotham City in various ways, and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the shy Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plans, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is rescued by cats and becomes Catwoman. <br /> <br /> While all this is going on, The Penguin has not been around for a long time. It is only suspected that it exists and is considered dangerous. He begins with a program that is presented to the public as a good guy, though he has less than benevolent ulterior motives. <br /> <br /> Before Burton's Batman Movies Revisited This time, I did not remember how little the films about Batman (Michael Keaton) are. It's almost as if Burton did not believe that the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the bad guys, especially The Penguin. Batman does not appear very often, especially at the beginning of the movie, and surprisingly we watch him watching the penguin. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers absolutely consider the above as a mistake, I can not say that, even though I want to know more about Batman and follow his story more. The stories of the villains are also interesting, and as an "origin story" for two great Batman villains, Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of conspiracy. <br /> <br /> However, there are some character issues I count as mistakes. The penguin has a squad of circus artists making his bid, but although they are often seen on screen, we can never hear about it. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those of Tod Browning's Freaks (1932), with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just does not have the space to use them. <br /> <br /> He has little room to explore Catwoman. The film is as if Catwoman had been developed and shown in as many scenes as The Penguin, but the cut of the film would have taken four hours. So most of the Catwoman scenes had to be cut out. Of course Batman barely leaves room for it. Burton leaves Batman very dark in the film in front of the public, and he never bothers to solve it uncommonly. As far as we know, the Gothamites still think in the end that Batman is a Murder Maniac. This is an interesting development, but unfortunately it was dropped between this and the next movie. <br /> <br /> As for the script, there are minor issues, including some non-sequential and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters, it is clear that Burton and the authors Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters does not just try to tell a traditional story. Much of the dialogue is focused on puns, but often this is quite subtle and / or complex (sometimes it is also very blatant or transparent). It is helpful to view Batman Returns as a more "poetic" film, as I believe was the intention. This also affects more general action and directing decisions - many strange character actions, even of smaller characters, are made in the service of a general mood or style, and this style works very well. <br /> <br /> "Dark" is the easiest way to sum up Batman Returns in one word. Whether this is positive or negative depends on your attitude. Everyone who knows me knows that I love darkness. For me, Burton's style transgresses the mistakes in the storyline and in the script. In many ways Batman Returns looks like an insane, martial horror movie with a beautiful uncanny production design. Like Batman, Burton still makes many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there is still a slight reference to Star Wars), he calls films like Nosferatu (1922) (including the "Max Schreck" was the name of the actor who played the Dracula - like character, Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned freaks, Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory (1971) (which has a surreal, dark edge) and zombie Films - most prominently in the closing scene of The Penguin. <br /> <br /> In terms of look and general atmosphere - and this includes the general "feel" of the story, the characters, etc. - this could not be stronger 10.
