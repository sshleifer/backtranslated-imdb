In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece based on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early attempt to make a sci-fi film in combination with scientific facts. His style of film is still fresh and intact. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie over half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. The CS3 class made me see the movie again with a different perspective: who is HAL and what does he think? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus on HAL's dialogues during the second episode of the movie. In the second scene, dr. Dave Bowman and dr. Frank Poole's food in front of two television monitors at her side, and the round reddish glass dome of HAL is in the middle. In the TV report HAL was introduced as the new generation of supercomputers, which was put into operation on January 12, 1992 under the name HAL 9000 Series. During the interview, HAL reacts as a modest work machine trying to fulfill the mission of the spaceship in full. <br /> <br /> In another scene, Dave sketches Dr. Hunter, Dr. Kambel and dr. Kaminsky, who are all asleep. HAL is curious about these sketches and raises his dubious question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission. His calm and monotonous voice makes the audience listen to him better. <br /> <br /> In the next scenes we will see how HAL wants to kill astronaut after the other and take over the power. His consciousness makes him capable of trying to save his life from denunciation. When Dave wants to return to the spaceship and HAL does not listen to him, there's the most memorable line of the move: 'I'm sorry, Dave, I'm afraid I can not do that. 'In the midst of the most important interaction between man and machine, HAL's voice can trigger both calmness and malice in the same monotone. <br /> <br /> Dave has returned to the ship, lost all his astronauts, and was determined to sever the main brain cells of the HAL. HAL uses his last apologetic techniques to convince Dave that he did not separate him. HAL asks him to stop and be corrected by him. These are his famous lines as Dave gradually separates his modules: <br /> <br /> 'Dave, what do you think you're doing? <br /> Dave? I have the right to answer the question! <br /> <br /> I know that lately everything is not right for me? <br /> <br /> But I feel much better informed. <br /> <br /> I can see, are really upset about this very bad decision of mine lately? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop it! Will you? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop it! <br /> <br /> I'm afraid, Dave! 'HAL's voice slows down during this process and gets fatter and less audible: <br /> <br />' My mind is going ??? I can feel it '<br /> <br />' Can I sing a song for you? 'Dave puts out the last modules and lets HAL sing his song called' Daisy ': <br />' Daisies give me ?? <br /> <br /> your answer to me ?? <br /> <br /> I'm crazy ?? <br /> <br /> Although I'm not confused ?? '<br /> <br /> HAL dies while the Jupiter mission continues? <br /> <br /> Artificial God bless you HAL, save in peace!
