Mikhail Kalatozov's Flying the Cranes is a great movie. The Golden Palm of the Cannes Film Festival was awarded. Tatjana Samojlova, the only Russian actor ever to win a performance prize at Cannes, has an outstanding film set and performance. She plays Veronika, a teenager who is in love with her boyfriend, happy and without worries, with plans to marry. Her life will be upside down when World War II hits and her friend volunteers to join the army. The film shows the effects of the war on the love of a teenager and the people who stayed and saw their loved ones fighting and waiting for a letter or other information. It is a representation of lost innocence. Samojlova does an excellent job, and her character change will break your heart. The camera movement is fast, with many close-ups, it is a dancing camera. The first scene on the stairs is fantastic, but it's not the only one, there's a scene where Veronika tries to commit suicide, and another, in my opinion, one of the most powerful scenes in film history, the bombing of Veronica's house as she runs in the middle of the fire the stairs to find her apartment completely destroyed. Just great! 10 out of 10.
