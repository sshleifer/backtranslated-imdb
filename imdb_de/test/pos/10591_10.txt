This movie is just great. It's so funny. Although skating and other montages are played through, the comedy is great. Raab himself and Brandon Dicamillo are weird. There will be moments when you can not breathe, that you laugh so hard. There are also scenes that you can see hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.
