"Buffalo Bill, Hero of the Far West" Director Mario Costa's unappealing spaghetti western "The Beast" with Klaus Kinski could only be produced in Europe. Hollywood would never have dared to make a Western about a sexual predator as the protagonist of a movie. No matter that Kinski is ideal for the role of 'crazy' Johnny. He plays an individual completely without sympathy, who is ironically dressed from head to toe in white suit, pants and hat. This low budget eater has nothing appetizing. The typically stunning Spanish landscape around Almeria is nowhere to be seen. Instead, Costa and his cinematographer Luciano Trasatti, who shot another western-turned "And God Said to Cain" by Kinski, had this horse opera in more secular surroundings near Tor Caldara, Lazio (Italy) and Monte Gelato Falls, Treja (River ), Lazio (Italy). Nevertheless, "The Beast" is considered a continental Western, because it is completely unscrupulous characters and the action could be classified as a film noir, because the hero and the heroine are trapped by unbearable circumstances that force them to take criminal activities. Their well planned plans failed mainly because of the Kinski character. In fact, the permissive Kinski character resembles a Wily E. Coyote character. Consequently, he fights with some beautiful women to have sex, but either lawyers or outlaws frustrate his every effort. Ultimately, "The Beast" is a tragic character study filled with irony. The Stelvio Cipriani orchestral music sounds as though it were raised by Tony Anthony Western's "The Stranger Returns". The Mario Costa script plays on the western border between San Diego and Mexico, which is being terrorized by a notorious Mexican bandit called Machete (Giovanni Pallavicino of "We Still Kill the Old Way") and his gang. They loot on the stagecoach and nobody is safe from their looting. The first time we see "Crazy" Johnny Vices, he takes a break to refresh himself at a stream and sees a beautiful looking woman washing. He sneaks behind her and attacks her, but a taller man, armed with a rifle, intervenes and he has to flee. He appears in a nearby town, and a snorting sniper hires him to raid a lukewarm man, Mr. Powers, and rob him. They killed him and did not get any money. Mr. Snuff-Sniffer accidentally leaves his snuff box at the scene and the sheriff is arrested on suspicion of murder. "Crazy" shoots his accomplice out of his hotel room so he does not have to worry about getting involved in the crime. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a young couple in love has problems going into the world. Riccardo (Steven Tedd of "Requiem for a Bounty Killer") lives a Mexican couple at their ranch and helps them raise their real son Juan. In the village Riccardo's girlfriend Juanita (Gabriella Giorgelli from "Stranger in Sacramento") sings and dances in the cantina. Riccardo and Juanita want to marry, but the last place where Juanita wants to settle is a dusty ranch. She dreams of living in the city, but life in the city requires more money than Riccardo or her. They team up with the blond outlaw name Glen (Paolo Casella of "Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead") and plan to kidnap Mr. Power's daughter Nancy when she comes to her inheritance. Glen makes the fatal mistake of winning "Crazy" Johnny to help them, because Glen knows Johnny needs the money to get women. <br /> <br /> They kidnap Powers' daughter and hold her in a secluded cabin with Johnny over her as a guard. Meanwhile, Juanita masquerades as a daughter of Powers and appears in the city to get the money from Powers' lawyer Gary Pinkerton (Giuliano Raffaelli of "Blood and Black Lace"), but he gets suspicious because Juanita does not remember Nancy , Riccardo floats with his six-gun and warns Pinkerton that they have kidnapped Nancy. Unfortunately for Riccardo and Juanita, Pinkerton can only get $ 50,000 because Machete has struck everyone's fear into the hearts of all people, so that the entire heritage of the powers can not be transported by stagecoach through the territory. In the meantime, the horny Johnny tries to rape Nancy, but she outsmarted him. He knows him with a chair that looks like he needs to be alone while undressing. After knocking him unconscious, she steals a stroller and drives him back to the city. Johnny recovers, pursues and murders her at around the same time as Glen, Riccardo, Juanita and Pinkerton hit him on the trail. They inform Johnny about the complications that Machete's terrorist rule has caused, and give him $ 12,000 as a cut of the money. Pinkerton is appalled by the sight of Nancy's bloody corpse and threatens Johnny. Of course, Johnny shoots him in cold blood on the spot. <br /> <br /> Things are starting to get worse when law arrests Machete in San Diego. Glen, Riccardo and Juanita return to Mexico, while Johnny attacks two women on a ranch and barely escapes. He rides to Mexico, finds a Cantina whore and goes down on her as a bounty throws a revolver in his face. Johnny admits he knows where he can find more money when he releases him. Machete's men follow Johnny's tip and capture Juanita. The villagers join Riccardo to attack Machete, and Johnny rescues Juanita, but she dies later after a big shootout. Riccardo is left alone now. Machete and his men took revenge on his stepparents and not only killed them, but also little Juan. Everything that Riccardo and Juanita came up with has turned up in smoke to find an unfortunate ending. "Crazy" Johnny dies and can never suppress his greed. If you think of Costa's uncompromising Sagebrusher, "The Beast" is an interesting character study and exercise in Film Noir in a Western environment where everyone is punished.
