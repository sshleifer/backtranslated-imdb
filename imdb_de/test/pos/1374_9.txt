Did the other day of the creators on DVD. I saw that this was advertised in a free magazine while the family stayed at a hotel and had never heard of it. After shooting it on the beach of Balmedie, I just had to buy it. I took the kids to the dunes the whole time while I lived in Aberdeen. 1st Place I'm not a big sci-fi fan (baring Star Wars), I just wanted to see what they did to this location, so I was surprised right now. This did not turn out to be a standard sci-fi, but rather a mix of sci-fi and survival horror. <br /> <br /> Had a good storyline that was different, had big budget special effects that it was produced at Â£ 8000. The drama was better than average for a low budget movie. The way they worked the entire coast to feel like a dry desert planet was beautiful. The weapons in the movie were realistic and the creatures were cool, like a predator in Invisibe mode. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'll buy all future releases from these guys, maybe a horror for the future (Hint Hint). The extras on the DVD were very informative to give the producers a background. I would like some of the short films to be included as extras on a next DVD release. <br /> <br /> Excellent work continues
