In this offer you just have to see the annual offer of the current Westminster Kennel Club to see the parallels. Incredibly funny and captures the true essence of the competition. One can only imagine the jokes of the producers and the amazing skills of the performers. I too would have nominated this film for a Globe Award and feel like the funniest I've ever met.
