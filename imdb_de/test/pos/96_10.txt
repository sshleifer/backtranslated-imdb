I grew up in Canada and have mostly seen this short time on the CBC. I have seen it many times in many ages, and each time the reactions are the same. It's a joyous, bittersweet, beautifully animated movie that's close to your heart. I'm sure I played it somewhere on VHS tape. <br /> <br /> Any child who grows up can relate to the situation and wants it to match their favorite idols. The scene and the look on the child's face when his mother fills in Eaton's catalog and his jumping in space is priceless. I have never seen anyone who captures this carefree youthful mood in the movie as well as this little short film. <br /> <br /> Sure, I'm a fan of Montreal Habs and that makes my appreciation for him special. But in the end, it's the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey and your family's memories that tell you to be great for what you get, even if that's not exactly what you wanted. And oh yes, the animation is nice too;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 from 10
