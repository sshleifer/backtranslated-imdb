Sony Pictures Classics, I'm looking at you! Sony has the rights to Harry Records - you need to distribute the movie and you'll dramatically increase the sales of its back catalog! Anyway, this is a great study of a fascinating musician, full of unknown, full of great stories and great music. It could have taken 3 hours longer and I would have loved it even more. I saw it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, where it played to a crowded house. They turned people at the door! I have been to many Mods & Rockers festival films and I can assure you that no other movie was as good as sold out, let alone reject people. Watch it in the theater, buy the DVD and make sure that slow company [* Coughing SONY cough *] picks it up as soon as possible!
