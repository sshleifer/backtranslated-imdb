Is Thursday an original movie? Shit no, but it's fun! I just buried it on the movie channels one evening and it was a pleasing streak. I was expecting a lot, but what I got was some interesting scenes (I liked the first ones in the convenience store), some amusing stories told by the characters, and a bit of action thrown in the mix. Some good performances by young actors, Paulina Porizkova, were good, and I was particularly impressed by Aaron Eckhart (who continued to impress me in "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "Erin Brokovich"). So if you want to have 90 minutes of fun, just go and check it out.
