This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's one of those movies where I know every line, but still can watch it without losing interest. I throw this film whenever I go on vacation or do not want to go to the gym. Just seeing Nikki's beautiful body gives me the motivation I need. It's an easy-to-see movie that always makes me smile, but I know it's not going to be for everyone, but if you love movies that are beautifully shot and have comedy, romance, and an interesting storyline, like me You love it. It's full of great characters and Ben and Nikki are both great, so everyone can stare at something attractive. BELOW LINE ...... YOU MUST TRY! I saw it on Fluke TV one day and loved the fact that I had to go out to find it, which took some time and I could see it every day. MY FATHER THE HERO I LOVE YOU !!!
