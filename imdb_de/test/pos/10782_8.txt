Oliver Stone, who is always ready to shoot politically themed films, makes another one here. "Talk Radio" is loosely based on the career of Alan Berg, a presenter for radio broadcasts in Denver, who was murdered by white Suprematists. In this case, it's Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian), an outspoken talk show host in Dallas, who loves nothing more than annoying people racists and things can heat up as anyone suspects. <br /> <br /> Bogosian's performance brings a somewhat weird tone to an otherwise reputable film. I liked the scene where he came across a redneck calling. Granted, I would never call the best movie by Oliver Stone, but it's a great reference at a time when the media is getting more and more concentrated. Good performances by Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin are also helping.
