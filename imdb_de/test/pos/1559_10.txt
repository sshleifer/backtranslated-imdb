I did not expect much when I rented this movie, as many independent films these days seem a bit overrated (well, Hollywood movies too), but this movie was awesome, really great, too bad it did not reach a big one Audience, because it's just great. I really love the determination of Alice, it really makes me look at my life as a gift, and I see how privileged I am just to have an education. Besides, this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story no matter what the budget is. It's an awesome movie and everyone should see it, they'll love it and definitely learn something from it. I do not have to be Roger Ebert to know it's one of the best movies I've seen all year, and certainly one of the most honest.
