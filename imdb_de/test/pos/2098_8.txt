This movie was made by Daiei Studios, known for their Gamera films. It's about a samurai lord who was murdered by one of his own men. He asserts his throne, forcing the two children of his predecessor to flee into the forest, where they hide for ten years near a huge stone statue. During this time, the new Samurai Lord proved to be very brutal and ruthless towards the villagers and the valley. Therefore, the only hope of the good people seems to be the stone statue in which a demon god sleeps. They want the god to help them. <br /> <br /> This Samurai film shows traditional Japanese aspects such as sword fighting, geisha and worshipers. It is a great and powerful story of survival and hope in which the protagonists try to defeat pure evil. It's full of excitement, especially in those areas where children have to fight to hide while the evil warlord wants to get them. In addition, there is a beautiful film set with lush landscapes of the village and the landscape, which immediately remind you of the ancient times in Japan. <br /> <br /> As with most Samurai movies like "The Seven Samuari" and "The Last Samuarai", this movie is nothing less than pure, sometimes graphic action. There are several disturbing scenes in the movie. So it's not the casual science fiction movie. However, it is strong and powerful and conveys the message that a good-natured person can defeat any opponent, as depicted in this film. Even the young innocent girl can calm the anger of the demon god. The daimajin's scenes of the demon god trampling on his enemies and everything in his path will immediately remind you of a Godzilla or Gamera movie. All in all a powerful and serious but hopeful film. <br /> <br /> So be careful with your samurai sword. They do not want to rattle Daimajin's cages. <br /> <br /> Grade A
