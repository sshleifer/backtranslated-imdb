Most of Kieslowski's films are like a mystery to me to expand mind and soul. The characters are not very credible, are idealized, are schematic. Nevertheless, the way Kieslowski winds his way through life through its intricate interaction with others, with the universe, with chance or fate, leads to an understanding of faith and a belief in God. That at some point everything has meaning, if not for me, then certainly for someone. <br /> <br /> Trois couleurs and especially "Rouge" come closer to touch, to feel, to experience the "truth". the "meaning" as perhaps any other of his films. The only problem is that the paths of the explored "puzzles" are a bit too similar to his other films and eventually become something to be foreseen. There is still a lot of fun here. It's like a well-known wine brand - you know what to expect and deliver, sometimes with a newly found bouquet that could be caused by aging - either the wine or yourself.
