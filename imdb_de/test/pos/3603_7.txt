Just as John Madden, director, was content with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz, who played the roles of an Italian officer and a Greek villager in an honorable story: "Captain Correli's Mandolin" just miss me! Witness: A wobbly, inconsistent accent of Cage amidst terrible hyperfunction, with Cruz - better than spoiled Latino next to Johnny Depp in "Blow" - in a rerun under the guise of a Greek nurse ... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces. <br /> <br /> The story itself is exciting to tragic, and Cage has some (- redeemed - that's! -) musical abilities. Next up is an outstanding performance by Oscar Callibre's John Hurt (Cruz's father, village doctor) and Irene Papas, village elders, as well as Christian Bale (Papas' son) among the village fighters, going far in the direction of the unpleasant ones To balance performances (especially at the beginning) of Cruz and Cage. The last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses, but brushing their teeth starts early. After all, the landscape itself and photography could receive a technical award, which could be a nice distraction if needed. <br /> <br /> John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and this would be a third; I hope he gets it as his performance as the doctor makes this movie worth seeing. The true test of a supporting actor / actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the person in question, and in that case it would most likely not be ... even close. <br /> <br /> entertainment value, but for the above plus factors that raise the bar. See it if you do not. Rating = 3.5 stars (out of five).
