Although at times I was the only one in the cinema to laugh, this is the main joy I have from the beautifully shot "thirst" laugh. Although it sometimes seemed that the film had an identity crisis and did not know if it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest black humor shone at regular intervals. <br /> <br /> It helped, of course, that the standard of action of all those involved was wonderful, and that I was somewhat obsessed with the sometimes wicked leading lady who, no matter how blood-soaked and vicious she was, was incredibly elegant. <br /> <br /> I read reviews in which the movie was too long. I did not think so. In fact, the last moving and hilarious scenes (I mean, the brown shoes ...) were alternately among the best in the movie.
