Far-reaching and still impressive early talkie west of the pioneer days; Other contemporary films in the same direction are THE COVERED WAGON (1923), THE IRON HORSE (1924) and CIMARRON (1931)? None of those I've seen, though I have the latter on VHS. It was filmed simultaneously in the full screen ratio "Standard" and in an experimental widescreen process called "Grandeur", but only the former was released on the Fox DVD "Bare Bones". one can only guess what it would look like in a larger relationship, but the careful design? Not to mention the great cinematography? Even in the "standard" version, that's obvious enough. <br /> <br /> The young John Wayne is surprisingly at the top (a role that, however, did not lead to the expected fame since he was languishing.) in "B" Westerns for the best part of the next decade before John Ford with STAGECOACH [1939] came to his rescue!); he and Marguerite Churchill (from DRACULAS DAUGHTER [1936]) still make a nice couple? despite their somewhat boring nature. Supportive characters include several types of stock: Veteran Westler, comic-relief buddy (with a preference for mouth-to-mouth sounds!), Stocky and unkempt villain (played by Tyrone Power Sr.!), His two slimy cohorts (a Mexican) and a Southerner, who also fills himself as Wayne Rivales for Churchill's hand), etc. Also among the members of the Carriage Party is a shy Swede (full of optimism for the Promised Land, but constantly being crushed by his invincible mother.) and later Wayne regularly sent Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The episodic narrative dissolves into a series of alternating cornballs, lyrical and action-packed vignettes? how we see the future settlers fighting the elements, the Indians and themselves; The film, however, feels completely authentic, which smoothes out its essentially obsolete and static quality. Also, the cut is a bit choppy (especially in the second half). No wonder, because the DVD version of the film is only 108 minutes long compared to the 158-minute "Grandeur" version!
