I could not help but enjoy the whole premise of CAT IN THE BRAIN, for it dutifully states that a director is always angry because he has seen people murdered from previous films he made. Even secular activities such as microwave cooking or the operation of a faucet turn a movie into a horrible butchery in the past. Director Fulci plays himself, directs GHOSTS OF SODOM (?) And can not save his mental well-being from the constant murder. He seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses Fulci's work as a method of executing a number of innocent people and mesmerizes the director that he may be responsible. <br /> <br /> This is obviously a movie that is playfully fun with Fulcis Image as it explores the themes of how such a profession, which produces so much death and destruction, can rarely untamed, shape and shape an inheritance , The movie is pretty much a wrap-around story about continuous violence in graphics, with all the ways to kill a woman expressed in gruesome details. This has a shower murder that Hitchcock could never or did not want to direct. The cruelty of the film is a compliment to the mental state of Fulcis Fulci (.. I know) during runtime. Reality and cinematic fiction merge and Fulci can not escape. The end (the old clich√© declares, "It's just a movie") could not work better than here. Fulcis boat says perversion (excellent touch) and he sails off .. I just wish this was his last movie because that would be a perfect ending, if ever there was one. David L. Thompson is the confused psychiatrist who plans to kill his wife. Jeoffrey Kennedy is a police officer. Fulci fears that a family was murdered by the Fiend. <br /> <br /> The extreme violence in film offers many unique ways to remove a head, such as the door to a chest, a scythe, a chainsaw and a hatchet. The most brutal violence is caused by evil chainsaw activities, as a body is chopped to pieces (as a gardener's chainsaw on a log fits into a nightmarish hallucination sequence) is beheaded! The opening scene with the demolition of the puppet cat on Fulci's brain is a howler. The scenes that are put together in the movie and bring a horrified fulci with them are obvious, but I can not help but enjoy it.
