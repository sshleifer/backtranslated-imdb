This Blake Edwards movie is not sure if he wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. Anyway, the mere presence of Julie Andrews is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical espionage. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the movie. Rock Hudson looks tired, but it's more than good, like Julie's romantic interest. Authentic cars and planes from the First World War contribute to the attractiveness. Overall, the movie is very entertaining. The DVD version is a revised (by Blake Edwards) version of the original version. Supposedly, this is the only version Edwards allows. But Turner Classic Movies recently showed the full (theatrical version) version. Recommended.
