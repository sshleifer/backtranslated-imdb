This is one of those movies that looks so "outdated" that it's so much fun. You see and hear things that you would NEVER see or hear on the screen today. Some of it is good; some are too dumb for words, some bad (depending on your views on specific cultural issues.) <br /> <br /> For example, in this short (68 minutes) 1931 film, you have: <br /> <br /> The grandfather of the family presented in this story, who praised the value of patriotism and why they should speak out against criminals for the benefit of the United States (picture of it in today's films!). <br /> <br /> A district attorney (Walter Huston) almost begs for capital punishment, and the population shows that he is 100 per cent supported (once again the picture in modern films.) On the way, some violence threatens you, for example For example, when a boy was picked up a few times and literally thrown upside down in a cupboard and his father was picked up and repeatedly turned upside down into a wall. That's a tough stuff, to say the least. <br /> <br /> But the movie is full of comedies, mostly from the patriotic grandfather Charles "Chic" Sales plays magnificently. There is a lot of laughter for all who see this unique crime movie. And for gentle touches, there are the two little boys, one of whom - Dickie Moore - became a pretty famous children actor in his day. Here he is just a little boy of about five, who is understandably not a polished actor, but you can see him on the horizon. That's what he did the following year with a solid performance in "Blonde Venus," starring Marlene Dietrich. <br /> <br /> This entertaining movie is definitely an entertaining movie because of an effective mix of violence, comedy and sentimentality ... and it has a nice ending and a thought-provoking message. There was also an Oscar for Best Writing, Original Story. I am sorry to say that it is only available for cable TV as it has never been released on VHS or DVD ... and that's a shame.
