Maybe once in a generation, there will be a movie that is perfection. "The Railway Children" is for me the film - a timeless classic that was best staged. It shows everything worthwhile in humanity and achieves conquests of love and faith over cruel injustice. Every performance is a gem, though Bobbie stands out and Jenny Agutter, just like Judy Garland as Dorothy before her, makes it impossible for us to introduce anyone to the role. <br /> <br /> The world is even better This film and the kids of today would be much better for the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, like so many young men of my generation, I fell hopelessly in love with Jenny Agutter, and her influence was just as strong as I was fortunate enough to meet her a few days ago - the enchanting smile and voice like dripping honey were still there to soothe me on my knees, as they had done for many years before!
