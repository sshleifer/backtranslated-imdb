Is this a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Of course, what did you expect from a movie called "BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND"? <br /> <br /> It's a "BABES IN BIKINI" movie has no pretensions to be different. This is not "A ROOM WITH A VIEW" or "SCHINDLERS LIST". If you wanted a movie like "A room with a view", you would not see Beach Babes from Beyond. However, if you are looking for a good babes in bikini movie that has almost no action, this is the one for you. This film does what it promises and much more. It's pure teenager fun. <br /> <br /> There were many BABES in and out of bikinis. The movie was pretty funny and great to watch. These were some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen on a home video. <br /> <br /> Every high school kid should at least see a bad movie like this. This is actually one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. So I'll say it straightaway ... If you just see a "Babes in Bikini" movie, that's the case.
