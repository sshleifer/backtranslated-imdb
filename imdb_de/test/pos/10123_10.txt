Cuba Gooding, Jr. will win the Academy Award for Best Actor in 2003. And Ed Harris will win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR. What a beautiful and moving film it is, but be sure to bring a box of handkerchiefs, because if this film does not come to you, then you have ice water in your veins. <br /> <br /> It was 1976. The scene was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years old. We have a white football coach and high school teacher, Ed Harris. Then there is a black retarded, frightened, but pleasant fellow, Cuba Gooding, whose biggest possessions, including a radio, are stacked in a trolley that is also used as a bicycle in colleagues for a reason later explained in the movie. He nicknamed Cuba "Radio" and the following is an exciting, poignant and poignant exploration of the human soul. <br /> <br /> The film is a masterpiece.
