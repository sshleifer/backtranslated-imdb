The largest crowd that ever came to a wrestling event in the US took place at Wrestlemania 6. Over 93,000 people came to break Rolling Stones' indoor record, and this event did not disappoint. Probably the greatest match of all time took place when the Immortal Hulk defended his world title against the Ultimate Warrior. There are more than 12 games in total, so you get plenty of action
