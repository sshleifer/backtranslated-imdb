I've seen this movie about 50 times and it does not seem like I'm ever bored. I always look at it with my best friend and it has become a kind of tradition that we now see it almost every month. Every time we see this movie, we both become very emotional and we laugh and cry in front of the TV and sing all the songs in a loud voice. In the end we always dance. So far we know practically the whole dialogue Heart and the movie's reputation feel like we're seeing our own old friends on TV. <br /> <br /> this movie is perfect! Although I must admit that the story itself is a bit cheesy, but the characters, the dance, the music, and even the place where everything happens, lets you forget everything and you believe that such things really happen the song "all you need is love" has some kind of meaning. <br /> <br /> I'm really a normal person and not too serious with this comment from myself, but I can not wait to see you next time we'll see Dirty Dancing.
