This film has an outstanding acting by Marilia PÃªra and a stunning award by the Argentine Hector Babenco. This, in my opinion, is the best Brazilian movie ever made. The film was shot with a child from the "favelas", the Brazilian ghetos. The children were not actors and were occupied by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children arrested in the detention center. This looks a lot worse than Alcatraz. The children are constantly being raped and beaten by the policeman. Unfortunately, this is not pure fiction, in Brazil that is still the case today. A must for those who like violent movies. But take your mother out of the room, because it's a tough movie.
