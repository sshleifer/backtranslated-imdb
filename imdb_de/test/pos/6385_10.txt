I loved it. Others have revealed spoilers, but I will not. It was an unusual premise, kinda weird, but I got it completely. Camille was hard to convince. Maybe that's why some people hated it. But I think Sienna was excellent, and her acting skills enabled her to hit the part perfectly - without being mudlin or ridiculous. I do not know why she was interested in a loser like James Franco, but married anyway. I like him as an actor and also thought that he did a great job. He does not have to be ashamed. There were films with similar settings, eg. "Ghost". I just love Sienna Miller and went along with the script written situation. I feel that their great acting talent is greatly underestimated and I hope that it is more widely recognized by the public. I thought that all actors played their roles very well and hope that more people will see the movie. I highly recommend it. I was surprised that my local Block Buster store had about 10 copies available. I definitely plan to buy it.
