Not looking in the basement is actually a very smart and thoughtful exploitation film, which gets a bad reputation because of its cheap quality and its bad acting. Sure, it's not a masterpiece for everyone, but it's a very funny little B-movie with a lot to offer and even a lot of scary scenes that will stay in your head. <br /> <br /> As I said, acting could have been a lot better, but with most exploits that is so that I can not really complain. The story is smart and has some great twists that will make you guess. I thought the blood was also a lot of fun. Older Gore movies are just great because they did not have CGI back then, so they had to set everything up themselves. See this for a good time!
