"One True Thing" is a very quiet movie, which opened glowing reviews in the fall of 1998, but with a modest budget. It tells the crippled story of Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a workaholic forced to go home to look after his terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep) for her reserved father (William Hurt) to direct his academic department , These terms are only general. The strength of "One True Thing" lies in the way the actors lift their characters across Hollywood's clich√© territory. Streep is Kate, the perfect housewife whose ability to illuminate a room with her charm is obviously your opening scenes on a costume party celebrating Hurt's birthday. But Ellen has never been close to her mother, and since graduation from Harvard University, she has a certain fate - Ellen almost believes her mother is a simple airhead. On the other hand, she admires her father, who has a special passion: writing. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York company and is almost heartbroken when her latest piece of Hurt is demolished, which seems to be a very lonely character. <br /> <br /> To get to the point when Kate gets sick Ellen's prospects change and she moves closer to her mother and to her father. Hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most, and Ellen thinks he's having an affair. Meanwhile, she has given up her desk at work to spend her crafting activities with her mother's "cult" group "The Minnies," and she has also learned that her mother is not as weak as she first thought. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much, "One True Thing" is a masterpiece in character research. Streep is again showing a nice performance, this time on a subtle level that starts slowly, but ends with a brilliant speech about the vows. For her performance Streep received her eleventh Oscar nomination. Hurt is also convincing as a father who has a secret that is revealed only in the final moments. But it is Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. Forget "Chicago," "Cold Mountain," "Bridget Jones's Diary," or whatever you've seen and hire this movie. She is remarkable in it. Zellweger works in the bitter resentment of her character, because he understands her parents, and thus creates a realistic representation of a young woman struggling to keep her lips while she screams inside.
