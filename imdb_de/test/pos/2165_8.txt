Although this is a good, funny cartoon, they later did much better, like Carrotblanca. This is almost like the first Star Trek feature that would have been welcomed with open arms and joy in any case. This is really a rag rug of old pieces with some nice details, but nothing special. Reminds me a little of the hunting trilogy in spots and the end is priceless. Available and definitely worth a look, just for the novelty and the good parts. Recommended.
