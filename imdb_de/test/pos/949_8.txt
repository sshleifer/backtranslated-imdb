"Tumbling Doll of Flesh" by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three types of thugs who sexually abuse, torture and dismember a young woman while filming her terrible actions. Typically twisted Japanese porn diseases that offer much sadistic sexual violence and gruesome gore No plot to talk about, just lots of sex scenes in the hard core (optically censored again) and lots of blood. The special effects are quite impressive - the fragmentation of the Japanese porn actress shows in unyielding details. The tongue cut scene really made me wind up. Her arm is also choppy and her stomach is cut open graphically, and finally one of the sick has sex with her gut. "Psycho: The Snuff Reels" actually reminds me of "guinea pigs: flowers of flesh and blood", but that's not so memorable. So, if you're a fan of ultra-degenerate Japanese patients, like "All Women Are Whores" or "Raping My Virgin Slave," give them a look at one of 8.
