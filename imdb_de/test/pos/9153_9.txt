And there is nothing wrong with that! I warmly welcome the comments of Boblipton and Snow Leopard. <br /> <br /> I think it's great that this movie is available on US DVD. I've only seen it once - I convinced the Goethe-Institut here in London to show it in the Conrad Veidt season a few years ago - and long after seeing it again. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is splendid when he's engaged, as in this movie, possibly because of the twinge of having a reputed German actor A Slide. And Veidt is such a wonderful scene robber (will not he take his nose off eventually?) This is one of the first films that combine "Dr. Jekyll" with "20th Century", "Grand Hotel" or "Midnight". and 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari or The Student of Prague with The Spy in Bladk, Contraband and Casablanca. <br /> <br /> See it!
