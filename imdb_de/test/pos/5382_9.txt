Man! I remember this show with nostalgia ... I really dug Bravestarr out because he was not the conventional hero. He was more than a futuristic Texan cowboy. The man had the power of a bear, the vision of a walk and the agility of a ... I can not remember. <br /> <br /> The action sequences were great! I remember that Bravestarr always used his bazooka called SARAJUANA (translated into Spanish) when he was in big trouble. <br /> <br /> This was a high quality action cartoon. I loved the characters, the dialogues, the music and of course the opening sequence! BraveStarr! long live to him. A cult classic in my opinion and a must.
