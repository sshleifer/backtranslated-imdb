I do not care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing about this movie is that you can not expect anything else than just being entertained. This is not an intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main characters are great and work very well together. Shatner is an outstanding minority officer, as he was a former police officer himself, who was led by Russo's character to train the police in what they were meant to be "television cops." These are by far the funniest scenes. If you want to be entertained and just want to laugh, then watch this movie.
