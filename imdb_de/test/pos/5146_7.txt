My family (two 40-year-olds, an 8-year-old and my 71-year-old mother) saw this on April 29 in a preview. We all enjoyed the movie very much. The story was good, and knowing it was based on real events made her all the more enjoyable. Luke Wilson was a scream (pun) and Tim Blake Nelson. And to see Neil Flynn playing something other than "the common janitor of Scrubs" was nice. The kids in the movie did well and I'm sure they'll all appeal to a certain population group at the level of the heartbreakers. The visuals were simply adorable and the Jimmy Buffet music added the "Florida feel". OK, maybe the story was a bit too neat and well packaged for some adults, but who cares? I can not compare it to the book, I honestly did not hear it until the movie came out. <br /> <br /> It was just a nice movie and had good news. Plain and simple.
