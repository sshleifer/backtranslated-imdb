It's 1913. A studio prop boy spies on the actress who is to become Hollywood's next big movie star, and he's the director that will make it possible. After inventing cake-throwing and the Keystone cops, his dream comes true. He is completely involved in his filmmaking and does not realize that he loses his lead actress to another man. Several overbudget flops later, he is considered nothing more than the director who has rejected Rin-Tin-Tin. Fortunately for him, the faithful and compassionate residents of Hollywood are untouched by ambition and ego. As long as he has friends, he will be fine. <br /> <br /> This film begins as a time-licking comedy of a kind, and in the opening scenes he asserts himself with the best of them. It has a playful lack of self-esteem that is painfully lacking in most of today's comedies. Shortly after the film begins, however, he avoids this kind of comedy and instead tries to entertain us with the films within the film. These are silent slapstick comedies, well done but nothing out of the ordinary, and take much longer than is necessary for any audience that has seen the originals. After the return, the film makes a dramatic turn. It's well written and the cast does a great job at the transition, but the movie should have decided from the beginning what it should be. At the end of the movie, the movie has morphed once again - this time in a couple to the glitz of Hollywood. The small town of Los Angeles has grown into a city where films are made that entertain the whole world. Despite its promising beginnings, this film has not aged very well. Nevertheless, there are some strong scenes, a certain nostalgic appeal and a fun subtext about the people who did it and the audience it was made for.
