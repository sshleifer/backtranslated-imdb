I have seen this funny little Brit Flick many times. The only problem is that it is currently not available on video or DVD. It's certainly a contender for a DVD release. The much-missed Richard Jordan plays "Pinky", an ex-patsman who has just been released from prison. He finds a job as an electrician in a bank. Things are going well, until he and his ex are in a bank robbery Buddy, David Niven plays the mastermind Ivan, it's a funny little bump, hopefully studio channel or anchor bay, will come to the rescue. Watch out for John Rhys Davies before playing a major role in the lost ark "Lord Of The Rings" shogun raiders. In a small role as a lawyer.
