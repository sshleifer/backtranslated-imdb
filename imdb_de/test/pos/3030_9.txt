The last movie that gave a vivid and disturbing look at the madness was probably In Dreams. You did not see any madness in this movie, you were there. Now The Cell comes with an updated and much disconcerting account of the inside of a psychotic murderer. The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent spirit of a little boy in a coma, and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are intriguing and frightening at first. The things she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are amazingly inventive and intriguing, most of which had never before been seen in the film. <br /> <br /> The story of The Cell is not really something that's truly groundbreaking. In fact, it is basically the same as in the story of The Silence of the Lambs. They have a murderer in custody, and these people have to invade his consciousness to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between the conspiracies is that in The Silence of the Lambs you have to enter a murderer's mind to find another murderer and his current victim, while in The Cell you have the mind of a murderer, his own To find victims. Despite the unfortunately weak history, The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller. No one ever made comes close to him. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie had a good direction and was extremely well played. Vince Vaughn delivers another of his characteristically outstanding performances (he was even well-suited as Norman Bates in Psycho's wretched reissue in 1998), and even Jennifer Lopez expresses the second good performance of her career (the other being the Great Out of Sight) , Nothing can be said about the cinematography in The Cell in order to adequately appreciate it. She was imaginative and fascinating and is unique in the history of the film. The Cell is an incredibly well made movie and deserves to be recognized.
