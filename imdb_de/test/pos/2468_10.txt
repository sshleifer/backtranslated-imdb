I was just lucky that I found this movie. I used Walmart's $ 5.50 DVDs because I watch a lot of movies (and very rarely watch TV). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have family and many friends who have served in Vietnam. This movie really shows the pain I experienced in my friends when he dealt with what happened to them there. I wish more people would watch this movie - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnamese veterinarians by watching these outstanding actors portray a family damaged by this war. The story felt realistic - it's not mushy, but I felt what they were going through. I think it helped that Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez played father and son - which made their relationship more credible.
