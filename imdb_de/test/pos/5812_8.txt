This was my first glimpse of this short-lived British TV horror series, but I'd seen a few Hammer horror movies (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) that I found high enough to catch a glimpse of The first episode was a shock - not for the horror, but for the nakedness. Was this 1980 "normal" in England? If so, it showed a lot more skin than we see in North America. There were three different scenes showing naked women and their breasts, a scene in which a man put his hand on one, and another scene where a man held a woman at the head of the intercourse. Hey, I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a witch who disappeared in the 17th century returns to her old house and makes life difficult for the married man. The latter, Jon Finch as "David Winter", was not a great actor, but his wife was not bad and was really beautiful. She was Prunella Gee as "Mary". The husband rightly suspected her of having an affair, and this role plays a role in this story. Patricia Quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch "Lucinda Jessup" who comes back with a nasty attunement and has a good time tormenting the couple until everything goes awry in the end. As a man, I would say it was especially funny to see the two women with them! It starts slowly, but as soon as "Lucinda" stirs things up, it becomes very entertaining.
