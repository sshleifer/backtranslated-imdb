The BIG NEWS is that this movie is now available on DVD from http://treasureflix.com for anyone who wants to own it, as well as on video. This is good news as it is one of my favorite movies! <Br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in the 80's, and it's a compulsory holiday visit. We live in the small market town called Tewkesbury, picturesque and with its own traditions, reenactments and traditions. We are also a cozy, close community. We are now confronted with large housing estates threatening to destroy the community, and you can see why I love this movie. Above all - and above all - there are LASHINGS of snow !!!! Then there is the beautiful legend of the Christmas tree and also the Christian denouement as the entire community spits out the money to help the destitute farmer save his farm and stay in the community. The evil developers are not sent out until the money is packaged, while the entire city commits their money to protecting what they have, which is very special. I love how the entire community sends their message through the post office to Santa, which is misunderstood by the hero. He and his daughter have to travel long after the death of the wife and mother of the family. (It's a likely candidate for that) - even a sleigh ride and most exciting is that the taxi driver, whose engine is broken, mysteriously got a new one on Christmas morning, and nobody had constructed it! There's a moment when Denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. Great soft movie for everything that is really at Christmas.
