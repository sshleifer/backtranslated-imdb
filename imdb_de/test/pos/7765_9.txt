This is my favorite movie showing African Americans in a very different light. because it shows another side of the African American that it is not shown in the movies. It's not gangbang, an urban ghetto, or dealing with profound racial issues. It captivates the very essence of being young and trying to be successful and having problems if you forget your alertness and let someone into your life and the whole bohemian atmosphere gives that great touch that makes it all great. It's a great script that intrigues you and you get involved in the character. perfect casting with a lot of chemistry and very good acting and I still have not seen another movie with black characters, which is displayed in this format. the only one who comes close is "spring", but since it's a comedy, he loses it very quickly. I give this movie 9 out of 10 and I wish they would continue to make films with this kind of attitude to African Americans
