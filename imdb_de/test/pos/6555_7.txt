A girl realizes that people in her small town are fascinated by everything that is shaped like a spiral. Soon, the fascination becomes obsession and things become deadly. Although I will not say that "Uzumaki" was an excellent movie, I will say that it was different from anything I have seen before. Throughout my viewing, I felt like I saw a cartoon. Between scenes and characters, there are funny areas with digitally amplified eyes. Later, I found out that the movie is an adaptation of a manga comic, so it makes sense. Just when you think you're seeing something that could be a kiddie movie, you'll be bombarded with evil and bloody images! The story is often delayed and the ending is a bit abrupt and seemed anti-climactic at the time, but in retrospect, I appreciate it more for its originality. My rating: 7/10.
