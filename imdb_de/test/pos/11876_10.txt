Bringing Philip Larkin to life in a way that is worthy of the greatest achievement of all time, and not just those that are gaining in popularity. It shows an unmistakable depiction of Larkin's life as the greatest unrecognized poet of his time - just as he would have liked it, so was his contempt for cancer and medallions. It dramatically exposes the raw beauty in the intense sadness of Philips's observations of our relationship to our own mortality and suggests it in a way that even the great philosophers seem to have missed. For those who are interested in deep observations of our relationship to life, love and death, this is a must.
