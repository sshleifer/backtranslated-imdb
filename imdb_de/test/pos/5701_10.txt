A surprisingly good documentary. My surprise was mainly because I was confused by the title. I assumed it was about the influence of drug culture on filmmaking, but no, it's a far more far-reaching and intelligent movie than might be expected. Demme has well encapsulated time from the late '60s to the late' 70s. From "Easy Rider" and the collapse of studio influence through all those introspective "Real Life" films in which brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically, sexually, and artistically, right up to the beginning of the blockbuster and the return of the reigns the money men and their studios. As someone who had seen the "real" films of Britain and the rest of Europe in the sixties and in the revolutionary US films of the 1970s and is sad that the continuation of the sequel is so commonplace, this was one most fascinating movie. The interview clips are measured (thanks to the DVD, the full interviews are available as extras!) And the film clips well considered. As someone who has just met "Joe" I am impressed that this important little movie gets its well deserved entry here.
