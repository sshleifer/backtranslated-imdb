Batman Returns It is my opinion that Batman's first Batman series was only half the movie that Batman Returns portrays. In Tim Burton's first Batman, we only had Batman and The Joker, both wonderfully played by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. <br /> <br /> In Batman Returns we have what I think (and even better than Dark Knight) for the perfectly cast Batman movie. Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the role that is never surpassed too far with the character of Batman, who is perfect in this film when it comes to the two bad guys he is struggling with. First you have Danny DeVito, who is wonderfully crazy as a penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat-Woman, of whom I want to say that she is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the Batman movies. I feel so over Pfeiffer because she becomes the cat-woman who starts out as a pathetic mouse Selena Kyle and then really dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman that goes from that Trying to become a hero to a villain, and then I suppose I'll find another hero in the end. In this amazing cast you have the evil businessman Max Schreck, played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken. In a minor role, there is something about this role that I love, and maybe it's the look of fright in the movie that makes its performance all the better as it already is. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, Batman Returns has so much more to offer than the first Batman. One reason why I loved this story so much is that Burton dared to go in a much darker and twisted direction, unlike Nicholson's exaggerated antics. They have the story of the penguin and how he tries to fool the people of Gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her trouble deciding who she really is and what she should do with her new personality. When it comes to Batman, I feel like he's more the ringleader holding the two stories together but of course kicking his ass at the same time. <br /> <br /> In cinematography, the movie was dark and atmospheric, the story in it. Gotham City has never looked as good as Blu-Ray and HD. So, if you have the opportunity to see it this way, be sure to do so because it really improves the overall experience of Batman Returns. <br /> <br / All in all, I really feel that Batman Returns is convinced by all the Batman movies that he does not outnumber the Dark Knight for me while watching this movie for Heath Ledger's incredible performance as a Joker I had the feeling that the film was missing something. There is nothing missing in Batman Returns. So if you want to watch an amazing movie that I think is a perfect cast, then this is Batman, for which the bat signal is triggered.
