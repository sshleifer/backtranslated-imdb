For me, the best and most memorable movies are often those that I do not know at first sight. American Movie is a perfect example of such a gem. When I watched TV late in the evening, I saw the only and only good rating among the cinders - fortunately I chose a real pleasure. American Movie is a documentary that follows the memorable Mark Borchardt (pronounced "orchard," I believe), a highly articulate and charismatic Wisconson boy who seeks to write, write, and direct "MidWestern," a sinister, cheap horror movie and to produce that he has been working for years. In Mark we discover a young man full of contrasts. His looks are dominated by the classic trailer trash stereotype - thin, thick fuzzy mustache, '80s heavy metal styling, mullet hairdo, etc. In front of the camera, however, Mark reveals an amazing mind as he talks about life, Love, Movies, and Cinema Philosophize American Art As the movie evolves, it becomes sadly clear that Mark's discipline and strong drinking are relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts. American Movie is a charming watch with funny moments and lively characters. Among them is Mark's loveable buddy Mike Schank, a gentle reformed stoner who, after having become dependent on scratch cards, relies on soda pop. I absolutely loved American Movie. It creates true empathy between onlookers and protagonists, and creates serenity without feeling exploitative. I highly recommend it to everyone.
