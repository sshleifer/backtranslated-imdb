Well, what's wrong with the title "Separate Lies" (elsewhere accused of not being "exciting"). It's smart, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course, there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi movie called "Separate Lives") which are referred to here as film probes. OK, it's not a funny title "in-your-face", but then it's not an in-your-face funny movie. Please give British films a chance. They try to get people to think about important things, like this: How far do you go to protect your life (even if it's a bit lazy) against unexpected disasters? Maybe you'll tell lies. Maybe you ignore the lies of your loved ones. That can exhaust a lot of people. <br /> <br /> American films on the subject are abundant but usually go much further, using firearms that are not part of everyday life in Europe. <br /> <br /> We may not be so "thrilling" here, but we do not expect slogan-like movie titles for movies that are not aimed at a broad audience.
