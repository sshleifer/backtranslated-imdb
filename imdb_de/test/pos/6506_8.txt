As a big fan of hip hop and turntablism I always knew that I would like this movie. However, I was not prepared for how good the documentation actually is. It covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip-hop that was there from the start. The story begins in the early 1970s and follows the development of turntablism as art until early 2000 (turntablism fans will find this significant). <br /> <br /> The editing is almost perfect The movie. Apart from the excellent visual "scratch" techniques they used, the fast editing between the interviews and the footage is excellent, which gives the movie tempo when needed. The sound editing is also very good, with a few nice sweeping sounds that help with transitions. <br /> <br /> Even the absence of a narrator was welcome. We are not taken by the hand of history, and thus the audience can make their own assumptions easier. Each DJ adds another page to the story, and it's very interesting to hear about the unknown stars of hip-hop, especially those who were there as hip-hop turned away from the music business to the left, right and center has been. <Br /> <br /> Although there are many great things about this movie, I have a couple of handles. The biggest of these is the absence of some notable DJs like Ca $ hMoney and Jazzy Jeff, as well as DJs outside America, like Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. However, if you look at the commentary on the DVD (something I can highly recommend), the producer and director elaborate that they regret being unable to do so. The deleted scenes contain many interviews with Ca $ hMoney, Jazzy Jeff and the Scratch Perverts. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best documentary I've ever seen about hip-hop culture and music. However, it does not show the true potential of turntablism. I strongly recommend that you watch the DMC and ITF videos. However, this is a small mistake. I recommend this movie, not least for the fat soundtrack, with excellent music. (9/10)
