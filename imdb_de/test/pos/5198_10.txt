Stalingrad is a terrific film, well played and staged, and more down to earth in its approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and its politics. This together with "The Boat" is one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish "Vinterkriget" (I think)). It shows the tests of some German soldiers who fought and died in and around Stalingrad during World War II. The mood of the movie is similar to "The Boat," and that should give you some clues as to what to expect. So if you like realistic, non-Hollywood war movies: Rent it, buy it, make sure you see it! Finally, a hint for a movie fan: For some of the previous reviews, I just want to add that "Stalingrad" is not directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who did "The Boat")!
