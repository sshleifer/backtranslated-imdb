No blood, no sex (even though it radiates passion), no special effects, but just one of the pearls that hit your screen if you're not really looking and attracts your attention. <br /> <br /> Great spectacle, great sets, great music, nice action. If only there were more films like this! <br /> <br /> The sets move us through time, making us feel like we're there. <br /> <br /> and rise to the level of consciousness of "Nanny", for whom no one is a lost cause, least of all the inhabitants of their own "Halfway" house. <br /> <br /> Best of all, it's a true story of outsiders learning to "fit in". I was a little jealous of the good times everyone had in the movie! Could we all spend some time in Nanny's house?
