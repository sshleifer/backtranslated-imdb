This show was so exhausting to watch and there are only two numbers Drought World (Paradise for Love) and Paradise (Not For Me), where you can sit down and just watch. The opening of this show will be visually exciting in the story. Madonna enters the stage via a gigantic Swarovski crystal ball coming down from the ceiling, and the huge screens behind show pictures of galloping horses. Horses play a role in this show because Madonna falls down from you. The notorious scene of Madonna on the Crucifix is ​​on this show, as a large canvas counts 12 million, how many African children are orphaned because of AIDS. At the end, a website address will appear for anyone interested in donations. We then deal with the topic of the environment and again show images of politics and religion. There is an interlude and then the show starts again to the music of I Love New York and Ray of Light. This part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers doing funny hand gestures there. Towards the end there is the music number with the song Disco Inferno, which is mixed with the song, and the dancers make more presence known. The end is full of energy again as the show focuses on the tunes of Lucky Star and Hung Up, and hundreds of golden balloons drop off the ceiling and the message, "Did you confess?" The DVD is worth buying and when it came out the soundtrack was added to the show as a bonus. Jonas Akerlund has done a great job with the footage for this show and adapted it to the style of the tour.
