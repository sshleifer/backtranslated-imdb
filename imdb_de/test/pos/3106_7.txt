On the way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theater producer, his secretary and playwright are stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house and land with the playwright's fianc√©. If you can not imagine that murder and chaos are going on, you have not paid attention. <br /> <br /> This is a good introduction to the old Dark House genre. Not only is it a good puzzle, there are also some very funny liners that wander through it. The cast is excellent all along the line and they are more than willing to converse with the good material. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say this was one of the best in the genre, but something happened to me on the way, which made me downgrade the rating to just seven out of ten. I can not tell you what it is, not sure anyway. Maybe it's the feeling that I knew where it was almost from the beginning, or maybe it's something else. I'm not sure what, but there was something I could not shake that I like about this movie even though I wanted to love it. It just did not like being great and somehow it was too short. <br /> <br /> That said that I do not recommend seeing it. After all, it's a very funny movie that entertains, even though it's just great.
