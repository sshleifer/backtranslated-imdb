This is the true story of the great pianist and jazz singer Ray Charles (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe, winner Jamie Foxx). He was born in a poor African American town and went blind at the age of 7, but with his faculties of touch and hearing, this later in life would lead him to fame. In the 1960s, he had realized his dream, sold records in the millions and led the charts with songs and albums. However, the story also showed his demise, including the separation of his wife and child, from his affair with a band member, drug and alcohol use, and his imprisonment. With Regina King as Margie Hendricks, Kerry Washington as Della Bea Robinson, Clifton Powell as Jeff Brown, Harry J. Lennix as Joe Adams, Bokeem Woodbine as Fathead Newman, Aunjanue Ellis as Mary Ann Fisher, Sharon Warren as Aretha Robinson, CJ Sanders as young Ray Robinson, Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun and Richard Schiff as Jerry Wexler. It's a great story with a great singer-impression. The songs, including Hit the Road Jack, are the highlights. Awarded the Best Soundmixing Oscar, Best Costume Design, Best Director for Taylor Hackford, Best Cut and Best Feature Film of the Year, BAFTA for Best Sound, and Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Craig Armstrong and Best Original Screenplay. The Golden Globe was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. It was number 99 at 100 years, 100 cheers. Very well!
