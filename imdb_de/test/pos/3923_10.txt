I recently saw House of Wax and have to say that I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It was one of the better horror / thriller movies of the last few years, though not one of the best and most entertaining /> <br /> I've heard a lot of people doing the so-called slow start and the Character development plunder, which takes 45 minutes to open the films. <br /> <br /> Still, if the movie plunged directly into the deaths, viewers and critics would have criticized the film for not having decent characters that it would not care less about. <br /> <br /> and for character development, I think it worked amazingly well. <br /> <After I took my own answer and others (reading posts from the message board), many people wanted the characters I live to notice that many people liked Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton) have mentioned. considering Warner. Bros. have marketed their death, it was a surprise that many viewers cheered them to survive. <br /> <br /> Talking about the chases / death scenes, they were some of the most imaginative and exciting. I've been around for a while and enjoyed each one very much. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film was absolutely fine, I could not blame any of them, especially Paris Hilton, I found them to be very decent and I was hoping that in a 120 minute movie they would be over 25 Minutes of film time, but their persecution scene made up for that and believe me when I say that Paris can be scared (watch the scene where she hides a car from Vincent and he passes her ... the expression the horror on her face looks very real. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give House of Wax maximum stars, for entertainment value and excitement and tension even bloody ...... only criticism I wish them while marketing for the movie did not reveal the death list and who dies and who survives as it is It would have been ten times better not to know if the persecuted character was still alive or dying and a terrible death. <br /> <br /> can not get up Wait for the DVD, but watch the movies as long as you can. In your own vestibule, it's not the same, but if you wait for the DVD, watch the movie without interruptions in the dark, trust me that you will not be disappointed become.
