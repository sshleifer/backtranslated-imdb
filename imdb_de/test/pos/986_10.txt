I have never read or seen the original of the bard and can not compare it to his story. So I will not. Instead, I'll just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that were a little lower in budget but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought that all the leading actors did a good job. The style of magic seemed to be black rather than white and would offend almost anyone who was upset about it, but I thought it was well done.
