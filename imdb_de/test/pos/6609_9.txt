A solid documentary about marginal children surfing in the face of the American dream, then skating. Unfortunately, some of the youngest and most gifted succumb to the lure of drugs, while others become slaves to the blatant marketing of their pseudo-instincts. few come out up. But the cube is the result and the fruit of the whole is the new national pastime, skateboarding (the New York Times notes that "it once was considered a blast of authority.) Now skateboarding has its own summer camp, video games, magazines actually had it always these and corporate sponsors. ") commercialization co-opted another child who has born a cultural node.
