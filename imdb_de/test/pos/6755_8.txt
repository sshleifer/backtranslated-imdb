One of Starewicz's longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog ​​in search of an orange after being animated by the tears of the mother of a girl longing for an orange. The dog encounters an orange after it has fallen out of the car on the way for sale. At night he has to protect the orange when he comes to a devilish nightclub with bizarre and sinister characters. With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets the orange back and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. The mascot contains new techniques that I have not seen in Starewicz 'films yet. Adding sync sound and a mix of live action and stop motion animation gives Starewicz an old style of puppetry. Live scenes of moving cars and passing human feet while a doll sits on the sidewalk are impressive and fresh. The honking of cars and the shouting of street vendors is remarkable, as the shift of small studios into the sound was costly and Starewicz's use of the new technology seems like an old hat. New puppet characters in this film are scary contributions to the club scene of the devil. Branches and newspaper scraps come alive. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs that hatch skeletal chicks. Characters fly from everywhere to pats and pans and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses fast zooms, which are achieved by editing to speed up the previously slow scene. Overall, Starewicz can adapt his film style to the needs of a new audience and makes this film one of the best examples of his work.
