I do not go for so many "theft" comedies, and I might not be interested in them if it was not for the actors, when they were made, and when I got them FIRST (just a few years later). It's almost too similar to "The Happening" (though it's obviously a far less serious comedy than this) - Mafia's character takes on his own kidnapping or turns it in a different direction altogether. Of course, Raquel Welch did not play the kind of sharp character that Faye Dunaway did in The Happening, but that does not make him a sexist movie - she practically played a stick figure, almost her version of a "minor"! But I'm totally biased - it's one of the first films I've ever seen with her, and at the time I saw it, you could not turn without seeing a poster of her (thankfully). I think Robert Wagner was just right as the neither sympathetic nor averse leader of the group, as well as Edward G. Robinson (of course) and Vittoria De Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge, an actor who always managed to be funny.
