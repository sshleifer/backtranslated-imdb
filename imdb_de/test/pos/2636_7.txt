At the time of writing (January 25, 2006), I am saddened to hear that Chris Penn had died in the last few hours. Apart from Footloose, The Wild Life is the movie that I remember most about Chris. <br /> <br /> I still remember the movie with a slight preference for Chris' wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favorite restaurant with a family. Huge plate of fries in front of them, drowned in a whole bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my comment refers to the theme song sung by Bananarama. After all those years, I still remember the rumor (lol) that Bananarama was called to a VERY LAST moment to compose the track for the film and that he wrote the song in the plane bound to the recording studio Have recorded the song and shortly after they recorded the song, they spin the low-cost video for their theme song. I heard that this entire process (from start to finish) lasted 4 hours! If this is true then they are truly worthy of being the most successful female band of all time. Anyway, this is just a rumor that I heard back then and can still remember a generation later. Maybe anyone who reads this can leave comments and explanations. Many Thanks.
