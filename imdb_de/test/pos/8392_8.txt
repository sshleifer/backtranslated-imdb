Unusual Tom and Jerry for many reasons. First, there's Jerry's voiceover narrative, which is strange because Tom and Jerry rarely speak. Second, the two are friends, which was also rare and rarely works, as well as the more adversarial shorts. Third and most importantly, the cartoon is rarely funny (by design) and the jokes here are dry chuckle with a bit of a cough and a bleeding in the end. Think of a Tom and Jerry cartoon by Tim Burton. Not quite successful, but it works largely. The scariest ending for a MGM short I can remember. Not for everyone and a proof that these shorts were never intended only with children as a target group. It is worth seeing. Recommended for the above reservations.
