If you want to see a movie with Stan Laurel from the Laurel & Hardy comedies, this is not the movie for you. Stan would not find the characters and rhythms of these films for another two years. However, if you wish a good travesty of the Rudolph Valentino BLOOD AND SAND built last year, this is the movie for you. All stops are drawn, both in the physical comedy and on the title cards. If the movie is not held together by the character, the plot of Valentino's film is used.
