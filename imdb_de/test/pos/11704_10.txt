<br /> <br /> Crackerjack with Mick Malloy & Judith Lucy - both part of the cast of the late-night Saturday night comedy show "The Late Show", Bill Hunter, an Australian movie icon, and John Clarke, we always Still see regular on Australian television alongside Brian Dawe. Crackerjack, Losely is about a man in his early thirties (Jack Simpson, played by Mick Malloy) who commissions his annual membership in the local Bowls Club to get some parking for which he uses himself and cheap downtown parking rented to others. <br /> <br /> The club has a hard time gathering resources and members, and Jack receives a call asking him to play the next Saturday's match or lose his membership (and consequently his parking lot) <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the rest, but the movie is fun, carefree and contains everything a good Australian movie should be. <br /> <br /> If you are not Australian, some of the jokes and humor will undoubtedly amaze you. You are an Aussie - do yourself a favor and sit on Crackerjack. It is now available on DVD, I already have my copy! <br /> <br /> 10/10 .. Awesome flick! <br /> <br />
