Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983) must be the best video ever made. Dude, you have zombies, gussets and a catchy tune, what more do you want? John Landis mixed elements from Night of the Living Dead and American Werewolf in London and this video has been released. What starts as a nice evening for a young couple literally becomes a date from hell. They have rapping dancing zombies, a werewolf in a funky jacket, and Vincent Price. A cool video for a song everyone in the neighborhood belongs to. <br /> <br /> I have to give this a high recommendation as it has to be the best music video ever made. There was no such. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the "Making of Thriller". The documentary contains some "interesting" stuff.
