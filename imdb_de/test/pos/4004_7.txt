Especially when I wrote this comment, I had already read what Kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not a real movie. I mean, I would choose myself every day for a good Deniro movie or play a video game. But, man, what are you talking about? Well, since I have that out of the way, we go on, right? The video game adaptation by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is based, as you may have guessed, on the movie of the same name. The stranger is that this was released three years after the release of the film. Whether it's a slow development time or simply laziness, no one really knows. At least not. <br /> <br /> The game allows the player to play as the four main characters of the movie: Jen, Shu Lien, Li-Mu-Bi, and Dark Cloud (their story this is a secret bonus for a separate All four of these characters have combat styles based on their combat. But the real eye-catcher is the evasive maneuvers that allow any character to avoid the blows of an enemy attack in the most unlikely and gravity-defying way ever seen in the movie. The story is obviously based on the story told in the movie. The story of the game is told in CG movies and spoken in a subtitle language Mandarin (A nice little touch, considering I preferred the foreign-language title of the movie to the dubbed one.) The story goes into what may have happened the other characters throughout the movie and even (not really surprising, since pretty much all the video game movie customizations have) changed what was officially done in the movie to give the game more action. I never thought Jade Fox would actually go so far as to actually rent it. <br /> <br /> The true bonus to the story is the ability to decide how the game ends. What if Jen had all the ingredients for the healing of Li-Mu-Bi in her possession? What if Jen had not got her comb back? What if Li-Mu-Bi did not get the green fate for the second time? Their actions determine the outcome of these scenarios and the fate of the characters in this game. This is really the best feature of the game. <br /> <br /> Despite all its strengths, it also has some shortcomings. Enemies often tend to get annoying after a while, and the camera angle tends to stick in the least. Not even the special features (unlocked after playing the game) are good enough to forgive those hardships imposed on the player. <br /> <br /> If you loved the movie, you can enjoy the game. However, this game is the only way to dive into a playable version of such a beautiful and amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, you could have chosen a Deniro movie instead.
