It does not happen often, but occasionally a man can make a difference - a big difference. George Crile's 2003 bestseller, CHARLIE WILSON 'WAR, is a fascinating and enlightening account of the highly unlikely "differentiator" imaginable. The relatively unknown congressman from the Second District of Texas, "Good Time Charlie," was known more for his libertine lifestyle than for his libertarian legislation. Sympathetic and unrestrained (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson has served his constituency well, since the good people of Lufkin really only wanted two things, their weapons and to be left alone. It's Easy Street, replete with its abundance of beauty whales known as Charlie's Angels. When asked why all of his office staff consisted of attractive, young helpers, his answer was a classic: "You can." teach them to type, but you can not teach them to grow tits. "No argument. <br /> <br /> But even with the toughest rapscallions, a conscience lurks somewhere beneath it, and for Charlie Wilson, the unimaginable atrocities in Afghanistan, all his political know-how, led him to finance the most extreme, humiliating behavior to defeat the Russian military and possibly even help accelerate the end of the Cold War Fat chance, right? <br /> <br /> Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and a smart, snappy script by Adam Sorkin CHARLIE WILSON'S WAS a sparkling, sophisticated satire that captures the behind-the-scenes machinations of three colorful characters from "Charlie's Team." <br /> <br /> The "team" on the screen consists of three wonderful actors with four ( 4) Academy Awards and Nine (9) Nominations Charlie will be joined by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly restrained manner presented, which belongs to his best works for years. He is supported by Joanne Herring, a wealthy shareholder from Houston, who is played by the still devious Julia Roberts. Hey, why else's the bikini scene than letting the world know? In any case, Ms. Roberts looks good and keeps herself, but the script never gives us any clues as to why Kabul and his country are so important to their character. Maybe the two Afghan hounds are usually on their side - but we as spectators never do that. The third member of the "team," Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene in which he appears as Gust Aurakotos, a smart, street-bound CIA stranger who knows the outcome - both in the agency's boardroom and in Wilson's bedroom. <br /> <br /> For the success of the mujahedeen, the most important help that the US can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI-21 helicopter battleships that rule the skies. This requires money, a lot of money, and finally, "Charlie's Team" is forcing Congressmen to fund the $ 1 billion effort for advanced weapons to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles and other advanced killing devices. Bad, bad stuff. <br /> <br /> That this kind of illegal activity worth billions of dollars can take place behind the doors of Congress is really alarming. Any American should see or read this movie because it reveals a truly scary aspect of the business-standard political scene that is rarely seen outside of one's own government. Oh Mama, I wish it was not so ... <br /> <br /> Even though the first result of "Team Charlie" was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unexpected end result is that these sophisticated weapons are now being used be against our troops from the Taliban and others. With funding completely "hidden," the younger generation in this part of the world has no idea how oppression by the Soviet Union has fallen, and the end of Russian barbarism was the direct result of US intervention. Yes, when the Russkies left, our help did so - zippers for schools, zippers for infrastructures, zippers for maintaining meaningful relations with the Afghans. As a result, the consequence is an unmitigated catastrophe - it's like the precursor to "mission accomplished." <br /> <br /> As Nichol's film makes it so clear, "The ball you set in motion can bounce, even if you've lost interest in it." Mike Krzyzewski knows that, Eva Longoria Parker knows that, the little Lateesha in Lafayette knows that, but the typical American politician does not know. So we go from good to bad because we can not let the world know that we are the good guys. Talk about a catch-22 (another movie by Mike Nichols). <br /> <br /> Maybe Charlie Wilson said it best, "We've finished the game." <br /> <br /> Once again.
