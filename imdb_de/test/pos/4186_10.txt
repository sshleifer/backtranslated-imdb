A very strange, psychedelic, esoteric (and strangely enough I?) Experience. <br /> <br /> But at least on one level - it did exactly what it should do. It bridged the gap between the stupid, crafted Hollywood looks of teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program, and the adults who are growing and growing musically, and still a bit stupid Monkees of the 70s and beyond. <br /> <br /> The most important line in the movie is Mike Nesmiths: "If they think we're plastic now, wait until they see how we do it." That the Monkees were fed up with the negative comments on their image and work is a matter of history. They kept saying it in interviews. They had to make themselves new, and what was the better way to decompress and strangely decorate the machine that created them. And at the same time, they commented on our entire society (news, movies, art, everything) and said, "Hey, why are we reaching out to us - is not that all on one side or the other." These are the Orwellian "proletarians" (the Monkees portrayed the persecuted "Everyman" even in their stupidest TV series), stripped off "Big Brother's" pants and kicked him into his highly deserved butt. <br /> <br /> Loved the ideas, loved the music, loved the effects, loved the movie! But then, as Peter Tork says in the movie, "But why should I speak, since I know nothing?" :)
