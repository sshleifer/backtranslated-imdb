At the same time, John Russell played the ranch owner Nathan Burdette and tried to free his not good brother Claude Akins from sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo. He worked on the other side of the law on television. These years were probably the culmination of Russell's career, his best-known film role, and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Troop by Laramie in Lawman. Russell maintained law and order in Laramie the same way James Arness did in Dodge City on Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed the little characters that made you feel like Dodge City. Instead, he focused on Russell taking care of his business and entrusting the deal to his eager young deputy, Peter Brown. Brown played the deputy Johnny McKay, who was a very respectful young man and constantly referred to his boss Mr. Troop. He was quite handy with an iron but tended to be impulsive. Good that Marshal Troop was nearby. <br /> <br /> The other series was regularly the Kitty Russell by Laramie, Lily, played by Peggie Castle. At this point, Lawman was most like Gunsmoke. There was an unspoken understanding between Russell and Castle that even the smallest children would not have missed. And I was not the smallest kid when Lawman was in the first run. Unfortunately, Peggie Castle had substance abuse issues after Lawman's run was over. I remember a little obituary in the first half of the seventies. She was a beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Lawman was not a sober western from this golden era of adult western television. It was one of the best.
