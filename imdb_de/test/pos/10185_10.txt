The three-part series ended on PBS last night, which, in my opinion, was the first major presence for an American audience. The richness of the text and the unique quality of the filming are highlights. It seems very novel to see and hear an action game using the vernacular of Georgian England. Jane Austen's filmed salon rooms are the most important example of this language. However, it is the extent of the drama that overwhelms the senses that fits the picturesque language perfectly in every scene. This courageous confrontation with an ancient reality is reminiscent of literary giants like Tolstoy or Shakespeare, while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a C.S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian Sea Saga. The focus is on the universality of the human condition. Narrator Talbot, as he's being played by an actor with the almost perfectly fitting name Benedict Cumberbatch (certainly not even Dickens could beat this!) Alternates between heavy jingoism and extreme vulnerability, an effective tour de force. In fact, I can not remember a very fine cast of an interpretation error. This is not only a tribute to the actors themselves, but also to the director. <br /> <br /> The most impressive element, however, is how perfect life on board a warrior on the way to Australia in the world is in the early 1800's. This is especially true of the way the ship's motion itself becomes almost a figure. Something that rarely considers sea stories except in the background. Anyone who has ever experienced Mal de Mer in person will immediately recognize it and appreciate how difficult it may have been to recreate in the context of filming. Some effort must be made to gain an understanding of its nuances.
