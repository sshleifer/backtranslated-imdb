We saw this movie in my chemistry class, so obviously it had an educational value. I found that the film was very intertwined with the topics of science, moral issues, and personal experiences of the Manhattan Project, but was not geared for action. I would recommend this film for those who are interested in science or those who are interested in the moral problems of Fat Man and Little Boy, but if you are bored with atom bombs then you will not see it.
