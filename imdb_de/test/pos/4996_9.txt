What hurt this movie is everyone and her aunt Matilda compares her to her illustrious predecessor, who will harm any show. If you consider it western, it's a damn good show. We discover how our characters in 'Lonesome Dove' emerge in the situations in which they begin (like: Why do two Texas Rangers who live on adventures end up in a dead city? And how did Gus lose the love of his life? ) The performances are very good and we see exactly the same behaviors the characters will have on the road. The actors have done a great job. The cinematography was great, and although the music did not do justice to the legendary music of nearly two decades ago, this was an impossible task, and it was still fine. <br /> <br /> It also helped that we had three episodes that you do not see in a miniseries. Heck, it's absolutely impossible to see a two-part movie these days. <br /> <br /> Fans of the West, rejoice!
