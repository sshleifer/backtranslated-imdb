One of the characters (the aging film director pretending to be dead) says something that can sum up the entire movie: "In Italy, the dead rule". True! This is a land without future, in the hands of old and rundown men. And Bellocchio's cryptic portrait of the country, filmed from the seemingly pointless story of a director who has to film a spouse to make a living, says a lot about what's not working here. But foreigners can miss the point because it is not clearly expressed. I understand that Australian or Canadian people who see this may get bored and wonder if there is any meaning - yes, there is a purpose, but it is only clear to the people who live here today and keep their eyes open ... like Bellocchio. It's certainly not one of his best films and it's not as strong as Buongiorno, but it's worth a visit ... for Italians living in Italy.
