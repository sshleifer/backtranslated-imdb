I first heard about Commander's Log when attending the local science fiction convention. Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks and Brian Oberquell came out to show the video and show some panels on how to make money on a small budget. I have to say that I was very happy when I finally got the chance to see the show. Comparisons with Red Dwarf are unavoidable, as the first seasons of Red Dwarf were also shot on a low budget (though Commander's Log has to set some record for the least amount of money per minute of airing) and thus must make up for the lack of "eye candy" through good writing and acting up. Linden Banks, who plays Chief Petty Officer Blather, is especially good at introducing a serious but unsuspecting person. Bowlby's original idea was to tell the story in two minutes of "interstitials" shown in between the other shows over the course of an evening, though for some reason Space did not know how cool an idea would have been, and so did the interstitials a one-hour show summarized, the Space usually in two shows showed half-hour episodes. The existing DVD does not include Episode 3 (which premiered at the 2005 Cascadia-Con in Seattle) or Episode 4 (which was previewed at VCON in Vancouver in 2006), but if you're in your local Fannish community Contact, then you can receive news about a show in your area.
