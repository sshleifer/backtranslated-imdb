Not bad, but could be better, seems to be a staple for the crime drama. Sandra Bullock is the policewoman who has difficulty working with others. She signed her with a new partner. There is a closed case, but a police officer who works on it anyway, and there are so many Corney lines in the movie that you want to scream good movie hiding underneath. It's thrilling and the subplots worked for me. Worth a rent, but maybe no purchase.
