I never dreamed of it when I first started to watch this DVD, that within a few minutes I would be fascinated by it. The story was totally exciting and entertaining. The acting was great. The biggest surprise was how much the love that these two young women radiated across the screen enchanted me. Her first physical encounter was by far the most tender, romantic, sexy, intoxicating love scene I've ever experienced in the movie. I literally stopped breathing. I could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses. Without nudity or graphic sex they conveyed more passion and kick than any American production could ever have shown. Bravo to the author, the screenwriter, the director and the actors.
