Well, I would not want to lecture anyone, but I feel the urge to say some things that I consider important for this BEAUTIFUL movie. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and again a year later. That's it. The rest was the pink LP from Elton John's soundtrack that brought the music and the story deeper and deeper into my heart. How deep? One week ago, my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVDs yet). Boy ... I was surprised !! The poets have always maintained that deep childhood and youth experiences of beauty, love, God, and idealistic aspirations remain with you forever. Since they mostly occur on the heart level (not yet intellectually!), They define the contours of your soul like a sculptor with a stone. Sometimes, if we do not forget how right they are, we might better understand the meaning of every minute, every decision, every turning point in our lives. <br /> <br /> I admit that I feel nostalgia. But the fascinating thing about it is seeing the movie again, and through this time travel in the past, we enriched the understanding of why we 60's people grew up like us. The spirit of these times is all here: a genesis that was created far away from the official world of consuming and economic success, love does not involve war, the beautiful pop ballads, the poetry of the lyrics, a totally romantic view of youthful rebellion The awakening of sexuality, carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love, these two lonely spirits, still full of childhood innocence, grow together as they learn mutual commitment and become adults. <br /> <br /> I showed the film to a group of schoolchildren and they were given such simple and cynical comments that they considered naive and stupid. Guys, be serious !! Cinema is an art and, as art, reflects not only human emotions but historical moments. And that's what makes "Friends" masterful. It reflects an idyllic idea of ​​rebellion and a new beginning that we all dreamed of when we were 15 years old. I am a musician now and I feel that some of us, artists for this matter, still dream of it !! How else could we live? These are "friends", that's "Brother Sun Sister Moon", that's "hair". These were the times that were not foreign to AIDS, explicit and vulgar lyrics to foreign pop songs without melody, the pornography portrayed as "sexuality", this barbaric new "world order" that grew after 9/11. <br /> <br /> What a heartwarming experience to see Paul and Michelle again, timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world. What a journey back to the heart of our hearts: to Paris, to Elton John at his best, to this urban scenario, surrounded by 2 CV Citroëns and the VW Beetles. What a breath of fresh air from the quiet cabin in the Camargue, surrounded by fishponds and wild horses. They have made us who we are, such as Serrat in Spain, Brel in France, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Luther King, the Beatles, the early Bee Gees, the Spirituals of Belafonte, Gandhi, the Gospel of Elvis , <br /> <br /> People still hope: Take this picture. Start with innocence and grow from there. You will learn what it is about. And from there you have a solid and truthful foundation. some ideals to look out for in life to handle personal and world affairs We need so much today! Give yourself a chance and maybe one day the time of the cynics will end. (I have an extra VHS copy) <br /> <br /> Santiago Zuleta. Bogota Colombia.
