"Tipping The Velvet" is one of the modern television productions that proves that watching TV can be as good or even better than it is in your local theater. <br /> <br /> If you want to read the drawing, read it and if you want other details to jump to the next paragraph. This is the memorable portrait of an unconventional young girl named Nan, who works as a naive oyster girl until she discovers her suppressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty, who disguises herself as a man for her stage job. The young girl soon joins the band as another male impersonator and they are a big hit. Soon both will start a tender affair. Kitty is finally wrapped in a union of comfort and devastates the young Nan. From then on, Nan works as a male prostitute for men who want to have sex with boys, and then becomes the private sex slave of the evil and sadomasochistic Diana, in which Nan experiences a severe emotional abuse. If that ends badly, Nan returns to the street where she remembers a young woman named Florence. a kind-hearted socialist who had the true potential of being a wonderful partner. There Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn to become famous again. <br /> <br /> The Region 1 transmission is of exceptional image quality, with a very good selection of scenes, an eloquent photo gallery and an entertaining interview between writer Sara Waters and the film's author, Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> The sets, costumes, cinematography and music are beautiful. Acting, writing and directing are extremely strong and full of realism, class and originality. I loved the movie and the novel. Section III of the film is much different in the film than in the novel because Section III of the novel is capitalized but is not on-screen. I will be brave and say that I love the interpretation of the movies more. <br /> <br /> In this breathtaking story, drama, comedy, eroticism and romance are combined in a way that grabs in a profound way while being exciting and spiritually uplifting. For every mature and open-minded adult who has ever experienced the joys, sorrows, and the power of falling in love and living. A revolutionary production; an absolute must!
