This is a video version of a stage production, with additional filming for the video edition. The result wins both the drama of the stage as well as the effect of a well-produced film. The set of George Tsypin with sculptures and masks by Julie Taymor is outstanding. Jessye Norman is awesome, and you can hear and see young Bryn Terfel. This production is breathtaking, emotional and majestic. If you do not see it, you have failed.
