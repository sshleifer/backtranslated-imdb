Usually I'm a comedy guy. I rented this in the videotheque under comedy and thought "Albert Brooks! Awesome!" and rented it. It seemed like a romantic comedy, and I remembered that I had hated it, and had the full mentality to hate this movie. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> While this is a movie, it's a romantic comedy played by a fantastic lead actor and supporting actor (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack, and Nicholson), and everything works well in itself. The script sounds real and not compelling, as if it could happen in the news channel that you see at night. It takes away your emotions and lets you enjoy Hunter and Brooks and Hate Hurt, which makes the ending a little uncomfortable and fruitless, but it shows that you do not need a happy ending to finish a movie, you just need a true ending got everyone. Not every life ends well, as the Broadcast News shows. Maybe people do not like the end because it's not a typical happy ending for romantic comedies ... but it works, it's real and it's awesome. Broadcast News is a classic in its time and a great romantic movie with "Casablanca". Well, maybe not so high, but it's the only other romance I can think of. <br /> <br /> Broadcast News: 9/10.
