Hunt for Justice is the recruitment of Slobadon Milosevic for his trial in The Hague. Although it was a little too clinical in the presentation, the subject could have been very depressing very quickly. A Canadian judge, Louise Arbor, becomes prosecutor for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the United Nations in Yugoslavia. She fights everyone to extract the evidence that has brought Milosevic to justice. Not a bad docu drama with class A direction and production work. The "evidence" bothered by the joking discussion of the facts, fortunately they did not go too much into detail and no real pictures of the torturers.
