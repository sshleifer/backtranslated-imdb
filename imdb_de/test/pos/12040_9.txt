Darr, although a copy of a Hollywood movie, is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is not only beautifully portrayed but also has great songs and beautiful scenery. Shah Rukh is his ordinary self. His expression and his voice match his character. I was pleasantly surprised by Sunny Deol's performance in the film. He is a bit romantic and adorable in the movie, unlike his other characters in his other films. Sometimes you feel that justice has not been done to your character. Sunny should be portrayed as a good guy in the movie, but in the end he looked like the bad guy. Juhi Chawla is beautiful and bubbly. She is her ordinary self. In short, a great love story with passion.
