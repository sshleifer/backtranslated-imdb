The rise of punk music has been poorly documented in the film, and most people are focusing on what's happening in other cities like London or New York. Penelope Spheeris managed to maintain a snapshot of Los Angeles between '79 and '81 proving that a vibrant and diverse art / music community had emerged that rivaled any other competition. For some, the bands read like a who's who of legendary American punk. Black flag, X, circle throws, germs, fear. Purists argue that vital bands have been missed (weirdos, zeroes, flesheaters), and that the film was the cause of a rush of suburban poseurs and macho violence. However, the topics discussed in the film remain relevant, the intensity of the music remains unsurpassed, and the influence continues to be seen and heard in today's cliques / fashions.
