The Curse of Monkey Island is a brilliant video game and it's a stroke of genius for lucasarts video game designers to create this sequel. All characters are brilliant, the characters' voice output was realistic and funny. It put a lot of effort in this game and it deserves the 10 that I have given in the vote continues to do so Lucasarts!
