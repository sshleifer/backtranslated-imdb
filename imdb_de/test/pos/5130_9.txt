Hoot is a nice simple movie with a simple message. It seemed like this movie was meant for small children, but I know adults will like this movie. The plot is pretty simple. A child who has moved to Florida needs to help a football jock and an outcast save the owls from building a pancake house. The message in this movie is great especially for animal activists and lovers. It's about doing everything possible to save endangered animals. The acting in this movie is decent. All three children looked like they had good chemistry. The music is not too shabby. I liked Jimmy Buffet's songs in this movie. Overall, this is a good family movie. I rate this movie at 9/10.
