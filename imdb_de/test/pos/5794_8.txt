Little Vera is the story of a Russian teenager, her family and her attempts to find meaning and value in an increasingly decaying life. In search of meaning, she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious Sergei, whose hatred of her deeply flawed parents quickly gets out of hand. Little Vera is shocking and disturbing in almost every way. The drinking of the father, the empowerment and incomprehension of the mother, the accidental lies and the misleading of the brother and Vera, who forgave them all their mistakes, are all shocking and a little disturbing. The raw honesty of the film, however, somehow shocks even more shockingly than the plot or the characters. In a confined space and in the great decay of the cities Little Vera presented a completely different view of the Soviet life than ever before. In fact, Little Vera is a portrait of the collapse of Soviet society painted in pain, despair and rust. It is the implosion of a family facing the implosion of a whole social order. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself is painfully and desperately unsatisfactory, it is definitely worth a visit, if only to understand the feelings and cultures that are still transforming Russia today.
