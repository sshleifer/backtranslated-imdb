This is my favorite love story, it has every element that should have a good love story. Poetry, jazz, friendships the ups and downs in a relationship. Finally a movie that shows positive aspects of the black community. Larenz Tate was great. I can not imagine anyone else playing the role of Darius. He recited this poem as if he had written it himself and meant every word. I own this movie and if I had the time, I would watch it every day, then I feel better and better and that's what a good movie should do. The character of Savon could not have dealt better with the topic of marriage. We would all like to find a Darius out there, but most of us are just happy with the movie. My vote is 10/10
