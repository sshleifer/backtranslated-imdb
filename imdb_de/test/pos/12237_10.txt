I think this is a marvelous movie ... I have watched it constantly from the time I was 4 years old until about the time I was 8 years old. I got them mainly because of the guy who was always like "the other world" and his friends. I'm 12 years old and I still have nightmares about it. I can not fall asleep now because I think about it. I love this movie, but it's so scary! I definitely love this movie, I have very good memories of it. Kate is very good at acting in this film. Amazingly, I never realized it was her! I also think that the graphics were very high quality compared to other people
