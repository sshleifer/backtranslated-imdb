Some may think that Imaginary Heroes is just like "Igby Goes Down" a movie, but it is not. In Imaginary Heroes, the director lets us feel for the Travis family and the people around them. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is great and the acting is extremely well done. Weavers and Hirsch's acting is believable and makes the movie what it is. The actor, director and author Dan Harris has made a film that many people should see. I do not think this is just another teenage movie, it's a movie about a family and their problems. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10/10 because I think it's not the best movie that can be No movie, but it's the best thing he can achieve perfectly.
