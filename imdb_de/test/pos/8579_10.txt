This is a great movie. If two people with different backgrounds and social status think they can not offer anything, in the end they need what they need to testify to what the heart knows. Sometimes we wonder why a man is with a woman or vice versa, and the outward appearances say something to our eye. When Nimi thought that Matthew had nothing to offer her, and when Matthew was just looking for a fly (because he had an open marriage with his wife Jenny), in the end, they realized that they could exist without and without others. It was worth resisting what family and friends thought and what society thought was right to be together. This movie restores my belief in love.
