This is musically an extraordinary movie. I felt terrible that Rodrigues died in 1999 before I saw her live. Knowing she did a wonderful Lincoln Ctr. Concert in 1991 & that maybe I was there, but it was not painful. <br /> <br /> I just bought my first Amalia picture. While the musical recording is fantastic, in this movie you can SEE her face & her enormous expressiveness & passion as she sings these songs of horrible sadness, wonderful. A way of seeing Mary's face as she weighs Jesus in her arms in the pieta. When I saw her in the film, I remembered witnessing a similar extraordinary concert appearance by Mercedes Sosa at the Lincoln Ctr in the mid-1990s. As I listened to Mercedes singing, I felt in the presence of a tremendous spiritual and musical power that contained incredible primal power. Some of the musical segments of "The Art of Amalia" touch on how Caetano paid Veloso Amalia a tribute and sang one of her songs in front of a full concert hall. The musical segments also convey the incredible international reach of her musical repertoire and the bonds she has made. Fans around the world. There is a section in which she claims that she has played in every city in Italy that has a stage! <br /> <br /> In another section, Amalia talks about her fight. Oral cancer and how she came to New York to commit suicide in a hotel. Looking at Fred Astaire's videos, she gradually convinced herself that life was worth living and turned away from killing. Amazing! Later in the film, she bravely admits to the interviewer, directly acknowledging that although she might have conquered the world musically, she had a sheer sadness. She admits she was never happy. This is unbearably sad to hear, but perfect to keep w. a singer in Fado (which she translates as "bad fate" or "bad luck"). One longs to learn more about her personal life: what was that that made her so sad? What were your disappointments? <br /> <br /> "The Art of Amalia" is somewhat disappointing in other important areas. My concerns: Showing 20-30 full songs in the movie, but only providing one English translation for the last one, seems like a waste (unless the movie was for a Portuguese-speaking audience only, which I can not imagine) , Seeing the deep pain in her face when she sings and does not understand the lyrics is a disappointment. As for the other disadvantages, there is almost no biographical material on the family background of Amalia. There is a 20 sec. Snippets w. her singing w. her mother (it's absolutely awesome). There is only a brief indication that her parents are moving. the landscape to Lisbon. I would have liked to see footage of the village she came from. The interviews as they are are almost exclusively w. Amalia herself (and a few close friends). It is a good but not a great topic. There are no interview topics that are familiar with Fado or Portuguese culture & society. Therefore, we do not get a deep understanding of their musical roots. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a wonderful movie that anyone who is interested in Amalia should see. But it is not a perfect or final work on this topic.
