Frank Sinatra has done so many great things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to make one stand out as the best. If I had to name the best he has ever done, it would be his performance as Frankie Machine, the heroin addicted musician and poker dealer just saved by the love of a good woman (played by an extraordinary person) babelicious Kim Novak) , The "cold turkey" scenes between Sinatra and Novak are terrifying and heartbreaking. The film is almost perfect, from Saul Bass's cover artwork to the seminal jazz score by Elmer Bernstein. It may not be what anyone thinks of in the fifties, but it's still a must.
