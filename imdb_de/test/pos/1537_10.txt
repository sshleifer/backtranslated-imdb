This movie kept giving me nightmares, with Alan Rickman's voice an omnipotent, deceitful, fascist ruler. The scariest movie I've ever seen - psychological terror is stronger than anything any horror movie ever got. For me, Alan Rickman's voice will always be the power and terror of a totalitarian state reminiscent of Orwell's 1984. This film describes those who are not interested in the reality of much of today's world governments. This movie is disturbing, but in a way that everyone should see it - it's a description of a reality that no one has ever had to experience, but so many do.
