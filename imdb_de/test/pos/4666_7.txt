* SPOILER ALERT !! PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE MOVIE TO LOSE !! * <br /> <br /> I originally planned to watch this movie last weekend, but my plans eventually did not let me see it anymore. So my friend and I made plans to see it after school today. Boy, are we glad we did that. The film opens in Italy with a planned robbery with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton]), Lyle, also known as "Napster" [Seth Green, you'll get the nickname later], Pretty Rob [Jason Statham], left ear [Mos Deaf] and John Bridger [Donald Sutherland] are planning a theft to steal 32 gold pieces. This leads to the entire opening, which takes a good 10 to 15 minutes, and includes a boat pursuit that opens the movie to the right. As Steve drives away in his van, Steve turns against the group, stealing the gold and killing John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retired) leader of the group. A year later, John's daughter Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron) is one of the top crackers everyone can ask for. Charlie Croker (who was indirectly responsible for her father's death when he called him over the retirement) says that they found Steve (who was hiding) and found him back for what he did want. She initially declines, but later agrees, and the team members return, along with the help of mechanic Wrench (Franky G), who manages the perfect robbery while creating one of the biggest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is a perfect mix of action and funny pieces. There is a joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle who created Napster, and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole him while falling asleep. Eventually, Lyle will only respond if he's called "Napster." There's even a funny line in the film by Seth, who says, "He said in an interview, he called it Napster because it described his hair like it was a diaper. He called it that because I took a nap, when he stole it! " The beginning and end sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative I can think of in the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He was not a big, tough villain. He behaved as if he was paid and did only the bare necessities (which is a fact because he was forced to do so due to contractual obligations to this film). But even if this problem is the only true criticism of the film, the film is still very enjoyable and I definitely recommend it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, you see Seth Green in the comedy role. He is perfect. Rating: **** out of *****
