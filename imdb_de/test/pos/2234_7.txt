This is a pretty smart, well-made version of the fairytale romance of the "modern" woman of the 30s. In this case, she helps the man she loves to become the boss of the company while serving as his secretary, and finally wins his love from a scheming social butterfly. Interestingly enough, her business acumen is subtle in parallel with her housework, and the ladies of the office are portrayed as "powers behind the throne". From Mrs. Astor's intelligent performance, well above average.
