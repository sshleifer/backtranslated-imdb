My friends and I gathered in a house on a Friday night before going to the pub. It was the only program that missed us the opening time. It's one of the best comedies I've ever seen, if not the best. David Jason was brilliant and has been compared to Buster Keaton several times, with his skillful stunts that have been made so believable. I wish I could get the series on DVD to watch again. He had an amazing ability to make stupid things believable, and this series shows how talented he is in so many different directions. He's an accomplished "Trip and Fall Guy" and I remember once seeing a trailer showing people how to do it professionally. Surely he is the one who teaches this art to people. He only got glimpses of it in other programs he did. Pshaw, this program shows how versatile he is. I have no idea why David Jason vetoed another series. In my opinion it was one of the best things he has ever done and I have been a fan of his since he made this series. It is said that he did not like it because it showed the rudeness of his early career. Well, in my opinion that might have been the right decision when he made the decision, but now his career is well advanced. I think this would be a good time for him to do another series, in which he looks back on his "secret life" full of mistakes he does not see
