I saw this movie last night with a book in Lexington, Ky. After a wonderful night, which consisted of a few short words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say everything, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell; D), friends during the signing of the books and a QnA session with our favorite Deadite Killer the Lights dimmed. <br /> <br /> I do not go into detail to spoil anything ... but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job maintaining the classic B-movie feel. The characters were classic 'b' characters, the place was refreshing (which movies do you have * that are based in Bulgaria?) And the scenery was almost original and fun! Add to that the humor that is spread throughout the movie that made the audience laugh at most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Even though this film is not as universally interested in people as others, a beacon of fun and laughter in a squadron of (as Mr. Bruce Campbell put it) "B-Movies" is considered "A-Movies" are listed (Bewitched, Dukes of Hazard, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory)!).
