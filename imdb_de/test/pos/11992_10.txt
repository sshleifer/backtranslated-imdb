Like Richard Pryor, Mason never got the material he deserved. Whatever you know about him is probably wrong. Walk past the accent and look at his stand. You'll be very surprised - he's one of the best stand-ups I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from Lenny Bruce to Eddie Murphy to Jerry Seinfeld to Chris Rock - Jackie Mason definitely up there). He is known for being a comic-comic. Even Howard Stern said he was one of the three funniest comedians of all time. <br /> <br /> The claim that Mason is not Dangerfield is ridiculous. Dangerfield is known for being a big Mason fan. Dangerfield's career went nowhere for a long time until he followed Mason's shows. At this time, Mason gave Dangerfield inspiration for his "Get No Respect" routine. Although I think Dangerfield is great, you both see them standing, and you'll see Mason is the better comedian.
