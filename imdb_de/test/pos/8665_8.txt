It seems that we should recognize Scandinavian cinema more than just the Dogma 1995 movement, as it was cooked by the Danes all those years ago. "The Brysomme Mannen" or "The Bothersome Man" in English is a surreal and deeply thought-out film that is deeply entertaining and content-wise both on and off the surface. As a film alone, it is a devastating comedy about society and attitudes in the postmodern world in which we live. A world that, judging by the sinister man, has reached the regions of Norway and the like. But along with this black comedy, the film seems to go a little deeper and raises, at least for me, the question of metaphorical religious spaces and our human instincts, trying to expose the truth among so much material in our world seems alien to me. <br /> <br /> This was really a fantastic introduction to contemporary Norwegian cinema for me. The film falls heavily into this category of European art cannon, whose deep themes and ambiguity envelop the atmosphere while maintaining an open-ended finale, rather than a narrative as a sequence of events that may have one or the other meaning. So many times have we seen movies using the set The Bothersome Man, and so often it has become an almost predictable routine that revolves around a detective story or a prose or something similar, but this film allows its attitude and situation as a mere backdrop for his protagonist named Andreas (Fausa Aurvaag) to find out who he is; where he is and what the possible secrets behind this place really are. <br /> <br /> The setup I'm talking about involves the hero arriving at a place he can not remember before or what happened before. I'll jump right in and say he's dead, in my opinion, and like all the townspeople he's sent to purgatory. Everyone in the city with which Andreas mixes is the same age; The same mentality and attitude that suggests that most of them are victims of their suicide and sent into purgatory without any emotion, feelings, colors or, above all, pain. <br /> <br /> When we see Andreas for the first time, he gets off a bus he discovers to be scary, and approaches a gas station in the middle of the countryside. He is awkward and has a big beard, but soon he will be the opposite, with suit and tie; Clean, shaved face and a home of its own, complete with a new job where the movie is one of the best transformational moves between rural and urban environments I've ever seen. But the new job as well as the new city are restless; You can take breaks whenever you want. Chefs are unusually friendly and there just seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything. These ideas are best disseminated in the cinema when Andreas, still a relative freshman in the city, cries and is clearly influenced by an on-screen movie, but everyone else sees in the stone face. There is also the first example when a man jumped out of a window and was speared on some spines, but they all go by without a hitch. <br /> <br /> To support my idea that everyone is already dead and the city is acting As a kind of purgatory, death and harm are generally impossible. There is one particularly unpleasant scene that contains an electronic paper-cutting machine and the thumb of another. However, the reaction of all those involved to this event is blatant and growing back within an hour. A suicide attempt that involves moves later is also unsuccessful. Instead, we get the point of view on what it feels like to pull down pipe rails with invulnerability on your side. The city acts as a barrier, a painless society in which the masochistic need to hurt oneself is impossible; a place where sexual relations can equally occur and disintegrate, but in both emotionless and dispassionate circumstances; a place where people can commit suicide, but it is impossible to actually die. The city takes over these forces because the damage was done in the "real life". Therefore, the movie says that you can not kill yourself twice, in fact, you can not feel pains or emotions in purgatory after life. <br /> <br /> But the best part of the movie is the one that sneaks up on you. Judging from the last five minutes of the film and the side story of listening to music from another house, there seems to be a fine line between the spaces that the film dictates as heaven and hell. We only see these rooms very, very briefly? so short that they consist of a single shot. The sky is a colorful kitchen with music and children playing: it offers life, hope, emotions and happiness, while hell is a snowy place that pursues you thanks to its hopeless construction and sinister disconnect. The introduction of these two rooms at the end of the film suddenly informs you about the reality of Andreas and Co.: Purgatory and all that went with it, life after death was simply not ready for Andreas and his free-spirited, adventurous mind? and see where the thinkers end.
