Great movie about a great man. Thomas Kretschmann is first class as in all his other films. I never saw him as Pope John Paul. It speaks volumes for the casting director. Why do you throw him away as a German officer in the cinema? And he only came to the general attention after "the pianist"? Of course he looks so hot in the uniforms. I know that many girls are drooling about his pretty face. But this guy is a great actor and has so much potential. If you do not believe me, look at "Stalingrad". I hope that in future he will get many excellent roles with more diversity. Otherwise what a heartbreaking waste of great talent.
