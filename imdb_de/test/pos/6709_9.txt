Many people say the end made no sense, but it did. When the female vampire was dead, the connection to Earth was broken and the ship launched after gathering a lot of life force from hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough to re-activate these hexes and create new bat creatures. It seems that they have no carnal sex, as vampires of the legend. <br /> <br /> Vampire bats from outer space may be ridiculous, but quitting them with one shot to reach the powerhouse under the heart is consistent. All you can ask for is consistency. The viewer must expose the unbelief, even for scifi. <br /> <br /> The only problem is having to be a sword or a stake, not bullets. That brings a supernatural twist that does not fit science fiction. So that's a problem. <br /> <br /> The only major inconsistency I've found is killing the male vampires with the sword, but the girl's soul and Carlsen go up to the ship. I suspect the male souls also went up the ship, but not shown. <br /> <br /> What about all the people killed? Do their qui powers ("souls") go as discrete units on the ship, is the total life force merged into a unit, as the ship deems appropriate? In other words, all the human souls who went to the ship could be reborn as bat beings. <br /> <br /> The basic concept is no more ridiculous than Star Wars "Force" or even reincarnation. <br /> <br /> This movie was overkill, sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula), but profound in many ways. It was also a beautiful love story. Beginning and end were ethereal. Both started ("What happens to me") and ended up as a love story. <br /> <br /> Most of the criticism of the movie is that it is bizarre. Like this? Bizarrely is an art form. As far as it is ridiculous, everything fits. The plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the aliens that only kill people. Maybe they did not need Patrick Steward's blood to get a picture of the girl, but it was a very distant, surreal scene. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie is hated is the end. But the end fits in perfectly with the beginning. People are so wrapped up in the naked girl that they miss the core of the movie. It's a love story, from beginning to end. It starts with Carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and ends the same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are fixated on the hero killing the monster, and this movie did not end that way, which is why I love him so much. <br /> <br /> Instead, it has a happy ending. The two go back to the ship to be reborn. Much cooler than the hero kills monsters in the end, but that's exactly why it's bombarding. It was not a direct horror or even scifi / horror, but a love story with a nice beginning and end. All these souls are sparkling on the ship. And the crystal room pulsates with new life. <br /> <br /> Most people can not handle a love story that is Alien meets Dawn of the Dead and Dracula.
