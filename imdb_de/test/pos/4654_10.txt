Twenty years after I saw this, I still quote things from this movie like "Look between the two giant melons" or sing the "Pabst Blue Ribbon Theme". On the other hand, 20 years later, I can now understand the Meat Machine, because there are still many clich√©s like these that they used for this movie. These are signs of a good movie for me. I could say that this movie outlasts the time, which I can not really say for many movies of the 80s. I assume that this film is still on a list of many people's favorite movies when he grew up in the 1980s. If you like games and have dreams of becoming a "Game Master", or if you are pulling away from these 80s movies to see your childhood, you need to see that. Sometimes it is also sarcastic and funny. But one thing is for sure in this movie: If anyone ever invites you to a "Great All-Nighter," they do not mean an X or Acid Trip party, they mean, get ready for Midnight Madness! Oh, you will see it. Everyone will want to die! hehehehheh.
