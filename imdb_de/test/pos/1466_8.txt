A strange relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual who will soon be a woman. Charlotte and Venorica, both trapped in their lifeless lives and do not know how to get out of them. Charlotte is the owner of a beauty clinic, she has separated from her aggressive ex-husband, moved alone in an apartment and has packed all the furniture except for her big bed. Veronica lives with her poor dog downstairs. She is sensitive and worried about her mother's visit and the bad relationship with her father. Her only hope is that the upcoming transsexual operation will make her a real woman and then everything will be fine. Now she can only wait for an approval certificate. <br /> <br /> Then these two people meet by accident, and gradually they are all involved in the lives of others. There are some sparks between them, but no one is brave enough to face the truth because they are not willing to accept the change, as most people do. After all, the end is pretty satisfying and leaves some imagination for us to think about. <br /> <br /> The great work of the director gives me a great impression, she masters the development of characters very well, the emotional atmosphere is quite full and intense. I am so obsessed with the gloomy lights throughout the apartment, Delphic, but full of desire. Two main characters are played by Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik, they are amazing in their roles, a very impressive performance and the chemical reaction between them is real and convincing. <br /> <br /> This Swedish indie film is about encounter and change. Whether you are homosexual or heterosexual, male or female, the peculiarity of life is everywhere. If you come across it, you will be hesitant and confused, but at least do not be afraid to follow your heart and choose the right path.
