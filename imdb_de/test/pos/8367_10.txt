I could never imagine that I would love movies like that. After watching Yimou Zhang's "Heroes," I decided to check out his other films and maybe search for something similar. The second film by Yimou Zhang that I saw was "No One Less." Then I realized what movie I'm in right now. No wonder why I immediately got "Keep Cool". It's a simple, touching and brilliant piece of cinema, I pay tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that it is not the amount of money that makes the movie good. It's about what the director wants to show and how successful he is. The story is very simple, a typical excerpt from a typical everyday life, and also presented in a very simple way, the camera movements also enhance the impression and feel of the film. I give this film a top rating and am impatient to see other films by Yimou Zhang.
