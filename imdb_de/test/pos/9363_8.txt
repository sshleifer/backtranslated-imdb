RKO Radio Pictures became a real classic in 1947 and was even nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. The drama, the script, the continuity, etc. are far from perfect. and the story is worth the viewer 82 minutes. Although the image of soft petals is the true story of life, turning the murder victim into a homosexual rather than a homosexual, most viewers will see the victim as a Jewish homosexual - such disguises never work, were perhaps not intended. <br /> <br /> I could pick some details, but just for fun. There was no all-night movie house in Washington, DC in 1947 - and if I wished, I wished Robert Mitchum and his buddy would not talk through the show. There were no bars where a GI could pick up a pretty blonde. NO! If Robert Ryan wanted to read the latest scoop, he should have bought the Daily News; Not the Times-Hearald, the Evening Star, and certainly not the Washington Post. But these little things take nothing away from this classic. <br /> <br /> The film benefits greatly from the absolute lack of a musical score, except during the credits. I only saw it in a few movies. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, there has been a TMC introduction since 1995, in which some liberal accusations are made about what the public wanted to "prepare" in 1947. bla bla bla! As if that fool has a business that judges his opponents. I'd say the ex-GIs of 1947 - the Greatest Generation - were a lot smarter - and had better scores - than a commentator, film historian, or any other clever mouth of 1995. Put a sock in!
