It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about their past (as he landed, for example, in the same hospital where Hurley was), then you should know that despised Libby dies in season two more in the third season and we'll get answers to questions that surround them. BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions ... like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toes statue? <br /> <br /> I can not wait until Season 3, Lost just rules !!! I hope all unanswered questions will be answered. I loved how they explained why the plane actually crashed. Desmond did it when he did not manage to enter the numbers in time. 4 8 15 16 23 42
