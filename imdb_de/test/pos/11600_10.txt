It seems that many Europeans and Americans see Indian films for a false reason; I see some people complaining that this movie had no dance sequence! Bengali films are - apart from their Hindi counterparts - a class that is more realistic. Rituparno Ghosh is one of the best young directors in India. He is widely known for his choice of themes for the films and the strength of his screenplays. 'Chokher bali' is a perfect example. The director is a faithful adaptation of Nobel lore winner Tagore's novel, which explores the quest for the sexual desire of a Bengali widow, and adds a new dimension to the much-noticed and controversial work.
