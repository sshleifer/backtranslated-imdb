I saw this on Zone Horror and fully expected that, like most of the movies they play, it is a manhunt fight, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie revolves around two friends and a madman in a monster truck chasing them (I know, it sounds like shit, but it's actually pretty good), the movie is scary when it's intended, and it laughs out loud, sometimes funny (and not) Unintentionally too, it's well timed and fun and very bloody, there's also some very funny black humor that's not the most original movie, but something. If you are after Shakespeare, then this is not the case, if you are looking for a fun movie then that should be fine
