I read the book in a summer book club, and we all loved it. My friends from this club agreed not to watch the movie, so the book will not be ruined. I did not agree and recently saw it with my younger brother and parents. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. The film was very faithful to the book, without losing its own mind. The topic "New Kid" has been shown just enough to get a feel for it, but that's not what history is about. <br /> <br /> The acting was not the best I've ever seen, but it was all still good and most of all the kids had a lot of energy. The characters were interesting and the plot was sweet and not over the top. It was a children's film that works well for adults or teenagers. <br /> <br /> I wish Beatrice had a harder girl, but she was still a great character. Mullet Fingers was the way I imagined, except that his hair was obviously dyed, blond hair and dark eyebrows. Roy worked very well as a little guy and as a new kid, especially when dealing with his parents and friends. <br /> <br /> The message and the end (which I do not discuss anything but I like) have teamed up Make a great movie for a rainy day. All in all, this was a great movie that you can watch over and over again, if you have to remember that the world is not a terrible place.
