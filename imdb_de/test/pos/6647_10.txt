I can not remember a movie that shows the emotional destruction of war so skillfully, as reflected in a single marital relationship. The focus of the film is the union of Ullman and Von Sydow - the two can be seen in every scene. In the course of the film they experience a role reversal - one has the power of survival and the other is reduced by dreams to emotional escapism. Both will lose a degree of humanity, but one to a greater extent than the other. The characters and the viewer go through periods of fluctuation in terms of closeness - the camera moves away and the sound disappears, the words are lost, just so that the camera returns to picturesque close-ups of their facial expressions. The confusion and fluctuation may make this film difficult for some viewers, but this is all under Bergman's hand. I think using a "fake" war makes the movie timeless, as up-to-date as ever, and by focusing on the human relationship through war, makes the movie relevant to everyone. The couple could be anyone. The film is not based on location or time, but rather on emotions. A unique and effective war movie like no other. Bergman's films are virtuoso in depicting human relationships - that he would make this a war film is masterful.
