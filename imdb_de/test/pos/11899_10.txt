Finally, I see the El Padrino movie, which I can see is an incredible movie, and lots of action. Damian Chapa is a good director. But I have to admit that I'm his best actress. I saw her working behind the scenes by a lady named Kinga. She has to go back to school and learn how to work it. <br /> <br /> El Padrino is a pure action epic. Why can not most of the directing people put together movies that ask you what the plot is? I'm so happy to see someone that I know is a really great actor. I am one of the people who love it when artists manage to do it. <br /> <br /> BS
