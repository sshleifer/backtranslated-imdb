Do not be fooled by my surname. My mother was a full-blooded Italian, so I really know Italian families, and I love gangster movies, even the funny ones like these. <br /> <br /> For the people who beat this movie badly (you know who you are) you should have your movie privileges because you do not know what's good. This is a damn funny and well-styled movie. The fact that almost nobody is Italian is, as far as I can see, part of the joke. And what red-blooded man could complain that he spent an hour and something with Michelle Pfieffer? Puh-lease! When I saw this movie, it convinced me with the opening song of Rosemary Clooney, as Irish as you can but their pronunciation of the Italian words in "Mambo Italiano" is flawless and sets the tone for what should follow perfectly. (Damn it, I even bought the record the next day.) Only the look of every flash thing in the apartment that I personally saw in my kinship houses, though it was not in the same place (which I found hysterical) sold for me , <br /> <br /> This movie is like Goodfellas laughing. I'm just wondering why there are no burger worlds and what happened to the food these guys should get? I suppose the crew ate it. "The fries are crispy, the shakes are creamy." My mouth pours almost as much as he thinks of the beautiful woman Pfieffer. (And I've never trusted clowns anyway.) And the three best things in this movie are Mercedes Ruehl's hilarious comic woman who is spurned, Dean Stockwell as her extravagant husband Tony "The Tiger" and last but not least, the awesome raids by Oliver Platt, who should get more comic roles. And take note: Find out where the black chick went. Ouch! Why does she work so seldom? This picture is just next to the great mob movies as it should be.
