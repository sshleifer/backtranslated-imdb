All budding filmmakers should watch this movie - it's like a master class in digital filmmaking. Some scenes look like they've been shot with much higher production values ​​than they really were. It is very encouraging that such well-made work can be made on a low budget. The acting is very good and the characters are very interesting, especially that of the main boy (John Kielty), who manages to play a teenager who has difficulties and remains very sympathetic. His beautiful but fading mother was also very well represented, and the relationship between her and her boss was very intriguing. This is a very bizarre, interesting piece, and I will look for something else made by the same team. The director is certainly one to look at.
