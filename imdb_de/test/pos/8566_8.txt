This had to be my guilty pleasure. I'm a GIANT fan of 80s movies designed for entertainment and they did not care if they insulted someone. This movement has no flesh, no substance, no deep, thought-provoking scenes. Just old college kids having fun and having to show some boobs, that's the way it should be! This movie is for you if you just want to relax and NOT think. Viva la nudity!
