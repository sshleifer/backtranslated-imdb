"Father Hood" is an overlooked little gem of a "road movie". Fine performances by Halle Berry, Sabina Lloyd and Brian Bonsall, two really fun over-the-top performances by Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside, <br /> <br /> and a truly outstanding one by Patrick Swayze. The film is supported by an unconventional storyline, which is greatly undercut by flashback imaging, resulting in a formamatic, abrupt end. "Father Hood" would have worked much better without these "bookends". Nevertheless, the film raises important questions about "family responsibilities" and the consequences of state intervention. As long as the care system rewards state institutions for NOT having children, it will lead to such abuses. <br /> <br /> Get this problem. It's worth the drive.
