1981, just before dawn, is one of the best horror stories in the wild. It's one of the best-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Do not Go into the Forest or The Prey Out of the Water. <br /> <br /> A group of young adults Come and have a look at the mines that one of the group has just bought. However, they are not alone in the wild. A huge imprisoned killer, who appears to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates intruders. <br /> <br /> Director Lieberman, who provided such great B movies as Squirm (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), does a great job with this intelligent thriller. The film is beautiful atmospheric, with a creeping tension and a strong tension. This film makes even the open wilderness terrifying claustrophobic. The places in Oregon are beautiful and well captured by sophisticated cinematography. The music score is a true original and stands in contrast to the scenic visuals. <br /> <br /> Deborah Benson provides a great lead, her presence was fascinating. Gregg Henry performs well as a Benson lover and Chris Lemon provides occasional charisma. The minor cast, especially the veteran Kennedy, is quite good. <br /> <br /> A true gem of the Slasher genre that does not need a thrill. Definitely worth a search for Slasher fans and horror fans. Do you see it! <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 from ****
