I'm sure the movie has some logical gaps, but I was so intrigued I did not really care. The movie is like a happy, cheerful teen trumpet combined with a Schwarzenegger-type action movie. It is full of action, full of excitement and also has some humorous moments. Sean Astin is fun to watch, and I have not seen Louis Gossett Jr. since I saw "Diggstown" in the movie theaters. He's a good, underrated actor, and I love seeing him on the screen. I'm just wondering what he's doing now. Unfortunately, he plays in many of these direct-to-video movies. Hopefully my assumption is wrong. Anyway, this is an entertaining thriller, and I definitely recommend trying it out. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
