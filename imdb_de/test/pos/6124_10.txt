You know the saying "The cat has killed curiosity"? Well, I've heard so much about this movie, from a magazine that described it as one of the most shocking films of all time, my 1001 films you must see before you die, my sister who saw this at a film festival, and the ego I love the 70s show on VH1. I just had to watch this movie because it was voted the grossest movie ever, and after watching it last night, I have to say that it really was its title. My God, this movie was so funny! I thought I really saw everything with some of the sickest movies and TV shows I've ever seen. Some things that I think will still feel like a shock. <br /> <br /> Well, Babs Johnson, aka Divine, has become the dirtiest man alive and a jealous couple named Marbles is competing for the title. They want to get Divine out and become the dirtiest couple by abducting, raping, impregnating, and selling their babies to lesbian couples. But it seems like Divine and her family are good ... I do not know, seems to keep the title by having sex with chickens, dubbing butt-lip sync, eating dog feces, stuffing meat in skirts, incest, and it just gets rougher and coarser. <br /> <br /> Pink flamingos are terribly played, terribly made and good, just terrible. The reason for the rating I will give is the fact how could you rate this movie? I always rate, so I only find what the hell? Because of the rudeness of this movie, you have to pay tribute to John Waters, who the hell would ever think this movie over 35 years later? For the performers and crew who worked on this movie, you're just evil! <br /> <br /> 10/10
