From the beginning you can not look the other way and do not want to. "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu) is one of the most entertaining animes I have seen in a long time. If you can see the insane and sometimes perverted sense of humor, it is easy to find a brilliantly constructed and masterfully executed work. <br /> <br /> Part of the brilliance comes from the fact that the episodes are not chronological. They can not understand some of the things they talk about first, but in the course of the series you will find that they are " Oh, that's what they meant! " While this may confuse some people, after watching the show you will be persistent enough to tell the story this way. <br /> <br /> Finally, the focus is on the characters. The title character Haruhi Suzumiya is by far one of the most eccentric heroines of all anime. Her opening speech to her class, in which she explains she's "not interested in ordinary people" and "espers, aliens, and time travelers," is absolutely bizarre, but she's so adorable. <br /> <br /> Then there is Kyon, the "normal" guy who is drawn to the madness surrounding Suzumiya-san. He is the narrator, and his quick joke makes the scene always a lot more entertaining. He is in the midst of various factions, all trying to influence Haruhi Suzumiya, and the other three characters are representatives of these factions; Ironically, they are the beings Haruhi is looking for, and they can not reveal themselves to her. <br /> <br /> The first is Yuki Nagato, a quiet girl who happens to be the only member of the literary school club and also a representative of the idea of ​​integration; She is basically a stranger, though the best description of her is a computer program in a human body. Their purely emotionless reactions make them weirdly dead and always make you think that there is more than you see. Then there is Mikuru Asahina, the time traveler, who is incredibly cute, a heavy blow and the theme of Suzumiya's plans to promote her club, the SOS Brigade, for the world. The end result is that Suzumiya does things to her that border on sexual harassment and dress her in fetish uniforms. The final character is Koizumi Itsuki, the shy and ever-optimistic philosopher who happens to be Haruhi's "Esper," although he can only use his powers under certain conditions. <br /> <br /> The end result of all these characters is a comedy like no other, that's both raw and deep and always brilliant. Do not believe me Look at the first episode, their "student film". You will see what I mean.
