I'm not sure if I like this movie or not. I think it's scary and totally weird. Crispin Glover did a great job as Layne, as always. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but I do not like the character at all. The performance of Keanu Reeves was really good and I really felt for his character. I think the whole cast has been great, as if the characters were real. I did not like some, but others were really sorry (Keanu Reeves). I'd like to know if this was the original ending the movie should have since it did not end up as I expected. I was disappointed in the end and I do not feel like the rest of the movie lived up to it. If you are looking for creepy, crazy and really different movies, choose this one. If you like things that are normal, please stay away.
