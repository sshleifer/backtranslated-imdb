I have to say that every time I see this movie, I am deeply touched not only by the most painful four years in Hongsheng's life, but also by how his family handles his drug addiction. It is also true that the addiction to drugs, alcohol or pornography is not only hurting you, but also your most important people in the world, your family. Since the family has the highest priority in Asian culture, the circle must come together and show a person how much the family loves him / her. This is actually the first Chinese movie I really enjoy, not for fun, but the elements that surround it (great acting, touching story, great direction) make this movie worth seeing. What's most striking is that Hongsheng and his family play the story out instead of having a B-movie actor trying to imitate the real person. It shows the authenticity of the film.
