I recommend the idiocracy to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, the film is enlightening and made me laugh so many tears ran down my face. To the end, as I breathed in and realized how close we are to Mr. Judge's vision of tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Look for a cameo from the Mac commercials (Justin Long). as Dr. Lexus. I found his performance Oscar-worthy, especially considering what the Oscars were spent on in the recent past ... besides, he's cute. <br /> <br /> In short: Idiocracy is a fatal, funny look into a possible future. Where people are named after product brands (the president's second name is Mountain Dew), hospital visits cost $ 5 billion there are garbage mountains, because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it, and no one cares about anything but money. All because only stupid people brood. Seems familiar. Oh yeah; That's what I think about when I see professional wrestling ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, look at this movie. It's a good laugh and it will make you think.
