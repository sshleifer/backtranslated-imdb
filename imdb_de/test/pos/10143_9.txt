The Man Who Knew Too Much {1956} is a remake of a movie that Alfred Hitchcock filmed in England in 1934 with the same name. In my opinion, his later work is far superior. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and that Peter Lorre does not have the tingling excitement of the original. In both films, the plot is essentially the same, except that the original plays in Switzerland and the remake in Marrakech. It tells the story of a married couple, James Stewart and Doris Day, who have vacationed with their young son and have met a suspicious man who is very curious about his past. It's just like that, he's an agent looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader. Then he is stabbed to death in a market in Marrakech, because he has found out that he is a spy, and then falls into Stewart's arms. In dying he tells him the whole story of the assassination. Stewart and Day find out that another couple they met was the couple the agent was looking for and kidnapped their son. The film features outstanding performances of Stewart and Day in a straight as a dramatic role, as worried and frightened parents. This film has proven that Doris Day can perform in both exciting dramas and light-hearted musicals. The direction of Alfred Hitchcock is first-rate. The scene in Albert Hall is a classic. The original is so slow and gloomy. I do not know how people compare the two. Just look at the remake and you'll enjoy it. I give the movie a 9 out of 10
