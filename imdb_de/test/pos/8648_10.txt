10/10 <br /> <br /> PLOT DISCUSSION <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies ever made, and I'm not saying that because I'm going to be fooled by the seemingly nonsensical presentation. Those who dislike the movie because they do not understand the story often criticize those who praise the movie by saying that they accept their genius because they do not understand it. I do not consider this movie as very allegorical. For me it's a story with beginning, middle and end. People are puzzled by the film because they expect it to have a deep, philosophical meaning to interpret from the supposedly meaningless scenes. I feel they do not understand that the crypticity comes from a hacked and rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy scene, rather than a chaos of visual allegory. Because of the limitation of the length I will try to keep it short and to focus on the main concepts. <br /> <br /> The general plot: Diane moves to L.A. after Jitterbug Competition to get into acting. During an audition, she meets Camilla, whom she falls in love with. Diane is angry with jealousy since Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers the other man (the director) at a movie shoot and the other woman (a random blonde) at the engagement party for Camilla and the director. Motivated by her anger and obsession, Diane hires a killer who kills Camilla. After that, she is overwhelmed by loneliness and slips into an unconscious fantasy world in which she lives the life she wants. Diane is awakened then. In her conscious state, she is persecuted by what she has done. <br /> <br /> The meaning of the fantasy: The film begins after the credits with a 1st person p.o.v. Shot showing someone collapsing on a bed and slipping into unconsciousness. This is where Diane's fantasy begins. The accident serves as an excuse for her to "bring back" her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. She portrays her friend as meek and innocent because she wishes she were. In the meantime, she acts as if everything is "like in the movies" because she has a fleeting personality. In a sense, she also kills herself and takes on the identity of a waitress named Betty in a diner. The story that revolves around the director is a direct result of her feeling that he was in fact just like herself, and "convinces" himself that he was forced to vote for Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. Camilla Rhoades in Fantasy is actually the casual blonde of the engagement party. She hated her so much that she turned her into Camilla and became the ultimate opponent. Then she took the real Camilla, made her a perfect, submissive out-of-the-movies friend and used Rita Hayworth as inspiration. She paints the batsman as a very awkward and incompetent person to further justify the survival of Camilla. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was the search for Diane, who was ultimately herself, dying the dream world by leading her through a series of memories of reality. The first recollection was of Club Silencio, who said that "there is no band" and the "instruments" that you hear are not really there. This is a metaphor for the imagination. She begins to shake violently because she shakes the perception of her surroundings. The other reminder is the blue box ... Actually, the blue box is not the memory itself (more like a Pandora's box), but the blue key that opens the box. The blue button reminds her of the real death of Camilla, because the man who was said would show up after its completion. In addition to her love, this entire creation is an escape from reality, living in the idealized Hollywood that she expected to be part of when she arrived. <br /> <br /> This is a story that shows the psychology of a very restless woman who has lost a dream. It's not a series of random things specifically designed to bother you, and it's not a cryptic philosophical message. It is an unfortunate part of the human condition that is beautifully presented. <br /> <br /> However, this is ultimately my opinion. I may be far away. Or it is not intended to mean anything. There are many who disagree with me. Great! Why does it have to mean anything? Why can not it just be a statement in itself? What if coherent, rational narratives are fetters for artistic expression? Peter Greenaway, for example, has used many words to eloquently support this idea through the following statements: "I would argue that if you want to write narratives, be author, be a novelist, not want to be a filmmaker in areas that are not primarily narrative doing is more exciting to do. "And where is the written rule that everything has to be immediately understood with just one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the film is not related to its art. "I did not understand it!" So...? "Mulholland Dr.", the story or not, affects the viewers, harasses them, pulls them along, makes them astonished, lulls them. The way it is suitable for interpretation is amazing. It never gets old. It never loses its shine. His visuals are always effective and beautiful. It's cinematic perfection, no matter what. Enjoy.
