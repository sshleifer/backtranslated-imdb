Good movie. <br /> <br /> I managed to pick it up at a local store on DVD. Â£ 2.99 seems to be a good deal and it is. The movie is called "To Kill For". It took a bit of detective work to find out the original name. <br /> <br /> In Britain, it has been classified as 18, and rightly so, although the standard of films depends on the "ability to sell". After seeing Final Destination 3 last night, it should have been an 18 in my opinion. Perhaps the fact that Traci Lords is able to tend to bring the classification group to 18. Such a shame. <br /> <br /> Traci is a great actress and should get the chance to appear in bigger and bigger budget productions. She is able to turn what's branded as B-movies into fine-performance, and she's really amazing. Long live Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress.
