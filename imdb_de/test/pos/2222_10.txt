One of the funniest movies I've seen in the theater in the early 70's, and unfortunately he's been on TV only a few times since then. This movie should be released on video. It's Sellers in his worst and slimmest form as a confused hospital administrator. Great cast, great movie. If someone has a good VHS copy, I would like to buy them.
