The second "Mr. Eko" episode has slightly less interesting flashbacks than the first one ("The 23rd Psalm"), but in almost every other section it's one of the best episodes of Season Two, the mythology / background of the series also drives the characters. A new station of the Dharma Initiative - The Pearl - is discovered by Locke and Eko, and the landmark film they find and see inside completes Locke's transformation from a believer ("orientation") - after the film ends, "We To see this again ") to a doubter (" SOS "-" Did you press this button, Henry? I need to know? "), to an infidel ("? ") - after the end of the film:" Do you want to see that again? - "No, I've seen enough.") Terry O'Quinn's performance is as powerful as usual ("Every second of my miserable little life is as useless as this button"). Meanwhile, Eko takes his Als the man who is sure that he was brought to the island as part of his true destiny, that is, push the button further.Other highlights of "?" are an amazing, unique dream sequence in which person A has the dream to be person B (this is the brave idea that the current season v on LOST could use much more) and the haunting scene of Libby's last word before her death and the way Jack and Hurley can not recognize their true meaning. *** 1/2 of 4.
