"Crossfire" is a well-known Noir of 1947, which is a murder mystery with a strong message. It shows Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene and Gloria Grahame and is strongly led by Edward Dmytryk. We witness the murder at the beginning of the shadow, and for the rest of the movie, Young looks like Detective Finlay, who's in charge of finding out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death, and equally important, why. The victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), is someone the soldiers meet in a bar. They go to his apartment to continue their visit, and Samuels is dead. <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about 1947, but when I see "Crossfire" today, you know who did it and why we did it the suspects were just watching I do not think it was so obvious back then as these actors were just starting out. Nonetheless, the film is very impressive with its powerful acting, good direction, violence and unyielding anti-Semitic language. The characterizations are lively, including that of Gloria Grahame in a small role - she is a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspected soldiers, in a bar and can provide him with an alibi. The movie's big performance belongs to Robert Ryan, but all are excellent. Above all, Robert Young is effective as a tough but intelligent police officer. Mitchum is very sympathetic as a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely man who is not sure if he still has feelings for his wife. <br /> <br /> Really excellent and a must see.
