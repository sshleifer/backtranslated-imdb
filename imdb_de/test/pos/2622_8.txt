I have seen this episode many times because I did not know how Prue died. That's what happened. Prue, Piper and Phoebe try to save their innocent doctor because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe goes upstairs and looks into the Book of Shadows while Prue and Piper protect their innocents. Shax arrives while Phoebe is still up, so Shax throws an energy ball at the doctor, but Prue shoves him out of the way and Prue gets hit in the chest and hits the wall with the piper. So Phoebe comes down and says the spell, since it was only Phoebe who said it, not the power of three Shax who was only wounded. Phoebes calls Leo to heal Piper and Prue. So Leo heals her. Phoebe went to the Underworld to find Cole. Meanwhile, Prue and Piper are looking for Shax on the road. Piper and Prue see Shax and Piper uses her power to blow Shax, while a New reporter has everything on tape. It's all about the new about the three powerful Halliwell sisters. Meanwhile, Phoebe knows nothing because she is still in the underworld. Everywhere in Halliwell House there are repeaters and people. Then a madman comes in and says, "Can I be part of your coven?" and Prue says, "No, that's our house, get out of here!" and Prue uses her powers to kick them out. When the madman comes out of the house and cries "There Mean Hexches". The madman gets so angry that she shoots Piper right through her stomach. Prue gets into her car and trays to go to the hospital, but people do not let her through, so Prue uses her powers to get people out of the way, and people want them to kill her more. They came to the hospital, but Piper did not succeed. Meanwhile, Phoebe is in the underworld. Phoebe finds out that they have been exposed. Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can reverse time telling Phoebe what the source told him. Phoebe says, "What would make him think I'd make a deal?" and then Cole says, "So you can save one of your sisters's life." Leo goes to the hospital to find out the Piper is really dead, so he tells Phoebe that it's true. Then Phoebe agrees to stay only when Cole returns to warn Piper and Prue about Piper's exponent and death. Back at the hospital, SWAT is about to take Prue, but the second before they do it is rewound when they were in the mansion with the doctor, but this time Phoebe was not there to call Leo, Prue, and Piper to heal, so the doctor Throw also in the wall. The doctor died and Prue too. But I did not get that, even though Piper was thrown against the wall. Why did Prue only die? Why did not they show that Leo came and cured Piper and Leo trying to heal Prue? If you know the answer, send me an email at angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS. I miss Prue, but I also like Paige and I'm glad the show continued
