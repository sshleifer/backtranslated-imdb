If you like silly comedies like Airplane, you'll love this movie! It's definitely in the style of Airplane and Scary Movie. A funny movie! It has the strangest characters in a movie. Michael Jackson, Evan Marriott, Joyce Giraurd, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. The special effects are hokey, but I think they are because it's a stupid comedy. There are apparently two versions of the film, one at Blockbuster and one at the official website: MissCastaway.com. The version included on the website seems to be a preview version signed by the director. Behind the scenes, there is also fun with Michael Jackson, which was filmed in Neverland. The film was filmed in 2003 and says it is rated PG on the box.
