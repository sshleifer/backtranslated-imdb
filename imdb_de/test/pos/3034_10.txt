CONRACK (20th Century-Fox, 1974), shortly after the "blackploitation" era of the 1970s, offered viewers a restrained, sincere and everyday style of drama. To offer a much different kind of mass to its audience (which was far more general than these Gansta films); a down-to-earth dose of realism that provided a solitary counterweight to these shooters. <br /> <br /> Replacing major characters who were evil detectives, superflies and megs / macks / pimps (Make your choice in terminology) was a lonely, humble and humble teacher. The academic we talk about is the main character Pat Conroy; Who is the only lonely teacher hired to take on responsibility for a kind of school house on an old island off the coast of South Carolina. <br /> <br /> "CONRACK" (Jon Voight), The name the youths called him finds terrible residue at school. In addition to the physical characteristics of this "Little Red Schoolhouse," every systematic and progressive graduated education system was completely absent. Oh yes, by the way, we mentioned that further complications exist for a successful education venture was manifested in two irrefutable facts. Pat Conroy was an outsider and he was white; Almost the entire population of this offshore sea was black and very poor. These unacceptable and deplorable conditions were the agents of the local education authority. Mrs Scott (Madge Sinclair) and the Superintendent, Mr Skeffington (Mr Hume Cronyn), are the Headmaster. Between the two, we realize that the teacher who is the low man on the totem pole is in many ways powerless to influence any kind of meaningful and lasting improvement. <br /> <br /> But don 'if you tell a "young Turk" like Pat Conroy that he can not. (Can not do anything, that is). "Conrack" spends unorthodox class performances for a year and makes real progress. But the strong-headed teacher does not give in and does not acknowledge the authority of his superiors. While he is legally and without knowing it, he serves you as a super lover; He disagrees with Mr. Skeffington's specific order and ban on bringing his class children to mainland South Carolina for Halloween for some trick-or-treating. Even if they stopped with them in the Skeffington residence, they act carelessly. Next we see an ambassador from Western Union Telegram happily singing as he moves from the Carolina mainland to the island. where he delivers the telegram to Conroy, who brought the news of his release from his position in this school and district. <br /> <br /> NONE BEING LYING LYING, Pat Sues Mr. Skeffington, Headmistress Ms. Scott and the Board of Education protested his dismissal as unlawful. The judge will impartially examine Skeffington's "offense" and the law on whether there are minor penalties that could replace the separation of Conroy from the school system. whereupon he receives a negative answer. Appropriately, the judge dismissed the lawsuit with a hammer and said, "It's very easy!" <br /> <br /> The story is brought to a bittersweet conclusion as the "Conrack" students take him to the mainland launch, while a record delivers BEETHOVEN'S 5th SYMPHONY; This had played an important role in the educational agenda of Conroy as well as in our history. In the opinion of this writer, the story (which we believe was at least semi-autobiographical, even the one.) Main character of the author's name) was much more than a story of a localized event. For me both buddy Schultz and me; This is a kind of representation of a microcosm that illustrates the unfortunate conditions that permeate state schools across the nation. (One opinion only) <br /> <br /> LIKE THIS film, it was just one of many films showing the shops of common people; They live in "Calm Despair" in the country's large hinterland, which is outside the DC Beltway and the urban business and communications centers located either on the Atlantic coast or the Pacific coast. <br /> <br /> IN HIS OWN This is a small movie that would soon be supplemented in the film vaults of 20th Century-Fox by such great works as NORMA RAE and BREAKING AWAY. (both are from TCF in 1979). <br /> <br /> SEE it if you are not already. Recommended by both Schulz and his buddy. * <br /> <br /> NOTE: * Why? That's me, of course! <br /> <br /> POODLE CARVING !!
