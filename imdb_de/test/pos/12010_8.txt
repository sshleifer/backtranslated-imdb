I was surprised when I saw this movie how much he "caught" me. No, the actors were not like typical Hollywood actors, but that's not always bad, as this movie proves. Unlike the Disney standard, it's still a refreshing twist! They also give you a taste of what it probably looked like without being "educational". A movie everyone should see and enjoy. Many people like to argue about "accuracy" in any film of this kind, but getting the basic idea has a lot to offer. Mild regret; East and West Germany, viewed on each map, would have West Germany on the left, East to the right. The movie puts you back a little bit at times, because about half of the scenes are on the right side of the Federal Republic and at other times on the left side. Even during the same events they shift back and forth. Maybe a little more consistency would have avoided this slight distraction. Go see it!
