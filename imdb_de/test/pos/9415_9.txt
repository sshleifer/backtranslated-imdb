One hilarious thing I'm going to say above is that I'm not the biggest Seisun Suzuki fanatic. I actually saw quite a few of his works (thanks to a retrospective that had the film festival) and I found his films just a bit too yakuza-driven for my liking. So I went to Princess Raccoon and took care of what I would see. Boy! I was knocked out! "Raccoon" is Suzuki's attempt at a musical, mixing the elements of Japanese opera with many modern elements (both audial and visual). The lead actor, Joe Ogdari, proves that he is one of the hottest actors in Japan at this time. I must adore that the younger Japanese actors still play roles that take place during the feudal times in Japan, and bring out the full benefits of samurai equipment. The story itself gets a little confusing if you do not really follow it closely, but even if you do not, be prepared for the treasures that Princess Raccoon has.
