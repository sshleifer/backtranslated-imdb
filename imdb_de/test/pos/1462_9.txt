Comedy Talk Show Creator of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' The new series Man to Man with Dean Learner focuses on Garth's manager, publisher and advertising agency, as played by Richard Ayoade. <br /> <br /> Nightclub owner, restaurateur, publisher, international playboy - Dean Learner is a one-man brand. <br /> <br /> After meeting his co-funded Channel 4 TV channel, Garth Marenghis Darkplace is now inviting you to his luxurious penthouse apartment for a brand new, fun and highly stylish TV talk show. <br /> <br /> Man to Man with Dean Learner will feature all Dean's remaining prominent friends as well as plenty of live music and fine fish dishes in a show that smells like class - but not fish! <br /> <br /> I was doing two of the live shots and I had stitches. There are clear comparisons to Alan Partridge's "Know I Know You" in the layout, but the unique writing style of Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness takes it to another level. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Darkplace, you can not miss it. If it airs late this summer, catch it
