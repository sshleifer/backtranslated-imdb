I have always heard of this great mini-series, but I first saw it this week, July 2007. I can see why she started the career of many young actors. The story is fascinating and gives wonderful insights into the time before and during the Civil War. I was interested in the characters and how their lives developed during that time. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me to see how people thought in the 19th century. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see how history books came to life. The costumes and sets were beautiful! I really enjoyed seeing both parts I and II. Part III is a disappointment.
