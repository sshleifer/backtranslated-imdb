This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the time between his glorious Mutual Shorts and the more mature United Artists. More opulent than the Mutual films, he continues Chaplin's quest to perfect his comic expression. Most people forget that the movie is actually a dream that Charlie has as he waits to be sent to the front. <br /> <br /> There is plenty of slapstick over the Limburger cheese, with which the enemy is gassed, and Chaplin's advance enemy territory disguised as a tree. <br /> <br /> At this time in this career, the big man was so immersed in cinematic expression that his films give the impression of making oneself. No doubt this was not the case, but it still offers such a convincingly realistic view of life on the frontline, as I recall, albeit from an ironic-humorous perspective. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, familiarity with it The entirety of Chaplin's work should be a requirement for all cinephiles - do not hesitate!
