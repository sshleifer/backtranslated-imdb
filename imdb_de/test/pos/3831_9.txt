I agree that this is one of the best episodes in the entire series - my only distraction would be the somewhat harrowing performance of Mark Lenard as a Romulan commander. My considerations are as follows: If you have not seen the first run of this episode, you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the second generation Trekkie (or Trekker - your preference), you are first brought out of the scene. Still, he is an excellent commander for our captain, and this episode is well written and well-done by all. Both sides speak of excellent arguments regarding the cost of war compared to the price of peace, and certainly recall some of the best films from World War II and later. This is not my favorite genre, but I would certainly recommend it to a fan to watch this episode through this filter. You will see that it holds. I'll never understand why sci-fi gets so little respect - the best drama is putting ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.
