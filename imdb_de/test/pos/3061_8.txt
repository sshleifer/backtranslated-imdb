This movie has to be released on DVD because I can only buy it that way. I thought it was so strange because there was no real plot. It was not supposed to be an Oscar winner. I appreciate these films. Cary Elwes was a very sweet Robin Hood. I can not think of my favorite part of the movie because they are all pretty good. Anyway, get out of peace. !!!!
