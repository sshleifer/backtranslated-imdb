If anyone ever composes a compendium on modern American horror that is really worth salt, there will need to be an entry for SF Brownrigg's omnipresent practice in Asylum Horror. Every time I see this movie, I am impressed with the film's overall economics, from the compact, completely self-contained plot with a puzzling beginning and all too horrible ending, the appealing performances of an essentially non-professional group of actors and one the prevailing sense of fear and claustrophobia, which effectively consumes the report with a degree of inevitability that is all the more appalling as the spectators know what is going on long before the hero, with the only question as to when they are going to wake up and smell the coffee ? <br /> <br /> In an old palatial mansion that serves as the backdrop for a private sanatorium, shot on a dental floss household in Brownriggs home Texas. Do not Look Down The Basement Another intriguing twist on the good old Edgar Allan Poe volume about inmate taking over the facility before an otherwise "normal" outsider unintentionally joins the ranks without realizing it until it's too late that not everything is as it seems. They are completely cut off and beyond any external help and are inevitably challenged by their own minds as the madness gets out of hand. The TV series Original STAR TREK had made an attempt with its June 1966 issue of WHOM GODS DESTROY, Juan Moctezuma. The process was fueled by a peyote in the Mexican psychedelic journey. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON, tangentially related in 1972, is the ASYLUM EROTICA / SLAUGHTER HOTEL by Fernando Di Leo, which contains the elements of an unknown killer and an end that can only be defined as "splatter cinema" - Brownrigg may not have thought or thought of SLAUGHTER HOTEL, but he certainly had some similar ideas. <br /> <br /> Legaliciuos former playboy playmate Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, RN in Clinical Psychology, who has just given up her nice job as a supervisor at a major hospital, to turn a Peckinpah movie into the middle of one of God left to go to a dr. Stevens to work in his private sanatorium. Dr. Stevens has launched a new form of therapy designed to encourage the emotional and psychological scars to confront their inner obsessions, to bring them to the surface and hopefully free patients from what has slowed their sense of reason , Nice idea, but to arm a six-foot, completely insane man with an ax and tell him to chop off his aggression, and then, if you turn your back on him, he's probably not the smartest idea. Stevens is sent off even before Mrs. Holotik appears onscreen with a good slap on the lower part of his skull. <br /> <br /> This event effectively leaves the sanatorium in the hands of a Geraldine Master [actress Annabelle Weenick, who also served as scriptwriter & production manager]. , a woman of amazingly professional demeanor, who quickly defuses the situation with the help of Sam, the wonderfully unlikely hero of the movie, a lobotomized African American Boheomouth, played by an actor named Bill McGhee, who was sadly deprived of muscle mass as a supporting Oscar nomination the brain of an 8-year-old boy. Sam's wish is to support someone who helps him get his coveted toy boat "in the water" and his constant appeal to the various female performers to do so [and his uninterrupted consumption of chocolate popsicles] as one subordinate topic But we will avoid this here because the children may still be up. There is also a brief overview of an employee who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients, but I leave the details of your discovery to yourself. <br /> <br /> Ms. Holotik arrives when Dr. Effectively stiffened and quickly convinced of the biting professionalism of Mrs. Masters, who reluctantly lets the leggy young nurse hesitate in spite of the tragedy that just happened, oh, TWENTY minutes you have to admit was rather athletic for you. Holotik's sister Beale begins to show symptoms that she is not the hottest meat cleaver in the drawer. When informed that she shares living space with a number of maniacs and there are no locks on the doors, she does not trudge for the nearest ace hardware store to pick up a hasp and a padlock to secure herself, and we will Treated with some really spooky scenes in which some of the inmates sneak into their room and smell things like their hair, they try to kill them with butcher knives and caressing their ax-headed necks. But this is all part of working in such radical mental health care, informs Ms. Master about it, and she delves into her strangely defined "rounds" that consist of wearing a leg that defines a nurse outfit like it in a 42nd street finds fetish boutique and getting to know the inmates. <br /> <br /> Allysson is a compulsive nymphomaniac with a morricidality who likes to strip off her shirt and provide the film with some T & A between attacks by Histrionics. Harriet is a young, former mother who had her child die in a stupid accident and now writes on a beaten up old doll, which she also murderously protects; The Seargant is a real Seargeant [and implied a Vietnamese veterinarian] whose negligence led to the death of his platoon and now watches over the approach of an invisible enemy with binoculars from the window. Jennifer is a Phish fan who could not win a ticket to the New Year's Eve show, went mad and likes to cut down nembutols and other barbs when no one is looking, and also has hidden killing moves related to her inability to find a bra; Judge Cameron seems to be a murderous pervert obsessed with his own sense of power and likes to chop up axes; Ms. Callingham is an old poet who serves as a kind of fortune-telling to old witch of MACBETH before the cat gets her tongue; and Danny is a crazy idiot included as a random element in the cast that can not control the plot, and whose antics serve as the actual catalyst for the series of tragedies and murders that end up in this dark, old, spooky house in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> The house itself is a beautiful building with a worn-out d√©cor of the early 70s, characterized by its inconspicuousness, with a fantastic color scheme, which is achieved by subtle ambient lighting. The house consists of a series of corridors and rooms with shiny brown wooden floors, winding, restricted staircases, hidden cupboards and passageways that lead to the various larger areas, and of course the cellar mentioned in the title - which was visited only once, but it right turns out to be doozy! I love the frozen old freezer where Sam keeps his popsicle ice cream, the completely plain outsides that remind me of a summerhouse our family visited every year, forcing us to sweat in the heat: everyone is wearing pearls Embarrassment and appearance weary, and even happy-go-lucky Sam realizes that bad things are going to happen, though he can not understand what that all means, and Rosie H. is too firm in her belief in her job to even suspect What Happens Really And While Ms. Holotik's limitations on an actress may have diminished the effectiveness of her Big Revelation scene, she's a great shouter when hell breaks loose, and Brownrigg took some nice camera shots of her in various suggestive poses or Disclosure stages show you what a pretty woman she is, nothing more than her contracted one n contract. Pity! <br /> <br /> The real show-stealer, however, is Sam. Fans of what I call Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed with the rather shocking finale, and something is moving. As Sam runs to protect his friend and brutally kills all the people in the arms that are within a few seconds of what either suggesting that he was just a common moth before his lobotomy or the movie is CUT. In any case, you are not prepared for the end when you see it for the first time, even though as a viewer you know what the score is, long before everyone else in the movie has put it all together. <br /> <br /> Except for one person: Rhea MacAdams' stormy baffled, old coot Mrs. Callingham [appears to be from the Donald Sutherland Old Woman character from the 1964 Michael Reeves-created Christopher Lee movie CASTLE OF LIVING DEAD Inspire Death by Lap "Spike to the Eye"], which not only foretells the future, but laughs most of the films in the movie amusingly entertaining as they walk in the garden with Mrs. Holotik running like this - <br / > <br /> "It's really nice out here, can you get out, Mrs. Callingham?" Holotik asks what the old woman answers <br /> <br /> "You have to get out." <br /> <br /> Hilarious and one of the things you need to see for yourself. Do not look in the base on at least half a dozen codefree DVD releases from "bargains" from companies like Brentwood Home Video, Diamond Entertainment, VCI and the Platinum Disc Corp. series HORROR CLASSICS; I like Alpha Video's graciously decorated $ 6 release of 2003: <br /> <br /> Dig through these bargains! However, make sure you get one with the 89/90-minute printout included; An older 83-minute version is downright confusing because of some embellishments, and you really have to see the end credits as the goal to bring this sick, twisted and surprisingly entertaining yarn to an end. <br /> <br /> masterpiece? Maybe not compared to THE EXORCIST or ROSEMARY'S BABY, but it's a very unique American horror movie and a true classic from the drive-in movie theater that deserves to be rediscovered by anyone looking for something more than a little brain juice and not a penny more than absolutely necessary. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 from ****
