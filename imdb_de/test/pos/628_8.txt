The plot is somewhat original and all the actors did their job pretty well. There is also a lot of comic relief. Some things are not very useful (like the first "Chase" scene, why would not the heroine hide somewhere and wait for the bad guys to go away?). The Russians actually speak Russian without accent, but the cars are extremely weird, with models that look like 50 years, so the place seems to be out of time. All in all, if you like thrillers, you probably will like them too.
