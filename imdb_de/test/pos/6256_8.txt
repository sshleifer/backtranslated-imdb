Okay, that was not the best horror movie I've ever seen in my life. Although the budget is lower, it's a pretty decent movie. The monsters are unique and believable. They are even scary in the scenes where they are briefly shown how they devastate this poor family. Although, when you finally see the monsters completely, you really think "WTF!? These little things are after them ?!" The only part that really bothered me is when * sniffing * they killed the kitten! Not the kitten, no, why? Seriously, if you're looking for hardcore violence and gore, this is not the movie for you. Rent The Hills Have Eyes or something in that direction. If you have small children I would not recommend seeing them with you. It would probably give them nightmares about trolls in their room.
