I saw this movie when it aired on Lifetime in 2004. I have not seen him since, but often thought of it. I've left an impression I've been looking for lately. I finally found it and realized that it was only for television. The movie is fabulous - with great writing and acting. William Petersen is perfect as always. This movie left me speechless and in tears. It is a wonderful story of faith, love and compassion. Does anyone know how I can get a copy of this movie for my home? Is that possible with television movies? I would really like to see it again. This is a must in my collection!
