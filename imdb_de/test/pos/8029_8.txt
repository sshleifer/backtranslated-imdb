As soon as I knew Donald Sutherland (Jack Shaw / Henry Fields) appeared in this movie, he immediately told me that this would be a good picture. Most pictures of Sutherland are full of action and excitement, he can play a pretty cruel character and can also be very charming and friendly. In this picture, Jack Shaw did his best to be a good and a bad guy as he trained a naval office to become a spy who would change his entire identity and become a different person overnight. There are many chases and many stuntman situations I do not want to do. This naval officer lived in a quiet community with his wife and was a father, but one would never notice until the film reveals the terrible background he had to withhold from his family and friends. Good spy film and great spectacle of all actors.
