"Do not look in the basement" is so easy to knock on, but the truth is that Brownrigg is one of the real underground stars of Horrors and in my opinion a bit overwhelmed. 'Do not' is his undisputed masterpiece. This terrible psychodrama immediately takes the viewer into such a strange, disconnected, claustrophobic world of sweaty madness. You have no idea what the hell is going on. You manage to feel strangely filthy, just scruffy, because Brownrigg's world is this crazy, unwashed, seedy prison cell of rioting, obsession, and all sorts of mental illness. And he uses his low-budget palette to throw you around like a bad memory. It's just something so beautiful strange about the whole damned thing. In a word, classic ... When you first see 'Do not', you have an idea of ​​the insane psychodrama style that characterizes Brownrigg's other films. In summary, they are really no more esoteric than that. Well, in fact, they are looking for Brownriggs 'Keep My Grave Open'. Crazy Genius Do not accept a replacement.
