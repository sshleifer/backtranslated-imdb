I was "approached" by my flight instructor for this film and now I wonder how damn it was outside for almost five years before I finally discovered it. If you have any love of flying, especially an attachment to the plains of World War II, this is an absolute must, far beyond the miserable "Pearl Harbor" and up there in competition with the famous "Battle of Britain", which filmed more is considered thirty years ago. There are moments when you feel like you're flying a wingman who literally dodges your leader's wraps as you roll on a Me 109 or He 111. <br /> <br /> As a historian, this film deeply touched me Well, it's about the plight of tens of thousands of gallant Poles, Hungarians, Slovaks and Czechs who fled their homelands between 1939 and 1940, to England then fought with the utmost bravery for the survival of Western civilization and then were so boldly abandoned by "us" after the war, when they were arrested by the Communists after their return to their homelands. I stood on the Monte Cassino in Italy and was moved to tears by the cemetery for the Polish troops who stormed this mountain that the British and Americans could not take. I also traveled to Prague (the most beautiful of the cities) and studied their history. I believe their story of abandonment should be a lesson to us today about our obligations to chivalrous allies. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie. If you like flying, you will see this. If you are interested in the plane of World War II, you will definitely see it. Undoubtedly the most brutal, direct, and terribly fast aerial combat scenes ever replicated for the film. And yes, if you are even looking for a touching romance, it also comes in heartbreaking details.
