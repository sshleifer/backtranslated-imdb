Tromeo and Julia (1996) is another jewel in the film archive of Troma Studios. Like The Toxic Avenger, Tromas War, Nuke 'em High, Terror Firmer and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. This movie is an instant troma classic. James Gunn updates Romeo and Juliet with a medieval tragedy and turns them into a modern street punk drama. If you have seen or read the piece until nothing has changed, except it has been "tromatized". <br /> <br /> Lloyd Kaufman adds his own twisted vision to the script and makes it a very entertaining movie. The actors treat the script very well. I was surprised at how well they performed the dialogue, much better than some big-budget Hollywood actors who use a huge budget and expensive sets. I really enjoyed this movie. Lloyd Kaufman does not disappoint, because you know what to expect from his films and other Troma productions. I'd rather see one of his films and be entertained than a boring, expensive movie with spoiled, paid actors, lame scripts, lazy directors, and that dreadful C.G.I. Special effects. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. If you like funny movies with cheesy special effects, outstanding actors and inspired directorial work, then this movie is for you!
