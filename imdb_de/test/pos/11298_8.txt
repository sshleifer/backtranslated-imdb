WONDERBIRD, no doubt an incredibly sophisticated cartoon drawn in a deliciously old way and sensationally old in almost every way, takes place in a kingdom ruled by a mean and vile monarch. Accordingly, the kingdom, or at least what we see, the surroundings of the royal palace, seems to be empty and uninhabited. Some residents there are away from the sun in the withered subway city. <br /> <br /> A piece of advice call it an allegory, call it a parable, do not call it a fable. <br /> <br /> Because IMDb promotes spaciousness and maybe for other reasons I add that this cartoon is the work of the great Paul Grimault.
