This is one of those movies where you have to set aside some obvious flaws (a result of the date and the site of your production) and emphasize the positive. In many ways, this is a really great movie. <br /> <br /> Forgive the parody in the one-line summary, but the biggest drawback of an English speaker like me is the awful subtitles. The print I saw had 1982 Soviet "Film Export" subtitles that consistently used inverse grammar, presumably to convey the impression of 13th-century language. The real effect of this nonsense is making it harder to follow the subtitles, which means you spend less time looking at the pictures. This is a real problem given the film's huge film size. <br /> <br /> Other IMDB Niks have written a lot about the Stalinist propaganda elements of this film (just in case the viewer does not notice them for themselves). They also wrote a lot about the battle on the ice scene, which I think is great. <br /> <br /> The love interest is almost completely lacking in fineness and yet strange ..... almost everything is lacking in charm. But it's good to flinch from time to time. <br /> <br /> I knew the Prokofiev music for this movie long before he saw the movie. The pictures and the music complement each other wonderfully. And it's the pictures that will stay in your memory for a long time. Bergman has clearly learned a lot from these pictures - the imagery of his medieval pieces (eg The Seventh Seal, The Virgin Spring), which build on and enhance Eisenstein's ideas. This film was shot in 1938 in the USSR. In this context, it is a masterpiece, albeit a faulty one. <br /> <br /> For the modern viewer, I suggest you go with the river and enjoy the many delicacies.
