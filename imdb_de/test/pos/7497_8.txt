As I noted earlier this year, this movie is a good movie in my review of Swordfish (written by film writer / director / producer Skip Woods). It's high on my list of thrillers between Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Pulp Fiction and Snatch. Basically, I think this film is for me what Reservoir Dogs was to many people - a cult classic - though I prefer to compare it to Pulp Fiction. I mean, I never really liked Tarantino's first effort, but I liked this thing as much as Pulp Fiction, because it just has everything a classic needs. A great story and good actors. OK, the budget might not be as big as in Godzilla, The Avengers of the Mission to Mars, but it sure is like hell about the living crap of these movies (and many other movies). <br /> <br /> The story of This movie is about a man named Casey (Thomas Jane) who settled in Houston with his wife. Unexpectedly, an old friend comes from him, interfering with his life, revealing his secrets, and basically making his day hell (and a bloody one as well). <br /> <br /> The film is very original and pretty bloody / sexually colored. Based on this first and last quality I can assure you that you also like Swordfish if you like this movie. Of course, he has a much bigger budget and better known faces than this, but is just as well (if not) bloody and not quite as sexually colored). I saw this movie for the second time yesterday and I liked it (again). I mean, all the characters and actors are good, though I have to pay tribute to Thomas Jane and Paulina Porizkova, who were the best actors (and the best characters) in the film. I also have to thank Skip Woods for being so inventive and original. Brutal, sexual, offensive ??? Maybe, but certainly as amusing, and an exciting ride to the end. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
