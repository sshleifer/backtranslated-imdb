Mark Blankfield (from the old late-night TV series "Fridays") plays dr. Daniel Jekyll, a gentle surgeon who invents a powder that makes him a drug-crazed party animal. Of course, this was not his intention, he had higher goals, but he goes with the river. This is actually a pretty stupid movie, but it's also fun. Of course, as soon as the good doctor knows what he's done, he's ashamed of himself, but he's not out to do it all again and walk around Hollywood as a crazy sex machine with ruffled hair and gold chains. There are a few subplots, such as the fiancee of Jekyll, the daughter of the chief doctor of Our Lady of Suffering and Pain, Jekyll's employer. And there's Tim Thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few "real" parts and a penchant for men and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of Howard Hughes and who will make several people rich with a complete set of organs grafts including testes. Yeah, the humor is rude and stupid, and overall the whole thing is pretty tasteless, but if you're not above a quick gutter in the gutter you'll probably like it. Now also available for the first time on DVD! Woohoo! 7 out of 10.
