I flipped through the channels and had to stop and laugh as I came across this movie. In the early '80s it was so clearly about teenagers, and I called my mother "hahaha, turn channel, and the like, the kid looks totally as if daddy were a kid." <br /> <br /> To. Yes. It turns out that this movie is about my dad and his friends. <br /> <br /> Even if it's not a casual kid based on my dad's childhood, I'd say you watch this movie! <br /> <br /> It's just ... bizarre, to say the least, the apathy that was instilled in teens back then. This is a good "human interest" and shows some strange sides of the psyche.
