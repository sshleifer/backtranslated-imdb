This was a very energetic and well played show. I saw it in 98 and my friends and I still joke about it. Every time I watch it is always as funny as the first one. I also love the way everyone can handle it in their own way. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of John's own scripts and productions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I can not find it for sale anywhere and I have been looking for quite a bit. If anyone knows a website or a business that I can relate to, I would appreciate it, as I also look for his other live performances. Please send me a message if one of you has information on the subject. Many Thanks.
