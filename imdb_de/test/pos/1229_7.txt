In my opinion, directing, editing, lighting and acting (minus Franco) were very good. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this movie. I did not expect much in terms of camera angle, sound, etc., but in those areas, the movie was not bad at all. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I was frustrated with both characters because I wanted so much that these two characters reach each other. And I felt that the character of Travis (Franco) in the end was not really influenced or changed after Terri committed suicide. Although this is probably due to the absence or inability of James Franco to express emotions (of any kind) in this film very well. I've seen some of Franco's other films, and for me he just can not make it when a scene demands real emotion or facial expressions. The only positive thing he brings to the movie is the possibility that more people see this movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Rachel Miner's portrayal of Terri was well done and she faces a bright future. I really could see and feel the sadness and emptiness in her character, and I felt for her. I only wish I could have seen more of Terri's life before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was good for a short film but in the end you want more. I only wish it could take a little longer if the characters evolved a bit more. Nevertheless, I hope to see more films by the director and crew in the future. :)
