Well, I must say, this movie was probably the funniest movie I've seen all year. And I do not mean that well. This is probably the most wretched movie I've seen in a long time, and that makes it so funny. You can say that these people are really trying to act, but unfortunately they do not do such a good job for them and even make it sound that even lines that are delivered in a supposedly serious tone sound really funny. Aaron Carter essentially plays a character that is quite similar in real life, yet he manages to make the character uncomfortable and not at all realistic. This movie is one of those movies where everything that should be serious is really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and stupid that you have to laugh because you know how much they do it to attempt. This movie is so bad, actually good. I would definitely recommend it if you feel like having a good laugh.
