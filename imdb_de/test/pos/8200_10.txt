I read some rumors about the court scenes. These people betray their ignorance. This production took an astonishingly long time to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story occurred. Courtly manners are something few people outside the court ever see. While the drama is highly stylized, it is actually as close as possible to the behavior of individuals in their respective stations, as the director might. The actor's facial expressions are a miracle, especially the double Marquis Changxin and the mother of the king. There are, of course, reflections of both Greek and Shakespear tragedy in the relationship between the king, his parents, and his love. The juxtaposition of the king, which changes from the good to the bad, and the assassin from bad to good, gives much reason to think about the development of the nature of an individual. This film would think a lot in a university course on the humanities. <br /> <br /> At the same time, he almost plunges into an unstoppable solution in the slowest scenes. One suspects the participation of large parts of the troop movements, which were pretty great. In comparison, the scenes from "The Lord of the Rings" fade. Few directors have the ability to literally put thousands of people on the battlefield just for the sake of the arts. I remember a scene where at least 30,000 soldiers are moving across a huge plain. The logistics for such a shot would have been amazing. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but I can not recommend this movie enough.
