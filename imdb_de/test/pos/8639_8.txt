Wow, what a funny movie. It's a David Lynch movie, so it's no surprise that it's weird. <br /> <br /> I urge everyone to explain everything in this movie. I can not finish. After some research after my second visit to this film, I know most of the story, but at first glance and without the help of other reviewers or outside help, it's difficult to understand things. So if you are in this boat and confused, do not feel bad. That is normal. Let me just say, the key to the film is Naomi Watts' character. <br /> <br /> In any case, I find the film fascinating. I love the beautiful look and rich colors and find every character in the movie really different and fun to watch. The camera work is excellent and the music is scary, like "Blue Velvet" by Lynch. There are also some good sound effects that help some of the dramatic scenes. All in all it is very good. <br /> <br /> Like Lynch's television series "Twin Peaks," this was a movie in which the end was put together since Lynch thought this movie would be a long, drawn-out TV series. When that did not happen, he used that ending at the last minute. This may be partly responsible for the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations about characters that we saw earlier in the movie, but which mysteriously disappear. <br /> <br /> The theme of the story is supposedly a negative comment on Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being actors are destroyed. <br /> <br /> Both Watts and the other lead actress, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting in their celebrated lesbian sex scene. Both women were chameleons, sometimes looking average and breathtaking at other times. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie the second time I watched it more than the first one. It's not just a curiosity. It's a very fascinating movie ... just do not feel stupid if you can not understand a few things.
