I grew up outside of Naila Germany (where they landed), every detail of the movie was 100% authentic, the power lines they flew over, the curious neighbors, the grandmother telling the kids that they are not West German TV This film brings back a lot of good memories of the Europeans, a great production by Disney ... In the same movie, Klaus Lowitsch and Gunter Meisner used their own voices to translate the English version into German in the German version Also, use Cookoo Birds, a bird native to Germany, as background noise to let you know that you are in Germany. I showed this step to many of my German relatives and they really really liked this movie a prototype balloon that they had to give up because the materials used were too porous and the other 2 balloons they used to escape. The burner problem was solved when the propane gas cylinders were turned upside down.)
