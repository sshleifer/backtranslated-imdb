This movie is a funny little private detective story as if it was not done anymore. It's all there: Tom Conway is the polite detective called The Falcon, Goldie Locke (what's a name) is his fickle hobie buddy, Louisa Braganza is the girl in distress, and of course there's the girl, the professor with the secret Formula, the villain who wants the formula, and the police inspector who stands behind the hawk. There is a murder, and the hawk gets involved. The scenery consists of night clubs, expensive hotel rooms, a luxury train, the suburbs and beautiful cars. Take a look at this little gem as you watch it go on the afternoon television!
