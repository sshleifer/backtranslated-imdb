A MUST SEE Documentation ------ This film had so many things to watch out for. It was a great documentary of a lawsuit against a 15-year-old black boy named Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police took statements of the man who killed his wife from the husband of the dead woman. The husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with the statements of the police the young man wore. The police do little to solve the crime. Brenton's lawyer Patrick McGuinness is meticulous when he receives information to help his client. He tells viewers what he thinks and what strategy he will follow in the police to show their incomplete investigations and beatings against his young client to confess. The camera goes with McGuinness to where Brenton was interviewed. McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how the sound is monitored. He questions a policeman on the stand and asks what Brenton belonged to one of the investigators, and he challenges her own words. McGuinness is investigating with Ann Finnell any place the police should have gone to, and the things they should have done but did not do. The film shows the Butlers as a loving Christian family, believing in their son's innocence and believing that God will make Brenton free. They visit him in prison and pray there with him to encourage him. There are scenes of group prayer for Brenton, the lawyers, the judge and all involved in this case. I am a white man and was surprised to see black people in high police positions treating other blacks. It was very disappointing to see black and white policemen holding together when they thought they had their husband. The police have a tough job and I think most of them are honorable, not like the ones in this movie. I think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the justice system, including judges, police and lawyers, and even potential jurors to watch and learn from this film.
