This movie is good for entertainment purposes but historically not reliable. If you are looking for a movie and think to yourself, "Oh, I want to know more about Custer's life and latest status," do not hire "They died with their boots." However, if you want to see a movie to enjoy an older western movie with some romance and just a good story, this is a fun movie to watch. The story The first day begins with Custers (Errol Flynn) at West Point. Everyone loves their charming personality, which enables them to get along with almost anything. The film follows his career from West Point and its many battles, including its fight in the Civil War. The film ends with his last stand at Little Big Horn. Between the fight scenes he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland). <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant but polite George Armstrong Custer. Olivia De Havilland plays the cute, sweet Libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby meet for the first time. Her chemistry on screen let her believe in her romance. The drama in general was impressive, especially the comic (albeit stereotypical) role of Callie, played by Hattie McDaniel. Your character will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The heroic war music brought out the excitement of the fight scenes. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. The script was at times trite, though the movie was still fun. The portrayal of the director of Custer was a hero, and history shows that this is controversial. Some will see this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will see this movie and learn to hate it. <br /> <br /> I give him a thumbs up for this 1942 western movie.
