This is a wonderfully grainy drama detailing the various sides of the international heroin drug trafficking - from the hills of northern Pakistan, where the tacit cultivation of opium poppy occurs on a large scale; the jet-setting "Euro-Trash" in Germany and England, which arranges the import of processed heroin into several kilograms of smuggling consignments; for the end users who have entered the web of addiction and the crime required to support their growing habit; and finally, all levels of international corruption and hypocrisy of the government in the context of police efforts to control the "drug problem" - this drama is presented with a wide range of detailed, well-rounded characters, a fully developed plot and excellent character and shooting. <br /> <br /> This puts Hollywood epics like "The French Connection" in their place! <br /> <br /> Traffic is a deeply thought-provoking and exciting tale of modern drug espionage and the international efforts of many people to eradicate it. <br /> <br /> Unlike many "drug dudes" that focus on drugs, Traffik focuses heavily on exposing the societal * reasons * that people are slipping into drug addiction. One of the characters says: "... until we as a society construct a world that people want to participate in instead of escaping, we will not be able to stop people from taking drugs ... "<br /> <br /> This is a fascinating and compelling drama. I highly recommend it!
