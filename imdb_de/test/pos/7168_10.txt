My first Mamin movie, I saw him a long time ago at the IFC and loved him. It seemed absolutely artistic, original, funny and hilarious. No moment in the movie has failed me or bored me, and I laughed a lot or had a smile on my face. I mean, this movie is really funny. But here's the catch: it's also very artistic and creative - if you do not know Yuri Mamin (probably, unfortunately, because so many of his GREAT movies are not available here), he has a very original style like no other, and for me This is not even my favorite movie (currently it's the madman ("Saideburns / Bakenbardy").) And as a Russian, I have to say that this movie is great because you really see what the Russians are like, and that's possible because of that For me, a real Russian movie is NOT a foreign movie trying to be American or appeal: Mamin was not sold out (not even since Gorko (1998) was so good, if not better. This is a Russian style that is out If you liked this movie, you have a very high chance of loving the other films of Mamin, in fact I like some of them. I think this is the most accessible movie. A similar film is Fountain, which took place six years ago during the perestroika, starring the same actor and more of Mamin's regulars, whom you will recognize from Window to Paris; This has a supernatural twist in the end, but is usually a realistic, great comedy. Viva Mamin, hopefully Criterion will one day put together all his films, he is still working and his catalog is so great! Watch one of his films if you can.
