I know Gerrit. He currently lives in the USA. This film is based on events in the life of Gerrit and Celeste Wolfaardt. It is a remarkable story. It inspired me to read "Cry, Beloved Country". The movie is well produced. The music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashbacks. They learn the stories of a white racist South African (Gerrit) and a black South African (Moses). Their lives overlap violently. The end is not typical Hollywood - it's unusually realistic and ends with a note that encourages you to think about the characters and the themes. See photos of Gerrit in real life.
