This movie was so good! It was funny! There are so many jokes that you can watch the movie again and again and never get tired. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were great as Pete Hogwallop and Delmar! I love these guys! I also love the adventures that they made. I definitely recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Also the music in this movie is terrific! I love to sing along with all the songs!
