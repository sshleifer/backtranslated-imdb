For those who have access to the BBC or CBC, this has proven to be spectacular. Like Battlestar Gallactica, this is a show that has been rebuilt from scratch. But in the case of Dr. Who saved the best parts? I can not believe I say that, but ... that's by far the best Dr. Who. This has none of the cheap production values ​​and sometimes the slow plotting of the old show. The spectacle is pretty good and there is a sense of continuity and history. The new doctor has easily grown into the big Tom Baker, and the author (former QAF lead) seems to bring even the smaller characters to life. But this should be on every sci-fi geeks list. I just do not know why it did not find its way here.
