Loved today's show !!! It was a variety and not just cooking (which would have been great). Very inspiring and captivating, the viewer always looks around the corner to see what's next. She is as down to earth and as personal as you get, like one of us who made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests who are friends make for a nice surprise. I really liked the "first" theme, and the audience was also invited to play along. I have to admit that I was shocked to see her entering the clock for a few things, but she did, and I'll just write down those recipes. Time saving in the kitchen means more time for the family. Those who have not yet set themselves learn which channel and what time they have. I assure you that you will not be disappointed.
