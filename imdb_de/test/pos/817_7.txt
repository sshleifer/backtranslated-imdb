I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He introduced it as crazy awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation it was HILARIOUS. I can see how it would be harmful to some viewers, and the theme is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the movie where I had to laugh so much that I thought I was going to pee. They only come in half, but if they do, oh god ... you will die. Oh and Jim Brown is brilliant. He's not much in the movie, but when he's there, you know whose movie he is. Of course, the best line in the movie (and the funniest) is his; You will know when you hear it.
