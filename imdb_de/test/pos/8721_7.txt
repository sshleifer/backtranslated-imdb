Apart from the disco scenes that characterize the swinging sixties (especially when everyone is dancing to instrumental versions of Monkee's hits), I'm surprised at how well this easy farce holds 37 years later, but thanks to the airy execution of their delusion, that's indeed the case , based plot and the sharp interplay of the three leads. Directed by legendary stage-to-screen expert Gene Saks in 1969, this 1969 comedy by Julian Winston, a successful Manhattan dentist and confirmed bachelor pretending to be married, has a long-term commitment with his one-year-old boy To avoid girlfriend. Toni In response to Toni's half-hearted suicide attempt, Julian agrees to marry her, but Toni initially insists on meeting his wife to relieve her conscience. Step into Julian's devout nurse Stephanie to play the woman, and the inevitable complications are the result when white lies become huge pirates that lead to supposed couplings and disconnections. As Julian plays Walter Waltau a skilful Walter Matthau deceptive dentist in his typical sardonic way, but he lets his two female co-stars run away with the picture. On her big screen debut, 24-year-old Goldie Hawn still retains her gigantic "Laugh-In" persona, but as Toni offers unexpected wit and depth. She and Matthau have a great, informal chemistry in their scenes together. Screen legend Ingrid Bergman, who is still royally peaceful at 54, obviously has a ball playing Stephanie at first strong and quick-witted, but has blossomed into a liberated spirit throughout the story. I especially like how easy she looks after her nocturnal game. There's nice supporting work from Rick Lenz as Tony's bohemian neighbor Igor and Jack Weston as Julian's smarmy actor-buddy Harvey. Billy Wilder's longtime collaborator, I.A.L. Diamond delivers the sparkling script and opens Saks, who is not the most cinematic director, the story beyond its stage-like origins. Apart from a few trailers, there are no noteworthy extras with the DVD.
