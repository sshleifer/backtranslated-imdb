Beautiful, charming, extremely versatile and talented, Irene Dunne is one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses in American cinema. In 21 years she illuminates - as in all her films - the canvas with a natural but glamorous presence. It is both authentic and human AND a charismatic, inspiring model. This role is the quintessence of Irene Dunne, full of pathos, wit and a bit of mischief. I love all her movies, and this movie was a fantastic rediscovery for me when TCM aired it last night. I hope they will not wait for years to be aired again. <br /> <br /> Likewise, Charles Coburn is one of the greatest character actors in the entire American film world. Although he often portrays variations of the same theme, I never tire of watching his soft-hearted Curmudgeons. Here, his character is the perfect foil for Irene Dunne, and he's perfectly portrayed by Coburn. Your conflicts in this movie are absolutely fantastic. They never miss a beat. In addition, they depict the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of Irene Dunne's husband, presented by Alexander Knox. <br /> <br /> I'm not so familiar with Knox's work. He was recognizable, but that was all. However, with Dunne and Coburn occupied, he asserts himself. He delivers a fine, differentiated performance. His character has noble motives that are made accessible to us through Knox's performance and are never drawn over us like a holy grail. He is noble but conflicting and doubts his ability to successfully complete OCS. His handling of Dunne is always convincing. Dunne supports him without being a syrup or becoming a martyr. Her scenes are very well done. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a fantastic snapshot and milieu that is not portrayed in other films. I can not remember another film in which America is still fighting World War II, but with the end in sight and the focus on the establishment of the post-war world. Not the usual film from World War II! That in itself is interesting; It is also important for the plot and the message of the film. Unlike other commentators, I thought the speech was okay, but not great. It was delivered very well by Knox, but it was not written as "strictly" as the build up expected me. I've heard better cinematic speeches that address very similar topics. It served its purpose. <br /> <br /> The greater value of the film for me was the portrayal of the life of Dunne and Knox, as it reflected the typical OCS experience. The sense of community of the wives living on Palmetto Terrace seemed absolutely authentic - as was Palmetto Terrace itself, although it was obviously a soundstage. The incredibly short encounters between the wives and their OCS husbands. The efforts of the OCS candidates to master the difficult and complex material they needed to learn. The shabby "socket housing" - obviously hastily built. The tired and worn furniture. The constant and terrible short deadlines - for the return to the base, for learning lessons, for catching trains to subsequent "posts". Tenants are constantly encountering their predecessors and successors in the base housing as they move in and out. Yes, I suppose this was a glimpse of a real World War II experience - dressed in a comedy, but in the core very real. I loved it and I highly recommend it.
