I do not say anything new when I say that "Ray" was great. While I praise this film, I have to mention something that sets it apart from other films. Very rarely a movie is made exclusively by the actors. Ray was simply made by Jamie Foxx. Without the wonderful performance of Jamie Foxx, "Ray" would be just another interesting and informative biography. I always thought Foxx was funny because he had worked with "In Livin 'Color" and "The Jamie Foxx Show", and I also knew that he was talented because he had his own show ("The Jamie Foxx Show"). used to show his musical talents. I never imagined he could play such a role. I do not know much about acting and what they go through to get character or anything like that, but what I've seen from Jamie Foxx has been very impressive. He joined in with this role and let us see Ray Charles instead of an actor portraying Ray Charles. The story of "Ray" was great, but it was created by Jamie Foxx.
