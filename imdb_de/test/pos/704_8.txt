"The Desperadoes" (1943) is a true classic, not because of its history (which is fairly routine) but because of its technical production elements. This was a Western landmark, the largest at the time of its release, and more unique as it was a Columbia production - a lightweight studio with the reputation of bottom feeding. Only Fox's "Jesse James" (also with Randolph Scott) a few years earlier has given this genre somewhere near this elaborate setup. Although dwarfed by "The Searchers" and "High Noon" in a few years, "The Desperadoes" was a groundbreaking effort and a historical treasure. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the economy in the city of Red Valley, Utah, is based on the collection and sale of wild horses to the Union Army. The script is a bit messed up here, with references to the railroad (which was several years away in Utah's future) and Custer's Last Stand (Custer was involved in the fight against Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time), but these are not important elements in the plot. <br /> <br /> Red Valley has a sincere sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and several citizens are corrupt. every time the government pays a herd of horses, their own bank is robbed. The city is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a famous outlaw who is an old friend of Steve. He wants to go straight, especially after he falls in love with the pretty owner of the ornamental mare Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes). Cheyenne's partner "Nitro" Rankin (Guinn's "Big Boy" Williams) is mainly there for comic relief, as are Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the city judge (Raymond Walburn, who has his character on the "Wizard of Oz" ball modeled by Frank Morgan) Schwindler). <br /> <br /> With no chance on their huge budget, Columbia packed this thing with loads of action and every western movie element except Indians and covered wagons. There's the best wild horse ever filmed, a spectacular brawl, an explosive climax, romance and three-stripe technicolor. All this stuff does not necessarily match, but who would have done it in 1943? Unity is a problem, as it is both a serious Western action and a comedy. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was probably the best there was at the time of filming. The interior scenes are solid, but the naturalistic outdoor photography is really impressive. Both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera film the action sequences. <br /> <br /> Scott and Claire Trevor had a top prize, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, which would soon be their biggest star. Director Charles Vidor used the film to present his new wife Keyes (whose portrayal of Scarlett's sister in "Gone With the Wind" had connected the audience with more than a small part of film history). <br /> <br /> The Ford Keyes Dynamics is "The Desperadoes" the most unique and important feature. Instead of opting for the clich√© "love triangle" with Scott and / or Trevor (which will be released soon), the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors. This was probably the best role Keyes has ever got, and she makes the most of it. They play a wild but extremely sexy young woman, who looks great in both leather pants and dresses, and how Kiera Knightley's character rides and fights in "Pirates of the Caribbean." This was revolutionary at the time and coincided in 1942 with the establishment of the WAAC for military service in World War II. <br /> <br /> "The Desperadoes" is a movie that has been well maintained and the print looks new. Unfortunately, there are no special features on the DVD. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
