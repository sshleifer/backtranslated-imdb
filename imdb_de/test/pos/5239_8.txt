I really liked this movie very much. In his first leading role John Wayne plays his main role. Even Wayne can be said to have a real presence, though he would not really become an icon for which he is known until Stagecoach, nine years later, in 1939. It's about settlers from all over the country in the new West to colonize him. Wayne's character Breck Coleman joins in, but for personal reasons. Most of the leading actors were stage actors and had never made a movie before, which makes this movie even more amazing. They've managed to create believable, distinctive characters, and there's a weird mix here. A year later, Jimarron came out and had a very similar story, though I did not like it so much. For me, The Big Trail is a strong 8/10.
