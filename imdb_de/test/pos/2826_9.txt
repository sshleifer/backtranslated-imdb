Okay, where should I start? Did you know that the part of the lead robots was offered to the famous pantomime team Shields and Arnez? I do not bet. But they refused and complained about putting on the robots. Then they disappeared into darkness. Well, this movie has everything. A crazy killer robot who thinks he's dirty, Harry. Many cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first romantic robot comedy. Of course, only a few films are perfect and there are some character problems. But there are very small and can be overlooked. I think couples will enjoy this movie and want to see it over and over again. 9 STARS.
