Dashing Errol Flynn brings his usual drama into this historically flawed, but entertaining movie from the life of George Armstrong Custer. The dashing, cheerful Flynn credits Custer from his time in West Point as a reckless, headstrong cadet through the Civil War years in an exceedingly generous and partisan interpretation of the story, and finally as a nonpareil-Indian fighter whose fault at the Little Big Horn is apologetically Custer's victim Commands as a means to expose the corruption of government officials and post-dealers, as well as a protest against the unfair treatment of the Plains Indians. Olivia de Havilland, Flynn's co-star in several other films, scores as a devotee, revering Libby Bacon, and Anthony Quinn sees the role as the wild Sioux boss Crazy Horse. The fight scenes of the film are excellent. The Civil War battles are short and depicted as multiple vignettes in which Custer, seemingly supported by only a handful of soldiers, subdues the Confederate army. Custer's latest fight against the Indians is a great spectacle, a wild clash between red and white men, with no quarter given in a wild mix of military power between determined fighting men. Good direction, cinematography, casting and wonderful music by Max Steiner make this film a Hollywood classic.
