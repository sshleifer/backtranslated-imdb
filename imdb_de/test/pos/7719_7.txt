My commentary is mainly a commentary on the first commentator (the extra to the movie) and his unfortunate assessment of the movie. I think his perspective shows why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. The movie was sweet, the acting sufficient, the experience of seeing it was a nice distraction from a busy week. It was not "The Hours" (drama) or "The Matrix" (special effects) or even "The Color Purple" (direction). Most movies will not be. But it was not the crap that "vinny ..." would make you believe. Sorry guy, only my 2 cents. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, he ended up being very gay and confirmed (+ # 1). It showed a world full of diversified and less perfect people - you know just like ours (+ # 2)! It opened a door to a culture without excluding other cultures (+ # 3). And I liked the music (+ # 4).
