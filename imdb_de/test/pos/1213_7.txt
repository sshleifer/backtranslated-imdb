Wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining, if not entirely successful Wrestlemania. The ultimate challenge is of course worth the price, but like many early Mania, there is too much filler. The crowd bangs for almost everything, and as always, the reliable team of Gorilla & The Body gives us. Having a face-to-face match as the main event for a Wrestlemania was absolutely unknown at the time, it just made things much more exciting. <br /> <br /> matches. <br /> <br /> Koko B. Ware / W Frankie vs. "The Model" Rick Martel. For a 3-minute match this is as good as it gets. I wish it was a bit longer, but what I got was damn good. Martel wins with the Boston Crab. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Tag Team Championship. Demolition against colossal connection | C | / W Bobby Heean. Giant pop for demolition. The game itself is pretty boring, I often had problems paying attention to myself. Andre really did not do much, so it was more like a 2 against 1. There are solid talents involved, and it's a shame they could not produce better. Demolition wins this title as the Pattened maneuver is at the top. The crowd blows the roof for the target. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Earthquake / W Jimmy Hart. Against Hercules I got, what I expected, a boring standard pen that earthquake did its thing. I'm not a fan either, so it did not make me very big. Quake wins with his sit-splash. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Brutus Beefcake against Mr.Pefect / W The Genius. Stunning pop for Bruti. Really good game, unfortunately not enough time to develop further. It really caught my interest and remains one of my favorites on the map. Beefcake wins with a slingshot at the post office, much to the approval of the crowd. <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper vs. Bad News Brown. Giant pop for Piper. No more than a boring brawl that does not know what it wants to be. Some entertaining antics from The Hot Rod, but nothing else. Remarkable for Roddy, who paints himself half black and calls himself "Hot Scott". <br/> 1/5 <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation against the Bolsheviks. Break a record, but nothing else to see here. Harts win with, The Hart Attack. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Barbarian / W Bobby Heenan. Against Tito Santana. Average for the time it got, but still seeing. The crowd was pretty dead for that, except for Heenan's interference. Jessie's hilarious tears over Tito's food are more entertaining than the game itself. Barbarian wins with a wicked-looking, flying clothesline from the top. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed Day Match. Dusty & Sapphire / W Elizabeth. Vs Macho King & Sherri. A big pop for Dusty and an even bigger one for Elizabeth, who looks absolutely stunning, I would like to add. I thought it was ok. It was lively at least, if not great. I'm not a fan of Dusty 'like that. Dusty and Sapphire win when she rolls up Sherri. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> The Orient Express / W Fuji. Against the rockers. Surprisingly, Crowd is pretty anemic. Decent no doubt, but with these guys it should have been better. The constant focus on Fuji somehow negatively affects the match. Express wins by counting when Janetty is nailed with salt. Jim Duggan vs. Dino Bravo / W Earthquake & Jimmy Hart. Duggan, like an idiot, brings out the American flag in Canada. Duggan also has a few goodies for him, but that may be due to Bravo's Canadian heritage. Fuck like-minded people everywhere, I'm not interested in Duggan, but that's why it did not suck. In the end too short to be really important. Duggan wins the duels by beating Bravo in the back. Duggan is splashed for his problems. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Million Dollar Championship. Ted Dibiase | C | / W Virgil. Against Jake Robers / W Damien. Some slow spots, but when all was said and done, I had a good time. Two solid wrestlers gave everything that led to an entertaining match. The crowd gets Ancy noticeable throughout the game by making the wave. Dibiase wins by counting. Jake has the last laugh by giving away some of his money, much to the delight of the crowd. <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Big Bossman vs. Akeem / W Slick. Nice pop for The Bossman. Too routine and too short to really mean anything in the end. Akeem was a gimmick I never liked. Bossman wins with his slam. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Rhythm & Blues segment had failed quite a bit. The crowd was not that enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> Rick Rude / W Bobby Heenan. Against Jimmy Snuka. That was not so bad for a filler match before the main event. If it had time to do more, it would have been excellent. Rude wins with the Rude Awakening. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Title by title. Ultimate Warrior | IC Champ | Against Hulk Hogan | WWF Champion | This is mainly about the atmosphere of the crowd and the reaction of the split mass. Warrior got a pretty decent pop, but in my opinion it was a bit oppressive. Hogan does it all with his. It's one of Wrestlemania's best games in history. With two people who are not really known for their wrestling, they have managed to create an amazing match that has been talked about for ages. I have seen this many times, and my level of respect is rising for everyone, for their effort, considering that I'm not a fan of both. Even die-hard fanatics craving pure wrestling can not laugh at this! Warrior wins with his splash. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Conclusion. Wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry, if nothing special. It's memorable for the main event, location and audience, but it's not the best if you ask me. That being said, I enjoy it, and I recommend it to other wrestling fans. <br /> <br /> 7/10
