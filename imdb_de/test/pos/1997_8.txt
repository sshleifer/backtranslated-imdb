I actually saw the movie several times. And what I want to say is that the only thing that made this movie a high priority was the unbelievable performance of the Burak Altay, absolutely nothing else. Not even the stupid model called Deniz Akkaya and some of those popular names at times in the movie ... Burak is definitely very talented. I saw a few jobs he did and went through. Although it's a horror movie, it does a great job in both comedy and drama. I'll bet most of you have seen Asmali Konak in the movies and the TV show, they would be setting an example ... I'll just say that you should pay more attention to the new works that come from Burak than you see. Keep the good work, a lot of love.
