At the High Falls Film Festival 2002 in Rochester, NY, I got the opportunity to speak with co-creator Rebecca Cammisa. She said that her style is to be completely open and uninhibited in filmmaking, but was very happy to be so severely restricted in the tight quarters of the group home. The narrow corridors and small rooms were expertly recorded with a realism that would have been lost with a controlled and deliberate camera work. Sister Helen herself is a remarkable figure who derives from the tragedy of her own life an unusual combination of caring, tenacity and street prudence. The way the film introduces us to its past is excellent. I spend only a few carefully selected minutes in all areas. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not properly praise this movie. It really is a treasure of cinema and the subject of a treasure of humanity.
