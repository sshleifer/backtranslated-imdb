When I saw this movie at the age of 6, it was in the Erols video section for kids because it was animation. We saw it and it was a different kind of ball game! A very violent story and graphic deaths are very entertaining and captivating, but not for kids. Avoid it for families, my mother almost had a heart attack and ripped the video apart!
