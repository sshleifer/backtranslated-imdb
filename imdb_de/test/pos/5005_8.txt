Talk Show with Spike Feresten is one of the shows that will definitely polarize the audience. Either you like it or not. Personally, I find most of the pieces weird, but there are a few "huh?" Moments <br /> <br /> Basic foods like "Idiot Paparazzi" are always good for a laugh, but my absolute favorite must be the unique "Hollywood Douchebag". "Comedy for Stoners" is the only regular piece that usually makes me confused (which is part of the point!). Spike and his writing team manage to produce fresh comedy again and again, so the show never feels stale. The humor of Feresten is not for everyone, but definitely worth it. <br /> <br /> The masses have spoken! We like this show and want more. Please note that I'm not a friend of Spike Feresten, Talkshow with Spike Feresten employees or Fox Network and affiliates. It's just funny!
