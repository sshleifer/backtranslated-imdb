I think I was recommended this movie by the lady in the store where I hired him! For once she was fully involved! What a great movie! First and foremost, I was convinced that James McAvoy and Romola Garai were Irish and so convincing were their accents. Halfway through the movie, I was absolutely convinced that Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was too! When I saw the peculiarities of the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' form, it would be an understatement to say that I was overwhelmed !!! I can remember all the recognition Dustin Hoffmann received in the 80's for his portrayal of autism in the movie "Rain Man" - frankly (in my opinion, of course!). Steven Robertson's performance / portrait brings Dustin Hoffmann straight out of the water and he deserves recognition as such !! All in all one of the greatest depictions of human friendship / love / relationships ever - and it was done in the UK / Ireland with local actors - put it in your pipe and smoke it in Hollywood!
