I thought that was a very good TV series and I would like to see it continue. In the end it got really interesting and I really want to see where it goes from there. Sometimes we are too fast to kill a series without giving it a chance. I think it takes a chance to continue and I will definitely wait for that. The ocean is one of the places that humans know so little about, and I think that's a mystery to themselves. What awaits us among the waters of the world? It is even said that many thousands of years ago man crawled out of the water or jumped out of the water. Is there a new evolution? Are we going down the food chain or are we fighting for our position?
