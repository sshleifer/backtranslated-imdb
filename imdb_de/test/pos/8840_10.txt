It could not. <br /> <br /> From the editing dialogue to the super special effects, this movie was a joy that you could see everywhere. The immediate sense of the bitterness of the Antarctic, the affinity to the characters that builds up at the grassroots level before the actual action heats up, and the cunning finale make this movie one of the most memorable and entertaining films. > <br /> Against a long list of films that have tried to capture the topic of visitors from another planet, The Thing is at the top of the list and laughing. Who can forget the perfectly coordinated dialogue and the deterring special effects? Special effects that are far more impressive than the computer-generated images we see today. I found that some of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie were the way we were slowly introduced to each member of the crew, and all had character traits. This was not just a senseless horror movie from a bloodbath that came to horror. This movie had a feeling. Emotion. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this movie highly enough. I've never seen anything in this class that comes close to matching the almost perfect game and timing of this cunning polymesmeric cinematic art piece.
