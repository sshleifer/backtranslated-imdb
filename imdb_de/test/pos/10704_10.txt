Unlike the previous poster I liked the celluloid treatment. It looked good and made the movie much more enjoyable to watch. For me, this has not affected the content of the documentary. In fact, I felt that the smoothness of the gaze allowed me to lose so much more in content. The previous poster was fair to compare the style with a commercial from Nike. it definitely looks like this. But for my taste it worked really well (and I'm far from being a fan of Nike commercials). I can not wait to see the next installments of these promising filmmakers.
