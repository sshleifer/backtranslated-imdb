I remember seeing this movie over and over when I was a kid. I loved it. I have not seen it lately, but I'm sure I would enjoy it the same way today. It's a very easy funny movie that's guaranteed to make everyone laugh. The situations with each of the characters were so funny and resourceful! I especially liked those with the girl who was traveling with her mother's ashes (which she picks up after the explosion on the highway), the robbers and the nuns. This cute humor style is very much missed these days. This movie also showed that actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty / Days of the Lives) got off to a good start. I recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video store.
