I saw "Sweeney Todd" on Broadway in 1980. It featured George Hearn, and most of the other performers appeared in the national tourism company, which was recorded in 1982 for television in Los Angeles. Yesterday evening, I saw the new DVD release of the Los Angeles production, although I own the videotape for many years. The production and the performances could hardly have been better, but the age of the original tapes showed, since both the audio and the video quality even on a freshly pressed DVD are below today's standards. Still, I still give 10 out of 10 because of the size of the work and George Hearns and Angella Lansbury's amazingly wonderful performances. Even today, my most memorable reminder of a live music theater performance is Hearn's interpretation of "These are My Friends." "They will drip rubies," brrr.
