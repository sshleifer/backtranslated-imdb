A very positive message for our youth shows this film. Through rugby sport as a means, a high school rugby coach introduces and discovers his players in their behavior and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> acting and directing are good. The rugby recordings are only okay if you know something about rugby or really cool if you do not know much about it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie Every day more Adepts. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a true story taking place in Utah. The trainer featured in this movie has been at the top of the Highlanders for over 30 years (and losing only 3 games every 3 years). <br /> <br /> Have fun!
