This movie was talked about in Fangoria, where I heard about it. He was particularly interesting to me because he was directly transferred to video. I recognized two of the stars on the cover, James Marsden of Disturbing Behavior and Christine Taylor of The Craft. And to my surprise on Valentine's Day, when I searched the horror story to find it on the shelf! I had to pack it immediately. Me and my brother and our friends looked at it and to my surprise it was pretty good, the stories were interesting and for once they were really scary, unlike many other horror movies that have been made lately. I do not understand a part of the plot, but if I look at it again, I bet I'll get it. And, to my surprise, there were other stars I recognized, including one of the girls from My So-Called Life and Jacinda from The Real World. I'm not sure why this movie was only direct to the video. With a little advertising this movie could at least make up for how much money was spent on it. The only problem I have is that I can never see it in widescreen because it was not released in theaters. You should definitely take a chance and hire them. <br /> <br />
