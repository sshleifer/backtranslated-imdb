If you tire of the same repetitive, unintelligent material that the established film industry publishes, you'll enjoy "You Are Alone." It is thoughtful, well received and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Without revealing something that you will not experience in the first few minutes of the movie, this is the story of a young upper-school white high school girl who works as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor. The vast majority of the film takes place in a hotel room in which he has engaged them. Their discussion explores two changing views of prostitution, depression and loneliness. Still, the movie is not depressing. It speaks of dark things, without being depressing. <br /> <br /> As a viewer, your emotions and preconceived opinions are only gently moved. You come out with a lot to think about. I like that in a movie.
