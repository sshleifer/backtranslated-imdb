Exciting, action-packed and interesting film that tells the story of a group of men stationed at a naval base in Italy and their adventures aboard a submarine submarine during the First World War. Tommy and Brick (played by Robert Montgomery and Robert Young) are two friends, and I have to say that they are some very nice officers. A new captain arrives, already known by some as "Dead Pan" Toler (Walter Huston). He is a true believer in following the rules and a "code of honor". Tommy and Brick soon watch an attractive blonde dancing an officer, Tommy insulting the captain - and of course the blonde is the captain's daughter. But Tommy still wins as he and the daughter sneak out of the dance to a street carnival and soon tie in an air raid - unfortunately for them she reveals that she is married. Later, Tommy gets into serious trouble if he does not keep orders to save his buddy. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite entertaining with a gripping storyline that holds my interest and first-class performances of all. A climactic death scene with Sterling Holloway is indeed haunting - the most memorable scene in this movie, I thought. Eugene Palette and Jimmy Durante add a touch of humor by playing some goofballs - Durante's character actually studies as a dentist by mail order and is constantly online with a British man making fun of his nose. Okay - if you are looking for a movie showing a man boxing a kangaroo, this would be the right one.
