Alfred Hitchcock's saboteur is not one of his most respected films; It consists of two much more popular and critically acclaimed images, Suspicion and Shadow Of a Doubt, and is generally considered a lesser effort. I agree that the later film is groundbreaking, bringing Hitchcock completely into the American mainstream for the first time, but Saboteur is at least as vivid on his way as Suspicion; His main flaw is that it's less than charismatic star players, Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane. <br /> <br /> In Saboteur, we sense that Hitchcock is literally finding his way around America, while his main character travels from California to New York to an arsonist whose crime he was charged with. Cummings is very young and very involved here. His boyish (but not immature) fit perfectly with the character he portrays, and seems appropriate since the director, although middle-aged, was about to reinvent himself and become an older, more established star Have thrown things off. Priscilla Lane's spooky heroine, who is not a typical type for the director, was very popular in American films at the time; and she and Cummings provide an openness and a youth that the director needed at this time both in his life and in his work. I can not imagine older, more solid types - Cooper and Stanwyck, for example - doing it better, as they would have carried too much luggage between them. <br /> <br /> As usual In Hitchcock's movies, nothing is as it seems. Where Saboteur differs from its more well-known films is that the audience is involved early in the game. Although Cummings is a blamed arsonist, we know he is innocent. The villains will soon be visible; and the movie depends more on his plot than on his ironies. What joy there is, is accidental and here the master does not disappoint. There is an interesting death Browningish interlude with some circus freaks who help Cummings escaping captivity. In another scene reminiscent of James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein, Cummings spends some time in the cabin of a blind man, who turns out to be Lane's uncle. Did the director perhaps study the most important American films of the past decade? However, these and other unconventional and discursive aspects of the film give it a playfulness and variety that, adding the factor of rather youthful allusions, make the picture look like the work of a younger man still learning his craft. <br /> <br /> The later scenes of the film in New York are more exciting and typical for the director, as the picture becomes more Hitchockian over time. In the end, I find it a satisfying job; and since neither Cummings nor Lane have a dark side as actors, the movie has none. It is deliberately light and I suspect half-experimental; an attempt by Hitchcock to see if he could do the sort of story he had done in England in an American environment. He succeeded admirably. The next logical step: Shadow Of A Doubt, a film in which the main character travels from east to west, with very different values ​​and plans. <br /> <br />
