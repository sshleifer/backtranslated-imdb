This is a classic war movie. One of the best, a festive image festival with flashing lights, dark backgrounds and helicopter blades turning into ceiling fans. A star-studded spectacle of mighty power. Martin Sheen is a mercenary who murders the lost General, a sadistic dictator unimaginably played by the great Marlon Brando. Also included are Robert Duvall as an over-top DI with a penchant for "napalm in the morning" or at least the smell. Dennis Hopper is an astute photojournalist with a look at the war and his leader. In this amazing movie you'll see emerging stars like Laurence Fishburne, Lee Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms and Albert Hall, and also look out for Harrison Ford ... Behind the scenes lens is Francis Ford Coppolla, who may be a movie with perhaps more intensity and drama delivers as the well-known Godfather movies. He emphasizes war in its most basic form, which is mostly something you can not see, you can only feel it as a boat is going upriver, the feeling of war is quite unbearable. The feeling is a rather claustrophobic feeling and causes unusual moods in the audience. Honestly, I did not feel that way in any movie. <br /> <br /> Criticism is hard to find. The biggest weakness of some is that Brando has earned tons of money for a ten-minute roll, which, despite all fairness, is not justified. It was well-earned money, a role that physically restricted him, was a sick man at the time, and a role that he really took on. I can not imagine a better one for the role. And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version, there are some extra points of the great man, and I think Redux makes the movie miles better. <br /> <br /> Final impressions, if you're lucky, the Redux version, then you'll be blessed with an absolutely satisfying movie with cool 49-minute additional material. If not, you will not be disappointed anyway. This movie is up there with the best and deserves great credit and a place as one of the 50 best movies ever made ...
