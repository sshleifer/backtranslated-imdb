A grueling watch, but one of Bergman's best films. It's interesting to compare this to The Hour of the Wolf, as they both have the same main characters as artists (or an artist and his wife) who have found refuge on an island. In the earlier film, mostly inner demons cause the personality of Sydows to break (at least I read it that way), while many circumstances are beyond his control. <br /> <br /> Much has been written about the unsympathetic center of characters, especially from Sydows. For me, there are flashes of a good (albeit faulty) man at the beginning of the film, but he deals badly with adversity. The mistakes will be all that's left if his humanity is gradually undermined by one horror after another. <br /> <br /> Shortly thereafter, I saw A Passion (Ullmann and Sydow on her island) again and was amazed to see many of the same locations. And then there is a dream sequence ...
