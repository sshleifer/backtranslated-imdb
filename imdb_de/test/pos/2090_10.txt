Highly recommended for those who appreciate watching movies. Great spectacle, absolutely surreal, awkward humor, necessary prison, exact representation of the condition of the men. Music is also on site. I think the artist is a "dip", but not sure. The short repetition of the title balance in the DVD menu is well tuned and sounds like Slint.
