If you're a "kid of the eighties" like me, you're probably remembering that 1981 Disney movie - one of Disney's first PG-rated movies - and the screen debut of Michael J. Fox. I remember watching that movie on HBO again and again when I was in middle school, and I've just found a very old copy of it since Disney shut down the movie a few years ago. Needless to say, this is a really funny movie to watch. Five college teams decipher clues in an evening race in Los Angeles and try to be the first to reach the finish line. Watch for the Cameo by Paul Reubens. From the cheesy music to the disco scene with the fat twins, this is an epitome of the fun movie of the 1980s that you'll love.
