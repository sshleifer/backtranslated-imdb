Since we did not see the movie on its commercial debut, we just caught it on DVD. Expecting the worst, "Hitch" proved to be a pleasant experience due to the three people in charge. Thanks to the direction of Andy Tenant, the film has a light tempo, and although it is predictable, the comedy has some winning moments. <br /> <br /> Hitch is sort of a "date co-ordinator" for losers like Albert, who is not exactly what one would think is a piece. Still, Albert is a real guy who would go unnoticed without the professional help of the same women he would like to take out. Kick Hitch in to prepare him for overcoming the obstacles he can not overcome. Although Albert is overweight and can never handle social graces, he conquers us because he is a real opponent, unlike all the phonies that make the rounds in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> The fundamental flaw that most production designers make when preparing venues for Hollywood movies is how far they are from reality. The homes in which they house these characters are so rare that these people can only live in places like these through the magic of the movies. Obviously, most movie people have to do with fantasy, since most city dwellers would kill for fabulous spaces like the ones they show in the movies, not to mention that the same people portrayed in the movie can not afford them <br /> Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way to charm without much to do. The surprise of the film, however, is Kevin James, who as overweight Albert not only cares for us, but also proves he can hold his own in his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva Mendez is the main interest of Hitch. In smaller roles we see Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport and Phillip Bosco. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is a funny movie that you can see thanks to the inspired direction of Andy Tenant.
