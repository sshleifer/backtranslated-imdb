SPOILER NOTHING, BUT SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to add my name to the list of people who feel that other viewers just do not understand it. But nobody mentioned the "s" word as far as I've seen. <br /> <br /> Although I agree that the boy died, I think we can be more specific: he committed suicide. He races down the slope in an old car, shoots from the cliff and ... "flies away". Perhaps the whole account of the form of death is allegory, or perhaps he commits suicide in a car as it is laid out. In any case, he "flies away" (come on, no such hard metaphor). <br /> <br /> Maybe I only have one thing for Tom Hanks, but I was fine with the story. He also collects $ 2 for the WW2 Memorial and you have to love him for it. Oh yes, I loved the movie and found it incredibly moving.
