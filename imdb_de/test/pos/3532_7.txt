I had postponed the purchase of this since the DVD release? First, because I was a little under-challenged by the other two horror titles of this director (SQUIRM [1976] and BLUE SUNSHINE [1977]), but also the fact that the film itself has been somewhat glossed over for the film Media Blasters / Shriek Show 2-Disc Set! I saw it as a rent now and am glad that I did that? not only is it superior to the earlier efforts (at least in this preliminary assessment), but I also found that the film is one of the better imitations of THE Texas CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974). But this factor only reminded me that I need to check another example? Wes Craven's classic THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977), whose 2-Disc R1 Edition was bought by Anchor Bay some time ago, but the Halloween time is getting closer ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie creates an effortlessly disturbing hillbilly atmosphere (it was filmed in the forest and mountainous areas of Oregon)? with many effective frissons throughout the house, but fortunately not too much violence (even if the last of the villains is sent off in a pretty vile manner!) The main young people here (one of them is played by Jack Lemmons son Chris) not as disgusting as the ones we normally encounter in this genre offer. Despite the free enjoyment of the shenanigans, you associate with youthful-oriented flicks that by and large continue to exist today! George Kennedy appears as a sympathetic Ranger; Although he has little to do, his characterization is significantly improved by making him a lover of plants and animals. Notable among the locals is also the well-known character actor Mike Kellin in a beautiful role as a drunkard, who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the narrative. His admonition to the teens, of course, goes unnoticed, but he can lead Kennedy to them later. <br /> <br /> The hermetic family the teens encounter in the woods finally has a skeleton in their closet While one of the girls shows real curiosity in the presence of the intruders, are the others openly hostile to them? and appropriately scary in the case of the stocky and unkempt twins (one of them even tends to maniacal laughter during his temper tantrums); At some point in the narrative, the Ranger even offers an interesting explanation for the nature of their aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior.
