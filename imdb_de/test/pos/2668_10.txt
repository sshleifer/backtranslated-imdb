Reading the user comments in IMDB sometimes makes me despair of the species. For those who want to dismiss the year 2001 as a "boring" space odyssey, they should not be interested in science, technology, philosophy, history or film art. Finally, I understand why most Hollywood productions are so flat and empty - they understand their audience. Fortunately, those who do not appreciate Kubrick's achievement are still a minority. Most viewers can see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that led to the creation of this epic. This is the film that puts science into "science fiction," and its depiction of space travel and the future of humanity is unsurpassed to this day. It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still has not caught up. <br /> <br /> 2001 is primarily a technical film. The reason is slow and full of minutae because the goal was to see the future of technology (and the past in the impressive opening scenes) realistically. The biggest strength of the film lies in the detail. Remember, when the movie was made, man still had not reached the moon ... but there it is in 2001, and that's only the beginning of the journey. Creating such an incredibly detailed vision for the future that 35 years later is still the best we have is inconceivable - I still can not figure out how some of the footage was taken. The film's only notable flaw was the optimism that predicted humanity's technological (and social) development. It is our shame that 2001 did not look like the movie 2001, not Kubricks. <br /> <br /> Apart from the incredible special effects, the camera work and the stage design Kubrick also offers the audience a lot of food thought about what it means to be human and where the human race goes. Yes, the end is weird and difficult to understand - but that is the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have started to imagine it, now it's up to the audience to keep going. There is no decent resolution, no final point, because then the public could stop thinking about the last part. I know that most viewers seem to want this today, but Kubrick will not make us so reckless. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see that this movie is in the top 100 of IMDB movies. and just wish it was higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the best filmmakers in the world and his best performance in 2001. 10/10.
