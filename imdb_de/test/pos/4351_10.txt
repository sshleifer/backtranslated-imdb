I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about a former Vietnam prisoner of war in Laos who fled, but I did not know much else. In fact, I did not expect too much. Oh, what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what makes this movie different from other biography doctors is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life, which he grew up in Germany during the Second World War, and the hardships. We are with him in the same small town where he describes his family, his inspirations and struggles. We follow him to America and his way to fulfill his dream of the pilot. Later, Dieter describes his story of arrest, escape and survival in the Laotian jungle. We are back with him in this jungle as he details and imitates his imprisonment and his path to freedom. We see the same primitive huts, villagers and forms of incarceration that he has dealt with and that have not changed for 30 years. We see the dense jungle, the mountain terrain and the rivers that Dieter faced during his escape. It helps us to understand his emotions, his pain and his suffering. I enjoyed the man, the story and the style. Well done!
