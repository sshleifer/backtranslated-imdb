I think that anyone stupid enough to be a wax figure just to go to a football game or not "leave" their car deserves what happens to them. <br /> <br / The guy, Wade, who "went to a barber shop and asked for the He-Man haircut," was not my type, but there's this really cute scene where he has his eyebrows and waxed his facial hair. This is a bit too maintenance intensive for me. <br /> <br /> Also funny, but not my type is the fat guy in big sunglasses who looks "like Elton John only Gayer", but the whole plan is nowhere to go! <br /> <br /> Blake was hot, I could see him with him if he was not facing his girlfriend, who is a fake Paris Hilton in a bad wig (no chihuahua in her purse, but that would have done it. ) was really valuable). I do not think girls who look like that are going to football matches anyway. Nick, the car thief, is the sexiest! One of the best things is where a football lands next to him, and instead of throwing it back, he chews his cigarette and burns the football. See, that's exactly the guy he is. He has a sister who looks dumb in borrowing his wife's white bat. Her bra straps show up for 1/2 of the movie! <br /> <br /> Mostly you just want to grow your legs and do not go to football matches after seeing this.
