After years of interested in Akhenaten, I was surprised to hear about this film through E-Bay and bought a copy for 99p on DVD. I enjoyed the movie, the twists and turns in the plot and the fact that the file is mainly the main character Sinuhe, which is more of a "family saga" than an action movie. The costumes and attention to detail were remarkable for their time (1955). The rear projection during the carriage ride now looks awkward. My main interest is the character of Akhenaten and his monotheistic religion. In this film, he was portrayed as "Jesus," as in his refusal to go to war with the Hittites, even though they invaded Egypt, and in his closing speech on the futility of materiality and political power. First, a connection is made between Sinuhe, who was driven in a reed basket on the Nile, and the Old Testament Moses. However, this connection is not undoubtedly explored in a new film in which a mose-like character carries Akhenaton's monotheistic religion all over the world if such a film ever becomes politically possible. It is generally accepted that we women were stupid creatures when women are worried, but the relationship or the lack of a relationship between Sinuhe and Merit, the character played by Jean Simmons, is difficult to accept. And that Sinuhe, a trained physician, was so excited by Nefer, the Babylonian "Femme Fatal", that he gave the house to his adoptive parents, and Tomb is not really credible, not even that his parents even have a grave. In real life Nefer (Nefertitti) was the wife of Akhenaten. And although Horemheb actually became a pharaoh, it was after some others, including Tutankhamen, who was the son of Akhenaten. But of course this is just a joke, and the movie is fun, and it's about Akhenaten and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus. Perhaps after the book "The De Vinci Code" and the movie, this film will be redone with the central mystery that is the foundation of our current monotheism! I am looking forward to such a film, there are already numerous books on this topic.
