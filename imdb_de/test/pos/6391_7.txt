On a routine mission to Iraq, a group of delta soldiers pulled out a computer hard drive from an Alqueda training camp, where the site of weapons specialist Dr. Walsh is described. After Dr. Having witnessed the completion of his secret weapons development program, Walsh finds an alternative source of finance and builds a new research facility deep in the notorious Belzan forest in Chechnya, where he develops weapons and sells them to Chechen rebels. The Deltas team is sent on a Black Ops mission to get the doctor and his technology before the Russians find him and his lab. What the Delta team will soon find out is that the latest weapons from the doctors are a herd of large carnivorous bats that have been genetically modified to develop a taste for human flesh. I found this movie much better than I expected. There is a lot of action and a lot of blood. It is more or less what you would expect from a creature function. The spectacle is not great, but it is passable. I have certainly seen worse. Overall, it's a fun movie for who he is. A good popcorn movie.
