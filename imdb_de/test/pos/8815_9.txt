This movie was hilarious. It had a weird view of the British club scene, which, if you really look at it, is a funny thing. The characters in this film were so realistic to those of us who saw it here at home that it felt like they were preparing a movie about ourselves, preparing scenes; the scene "Get me a real doctor"; the white background scene shows each character in a total state in which he was destroyed and ends with the infamous line, "What did I say?" and the comedown sunup scenes. I experienced these moments myself and laughed hysterically at my own ridiculous behavior. <br /> <br /> I can not give this movie a 10 because it does not match Groove, which I thought was not there for the world, but it certainly has its moments. The staging and the camera work are outstanding, the special effects are worth mentioning, and the acting is fantastic. <br /> <br /> After waiting a long time to see this movie, I am pleased to say that I was not disappointed. I hope to see more of the author / director in the future.
