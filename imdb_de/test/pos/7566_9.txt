Someone definitely has it for The Wind and I can not believe that what I saw on the screen has much to do with it. This is a better and more solid movie than most independent artists I see all year round. The cinematography shows a real love and mastery of the craft and the casting was good. I would like to see more of these people, especially Zeke Rippy. <br /> <br /> As for the story and the script, I am not so sure that the negative comments were written before this post with the intention of informing someone else about the movie. The lengthy, nit picky bashing posts, which have taken hours to complete and are the only comment the reviewer ever left for a movie on this site, are obviously libel against the producers of the film. I do not know the insider story, but she would probably make a good movie. What I know from this business world is that productions that make everyone happy are usually terrible, and if the filmmaker has the courage, drive, and common sense to "kill" the babies, someone always ends up injured Feelings. This is also part of the business and one of the best learning tools for those who really want to do it in the film business. Of course, the failures have nothing better to do than sit at home and write false reviews on the internet, as a sort of vendetta against those who have made them clumsy (read: were honest and honest with them). And that's my best guess to explain the unpleasant, unpleasant reviews. Inasmuch as there is a grain of truth behind everything, there is one point to be said, but these exaggerations of grains are so exaggerated that they obviously become fictitious. <br /> <br /> It's not a Slasher bloodbath If you're looking for it, it's more like the psychological suspense thriller that's usually not appreciated by the lowest common denominators. The best way to see this movie is to try to destroy all pre-made ideas, bring them in and unfold. Seriously, characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people do and what they say, I do not think you can conclude that these characters were poorly developed. Maybe poorly understood. <br /> <br /> Overall, I agree that this is a well-made, addictive movie. Maybe I would not have given him a 9 under normal circumstances, but the severe negative comments have actually drawn me to the picture (I have a secret love for really bad cinema). For me, the ratings below 5 should be reserved for the shitty, incompetent, poorly played and stupidly written movies. None of this applies here - it is high quality filmmaking with real talent. I gave him Nine to tip the scales back in the right direction. Take a look at the movie and tell me I'm wrong.
