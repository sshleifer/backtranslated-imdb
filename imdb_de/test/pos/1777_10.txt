It would be great to start a discussion on this medium-length film with a short story about the hypocrisy of the people of Hollywood. In 1988, Chuck Norris saw this film at the Cannes International Film Festival. He made a stupid remark by uttering these pointless utterances. The killing pictured in Decalogue 5 is far more effective than killings filmed in his Hollywood movies with him as a strong action star. He spoke of an innocent taxi driver whose face in Kieslowski's film is cruelly disfigured by a ruthless psychopath who brutally disfigured him with a large stone. There should be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a decent society. This is why Chuck Norris' statement appears as a cruel joke that defends violent means in a society that is becoming increasingly restive. An honest reviewer would make no mistake if he / she states that Kieslowski's film "Decalogue: Decalogue, Piec (# 1.5)" has universal connotations. Events depicted in Decalogue 5 can occur in all parts of the world. The best lesson that Kielowski gives us is the levels of violence that are acceptable in a just society. This is why the brutal killing of an innocent taxi driver is capable of a sense of dislike in us. We would not feel the same hatred of murder depression when appearing in films with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, and Jean Claude Van Damme, as they seem far too artificial. One can easily understand the special effects and the modern studio techniques can charm only toddlers, but have no sense for serious film lovers. Kieslowski is also committed to the helplessness of the people to save people from the clutches of death and misery. This is particularly interesting as strict laws and capital have been proven over and over again. Punishments could not prevent murder.
