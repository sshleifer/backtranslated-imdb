one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> * We are far from finished * and Shylock is not only getting his pound of meat or the 3,000 or the 6,000 or the 36,000 (each of the 6 parts was a ducat) ducats in one thing In minutes he is ruined by having to give up all his possessions. and his daughter has been abandoning him for a long time. Revenge is a dish that is best served cold. However, Shylock's revenge attempt fails completely. <br /> <br /> I suspect this piece was and is popular because it fulfills the desire for justice. But the harsh reality is that the world is entangled in injustice and most of it is. a few big names are thrown into jail, sme gear punks lose their lawn to the "good guys", but in fact it is mostly the opposite way. <br /> <br /> but not in this game. The long howl of racism and anti-Semitism forgets that it could well have been another socially displaced group gaining control. It's just that the money lenders of the time were Jews and therefore the need for history pushes Shylock, the Jew, into the role of villain. <br /> <br /> Merchant of Venice is my third favorite work by Shakespeare, with 1 and 2 being Hamlet and Macbeth. This production offers an excellent treatment of the moral of the story. Alone the scenes with the volunteers are worth seeing. also the awkwardness of the new husbands squirming and minimizing the fact that they slipped the rings so easily that they had vowed to keep forever. In real life, this trick is the one thing spouses use to remind their better half that pledge MUST mean something and not be frivolous. This piece has a much deeper meaning than just the comedy / drama. It's about loyalty, commitment and love. <br /> <br /> is always worthwhile.
