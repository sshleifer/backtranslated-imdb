Surely the best Three Stooges shorts with shemp, "Brideless Groom", is as good as any of the trio's best shorts with Curly. Memorable stooge moments abound. The opening with 'Professor' Shemp, who teaches the homey, untalented and lascivious Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green) voice to wince her appalling vocal notes and fight her progress, is a prime example of Shemp Howard at his best. Many regarded him as the most funniest of the Stooges, of course. <br /> <br /> Later, when Moe and Larry try to help him find a wife (and claim $ 500,000), Shemp thinks he cut off his head when his mirror is turned backwards. He fixes the mirror and shouts with relief: "There I am and pretty as a picture!" "Yes," Moe replies quickly, trying to loosen his pants, "from an APE!" <br /> <br /> The best scene (and maybe Shemp's best with the trio) comes in calling an attractive young Miss Hopkins (Christine McIntyre). Mingling him with the long-lost "Cousin Basil", she suffocates him with hugs and kisses (resulting in a weird piece between Moe and Larry in the hallway), without being able to explain his true identity to him. Suddenly the GENUINE calls Cousin Basil and she goes insane, hits him again and again, accusing him, "a poor helpless' defenseless woman!" This last line is delivered as she pokes him in the jaw (with a real punch, according to Shemp and the crewmembers) and beats him through the door and into the hall in a perfectly performed gag. "What happened, boy?" Ask Moe. "Can I help him if I'm not a cousin Basil?" Shemp asks before he faints. <br /> <br /> Other classics include Moe and Shemp getting tangled up in a pay phone, trying to find a lost coin and Larry being beaten because Shemp looks bad (his face is pressing against the phone). and the big girl is fighting in the apartment of the justice of the peace. The great Emil Sitka delivers his classic line (inscribed on his tombstone): "Keep hands, you love birds" again and again while his apartment gets into the trash. <br /> <br /> I prescribe "Brideless Groom" as a medicine for anyone who believes the Stooges' glory years ended when Curly went. True, Shemp did not have as many great shorts in the group as Curly, but that was due to an increasing lack of support from Columbia and his (and the other) advancing age. When Shemp was healthy and the trio was provided with decent material, they were still at the forefront.
