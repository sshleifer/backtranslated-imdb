I loved this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and at heart a country girl. There are no movies for small children. I loved this because the worst part was when one of the boys said "stupid". I welcome you for making a real family movie. I rented it when we saw it for the first time and knew I would buy it to add to our collection. My daughter can not stop talking about it. That fits in with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family movies like this. She even named one of our calves "Hokey Pokey Keen" !!! I can not say enough about this movie. I'm looking forward to many more films like this.
