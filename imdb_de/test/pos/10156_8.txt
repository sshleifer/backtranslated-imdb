If there is a good exciting movie, then this is one of them. James Stewart is doing an impressive job as the American dr. Ben McKenna, traveling with his wife and son in Africa. They stumble upon a murder scene and Dr. McKenna's son is kidnapped hours later. Before you can say, "Put the seatbelts on," Dr. McKenna tries too much to try and kill it But other people know that it can be dangerous (dangerous for them) and try to eliminate it. <br /> <br /> Finally Hank, the son, is found alive and healthy. <br /> <br /> If you like exciting movies, you should see this here. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10.
