I've just finished a dual role with an American werewolf in London and Paris. Let me begin by saying that "London" still holds after all these years, and the transformational sequence is quite impressive in every way. The movie was funny and scary, a bit gore too. Now we come to "Paris". It's fun, a few scars, a lot of Gore not as exciting or weird as the original, but it makes me laugh a little bit about what's become so fashionable these days in movies, that perhaps it was ahead of its time, the transformations' A CGI that is good for the technology of its time is not nearly as impressive as the original. I gave this movie a 7 because I have to admit it's fun, I laughed a lot and thought Tom Everett Scott was so stupid that I did not want to like his performance at first, just to like him. Julie Delpy was competent, as well as the direction in which the script had a bit of shine and finesse. I've read here that John Landis should go bad, but I'm pretty sure it would have been a different movie. I also noticed some discussions about a sequel to "What If". Well, no one has noticed that it should obviously be in American. Here is my title "An American Werewolf Coming Home" or in DC, that would be fun if all these political dogs are good at frightening. You just have to watch the original in their new DVD broadcast with Dolby 5.1 sound and watch both on an HD TV with Upconvert enabled ... nice !!!!
