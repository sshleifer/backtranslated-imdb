Very reliable entertainment, as Las Vegas amuses and intrigues, very carefree and very supported by Josh Duhanel !! I like this TV program and think that many people see it as a form of escapist voyeurism ... Voyeurism is very positive in this case and many women in this series are very nice to watch ... This show features Las Vegas legends like Wayne Newton as intermittent characters to authenticate the Las Vegas genre !! There were plenty of scenes from Sin City, this is one of the better efforts ... The producers and directors are lucky enough to have James Caan on the show because he is a very accomplished actor !!! On the whole, I like the Las Vegas TV show and I watch it on Fridays, I've also watched it on Mondays, but with Monday Night Football I could see why NBC switched it over on Fridays a lot !!
