I did not expect much from this movie and I was hit in the face. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint and Laura Linney are the main characters of this film. Any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to be who you really are, what this movie is all about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas in words. He slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much more awkward. Every viewer can feel the ups and downs of the movie, and the theater is filled with laughter in 75% of the time. The movie satisfies everyone, and I hope that it will soon be released in all US theaters, as many do not have the opportunity to see the movie unless they live in big cities. It is a must!
