"Two Hands" is a great complement to the Australian film catalog. <br /> <br /> It's this curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love that the Australians have developed on their own. <Br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is basically a good, if naive, guy. If you want to get in, he meets a local "Big" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). The moment he encounters Alex (Rose Byrne), he takes a first step on the dark road to crime. Here lies the cause of the error to change his life in an unexpected way. After Pando accidentally fell on the wrong side, things very quickly became very bad, and if not for a little extra-worldly help, this would have been a short sad movie. Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes unharmed in one way or another, but in the end he feels good. Although there is a lawless topic in history, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be in normal life. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is Jimmy's, innocent and smart at the same time. Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan are wonderful as always. This is a small ensemble of characters that are believable, and I took care of the good guys and did not like the villains. <br /> <br /> This DVD is usually in cheap gear. It would be well spent money. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
