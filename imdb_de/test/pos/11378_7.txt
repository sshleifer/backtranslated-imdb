An interesting companion to true documentaries by John C. Holmes. Unfortunately, it's not about what Holmes ultimately killed, and certainly would have benefited. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg were praised the most, but I felt like the real stars Julianne Moore as the cocaine-sniffing mother, Don Cheadle as the black man struggling with identity as a pornstar / stereo salesman in some wild get-ups, and William H. Macy, whose wife is the ultimate slut. Not to mention an almost unrecognizable Alfred Molina. Macy's New Year's Eve celebration and Cheadle's chance for a better life after a donut shop robbery are probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best shots. What makes this movie the best shows how power in its various forms can be easily damaged. Apparently, none of the characters learn anything from their dark downward spiral as they all bounce back and return to their normal lives.
