This is an extraordinary picture that is so highly recommended. Acting and writing are great and there are many great twists and turns in the plot. As a French "noir" film, its language is certainly much earthier than in its American counterparts, but for me this is just realism. Also, I liked how not glamorous everyone was - especially the husband and the lieutenant. The only negative, and the reason why the film gets a 9 and not 10, is because there was a bright plotting hole. As with another famous French film, Dr√¥le de Drame, the confusion between the cops and the defendants could have been easy at first, but the characters made more stupid decisions. For this you just have to suspend the unbelief and continue to watch - the payoff is worth it. <br /> <br /> This is just one of the most beautiful French movies I have ever seen. Period.
