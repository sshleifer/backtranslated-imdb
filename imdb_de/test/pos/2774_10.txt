Do you never miss the good old days when Disney really made great movies that really moved you? When I grew up with Disney, I was always fascinated by the characters. Everyone seemed really talented and knew how to move through a movie. I remember Friday evenings and ran to turn on the TV just to watch the latest movies. Susie Q was one of my favorites. I never forgot this movie. To this day, when you mention the song "Susie Q", I can always remember the movie. If someone thinks about watching this movie, I promise you, you will fall in love with him. I do not think I can ever forget it. You will not regret it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it's sad to see Disney movies like "The Hannah Montana Movie" coming out. What happened to Disney?
