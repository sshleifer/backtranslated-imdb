For the 1980s, this is a very dark movie. At the time, filmmakers worked on the assumption that all the films require smoky comic relief (which is extremely extreme these days, of course), flashy action scenes (even more exaggerated), or hot sex scenes. <br /> Hutton and Penn are amazing in their roles when childhood friends became Soviet spies. Penn is especially outstanding as a luckless drug dealer Daulton Lee. <br /> <br /> What you have here is a real thriller / drama. There is no eye candy to talk about, but the story is so captivating and the acting so great that (hopefully) most people would not miss it. There are a few amusing scenes, especially the scene in which Penn tries to get his Soviet benefactors involved in a drug deal. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
