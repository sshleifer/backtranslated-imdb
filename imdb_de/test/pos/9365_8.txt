Brilliant thriller that earns far more fame, Mitchum and Ryan are great in their lead roles, as well as the entire cast. A truly gripping film Noir with wonderful pictures and great dialogues. The focus is on a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on a novel about homophobia, this film attacks the postwar anti-emitism and all intolerance and hatred with considerable power. Although parts may seem a bit preaching to the modern audience, it still has the power to shock, and works very well as a thriller in itself. Thanks to all involved.
