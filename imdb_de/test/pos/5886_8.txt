After the Second World War, the film studios quickly rushed to the veterinarians, who returned home. "The best years of our lives" was probably the best example. It shows different people returning home and how to adapt not only to their pre-war life, but also to the changing world. Probably the most interesting actor is non-actor Harold Russell. After losing his hands in the war, he plays a hooked man who once held his hands and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else. He won the Best Supporting Actor and a special Oscar for the role. He was the only person ever to win two Oscars for the same role. There will probably always be a debate about whether this best picture deserves more than "It's a wonderful life," but I think they did a good job with it. Very well done.
