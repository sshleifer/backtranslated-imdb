Taylor Hackford wanted to shoot this film for 15 years and eventually found Jamie Foxx as the title role. Foxx is amazing in his portrayal of Ray Charles. From an interview I saw with Foxx, he met Charles several times, and they both played the piano together (Foxx had piano lessons as a child and actually played the piano in all of his scenes). I did not see Charles live in later years so it was great to get an insight into his career. I hope Foxx is nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor, as he definitely deserves it. The music is also incredible - it really shows the breadth of Charles's music, from country to blues and everything in between. The film also gives an impeccable account of Ray Charles's life, from the many women he has relationships with, to his drug habit and its consequences.
