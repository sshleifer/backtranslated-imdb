This movie turned out to be pretty much what I expected. Of course it's sappy, of course, predictable. We all know the fairy tale. But to know that it is pleasant enough to look at it when you see it. It was funny and cute. I found it annoying that they showed geeks as children who did not wash their hair there, or children who loved math and participated in maths clubs and wore t-shirts about math. I was an outsider in high school and did not do those things. It goes much deeper than that. It has to do with many things, some of it, how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness, and how mean you are to other children. I'm not coming in anyway. I do not agree with other opinions that do not convince Drew as a geek. With braces, no makeup, and unwashed hair, I do not think too many people would drool over them. And even if she goes back to high school and drops those things. She still wears the "wrong" clothes, "fake" hair and has the "wrong" attitude to be considered cool. And her other "geek" friends may be nice, but it does not matter where I'm from, you can still be an outsider and be beautiful. (inside and outside)
