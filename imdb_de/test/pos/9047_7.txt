Dexter (Kurt Russell) returns from The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes to a new adventure that can stand alone. Dexter, always the college student who tends to adversity, has an idea for a formula to make things invisible. Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn) is unimpressed and sets a lucrative science award with the student who studies bees. However, the bees sting the student and he turns out to be allergic. There is this chance for a price. But wait, Dexter does it! He actually makes a liquid that makes him invisible. The problem is, a ruthless businessman (Cesar Romero) learns about it and decides that he can use that formula, thanks, for something illegal. Can he steal the bottle from Dexter's nose? This is a companion to the TCWT, but you do not have to watch the first movie to enjoy this movie. Russell is a brilliant leader who comes through when it really matters. The rest of the cast is also a dream. Flynn, Romero, Jim Bacchus and others show why their comic skills are still valued today. The script is simply an innocent fun that is charming, with the special effects that are reasonably simple for today's standards, but still effective. If you want to sit back and relive a bygone era, or just want to share a quality G-rated movie with your family, this is a good choice. Even though it is over 30 years old, there is a chance that your loved ones will even now see the blues giggle with this fine streak.
