Somehow, somewhere, somewhere ... you've seen this movie GOTTA. Breathtaking aerial photography and incredible excellence by talented actors. You think Cirque du Soleil is going crazy, wait until you see what these two women are doing. Above all, the emotional journey and the fights Jane (Dreya Weber) faces are universal to many women. A brilliantly directed film that deals with the complexity of relationships and lasts until you can let go. This masterpiece will touch women and men alike. Ned Far (director / writer) and the incredibly talented Dreya Weber (star / producer) simply had the courage to be honest and sincere. This movie will grow up - see it NOW you can - or you will not be up to date if it becomes one of the most talked about movies.
