This film takes you to the opening scenes and never lets you go. If you see Janos Szaby's excitement about coming to America, look indulgently. He is a nice guy. You can not help but love him, even if his zeal is replaced by bitterness when his fortune changes. They know that in their circumstances, they must make the same choices as they do to survive. This film comments on the worship of the society of beauty and all superficial things and applies only in the culture of the twenty-first century. Janos himself becomes a victim of this philosophy when he tells his blind friend: "You are young and beautiful, if you could see, you would have the world." And like many modern gangster films, when their security is threatened, he takes his revenge. His innocence is not completely lost because he demands an equally high price from himself, knowing that he deserves his fate. Peter Lorre is in good shape in this lead role. Few actors managed to convincingly transform the character from innocent to bitter criminal within 69 minutes. Lorre is well supported by all the actors, so this ensemble is a real ensemble image and not just a vehicle for a star. With a little less preaching this film would be a 10. Highly recommended.
