I should not like Jackass number two. Nobody should do it. There is never and has never been anything special about Jackass. And yet ... it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen - and I just can not explain why. <br /> <br /> This new movie leaves the first one in the dust. It's so funny, so terrible and so wrong. The whole team gives it all - with Jacks boss Knoxville at the top. He is crazy. I adore him, but he is crazy. And more power for him. With his burgeoning film career, he could have sat back and just let everyone else do the dirty work, but the fact that he almost literally threw himself back into the world of the 'ass' makes me strangely respect him. A few kudos have to go to Bam Margera, who used to feel content to sit back and make sure everyone around him does just about anything he wants. Here Bam is not the tormentor, but the tormentor and it is all the better. <br /> <br /> I just can not say what I like the most because I laughed the whole way. Granted, I've seen a lot of the film between the fingers, but there was not a "real" movie I've seen in a long time that made me feel invigorated. I love her or most likely hate her. The Jackass team exceeded my expectations. But I agree with Bam. There can never be a jackass number three because someone is going to die and I want these people to stay here.
