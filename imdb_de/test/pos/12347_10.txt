Well-groomed, well behaved teen Meg Tilly has to spend the night in a spooky mausoleum to be admitted to a high school club. The problem is a powerful clairvoyant named Raymar, who was buried that day, but he is not quite dead and he needs the vitality of humans for his powers. <br /> <br /> Obscure horror film offers a lot of thrills and shivers, an appealing and sympathetic cast, and superior special effects. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> A dark night is rated R for violence and adult issues.
