"The King of the Queens" could be divided into two epochs. The first era, which is composed of the first seasons, shows the problems of everyday life of a man and his wife, who make it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck. <br /> <br /> The second era expanded the scope of the show and made a humorous take on current popular culture and marital problems. <br /> <br /> But apart from that ... <br /> <br /> This show was damn funny. <br /> <br /> Kevin James is having an ingenious laugh when he's not doing crap-comedy films with Adam Sandler, and his chemistry with Leah Remini was unique on television. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller as a psychotic, living father-in-law added his own unique style of whimsical humor, and Patton Oswalt as a "man-child" was Spence Ulchin's unbelievable (he's great) (even comedian) "The King of Queens "was the last sitcom of the 1990s that went from the air, and that's a damn shame. Now all we have to do is watch the idiotic sitcoms that are full of untalented actors and actresses whose only charm is their physical appearance. I like a lot of fans of actually funny TV shows that are now in mourning
