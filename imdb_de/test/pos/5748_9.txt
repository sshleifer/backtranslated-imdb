This movie was amazing. I was in tears at the end of the movie. Okay, I know the acting is shitty, but that did not matter. The message came loud and clear of God's love for us and Jesus' sacrifice. The film was realistic and showed real human feelings, whether it was Pete's anger at the blond girl's mocking smile or the guy who was asking questions. But it also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with Christ. The cars were fantastic and the actors were very hot and that attracted me. What I liked most about this movie was the clear message of the gospel. The mother and the pastor helped Ben on his new walk with Christ and tried to be a divine example to others. Nicky D has shown that it does not matter if you have everything the world has to offer, without Christ, it does not matter. Nina showed how a misguided but good person can easily miss the target. I loved this movie and I think it will bring many teens to Christ.
