What makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies? I do not joke, I have seen it 10 times or so and have not tired. Is it the tender melancholy in the whole thing? Is it similar to classics like "Niagara"? I've been thinking for a long time. And I found out: I think it is: There is no hero, there are only people. Some try to be good. Some gave up trying to be good. Some cases are hopeless, but they still have the feeling of being human. It's the story of a catastrophic night in a motel at the end of the world. So the catastrophe is just the end of a chain of coincidences. The other way this night shows the logical consequences of the lives of these peoples, because in a certain constellation they cut off the rest of the world. It has something like a Dostoevsky story.
