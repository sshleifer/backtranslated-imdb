There is more to this film than you can see at first glance. If you're looking for groundbreaking originality or simple comedy, you'll be disappointed. But for entertaining 90 minutes this is fine. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is meticulous and precise. The sex scenes, of which a commentary is considered unfounded, are anything but - every gesture contributes to the development of the characters. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of the main characters are not exactly lovely people. But the film is genuinely trying to show its interactions in an honest light without being sensational (at least not for urban standards of the early 21st century). And there are many very funny moments.
