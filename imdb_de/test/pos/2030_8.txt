Mark Walhberg in a big role, adores a rock star so much that he knows all his songs, imitates him to perfection and dresses like him. When the opportunity arises to take on the role of his "idol" in the band, he jumps on the opportunity. The role of a rock star, however, may not be what it is at stake ... and relationships may change ... This film definitely impressed me because it does not necessarily address the theme of what you are achieving as you believe so soon as you get it. All in all a really good movie with great performances of the whole cast as well as the two main roles Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. It saddened me, especially when Emily (Jennifer Aniston) met Chris in Seattle and saw the depths of what he had sunk. If anyone has ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie, you should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamorous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you want.
