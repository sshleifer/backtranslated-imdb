The whole city of Blackstone is scared because they lynched Bret Dixon's brother - and he comes back for revenge! At least that's what they think. <br /> <br /> A great Johnny Hallyday and a very interesting, formerly Mario Adorf star in this Italo-Western, obviously filmed in the Alps. <br /> <br /> Bret Dixon returns to Blackstone to find out why his brother was lynched. He's a loner and a superlative gunfighter, everyone's scared of him - the Mexican bandits (who are fighting the gringos who have taken their land!) As well as the "decent" citizens who lynch Bret's brother. They lynched him because they thought he had stolen their money instead of putting it in the bank's safety at Dallas. However, this is only half the truth, as we can see in the course of this psychologically interesting West. <br /> <br /> But beware, it's a kind of depressing movie, because everyone is somehow guilty and definitely everyone is bad to the bone ... <br /> <br /> Nevertheless I have it very much enjoyed and given him 8/10. Strange that on January 12, 2002, only less than 5 people voted for this film ...
