I saw this movie in a free-to-air station late at night, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Being a horror movie fan, I often watch midnight movies during school holidays. The horror movies shown at this time are mostly big lamer. "Campfire Tales" certainly does not fit into this category. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is basically an anthology of short stories loosely based on well-known urban legends. They are together with an environment where teens tell these stories around the campfire. This campfire offers a mysterious plot. However, this particular story is weak and confusing, and is apparently used primarily to set up the other scary tales. <br /> <br /> There are three stories in this movie (four if you count "The Hook" in the beginning). All are really scary and well done. I especially liked the third story ("The Locket"), in which a man collapsed in front of a mysterious household. This particular story works well to freak you out with sudden glimpses of the history of the house. In addition, it will shock the end of the story completely! The first story ("The Honeymoon") was also very scary, though the second story ("People can lick it") left something to be desired. This movie certainly did a good job! What I really liked about this movie is the fact that it is split into three shorts. This means that the movie will not go through about an hour of character development and establishment before the actual bloodshed begins. This makes 'Campfire Tales' perfect for nights out, parties, etc. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is a scary, crunchy horror movie that will make your heart stop more than once. It's definitely better than the crap you find in cinemas nowadays (Blair Witch 2, Urban Legends: Final Cut ... bleah!). Find a copy and look at it ... if you dare! <br /> <br />
