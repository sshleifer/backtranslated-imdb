I can not remember reading Sarah, Plain and Tall at school, but when my son told me about it and said that they saw the movie in class, I wanted to see it too. I borrowed the video from the library and viewed it as a family. It was a wonderful story. However, I did not know until a few months ago that there are consequences. I finished this week. I spotted a little oops: In the second movie, Skylark, Jacob remembers when he was a boy and tells Sarah "My brothers and sisters and I would dream ...". In Winter's End, these "brothers and sisters" do not exist in conversations between Jacob and his father. But it's a very small oops, and I only saw it at the second sight of the trilogy. Great movie, a must for a good, healthy family visit.
