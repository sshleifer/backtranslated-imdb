As the long-running "Happy Ever After" came to an end, the characters "Terry & June Fletcher" were revived for the longer-running and more popular sequel "Terry & June," even though their last names were changed by Fletcher in Medford. <br /> <br /> Terry has gotten a new job and so he and June move to Purley, where they end up in all sorts of scratches - unwanted guests dropping by at an inopportune time, the boss invites for dinner and Terry tries But risking his arm at the do-it-yourselfer always makes him go. Another IMDb user described this show as "not smart" and "never well written". To be fair, it was not smart, but that was the point. What was "never well written" - some episodes were quite inferior, I admit, but overall I found it very well written, very amusing and very well played. <br /> <br /> It was warm-hearted slapstick, not unlike the later BBC sitcom 'Keeping Up Appearances'. Eight different authors have contributed to the nine series, which gave the show plenty of room. Terry Scott was a weird genius, as in productions like "Hugh & I", the "Carry On" movies and of course here! June Whitfield was also a comedy legend. <br /> <br /> I enjoy some modern shows, d. H. "Still Game", "The Catherine Tate Show", "Legit" and "Empty". I've even enjoyed the "Alternative Comedy" - "Naked Video", "The Young Ones" and "The Comic Strip Presents", but I'm more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy like this. Humor that you do not have to think about is great if you feel bad and want to rise. For the record "Terry & June" was a wonderful stuff. Particularly noteworthy is the catchy themed melody, which has attracted the mood of the show enormously well!
