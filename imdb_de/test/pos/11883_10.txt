Critters 4 is one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. The word classic has never been used as well as in the description of this stunning epic. I agree that the original Critters is the best in the series, but the claustrophobic tension of the space station where Critters 4 is located really needs to be seen. I warmly recommend this to anyone interested in seeing one of the most significant landmarks of 20th century film.
