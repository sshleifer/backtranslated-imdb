She is the man was the funniest movie I have ever seen. I laughed so hard that I cried. It was also very romantic. Channing Tatum is absolutely great and can really work. It certainly does not hurt that he also has some shirtless scenes. Channing and Amanda have amazing chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together. I love this movie. Pay attention to it when watching the last deleted scene. It was a big mistake to cut this scene as this is one of the best scenes in the movie. I highly recommend this movie. Amanda has never been funnier. And Channing will be a big star. This is just the first of many for this shining new star.
