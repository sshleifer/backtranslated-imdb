By far one of the best science fiction movies. In order to understand the concept of the film and recognize not only the special effect, but also the main presentation of the film itself, but many considerations are required. I feel like this movie received so bad reviews because no one took the time to see the movie as it should be seen. There are a few moments that you want to hurry up and come by, but there are only a few. Hooper, who ran TCM 1 and 2 along with a remake of INVADERS FROM MARS, and THE FUNHOUSE do their best work here. Great score, good acting and great effects make this movie your collection. If you have the option to watch the widescreen version on DVD, it is recommended to anyone who is a sci-fi fan.
