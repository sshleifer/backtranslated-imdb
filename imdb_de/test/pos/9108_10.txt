Probably the best comedy in a long time. keeps you laughing! Acting is good and there are many funny cameos like Ben Stiller as a guitarist. The plot was not as good as I had hoped, but the comedy makes up for it. I can only hope for a sequel because it seems they can do so much more. Although it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long, I wanted more at the end :) Also there is a scene after the credits, which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie !! I recommend this to anyone who loves a good comedy and definitely to fans of The D or Jack Black. You should also buy the album, the songs are so damn catchy and hilarious, the music on top is also Top Notch.
