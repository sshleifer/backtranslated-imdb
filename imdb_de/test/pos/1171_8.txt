"Out to Sea" is a funny movie with the wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This movie is not as funny as the comedies "Grumpy Old Men" (which are very similar to it), but there are many laughs everywhere. Lemmon and Matthau play a few parents-in-law, who take a cruise together. As soon as they board, Lemmon does not know that Matthau has signed on as the dancing leader so they do not have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates Lemmon, who does not feel like dancing. Worse, Matthau can not even dance. Nevertheless, they join in and they meet some of their fellow travelers and crew members during the process. Here are the crewmembers: Cruise Director Gil Godwyn, played by Brent Spiner, veteran of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," who acts like a bad dictator. There are two dance colleagues, played by "Barney Miller" star Hal Linden and the veteran musical star Donald O'Connor. There is the shipping company Mrs. Carruthers, played by "Golden Girl" Rue McClanahan. As for the passengers: Vivian, a widow, played by Gloria De Haven, who falls in love with Lemmon. There's Liz, played by one of my favorite actresses, Dyan Cannon, who falls in love with Matthau. There's Mavis, Liz's mother, played by actress Elaine Stritch. And they also meet others. All these actors are a pleasure when Lemmon and Matthau play by them. It's great to see Cannon here. Stritch is a scream; Spiner is a weird villain who plays it deadly. De Haven is wonderful. Linden, O'Connor and McClanahan have one or two good moments; and finally, the two main stars Lemmon and Matthau are okay as usual. A beautiful little gem of a comedy. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
