The director, Ramin Niami, delivers the goods to Somewhere in the City. I think this hilarious farce is part of the tradition of a Mel Brooks comedy. Niami enjoys New York society by creating the believable, eccentric and tragic characters of a tenement that bring them to life from the start. The appearance of Peter Stormare as a gay Shakespearean actor is absolutely praiseworthy, and the film generally does a good job of showing the hopelessness and laughter of selfish ambitions. Sandra Bernhard is a perfect straightforward, self-obsessed therapist. I really enjoyed the performance of Sandra, especially as I have not been a big fan so far. Bai Ling, Ornella Muti and Bulle Ogier complete an international ensemble par excellence. I loved the scene with Robert John Burke and his band of idiots who could not plan robbery if their lives depended on it. With a cameo by mayor Ed Koch and a solid performance from Paul Anthony Stewart, the boy of the revolutionary mom, Somewhere entertains in the city without missing a beat.
