I have recently seen this movie for the first time. If you ask me, it does not get the credit it deserves. It's a bit like American Pie hits Ridgemont High on Fast Times, but with more depth. It deals with the same issues as both films, but in a way that contains some grains of truth. The end is sad, but that's life. I think everyone should see it. I put it on DVD and it took me so long to find it. That should say something, heh and another thing I want to add is that it's pretty hard to find the soundtrack. I think they stopped that, but the soundtrack to this movie is amazing. There are songs by artists like The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and the Sunshine Band and many more.
