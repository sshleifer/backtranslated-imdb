This is one of the most beautiful TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values ​​are first-class. The appearances are a passion with Beverly D'Angelo as an older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes, who is just perfect as a young student friend. The best part about this movie, however, was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of reaching the usual happy ending. It turned out that abuse can occur in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It's thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to everyone involved in this extraordinary movie. <br /> <br />
