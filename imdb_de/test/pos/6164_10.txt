Absolutely one of the best aviation films of all time on so many levels. Hardware junkies will drool over the largest mass of flyable Spitfires outside of a Battle of Britain reenactment. No less than eight flying spits are available for very precise ground and air sequences. <br /> <br /> Those who admire the history of flying and the misty eyes of reciting High Flight will identify with the reverence of the main characters the freedom of being fast, free and high in their dark blue world his. Be forewarned: romantics and even dog lovers will be very emotional in this film. The core message is shared by many veterinarians, with their most beautiful hours, their lifetime when they felt most alive, actually during the war, when everything else is sad and gray. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns Czech pilots fleeing their country when the Nazis invade the RAF Free Czech Squadron. There are some sub-sites, all of which deserve careful consideration. This is just a simple, old, great movie that even the most passionate anti-hardware romantics will love (have the Kleenex ready). Beautiful photography, first-class spectacle, accurate details of the life of the RAF during the Battle of Britain. Easily a candidate for the personal DVD collection of an aviation enthusiast.
