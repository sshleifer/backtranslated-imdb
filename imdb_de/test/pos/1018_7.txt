"Are you alone in the house?" is one of the days before cable television, when the networks wanted to offer an alternative to popular television broadcasts. It's a well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. Kathleen Beller plays a high school girl who receives a series of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think it's nothing more than a prank, but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller's parents, Ellen Travolta (John's sister) is the headmaster of high school and Dennis Quaid has one of his earliest roles as a generous child. It is a competent radiator with a still relevant social message. Beller is lovely - if you are 30 years or older, you will remember that she was very popular with teenagers. Blythe Danner, whom I do not usually like, gives a really moving performance. Nice little movie.
