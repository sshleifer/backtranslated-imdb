"Miss Cast Away" is an amusing little thing that avoids a serious conspiracy or character development to pack as many jokes as possible. Preferably with a large audience that is open for such conversations and maybe had a few drinks. Most jokes are based on current events, so this movie may become a time capsule of turn-of-the-century pop culture references in years to come. The 30i to 24p conversion of the footage creates a jerky appearance in some parts, most notably the first aerial shots. <br /> <br /> The performance of Micheal Jackson is indeed a strange non-sequester event. But I find it encouraging that Mr. Jackson showed a helpful interest in one of his protégés even after he (the director) left the stage of the cute Preteen boy. Effects Work is not as bad as a review suggested. Most of it was done by a one-man crew in a short period of time, consisting of animator William Sutton, whose name was apparently left out of the IMDb credits. His work is an extraordinary feat and really helps close the gaps in this film. I hope he was finally paid!
