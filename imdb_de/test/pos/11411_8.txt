The movie is about a girl who does not just go to a campfire just because it's baby that night. Nothing strange, right? Until ... The phone rings. Until ... The phone rings again. And again ... and again. These are not stupid pranks. That is real. If you want to see how the girl reacts, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Great atmosphere with eerie sounds. Very well played by the young Camilla Belle who got the lead role. I see in her great potential to become a good actress. This is more than just a decent thriller, I have no idea why it is so underestimated. In my opinion, this movie deserves more than just 4/10. 24% of voters rated the movie as 1. Be serious, people. For such a title you could not get a better thriller.
