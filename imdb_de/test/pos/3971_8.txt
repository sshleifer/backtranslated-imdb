At first glance, every teen comedy runs the risk of being homeless and obvious, and most of them are honest enough. There are some that have outgrown the usual banality of the source material (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and they give me the hope that others can join this oppressively rare set of teen comedies that are actually funny and not just one An excuse for flashing Some starlets breasts or a vehicle for some who have never been, was like Tom Green. Enter Accepted, directed by John Cusack buddy Steve Pink, was designed by sympathetic Justin Long (the sly, nerdy kid in Galaxy Quest and (recently in Apple Computer Advertising), a group of kids who are not admitted to college and decide as revealed in the trailer, to fake a false bill to get their parents off their backs If the website goes a little too far and other kids enroll, the kids have some issues to solve. <br /> <br /> Okay, the set-up is obviously absurd, but most comedy lives or dies in the running and here Accepted does quite well.Long's Bartleby Gaines (mostly cut to "B") is accompanied by sufficiently well-disposed, weirdly acceptable friends help him to share the load, but the best side character is "Dean" Lewis (undoubtedly in tribute to Rodney Dangerfield's Dean) Martin), aka Uncle Ben, Lewis Black, who wisely jumped at it where he can quickly shoot his unique kind of moody observation humor. Black is awesome here, candidly telling children how life really is (his adventurous end line is hysterical), and parents give the face of adults to the deceitful university. <br /> <br /> But Long has to carry most of the movie, and he does it in spades; Bartleby is easy to identify and we accept him almost immediately. A handsome twist came from Columbus Shorts Character Hands, an athlete who loses his scholarship due to injury and eventually becomes the de facto art faculty at fake college. It is also noteworthy that Bartley's hyper-intelligent and sarcastic little sister Hannah Marks is. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie feels familiar in some places; It's a debt here, of all the revenge of the nerds. Those who are rejected by all find a home in Bartleby and his cohorts, and of course the baddies are steroid-reinforced, conformist Master Race types who lead a brotherhood (well, brothers are evil) and try to humiliate the weird balls and to bury for the ?? wheeze ?? Crime to be different. Apart from that, Accepted has a lot of fun with the material and even asks some decent questions about the expectations of college kids and the course of higher education. Not that it's definitely a puzzling task, but Accepted is not just another mindless teen comedy (or Owen Wilson vehicle). It's a fun, smart 90 minutes that, while not a big departure from their genre, is smart and creative enough to be entertaining. <br /> <br /> There is at least one moment of unadulterated brilliance in the film when Bartleby attends a nearby college to collect ideas for the curriculum of his own school. When he sees that the children in the other school are all stressed out (some refuse to talk to him during class because they are afraid to miss something), he shakes his head and thinks there is a better way got to. When he wants to leave, he is struck by a stream of children going in the other direction. A person moves against a human tide, while in the background play the opening lines of Eleanor Rigby. Maybe an unplanned moment of brilliance, but still brilliance.
