From start to finish, this classic two-reel from 1926 seems to be made up of Hal Roach Studios, which was fun at the '20s. It plays the now forgotten comic genius Charley Chase and was led by the legendary Leo McCarey, who was then unknown, but earning his living at Roach and wanted to visit in the 30s and 40s green pastures. Recently released on video and disc, this is one of the ten best examples of silent comedy and should be seen in front of audiences of all ages. Although his star has almost shrunk today, Charley Chase was considered a leader in the short topic comedy in the declining years of the Silents. He helped create the careers of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before joining them as a team, Leo McCarey and a host of other talents. It's a shame he's almost forgotten today. Take a look at this little gem of a movie. Once you do this, you will be looking for other films from this classic comic. He had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive. Rediscover this lost giant of a movie from a bygone era and its giant star.
