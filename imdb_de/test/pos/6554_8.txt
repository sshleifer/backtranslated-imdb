Uzumaki (Japanese for "spiral" or "Vortex") is one of the most absurd films I have ever seen. A city is possessed and then totally consumed by the vortex pattern in a very grotesque way. Fingertips are cut off, people commit suicide in washing machines ... just wild and crazy Japanese horror. Possibly just as psychologically harmful as "The Ring". Generally not as scary as "The Eye", but the pictures are more annoying than most things in "The Eye". And not as bloody as "The Untold Story" ... but that does not mean that there is not much blood and dismemberment. Seriously, if you enjoy horror movies and especially Asian horror, you need to add this movie to your list. A few parts are a bit strange with the sound effects (the story was adapted by a manga comic and it shows), but it really fits. Unlike some films that try too hard to capture the original source ("House of the Dead"), this is perfect. The most original movie you'll see ... not just this year, but probably ever. Recommended!
