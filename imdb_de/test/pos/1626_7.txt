I still have not read a single book by Dan Brown, but I've looked at all the adaptations of his films. I will not fall into the game to rate this with the previous one because the scope is not really the same: this one is really a thriller, a race against the time of riddles. <br /> <br /> The plot is very twisted, resourceful and the cast is excellent: I've never been a big fan of Hanks before, but he delivers well. I noticed his denim shirt (blood-spattered) because I was looking in vain for one! The Italian Seeker is a brilliant newcomer to me, but I have received Ewan MacGregor very well: his inner faith and calm are truly impressive. <br /> <br /> I really like the debate between science and religion. The action at the Vatican felt like a vacation. I am not sure if it is helpful to include new converts in Christianity. With all the presence of gold and men, everyone would ask what charity means and why women are so dismissed from church life, while advocating half or more of the faithful.
