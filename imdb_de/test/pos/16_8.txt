I went to a pre-screening of this movie and thought that for 120 minutes I was going to use sassy lines, a thoughtless plot, and the kind of evil spectacle that made "The Postman" one of the most vicious stagings of cinematic flaws in our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a movie with Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could play in such a serious role. Shocked that a movie that plays the lead role has captured and captured my own emotions. I have not seen this Costner since Robin Hood: full of depth and complex emotions. Kutcher seems to have adapted the serious drama with which he played in Butterfly Effect. These two actors came into this film with a serious, focused attitude that shines through what I consider to be one of the best films I've seen this year. No, it's not an Oscar-worthy movie. It's not an epic or a deep social commentary. Rather, it is a story about a simple subject that is lit in such a way that the audience gets a higher level of empathy than it would have thought possible. I think that's good filmmaking, and I'm thoroughly impressed with this work. Bravo!
