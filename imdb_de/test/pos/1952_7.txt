Joshua Miller (as Tim), looking for pot-addiction, throws his sister's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck (as Samson) howls and smokes a cigarette after killing Danyi Deats (as Jamie). The doll washes away, but the naked young woman stays at the "edge of the river" so that every passerby can see her. The corpse looks at a group of about twenty teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. The Stoner Keanu Reeves (as Matt) and Crispin Glover (as Layne) are camera-conscious. The friends wonder what they can do with their guilty, beer-loving killer friend. Dennis Hopper (as Feck), an experienced veteran in the cast, keeps the heads of the young people fed up. Mr. Hopper once killed a woman. He lives with one of these life-size sex dolls, whose mouth is apparently ready to use. Ione Skye Leitch (as Clarissa) is a livelier doll, waiting for Reeves to kiss her. Their copulation is clearly crossed with a review of the strangulation of the opening. Ms. Leitch is a real teenager in her first leading role. She is the daughter of sixties singer Donovan. Make other quirky connections yourself. <br /> <br /> Depending on your mood, you can read a lot into the film or not. Some backgrounds of the characters may be a bit too subtle. Most obviously, the killer teenager was annoyed; Note its weight, posture and toilet-related nickname. Some relationships and motivations of the characters are too vague, but the cast certainly holds the material interesting. Director Tim Hunter, photographer Frederick Elmes and writer Neal Jimenez are obviously talented. River's Edge (8/27/17) Tim Hunter - Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover Dennis Hopper, Joshua Miller
