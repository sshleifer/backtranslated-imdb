This is basically a goofball comedy, which is a bit strange due to some dramatic elements. For Michael J. Fox and Paul Reubens it was her first film (Fox was previously in a short-lived television series and a television movie). <br /> <br /> As the movie is essentially a race / scavenger hunt like "Cannonball Run", "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" or "Rat Race" there are no main characters. Instead, there are groups of characters that split the screen time and take into account lots of mini-plots. Usually, this type of movie is a way to stuff the maximum number of stars (or half stars) on a movie. <br /> <br /> This has teams, one of which is the primary team that owns Fox, who are the only characters that are being developed. Their plot is more of a stereotypical Disney affair involving a college kid who does not pay attention to his younger brother, whom he considers a lazy punk. Since they are forced to team together with the older brother's girlfriend, they have to work together. Since this is the main display, most of the screen time is displayed. <br /> <br /> Some of the other stupid plots are striking. The Blue Team is about an overweight, rich kid whose dad wants him and his inappropriate friends out of the house. In the end, they have a cool custom van that has an on-board computer (1980!) To solve the puzzles instantly and play video games with the time saved! One member, Stephen Furst, later played dr. Axelrod in "St. Elsewhere" and later "Babylon 5". I also admit that I still laugh when Barf trying to decode a word a'la Scrabble, "Fagabefe?" This is a lot funnier than Bart Simpson's "Qwyjibo", in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The other three teams have plans that are somewhat interconnected. The green team is a bunch of frisky boys, with mostly beer jokes that mean a breakdown when the hunt leads to the Pabst Blue Ribbon Brewery. You have the chance to harass the red team with two feminists and two fun-loving twins. Nerd's White Team is led by Eddie Deezen, who was previously in "Grease," but then played an important role as a computer geek in "Wargames" and later in part of Tim Conway's "Village" series. <br /> <br /> If you grew up in the 80s, there are some classic moments in the movie that bring back memories. The early video game room of yesteryear, when they were cool, is always a plus for me. Look for Paul Reubens and his quarter-firing cannons. There is also a mini golf course and a scooter disco. <br /> <br /> The film is actually an okay family movie, simply because obscenities are almost nonexistent and the low amount of sexual humor is completely innocent. The odd pace thanks to the cheesy dramatic moments of the yellow team makes parents fall asleep while their kids chuckle at Fat Burger for gigantic melons (oh, they actually have a special melon plate, that's it, right?)
