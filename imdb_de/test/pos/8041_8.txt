The stunts sequences (as well as the special effects) are brilliant in this movie. Michael Scherer has to be one of the best stunt coordinators in Canada ever. The explosion in the cafe is a wonderful combination of stunts, special effects and visual effects. The director HAD an idea that the crew could create on film. <br /> <br /> Apart from that; Donald Sutherland does one of his best performances in this film .......
