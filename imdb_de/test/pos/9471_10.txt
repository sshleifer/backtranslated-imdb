I had the chance to see this movie in an early screening in Brea, and since then I'm crazy about it. The film is based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, which I've read, loved and seen on stage several times. I certainly liked the references. But whether you like Shakespeare or not does not matter - the movie is on it. It is super funny, funny and charming. Amanda Bynes is funny and David Cross too. Actually, the whole cast is great - I'm just a big David Cross fanatic. The cast is hot and the soundtrack brings a lot of cool bands and some that I've never heard before, but I know they'll release a CD. Everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish - all ages. !!!!
