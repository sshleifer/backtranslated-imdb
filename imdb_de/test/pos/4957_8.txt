I think this movie is really entertaining, though it lacks some features that are so important to this movie. When Doug and Chappy start their mission, they start with the F-16B, and during the combat scenes they control the F-16A. The second thing I do not like about this movie is the constantly repeating F-16, which races to the right to escape from rockets ... Why were not any chaff and torches shown in any movie? Third, as soon as you see the F-16 almost without ammunition, it seems that there are plenty of missiles again. The models used to simulate the destroyed aircraft are also not good. However, I think it was very good to use IAI Kfir as an enemy aircraft, much better than the F-5 shown in Top Gun (but this movie is not as good as this masterpiece). <br /> <br /> A funny movie, I love planes and I have seen it more than 3 times.
