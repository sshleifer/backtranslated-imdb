For the curious, this episode is based on Pirandello's play "Six Characters in Search of an Author" and Jean-Paul Sartre's play "No Exit" (as most obviously indicated by the title), but of course with a sterling twist. <br /> <br /> Five very different people are in a round room, not knowing who they are, except for their clothes. A bell rings occasionally (perhaps also an allusion to the Hemmingway?), Which reinforces the agony of their imprisonment. The newcomer to the group, a major, is determined to flee while the others have resigned with their fate. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pirandello, these characters do not even have a story. They have nothing but the experience of space in their consciousness and no one who could write their nonexistent story, so their position is even more hopeless than the characters in Pirandello's play. Unlike Pirandello and Sartre, there is no relationship between characters and therefore no real conflict between them, although the theme of personal responsibility versus apathy plays a prominent role in this story. <br /> <br /> Although this differs significantly from the history of the authors referred to in the title, the themes of Sartre and Pirandello (and many other 20th-century authors) come through with absolute clarity. This is obviously a piece that addresses the postmodern perspective in the context of the Cold War era. There is also a focus on issues of personal insignificance. <br /> <br /> This is by far one of the best episodes I have ever seen, and remains extremely relevant to the current experience (as is Sartre and Pirandello). Exactly what makes a good piece a classic.
