I've seen this movie about a agent agent, and he certainly agrees with a lot about what comes out of Sth. Australia in terms of overall tone, which is quite dark and moody. <br /> <br /> I found the little boy excellent in the movie. Mostly kid actors are * hammered * and embarrassing, but not in this case. He was really good. Regarding the * surrealism * mentioned by Bingo, I think this movie is just 'weird'. It's a real madness movie, with unusual locations, storylines, and weird stuff running all the time. But 'good' funny as opposed to 'bad'. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of other movies like this one, but it's not like CARS ATE Paris at all, maybe more of a REPULSION, but actually I think more like a 60s hit movie. It certainly has an interesting mind behind it. <br /> <br /> JINGO, My question also refers to the title. Why modern love? Someone? Also, Jingo, what did you mean by "God Forsaken" when you talked about Australia, hmmm? Just curious
