Sorry for the "extremely clever" summary. I do not know what I thought, but I really could not help myself. <br /> <br /> I've been wanting to see "Bloody Birthday" for a long time and I have to say it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this movie by mistake and at such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village and it is very unlikely that this will happen. It is a pity that some of these "gems" from the 80s are almost completely forgotten. 'Bloody Birthday' is one of those films that are amazingly old enough to be seen today. Certainly not a masterpiece, but still entertaining and you know something? ... it does not really have funny scenes. I know it's shocking to remember that this is a low-budget, early-80s movie about a group of bad kids killing people. But believe me, the movie manages to remain respectable and observable for the most part. <br /> <br /> In 'Blood Birthday', the story revolves around three children born during a total eclipse. According to astrology, the sun and moon block Saturn during the solar eclipse, which controls the emotions. As a result, the three children born on that day eventually become indifferent and evil. As these ten-year-old children feel no regrets, they oppose anyone who gets in their way, including their own parents and siblings ... and kill them! The number of bodies is increasing day by day, and the police believe a psychopath is lurking in the home. In the meantime, Debbie, Curtis and Steven are reluctant to continue slaughtering people, as no one seems to suspect these sweet angel faces (?). <br /> <br /> As I said, 'Bloody Birthday' is surprisingly NOT funny. I know that I said that before, but I'm really surprised. I expected some funny scenes, but the movie misunderstood me. It's not exactly what most people would call a "serious" horror movie, but if I have to be fair, I would say the story is done decently. One of the main reasons why you would normally expect ridiculous situations (like me) is that in these movies, where the main villains are children, the young actors are usually terrible and make the whole thing ridiculous. Let's face it, children are usually terrible actors, which is understandable, and we can not blame them. To my surprise, the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this movie looked very disturbing and not funny at all. The rest of the actors are good too and if you're a George Clooney fan you can see his uncle in this movie playing a doctor. Yes, I know it right ... ... who cares? Even Julie Brown, the great actress, singer, comedienne and gay icon, gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and if anyone is interested in nudity: she also strips in one of the scenes and looks naked. Too bad that she did not have more time on the screen! Julie is 'absolutely fabulous': P <br /> <br /> So basically this movie is alright when you're in the mood for a modest horror from the 80's. My only objection to "Bloody Birthday" would be the way to justify the children's motives. This is perhaps one of the deepest points of the movie. Let's see: If children who were born during a solar eclipse are heartless killers in the end, how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people? I am sure that there were other children who were born on the same day ... and also on other days of total solar eclipse. All in all, no big deal, it's just a simple observation, that's all. I've seen worse, trust me. Take, for example, "The Children" (1980), in which the precocious murderer gains his malice after being turned into a zombie by a poisonous cloud. No, believe me, "Bloody Birthday" is much more decent and if you like simple slashers, you'll enjoy them a lot. <br /> <br /> Now you know: you are invited to the children's birthday party ... and the hosts serve you and the rest of the guests a delicious poisoned cake. Come on, you can not miss it;)
