Another movie from the long series of "Do not" movies of the late 70s and early 80s, but this one is much more. This movie is an underrated low budget bat with a twist. It has the gritty quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of that time, but it's the highly underrated performances of the surprisingly talented actors / actresses that make this movie good. A young nurse comes to the progressive mental hospital of Dr. med. Stephens, right after he was murdered by one of his patients and everything is not as it seems. It seems that Dr. Masters, a rather ambitious doctor, has taken on his duties and started to implement her own ideas. Each of the patients accepts their own unique personalities and has their own personality traits and bugs that make for very entertaining interactions. There is the nymphomaniac, the crazy old woman, the woman with an unhealthy obsession with babies and a man who, among other things, has returned to his childhood. There is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story, in which the young nurse is later locked in the asylum, patients are walking around and their bodies are piled up. If you are a fan of the cheap 70s, then this is the movie for you!
