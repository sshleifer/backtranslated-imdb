When I went to the movies to see that, I was expecting some sort of stylish action-action movie implied by the trailers. However, it quickly became clear that this movie wanted to be more. I usually disagree with movies that try to entertain in as many ways as possible. For example, this film tries to mix action with comedy, romance, lightheartedness and serious seriousness all at once. Most of the time, this kind of approach does not work in movies (just look at Batman Forever), but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did it in this case. <br /> <br /> The end result is a very entertaining movie that should appeal to most adult moviegoers. (However, the stomach weakness should really be warned in front of a scene or two.) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller draw a brilliant double act and Ken Stott makes a superb villain. This mix with great costumes and some decent action scenes makes for a very pleasant watch. <br /> <br /> However, for me the big disappointment is that 'The Gentleman Highwayman' was a real success opportunity for some good dialogue, but the script definitely lacked punch and there were only a few guts. Okay, the lines were not that bad, but for me it raises a problem with recent British movies. Apart from a few notable exceptions, today's screenplays are relatively mediocre compared to some of Hollywood's efforts.
