Sharky's Machine is easily one of Burt Reynolds' best efforts. It is also one of the best contemporary crime thrillers. The film is erotic and violent in that it plays the story in Atlanta and gives you (the viewer) a chaotic detective case on a silver platter. Committed and determined, Sharky must stop the murder of Dominoe, a lovely lady of the night whose clientele is anything but ordinary. After a short while, Sharky's Crimefighting Machine uncovers a top-level conspiracy that threatens to damage Atlanta's inner body. As a resident of Metro Atlanta, I remember the excitement in the city during film production. Sharky's Machine does everything to give an accurate representation of Atlanta. Twenty years later and 2,000,000 people later, the film has proven itself. Trust me, Atlanta has not changed. One of the highlights of the painting is Dar Robinson's brave stunt (classic, symbolic finale). It was even featured in That's Incredible, ABC's reality show. It's just a pity that Hollywood does not make enough movies like this. Lean back, popcorn, and watch the sterling silver cinema.
