I was thrilled to see "the best years of our lives". The drama, script and direction of Master William Wyler (winner of the best director of 1946) is Brilliant. The film is about veterans of the Three World War II, who come home together on a plane and happen to be live in the same city, all reunited with their families. <br /> <br /> The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar winning role) has to adapt to his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and to children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) Unlike before, he went to war. <br /> <br /> The second man Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews in an excellent role) needs to find a good job and adapt to a wife he was only married 20 days before leaving for the war. He begins to find out that she is not the same. <br /> <br /> The third man has a much more difficult accommodation. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his stellar Oscar role) He has lost his hands in the war and has to grapple with the reactions of his family and his fianc√©e 'Wilmas' (played by Cathy O'Donnell) on his heels Has hands, set. All these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scenes. The stories of these men are all beautifully interwoven. <br /> <br /> This film really defines the meaning of a "classic". This memorable drama (winner of the best picture in 1946) is a movie everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I were asked to choose a favorite movie, I would choose this one. <br /> <br /> From 10, I would give "The best years of our lives". An 11th. <br /> <br /> So next time you rent a movie, do not rent this movie, you will not regret it.
