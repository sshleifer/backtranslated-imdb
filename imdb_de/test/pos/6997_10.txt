I really enjoyed this movie. It was nervous to be without sociopaths. Vin Diesel brought the Riddick character to life and made you feel good and bad on different levels. <br /> <br /> I also saw Iron Giant and Vin is perfect. (The snowmobile movie - oh yes, his name is "Triple-X" or "xXx" - was a weak example of his work.) In Pitch Black, he plays at most one anti-hero. I do not think you can do anything wrong when Vin plays in a movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood could use him as an adventure action movie star - wrong! I think the script for "XXX" was weak, for which Vin could not act that way. Anyway, Pitch Black is a great scifi - see it! Zafoid
