I totally agree with GarryJohal from the Singapore comments on this film. Quote: 'Yes, non-Singaporeans can not see what the big thing about this movie is. Some of the references in this film fly over the heads of foreign audiences, and it was mostly the Singaporeans who actually "got" them. It is still not quite the truth and as Malaysian Chinese I understand it, although I do not speak Hokkien, because we have similar problems in Malaysia. I know it's really hard to understand and accept this as a reality, but it's definitely NOT a "real story". I was delighted to see this film outside Malaysia because it is definitely banned in Malaysia as well. Which means you either get it in "illegally copied VCDs or DVDs" or hope someone is kind enough to "share" it on the internet. This is not "another violent teenage drama ......." because it presents the reality that exists in Singapore (and also in Malaysia) in an interesting way (sad + humor). I was just a little sad to know that this film has gone through about 20 cuts in censorship. What a waste!
