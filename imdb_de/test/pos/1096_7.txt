I really liked the film camera made of wood. I think it's a little bit influenced by the Brazilian movie "City of God", but maybe this parallelism between the two possible tracks (crime and art) in social neighborhood is a reality. <br /> <br /> I think the Madiba movies are really beautiful. I do not think it's unrealistic that he shoot such good films because there are many artists who have no education and can really be awesome. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the soundtrack. It is adapted to the pictures. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie ... It's good to show how living in a social environment can be.
