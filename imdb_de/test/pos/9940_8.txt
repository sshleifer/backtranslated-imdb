If you are able to accept his incredible storylines and extravagant style with the extraordinary work of leading Italian horror director OK, then you should spend a great time with Opera. If you do not, you will not. <br /> <br /> Cristina Marsillach plays Betty, a beautiful young opera staff assistant who gets a shot at fame (in an avant-garde production by Macbeth) when the star plays the show is hit by a car. Anyone who has "boarded" will know that Macbeth is a production that carries a curse? And Betty soon discovers that the show in which she is now the star is no exception: A killer systematically pushes the workforce to the theater and poor Betty is nailed down by the sadistic killer (the needles under her eyes to prevent her from doing so to close them!) forced to watch. <br /> <br /> With the help of a little girl crawling through her air - Binging Ducts, her director and agent and a few ravens who saw the killer's face (!!!), Betty discovers her identity the murderer and the truth about their mysterious past. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Opera is a crazy movie with its absurd twists, tortured death scenes and an end that begs the faith. And although director Dario Argento has never been one, say, conventional storylines, this particular giallo is so stupid and offers so many of its signature, stylish accents (all dressed to the max) that it's almost as if it were mit he sees what he can get from each of the following films (sometimes he almost parodies his earlier work). <br /> <br /> That's why I think the movie is so funny! Argento's camera moves are absolutely incredible: slipping, crawling, and even hovering the Opera House over the audience in an amazing scene; The power of Verdi's music blends perfectly with the synth majesty of Claudio Simonetti's score, which adequately accompanies the opulent visuals in a grand manner. and some outstanding set pieces (with Sergio Stivaletti's disgusting Gore FX) prove that nobody makes death better than Argento (look at the breathtaking end of a character with a bullet in slow motion through a door peephole in a door and directly in her eye!). <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
