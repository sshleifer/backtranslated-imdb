I saw Princess of the Nile for the first time when I was about 10 years old. I'm 63 now and never forgot the movie. I have not overcome my fascination for Egypt either. I searched the internet to buy the movie but could not find it. I wonder if this is one of the lost movies in Hollywood. I loved Debra Padget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have such a charisma together. If you asked me about the movie, I could not tell you anything other than who was in it. I vaguely remember a scene on the Nile with Debra Padget, a few other women. I always wanted to see it again. I've never seen it as an escape movie back then, but I can now see where that was probably the case. I hope they will put it on DVD and I'll see it again before I die. It was a wonderful movie.
