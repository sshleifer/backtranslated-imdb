Tex Avery's tenure as Director of Drawing for MGM was one of the brightest moments in the history of cartoons in the 1940s and 50s. His cartoons were exceptionally imaginative and surreal with many funny touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes that pop up when a man sees a girl, impossible stunts and uninterrupted action were the trademarks of these movies. <br /> <br /> This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and is among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his husband ... although in this case a wolf has escaped from prison. Throughout the film, despite many crazy stunts, Droopy keeps up with this rogue until the wolf finally gives up, because Droopy seems to be everywhere! It's full of funny jokes and full of laughter.
