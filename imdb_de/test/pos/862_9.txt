Wow, Stella shorts are great! Many patrons of The State and Stella, the TV show. I never knew Stella could get any better than Stella TV or even Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I never knew that short comedies could be good. My favorites were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods and David arranging a meeting with his long-lost cousin Greg. I think about all that David was the funniest. It's funny if it makes no sense. I like the music in the shorts. That's something I respect a lot. They always had good taste in music. I wish they were still shorts, either that or the sitcom. I hope they continue to make good and funny comedy.
