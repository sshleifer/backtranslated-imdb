A friend of mine asked, "Do not you have to be pro-euthanasia to like this movie? Is it a mistake of the movie to conclude that most of the cross-delegates want to end their lives?" Interesting questions. <br /> <br /> As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), there is only one tetraplegic who wanted to end his life in The Sea Inside. I think Ram贸n Sampedro was also involved in the film. He wants to die. He fights for his right to decide his death. He speaks for himself and not for other quadriplegics. Although his pioneering work, depending on his own perspective, may prove beneficial to the lateral thinker on the road, his primary goal is a personal goal. But this movie does (in my opinion anyway) that it forces us viewers to face the in-depth questions that my friend has so narrowly posed. After my first visit to The Sea Inside, I went home in a conflictless blur. I tried to reconcile with this annoying idea; Why would Ram贸n want to die? Given the love, care, and sacrifices so unconditionally sprayed on Ram贸n by the people around him, why would he stubbornly stick to his injured decision? On my second visit, Ram贸n and the lawyer joined in a common thinking. There was an insightful observation: "... total dependence is at the expense of intimacy." Most people long for such intimacy. Of course, how much we value such "needs" depends largely on the person. As a person of familial bias, I've been working hard with the supervisors of this film. Why can not Javier consider the sacrifice and love of his family and friends? Is he blind to everything? I would not think The miracle of The Sea Inside is therefore the enlightening account of a very humanistic tug-of-war. If we are faced with the guardianship of a healthy but incompetent lover who has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intention to die, what is the right one? Is it a pious gesture to care for this loved one and keep him alive against his will? Does it show the value of our love? Or is it just comforting our "selfish" fears of irreplaceable loss? If their caregivers have so much understanding, would their invalid accusations not also be an overlooked sacrifice if they submit to the total dependence of others on survival? Rhetorical or not, how much is "dignity" worth to an individual? Is life (or death) with dignity a privilege or a right? If we really care for one person and love him, then should we also respect his eventual choices in life (as in death)? A flood of questions that the movie may have asked, with answers that I am unable to deliver. <br /> <br /> In an effort to delineate the perks of pro-life or pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a gray sea, the most deeply affected people, the caregivers, and those who supervise, recorded. The Sea Inside therefore tried to portray the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them. Intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the essence of the "victim" is never one-sided. In this tug-of-war we should strive not to gain any arguments, but to observe attentively and hopefully determine who the "stronger" party that sacrifice is. <br /> <br /> The Sea Inside is a sobering movie. It opened my eyes to things I did not want to see. And I'm grateful for that.
