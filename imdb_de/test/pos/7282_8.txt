I was pleasantly surprised to find a very enjoyable movie that caught my full attention. I'm a horror fanatic and I see almost everything in this genre, but Dead Line has managed to freak me out. The pace is very clever and Andr√©s Bagg performs well as a desperate man. What is under the main presentation? A journey to madness. How can you end up like this? Martin Sanders asks himself while he sees a homeless man talking to himself, alone in the street. At the end of the film, the character of Aaron Mandel poses the same question, while he sees another homeless man doing the same; not yet aware that this homeless man is Martin Sanders and answers the question about the beginning of the film. The broken glasses in two are a clear symbol of break and separation ... of the personality. The end is chiming and you only know that a sequel must be made.
