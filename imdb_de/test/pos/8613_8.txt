While not determined by a fantastically ingenious plot, Sex is Comedy effectively focuses on the relationship between film director and crew during the film production process, while successfully addressing the dynamics of human relationships and, in particular, the problems and problems faced by actors involved in the filming of sex scenes , The director 'Jeanne' is consistently prominent, because she is the one who drives the story instead of a narrator and gives us many small pearls of wisdom for reflection. She is a social commentator, referring to her assistant and others to the problems she finds with her new male leadership by connecting him to a male stereotype. Their ambiguous relationship is typical of human nature. the tendency to be fickle. On the one hand, the two seem close; If he is not in sight, she claims to hate him. Jeanne also addresses his masculine pride, perhaps in a feminist attitude of things. <br /> <br /> The taboo on obscenity is raised: the content of the sex scenes is not considered obscene, but beautiful, because it is fake to make obscenity - that is the reasoning of the director. However, this is doubly ironic because the film we see is in itself a construct within a construct. <br /> <br /> There's more to this film than just relationships. Watching this movie is not just about analyzing it to highlight a specific meaning. One can enjoy the natural lighting that permeates the film. This makes it realistic and believable.

If you're looking for some fun that you can see on a Sunday afternoon that's not too heavy and you still think, that's it.
