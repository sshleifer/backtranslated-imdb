I used to walk past it often, mainly because the summary sounded so cheesy, so "Love American Style". It turned out to be very good, very well done. The two outstanding features are dialogue and action. Great cast The premise is indeed well executed and there are not many weak moments. What impressed me most was how many times you thought the wheels would roll out of the car, and instead the car, so to speak, brings the bends and the movie flies on. There are some nice little deals, especially the relationship that develops between the character of former Conan buddy Andy Richter. I would also like to mention that the accompanying music was good.
