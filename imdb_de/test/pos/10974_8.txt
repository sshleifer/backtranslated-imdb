No bullets, no secret agents, a fun, funny and believable story. Meeting with some producers / actors in this movie in the theater. They personally seemed to be as interesting as their characters on the canvas. You can not hear about this movie on TV with commercials in high dollar, but it's definitely worth it. I spent $ 8 on a movie ticket for many other movies that were not that entertaining. I am looking forward to future projects of this production company.
