I saw this stage show when it aired on PBS in 1983. At the time, I was involved in a local theater and saw some incredible things from the Dell Arte Players, but Bill Irwin got me on the ground. <br />> I was most impressed by how a man of his size (he is quite tall and fleshy) can fold himself into a small box without a fitting break and he crosses the stage in a dead run without a sound moved from his feet when he decided to make no noise. <br /> <br /> Most amazing for me was that he had gotten up in this performance during the Jack-in-the-Box / puppet play. Those who have seen this show will remember that as he climbed out of the box and collapsed on the floor with limp limbs, he "pulled up" his head like a string and did not just get up his feet, but to a full ballet point and did it in a flowing, seemingly effortless motion. Just think of the strength, the grace, the balance, and the concentration that such a series of movements must take to achieve them the way they did! Add to his physical ability his strong and credible characterization skills, and there is a consummate actor / actor. My chin flickered on the move and my heart broke in portraying a puppet determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box. <br /> <br /> As for the unfortunate (yes "tragic" would be a better word) unavailability of this piece in the form of home media. I've found that many works by PBS are not available on tape or DVD. Sometimes PBS shows are available directly after a show for a limited time, but they rarely last long on the market. There are of course exceptions, but these are mainly the science and history documentaries. Seldom remains a feat for a long time in print, provided it was created from the beginning as a VHS / DVD. I do not know why that should be. Certainly, PBS could use the revenue from the home media marketing of their shows, but they do not benefit much from it. That's a shame. There are many things I've looked at on PBS and I'd like to own, but songs like "The Regard of Flight" are, I'm afraid, a one-time, one-time treatment that will never be repeated on PBS again and never for the purchase of home media available. That's really shit. I'm lucky enough to have found it when I did. Oh, yes, our local library has received a copy of The Regard of Flight. And yes? It was stolen.
