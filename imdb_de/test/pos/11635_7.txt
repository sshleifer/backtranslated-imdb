Mighty Like A Moose is one of many short films directed by Leo McCarey with Charley Chase. What a dandy is that! Charlie and his wife are both undergoing a plastic surgery to improve their vile features that are unknown to each other. They then meet at a party and become in love with each other. Now they can not find out each other that they are cheating. That's the absurd premise of this desperate farce. Vivien Oakland, one of the few comic series that has had a thriving career long after the Silents, is perfectly suited as Charley's Long Nose Woman. Charley has a horrible case of canine teeth that are quickly shipped to the dentist. After one party was ransacked by police for no other reason than raiding, Charley and his wife desperately try to avoid home because they fear that changes in appearance will become known. Both were photographed at the party with their new features. The hilarity at home culminates in Charley, who tries to teach a lesson to his wife. Of course, the non-good nick is the new Charley that his wife first recognizes before Charley keeps a lesson in fidelity. This is one of Charley Chase's better efforts. *** of 4 stars.
