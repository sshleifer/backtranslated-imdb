I saw this title again on Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew, who was 17 years old, to see the same with me. I'm 35 and he's 17. He liked it and so did I. It's still funny, a bit childish, but still very clean conversation. Satish Shah is funny in several roles. This sitcom would still do better than many of the last series on TV. But obviously some people like the worldly tariffs that come out today. It would have been nice if Shafi Inamdar had continued in all seasons. He is no longer alive today. I would wish if anyone could list all the episodes here. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the lines "Yeh Kya Ho Raha HAi"? Ka Experience hai "<br /> <br /> and the title track Yeh Jo hai Zindagi, who teach us to live life as it comes and to enjoy it. The life of ordinary people. <br /> < I still like the sitcom, sometimes it may not seem so funny, but certain episodes are still funny.
