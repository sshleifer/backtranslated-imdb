This movie is well-filled, often stupid and always funny. Lemmon and Matthau work perfectly on their tag team. Brent Spiner is just a rebellion as a selfish tyrant of a cruise director. From the first "Rabbit krishna" to the last "You should pay him fifty dollars for calling you two stallions," I thought, that this was a fun, entertaining comedy
