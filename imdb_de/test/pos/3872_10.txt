from TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who appears as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find out who murdered his father. One week after his father's death, a preacher, Reverend Packer, was dead. Reggie was probably the one who killed him, but did he do that? Did Reggie Reverend kill Packer or was it some kind of setup? Back in the Day also has some romantic scenes. You see, Reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter and J-Bone does not approve of his lover. When J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, Reggie learns that forgiveness is in love. But what does J-bone do, does it work? Will Reggie and his girlfriend separate or bring them closer together? I like this movie because you wonder what's going to happen next, and this or that happens. I like movies with excitement! You want to be in the movie to see things. I also like this movie because everything fits together, if you really pay attention!
