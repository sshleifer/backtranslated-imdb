I enjoyed this film, which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love-hate relationships along with action scenes and carefree moments in which the miners counteract hard army discipline. All main characters are well staffed. John Wayne or Robert Mitchum would probably have been able to play the lead role as well, but Victor Mature seems to be a wayward, contentious Tarzan. Reminds me of his role as Samson, another difficult but not impossible man to be tamed. <br /> <br /> The miners in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism, as the era of pure trapper miners is quite a bit ended 20 years ago with the collapse of Western beaver populations and the fashion market for beaver pelts. This story is supposed to take place shortly before the civil war ends in Oregon. Judging from the volcano in the background of the opening scene (probably Mt. Lassen), the fictional fortress was somewhere in a remote part of the Cascades, as we never see other civilians. However, there is much contradictory evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud, the warrior who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fortress, is the namesake of a very famous Sioux war chief who led a highly successful campaign in 1865/66 to destroy the newly-built army fortifications in Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie (eastern Wyoming) is mentioned as not far from the fictional fortress. The Plain tribe of Assiniboines mentions that it has joined Red Cloud. So this aspect of history has a general resemblance to the historical fact. <br /> <br /> It may be of interest to note certain similarities between the plot of this story and that of John Ford's "Fort Apache". In both cases, we have a fortress commander who had recently assigned his first border post to Native American issues. He underestimates the military prowess of his opponents and regards them as little more than cannon fodder to advance his career. In both films, he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy. Even the Greenhorn Commander annoys a subordinate, who has many years of experience with the native Indians and wants to tell him what makes sense and what he should not do. In both films, there is a burgeoning relationship between a woman who is very close to the commander's heart and a subordinate with whom the commander does everything possible to suppress it. Obviously, the commander must be eliminated so that these romances can run to completion. <br /> <br /> I also see some similarities with "The Misfits". The soldiers as a whole, including the commander, are a kind of dropout (as one of them admits): Most of them have "problems" or are mere recruits who have no experience with Native Americans. The commander's wife is evidently the only woman in or near this fortress, therefore, by nature she is a loser, with a husband who is unsure of his future in the army. The trappers, on the other hand, are dropouts who do not really want to accept military or civilian discipline, but are still cut off from their former free spirit is the recent army-generated antagonism of Red Cloud. <br /> <br /> Finally, we can compare this story to Anthony Mann's later film "The Far Country," in which Jimmy Stewart plays with Stewart. In the end, he may decide to be a loner cowboy again, after all Mature 's character is not an appetizing new way of being his own boss: Red Cloud has made life outside the army in this region too dangerous to think about, as well as being obsessed with the Commander' s wife
