Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but in every way a solid streak. Everything from acting to cinematography was solid. Not a perfectly linear line, but there was nothing you could not see. Maybe a bit melodramatic at points, but still a pretty decent movie. Definitely worth a visit. If you are not sure which movie to rent on the weekend, give it a try. Even if you do not feel like running and buying it, I found it quite rewarding.
