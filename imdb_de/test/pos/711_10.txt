Peter Strauss, seen in mini-series and TV series, often receives an unfairly high percentage of bad reviews - usually from casual observers who have watched ten minutes of the movie and jumped half way through a channel. Well, I've just read the other 20 reviews for this movie and I'm glad that not a single bad word was said about The Jericho Mile. That should be enough to buy the movie !! <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss has won an Emmy for his role in this film, and once you look at him you'll see why he deserves it so much. <br /> <br /> I wanted to be objective and tried to criticize this movie. Instead, I argued with every one of my possible picks. That's what true, realistic filmmaking is all about. This is not your typical Hollywood sensation, where everything is exaggerated. It's so realistic and lifelike that people thought it was based on a real event !!
