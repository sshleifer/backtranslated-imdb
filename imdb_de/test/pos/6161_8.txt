This is such a nice movie! It not only shows war, it also has friendship and love. The life of Slama is full of sadness, every aspect of his life fell apart. I can only imagine how he would feel when his friend made the ultimate sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I see a slight resemblance to 'Pearl Harbor', which is also about two pilots who fall in love with the same woman. However, this film is much better done, as this does not portray the woman as unfaithful and laid back. The friendship between the two men is also much more convincing and well structured. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
