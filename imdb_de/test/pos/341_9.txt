In Sri Lanka, a country separated by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the separatist organization Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organization, has claimed an estimated 68,000 lives since 1983. Human rights groups have said that as a result of the war, more than a million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps. The impact on children and families involved in the conflict is being dramatically dramatized by acclaimed Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 A Peck on the Cheek, which won several awards at the National Film Awards in India. While the Civil War merely provides a backdrop to the story of a young girl's journey of discovery, the human war costs are made clear, and Ratnam gives the battle a universal context by pointing to the worldwide weapons smuggler as a source of misconduct. Beautifully photographed in Southern India by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran in a setting that reflects the terrain of Sri Lanka, the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year-old girl looking for her real mother makes in the middle of the fighting in Sri Lanka. Played with deep feeling and expressiveness of P.S. Keerthana is raised in a memorable notion of a loveable middle-class family with two younger brothers after their birth parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) had to flee when the fight broke out and they stayed in a Red Bear camp Loving flashback, we see Amudha's adoptive parents, father Thiru (Madhavan), a prominent Tamil writer, and mother Indra (Simran), a television personality, marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker girl. <br /> <br Young Amudha has no idea that she will be adopted until she jumps abruptly on her ninth birthday, according to her parents' previous agreement. As she plays, Thiru almost states in a businesslike tone that "you are not our daughter" and the reaction is predictable. Distraught, she asks who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave it up, and so on, but few answers are to be expected. Amudha runs away several times until her parents are ready to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her true mother, who is now a fighter for the Tamil separatists. The immersion of the family in the reality of civil war leads to traumatic moments and difficult decisions, which are usually done by Ratnam with skill. An episode in which the family was caught in a crossfire seemed awkward. <br /> <br /> A Peck on the Cheek is of course a Bollywood-style movie, and that means tons of music and melodrama. The melodrama did not disturb because of the strong performances of the main actors; However, I found the musical dramatization of songs by A. R. Rahman with their smooth, high production technique and the fast cut in the video clip in the music style of the mood of the film. The compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is narrated transcend the boundaries of the film. Tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country, for being too clich√©d and too commercial, but A Peck on the Cheek is both an entertaining film and a film that addresses serious issues. That the borderline between art and commerce is successful is not a rejection but a tribute.
