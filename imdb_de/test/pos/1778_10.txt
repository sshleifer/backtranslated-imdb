A brutally simple story of murder and capital punishment by the state. So painfully slow and accurate in the description of the death penalty (from the preparation of the gallows to the victim he holds in his own pants before dying), he has the power to change your mind about the death penalty. The entire Decalogue stems from this story: The Decalogue writer was the powerless lawyer who tried unsuccessfully to defend and then comfort the defendant.
