It's always a well-known and important director's tool to set the atmosphere of a movie within the first 5 minutes. In the crucial opening scenes, the film was to prevail and draw attention to the audience and be interested in the rest of the film. Here, in "Mute Witness", we find a good example of this. <br /> <br /> * Scene Spoiler * <br /> <br /> In the first 5-10 minutes, the movie very Hitchcockian scene of a pretty blond lady in her apartment opens with the radio on. She wanders around, applying lipstick, getting ready and ignoring the news of a serial killer. Of course, the serial killer is in her house, monitoring her movements with a knife in her hand. She hears a noise, looks into a room and her partner is in a pool of blood. At the point of her screams, she turns around to face the knife-wielded madman who repeatedly kicks her down in a brutal and terrible act ... <br /> <br /> ... then something strange happens. As the woman cramps in her agony, the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to see his victim die. Before finding his lighter, his cigarette is lit ... by someone else in the room! The camera pans out, and we realize there are more and more people in the room, taking notes, filming some, recording death, and that the lady needs a terribly long time to die, and she also does a very mischievous job. When the audience realizes what is going on and the whole scene is part of a movie, the exciting and horrible scene takes on an element of humor. <br /> <br /> * End Scene Spoiler * <br /> <br /> I have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. On the one hand, the atmosphere of the entire film is perfectly represented. A thriller in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma, with some very confusing and even black-humorous moments. It conveys a central theme (the difference between a "movie death" and a "snuff movie death," a theme that will be discussed later in the film), and finally introduces the viewer to the characters. Everything as quiet as possible. <br /> <br /> Mute Witness's storyline revolves around Billy Hughes, an American special effects makeup artist who works on the set of the film and shoots in a large warehouse in Moscow. Billy can not speak, but she communicates in sign language through her sister. After the filming of one evening, Billy is accidentally locked in the warehouse and in her attempt to escape witnesses how two crew members make a first pornography film, but turns out to be a snuff film. Suddenly her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely enthralling. Billy's saving grace and her handicap is the fact that she can not utter a sound. (In my opinion, one of the best aspects of the movie is the fact that it is not filled with screaming women). There are some extremely disturbing moments and some great sets for real excitement (the corridor and the elevator shaft are perfect examples). The timing is fluid and the entire first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film introduces new concepts. While there are still some exciting moments, the focus is on plot rotations. New characters are introduced, and it is unclear which side they are on. While there is nothing wrong with the second half of the film, it does not quite reach the first half. There are a few nice moments of black humor that perfectly juxtapose and mark some very dramatic scenes, but there are also some very lame comedy moments (especially of Billy's sister and her fianc√©, who is currently the director of the film) Billy is working), which almost ruin the movie just because they are misplaced and / or misplaced and ruin the tempo. - In the end, the spins come faster and faster, and the climax of the film is as tense as in the first half. <br /> <br /> There are several things that really make the movie work. The communication barriers to which Billy is exposed, both mute and American in Moscow, mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation. The actress who plays Billy, Natasha Zudina, does wonderful work in the film, with an appealing on-screen presence and a brilliant performance, and finally the direction as a whole, but especially in the first half of the film. This is really a study in Alfred Hitchcock's Suspense / Thriller movie techniques. As already said, the disappointments in the movie are to be added by some terrible comic relief moments that really are not necessary. There is already a consistent and effective streak of dark humor that appears in the movie without the characters of Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (The Sister and the Filmmaker) turning their scenes into an unusual sit-com. Despite these inadequacies, the movie is a thoroughly funny thriller and ideal for a group visit to Halloween. (Certainly better than the usual Slasher horror movie ...!)
