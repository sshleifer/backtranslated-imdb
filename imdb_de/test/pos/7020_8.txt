Dirty Dancing - I think everyone has seen this movie before. As a kid, I can remember that I loved this movie and watched it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Now that I'm a bit older, I bought the DVD and STILL was not disappointed with the performance. <br /> <br /> Swayze and Gray create the atmosphere for this film, even though they claim they can not get along. The chemistry in the film is incredible! As the film progresses, we are drawn into their relationship and believe in each and every one of their actions. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is amazing, the music adds only to the romantic mood of the movie and adds the relationship between baby and Patrick. <br /> <br /> The last scene makes this movie who I can forget the famous line "Noboby Baby in the corner". The song is perfect and the dancing is incredible! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone, no matter what their age, it's just a fun movie everyone can enjoy 8/10.
