Good shots of ships and airplanes from the First World War complete this outstanding war drama on the Adriatic. Walter Huston is excellent as the commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings. The safety of the ship and the mission must always come first. Robert Montgomery is the lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role a leader must play in combat. He makes bad decisions, endangers the submarine and its crew, but eventually becomes a "real man" after being court-martialled and fired by the Navy. Robert Young plays as First Lieutenant and Jimmy Durante as Chef. Parallel to the war drama is an equally important wartime love triangle between Montgomery and Madge Evans, who plays Huston's daughter and the wife of a tragically injured aviator. Recommended.
