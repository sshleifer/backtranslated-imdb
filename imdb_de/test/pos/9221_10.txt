I loved that, but I'm an 80-year-old child. I loved Rainbow Bright all my childhood. I do not know if the kids would be very interested in the show these days, mine do not. (But that's alright, I bought it for myself anyway, I just brought the little one with me so the guy at the box office would not make me look funny.) I love the non-violent drama and colorful scenery. It just reminds me of an easier time before cartoons had more violence than our local news can legally show. :) Although I may be a bit biased on this topic. After all, I was Rainbow Bright for 6 years in a row for Halloween ........ I wonder if they make a Rainbow Bright Adult Costume. Lol.
