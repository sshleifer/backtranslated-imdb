Another masterpiece that needs a DVD release, but some libraries have the VHS and it's worth looking for. Just a brilliant piece about many things, especially euthanasia, "respectability," religion, and basic human relationships. The script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to cope with a problem such as a handicapped child, but to bind the parents in their love of "Jo" and each other. The couple, Alan Bates and Janet Suzman, are perfectly matched, both in the acting virtuosity and in the realization of their deep, intelligent characters. <br /> <br /> I recently saw Bates' brilliant performance in "Butley" He was released as a movie a few years after "Joe Egg" and plays a teacher in both fields, cynical, intellectual and funny, though Butley is here much darker than his character from Bry. When you make such great performances in "The Go-Between," "Women in Love," "Whistle Down the Wind," "The Caretaker" and "Georgy Girl," not to mention the obvious "King of Hearts" and " Zorba the Greek, and I would say Alan Bates had a comparable career as Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and the other great British actors of his time. <br /> <br /> Director Peter Medak also had it One of my absolute favorites "The Ruling Class" appeared in the same year (1972) as "Joe Egg", which contains one year's occupation in everyone's book. He had a kind of spotty filmography ("The Krays" was another highlight), but these two jewels will mark him as a great director.
