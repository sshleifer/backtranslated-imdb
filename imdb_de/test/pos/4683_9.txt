I really enjoyed the movie. Everything in The Italian Job is easy. An explosive guy, a safe cracker, a computer genius, a man with wheels and a man with a spectacular plan to steal 35 million without a weapon. This movie is entertaining, though it has no central idea. It is a non-stop movie with many actions. The whole stunt work is beautiful. From the speedboat hunt in Venice at the beginning to the pursuit of the busy streets in Los Angeles, where three mini-coopers and even a helicopter were involved. The best chase I've ever seen. I like the mini-coopers. The expert thieves used mini-coopers for the escape cars. The hunt between the mini-coopers and the motorcycles is amazing. They hunted the underground. I can say there was not a moment when I got bored. Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def and Edwin Norton were really good at the job , I like the actors in this movie. I've seen many heist films, but The Italian Job & is one of my favorites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. I love this kind of movie after all.
