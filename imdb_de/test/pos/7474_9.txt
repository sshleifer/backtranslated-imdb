I happened to see this movie in Paris. I accidentally went to the wrong theater and when I realized that it was not a preview or a short film, I was addicted. <br /> <br /> Paulina has a phenomenal job to keep her attention with her acting. I can not say enough how impressed I was with her portrayal of this real Femme. The rest of the cast is also very good. Do not get me wrong, this is not the best movie ever made, but since I did not know anything about it, I had a lasting and very positive impression! After watching him, I did not stop talking about this movie for three weeks.
