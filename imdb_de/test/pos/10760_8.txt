From the opening scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE (an interplay of tribal customs photographed by the anthropological father of young narrator Finn Earl, showing why this South American Ishkanani tribe is so fierce), the direction of the film is nebulous: let's take a look dark comedy about comparing life in the streets of New York with uncivilized peoples, or is this a message movie with a more serious intention? As history progresses, the line between entertainment and philosophical effect becomes more and more apparent. Griffin Dunne's directing of Dirk Wittenborn's adaption of his novel may sometimes be somewhat negligent as it deviates from the development of rational acts, but in the end there is a strong enough end effect to fill the gaps he has created. <br /> <br /> Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his addictive masseuse / sexually obsessed mother Liz (Diane Lane) in New York and waits for the summer when he goes on an excursion with his anthropologist father South America (a father he only knows from letters and videos) when drug abuse abruptly changes his life: Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland), one of Liz's most affluent clients, rescues the out-of-control family and puts them into his ten Acres of land, the epitome of wealth and power. In return for Osborne's private masseuse, Liz and Finn can live in the mansion with the "dirty rich" Osbornes - the daughter Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and the grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his doctor lead Liz on the desiccation path and Finn ties to Osborne and his grandchildren. Despite the differences between the poor and the rich, the housing situation works - for a while. Incidents happen to change feelings, and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant, a turning point in the film and Finn's view of the Osborne family. Osborne reveals his past to Finn, and together they manage to learn the truth about Finn's troubling incident - and also about the fate of the affluent class. <br /> <br /> The film uses many tribal activity clips throughout the movie. draw some disturbing parallels for some of the more demanding scenes. It works well for this viewer, but if the director decides to bring the tribesmen into full stature as part of the Osborne estate, the concept feels as though the audience has to be forced to "get it." The various subplots between the maid Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and Finn as well as the introduction of the obese chalk artist Whitney (Branden Williams) express the credibility by emphasizing the line between the rich and the underclass Sutherland, Lane and Yelchin are strong enough to forgive the mistakes of the film. Not a great movie, but with many worthy ideas that pass on the canvas of a project that often feels lost in the orientation struggle. Grady harp
