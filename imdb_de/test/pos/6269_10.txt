Blademaster is definitely a memorable entry in the swords and sorcery category. I found Blademaster, along with Quest for the Mighty Sword, in a thrift store that was attended by people with mental disabilities. Credible sets and costumes, good sword fighting and a beautiful warrior make Mila a pleasing watch. A few problems, but there were many details in the plot that did not fit exactly like the cavemen. I did not understand her purpose. This film could have really benefited from some monsters. The snake was cool, but I think she borrows a bit from Conan. However, any primitive movie with someone ending in a hanglider is fine with me (see Yor and Battle for Endor). I think Ator is cool! Oh, and was anyone else reminded by the villain at Gallager or is it just me? I give blademaster a 7/10
