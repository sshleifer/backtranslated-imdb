Spin-offs are usually unsuccessful for someone who does not know, as most of the original characters are missing. <br /> <br /> Here they are and you essentially could not ask for a better ensemble, a stupid little cartoon that has nothing else to do but entertain. <br /> <br /> J. P. Manoux replaces David Spade and admirably preserves the Kuzco's ego and does not seem to be as annoying as Spade's character (a character Spade has been making for decades and getting on his nerves after a while). He has a softer voice, but it fits somehow. <br /> <br /> Eartha Kitt, who plays her role as Yzma, is brilliant. She has not really received much praise since her turn as Batwoman centuries ago, except perhaps for her vile role in Boomerang. It's funny how much the character looks like her. <br /> <br /> And Patrick Warburton. There is no way he can not be funny unless he was thoroughly wasted in Men in Black 2. I have been a fan of him since Seinfeld, but unlike this character, he plays a really sympathetic man who does not understand such beautiful things. <br /> <br /> The animation is really beautiful, as is usually the case with Disney, but sometimes the character design is a bit overblown. Well. Two out of three are not bad.
