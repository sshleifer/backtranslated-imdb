Before I start my review, there is a short lesson in Australian slang that can help you to see the movie and understand some of the other reviews from Australia and overseas. <br /> <br /> In the Australian slang, "thongs" are a pair of rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same American word that refers to the underpants), "stubbies" are a trademark of Australian Short, a "Stubby "is a small can-bottle of beer and a" stubby-holder ". is a foam isolator for a small bottle of beer. <br /> <br /> If you love black comedies about small-time criminals, you will love this movie, unfortunately many IMDB people with weak stomachs and no understanding of dark humor. I have reviewed this film, which unfortunately makes this movie rather mediocre appears as he is. Many reviewers have also compared it to Lock / Stock and Pulp Fiction, although it's the same genre, but it's a completely different and original style. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have also posted this movie for you With the dead brother of Heath Ledger's characters, to open and direct the narrative for this film without looking closely enough at the movie to see that his brother was killed by the same villain who wants to kill the character of the Gentiles enough for most to understand. <br /> <br /> This movie is also reminiscent of Lock / Stock and Reservoir dogs, as it is the director / writer debut feature, and for a debut feature there are these two films in which Act like Lock / Stock and Reservoir Dogs I rate this movie as 10/10 for a directorial debut, and unlike Tarantino and Ritchie, Jordan can not live up to his expectations in his later films like Ned Kelly. <br /> This movie is meant to be one of your definitive add to your DVD collection and is one that easily holds up to several visits.
