Victor Sjostrom, the grandfather of Swedish cinema, directed this crass, existential film about reconciliation, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption and the darkest moments of the human situation. He plays the lead role as David Holm, a not good guy who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways, and then later acting with the driver of the phantom car about his soul: death Unlike many silent movies in At this time, scenes with exaggerated scenes are almost absent. The tempo gets boring with his well-known Dickensian narrative. However, looking back at the film and comparing it to others of its time is a very daring and unique film. The audience at that time was not exposed to such a theme, and the cinematography is enormous, symbolic and is accompanied by double exposure effects and multi-layered flashbacks. It's a really scary and scary movie for teenagers. <br /> <br /> If you look at the film, you can easily see what later influences this film had on Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of the great Bergman themes can be seen here. Later, of course, Sjostrom played in Bergman's masterpiece about Alienation and Loneliness: Wild Strawberries. This would be Sjostrom's last performance as an actor. Sjostrom is based on the novel by the Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.
