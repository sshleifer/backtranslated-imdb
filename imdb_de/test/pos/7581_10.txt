Anderson's animation can easily match that of Pixar and goes far beyond what I've seen at Disney so far. While some say the story is too abstract, I find it a thought-provoking and refreshing change from the exaggerated characters and limping animals typically found in animated shorts. It's an interplanetary version of CASTAWAY! Anyone who has left the safe haven of home and gone alone to a lonely, frightening place will easily identify with this abandoned microbe. Excellent work, Mr. Anderson! <br /> <br />
