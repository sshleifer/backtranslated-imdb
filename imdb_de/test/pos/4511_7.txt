Greetings from the darkness. The film is based on the mega-bestseller by the writer Khaled Hosseini and gives us an idea of ​​the ugliness of the Afghanistan invaded Afghanistan and the terror of the Taliban. Director Marc Foster adds a gem to his resume, which already includes "Monster's Ball", "Finding Neverland" and "Stranger Than Fiction" share in the next generation. This is a story of honor, courage and loyalty and is an unusual story. Some great scenes of the boys when they're kids and then some really amazing scenes while Amir returns as an adult to find Hassan's imprisoned son. The acting is consistently solid without an actor stealing the screen. Although it is not a pleasant story, it is certainly significant and hearty. In addition, a short shot of Midnight Oil in the pool hall is a welcome gift.
