Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated psychiatric hospital in the country to become a full-time nurse. She is confronted with a colorful group of lunatics and a seemingly crazy supervisor. Is Dr. Masters everything she seems to be? <br /> <br /> Do not go down the drain, it's one of the best low-budget movies in the genre, and why people always do that is a mystery to me. The drama is excellent, my favorite performance was Betty Chandler as Allyson's nymphomaniac. The showers just jump off the screen. You probably will not have to say "It's just a movie, it's just a movie", it's not that scary, but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre that I do. It is very difficult to shoot a spooky movie with little money, and only a few succeed. AX is another cheap movie to look at. Maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any film that does not have great effects and / or is not considered a classic does not stand a chance with the audience. But I think after watching this movie, people will see how important the low-budget horror genre is, and this movie is a classic that distinguishes itself among other wastes.
