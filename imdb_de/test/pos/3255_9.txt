Mild spoilers <br /> <br /> .... and these are "Top Ten of All Time". I accidentally stumbled on "Two Hands" on the IFC (maybe that was all the more special - no excessive expectations) and could not believe I had not heard of it. Now that Heath Ledger is getting better known in the US, I'm sure it's more available. At that time, I told friends about the movie, and nobody could find it anywhere but the occasional IFC show. <br /> <br /> In the Black Comedy / Gangster genre, it still fits in well with my other favorite, and everyone in the movie really seems to have what it deserves. Bryan Brown is weird as the main gangster who makes origami with his little son and plays scrabble with his henchmen. Also funny is the fast fate of a car thief. Even Heath was pretty good at it. At the time, I vaguely remembered him from a short-lived Fox series called 'Roar'. Hopefully Gregor Jordan will score another goal, but for me that's his best yet.
