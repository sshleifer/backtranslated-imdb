I came across this movie at 3am in an Australian hotel room. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see, but a young Russel Crowe. But we did not meet the phone Russell Crowe threw, and we loved it in the States. To my surprise, this movie was incredibly creative and hilarious. It shows a group of clumsy teenagers with funny stories about strange sexual experiences, including a smooth salesman, prostitute and an unusual sexy mom. If you are lucky enough to come across this movie, I would strongly recommend recording it. I have to say that this movie was incredibly entertaining and I thank the good people from Australia who made the film ...
