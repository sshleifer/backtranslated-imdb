I'll make that short and sweet. Not surprisingly, you did not use it for this movie. This is a story about the power, beauty and possibilities of meaningful education. Based on your pathetic composite comments, I can see that your own upbringing has been painfully neglected ... or worse ... completely wasted. Your comments are those of a really ignorant person. I would advise you to do something against this condition ... but in your case, I think it's probably too late. I hope that you yourself do not intend to enter the teaching profession (especially in film studies) because you can only do harm. Oh ... one last piece of advice. If you want to write more opinions in the future, you should really read your work. It will make people take you more seriously.
