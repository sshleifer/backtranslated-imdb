I'll be brief: Normally, I hate movies like this very poisonous ... but there's only something about this movie that just puts me on and does not let me go. Granted, there are some serious flaws (some of the acting is substandard at best and the dialogue is sometimes so bad that it's funny), but there are enough redeeming features to get it through to the end. <br /> <br /> But what is it? Well, it does have a cool little plot - it's by no means original, but it's better than other movies of its kind. The three main stars (Whalin, Johnson, Long) performed pretty decent performances that more than offset the pronounced lack of quality of the understudy (the fat cop and trainer Quinn really upset me), and the script is smooth and witty (even if it's bad in places). <br /> <br /> But the bottom line is, this movie is so cute: Me I grinned all the way through and it has a place in my video collection just because it is so could cheer up everyone. You really have to be a kind of humorless boredom to not like that (I dare someone who did it without a grin !!!). and above all a pleasant clock. You will not regret it! <br /> <br /> ~ Top $ ~
