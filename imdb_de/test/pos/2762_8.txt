I've seen so many bad reviews about Supervivientes de los Andes that I felt compelled to stand for it (or at least I'll try). First of all, of course, that it looks outdated, it was made in the seventies on a very low budget, but that's part of its charm. I like contemporary films, but I also dig the old ones for what they are worth. I'm not the one who feels the urge to only see or like movies with modern treatments and effects; In addition, almost every movie lover likes old-fashioned feature films (who does not like films from El Santo or Plan 9 from space, no matter how high the quality is?). In terms of tempo, it's just a tool to (re-) reduce its costs, and I think the constant dialogues are in order of better character and situation development. Sure, Alive has better effects, but I will not just despise the old one, and I'm not particularly attracted to an event involving people from Uruguay, and for me that's a plus for Supervivientes de Los Andes. It's as if 1970's Canoa, based on a real event, also had a better remake now, due to the advancing technology, but I think I would stick to the one based on the emotions offered regardless of the date of production , <br /> <br /> All this is based on the impact I had on seeing TV for the first time, and nowadays I do not think it has lost any of its original power. Of course, it was a long time ago and I have seen a lot of better movies in every aspect of the cinema, but that does not diminish its true value. It's not a bad movie and I put it on Alive without hesitation. Just give a break.
