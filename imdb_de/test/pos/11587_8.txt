The true story of a Spanish paraplegic, Ramón Sampedro, who fought for decades for the right to euthenization. This movie, along with the best picture winner of the same year, Million Dollar Baby, caused a stir this year with his depictions of disabled people desiring death. Both advocates for the disabled and conservative pro-life groups (unfortunately advocated for the disabled) protested against both films and their Oscar nominations. The nominations also took place during the entire debacle of Terry Schiavo to bring everything into a historical perspective. The protests, especially from the disability groups, against million dollar baby make sense? The film has portrayed the life of a paraplegic as worthless, without wavering. The central character of the film, Maggie Fitzgerald, is paralyzed, seems to receive no counseling, no help, and wants to die immediately. The film is frankly pretty stupid and straightforward. The Sea Inside, based on the true story, is certainly much more thoughtful on the subject. It was most likely placed in the same category as Million Dollar Baby without its demonstrators even seeing it, an incredibly common phenomenon. The movie gives time to many different sides of the argument. And it immediately explains that the desire to die is the protagonist and the protagonist alone. However, some crimes are to blame, and I still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it. First and foremost, the protagonist meets with a paraplegic bishop. I do not look good as he is portrayed. His verbally operated wheelchair is portrayed as absurd, and there is almost a funny sequence in which his female boy toy servants pull him up the stairs in his chair. He can not even reach the room where Ramón is, and one of the children's toys is forced to talk to them. I had to think, maybe if Ramón lived in a more wheelchair-friendly household, he would not spend his entire life in bed and could find life more fulfilling (who knows exactly how the movie is the reality). Director Amenábar (The Others) also includes some ridiculous scenes that attempt to make this film more suicidal about suicide, such as a cross sequence in which Ramón looks thoughtful and his lawyer's baby is born. Apart from a few ugly moments, the movie is very good. It hurts that someone wants to die if he has the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others. In the end, however, our life belongs to us. Should not we have the right to vote? The biggest advantage of the movie are the minor characters and the actors who play them. It shows how Ramón's struggle and decisions affect his surroundings with a fine precision. Especially the family members are great, and Ramón's final goodbye to them is absolutely heartbreaking and moved me to tears. My favorite performance in the film is by Lola Dueñas, who last year showed the best or at least undervalued performance in Almodóvar Volver.
