This film is essentially intended for those who had little or no introduction to hip-hop, especially turntableism, as was the case with the director before the film began. It was cool to focus more than expected on the bay, because NY always gets all the credit, but from the bay Q-Bert worship gets a bit out of control. This movie did not introduce anything new to me, but it changed my mind. This film should convince everyone that it is with Viola and Clavichord at the top.
