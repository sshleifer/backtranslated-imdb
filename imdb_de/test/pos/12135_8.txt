So you think you've seen every mafia movie ever made! Here is one that nobody has heard of. It's a low-budget Quickie B movie shot in the swamps of Jersey. For us mob movie fans it had a bit of everything - sex, violence, cursing and smart guys acting like gafones. While the movie was dominated by violence, I laughed at some familiar scenes that I have since seen on The Sopranos and Goodfellas. Look for a 1977 version of the "Badabing Girls" at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> All of our favorite gangster stereotypes have been featured here. As for realism, "Fugettaboutit"! Joe Pesci was great and portrayed the classic Wise-Guy character we've seen so often over the years. This was probably his first shot and it was a gem. Pesci fans should go to the video store to watch this movie. You have to pay close attention, because it has different names. My copy called it "The Family Enforcer". Here it is known as "The Death Collector". But under whatever name, it should read - A Winner.
