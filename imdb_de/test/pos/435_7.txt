This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge Dance Hall. In many ways, that reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 1940s and 50s, as it has many clich√©s that lead to the inevitable conclusion ("Will the show go on?"). Of course, none of this is new, but it was nice and well done. The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and nice to look at. In many ways, it reminds me of a sexy version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In reality, Ziegfeld was the player who was cleaned up in American film, however. But in FRENCH CANCAN, the characters have full-fledged libidos - but nothing is shown, so the movie is fine for kids.
