It's hard for me to put into words how wonderful that was. Now and then you see a movie that just stays with you. "You Are Alone" is this movie (for me). The movie is constantly in my head and in my heart. I play the scenes every day mentally and analyze them and go through the emotions again, as if I see them for the first time. <br /> <br /> There's nothing I do not like about the movie. Amazing soundtrack !!! The end was perfect. Very emotional touching !!! It was captivating and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I loved Jessica Bohl and her performance was the best I've ever seen. I admired Brittany's strength (what a strong woman). <br /> <br /> The slogan is "When your darkest moments come to life". We never know what we are capable of. Everyone says I would never do that if we really have no idea what we would do in a situation. We are capable of anything and this film goes straight into this topic. The honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Gorman Becherd, for a perfect work of art !!!!
