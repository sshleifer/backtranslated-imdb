Soul Calibur is more solid than ever ... with the new character creation and the evil chronicle of Sword Mode in the Home version. <br /> <br /> The arcade version is more complete The character list is smaller than the home version. This version is definitely the prettier of the two and eliminates all the "doofy / unrealistic" fighting styles of the home version. If you were in any way disappointed with the Home version, or thought it was "too much," you could find a much more sympathetic and straightforward Soul Calibur game in the arcade. Do you think you have what it takes to become a legend?
