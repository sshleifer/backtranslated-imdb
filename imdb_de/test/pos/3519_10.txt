"Just before Dawn" is one of the really good slashers who shivers down your spine every time you look at him! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very good camera work (nice work, Mr. Lieberman!), What makes an extremely well made Slasher! Although it is poor for the '80s, it still has an impact on you after it's over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death has made me stunned! Overall, I give this lost classic 10 out of 10 stars! If you are looking for a gore feast, do not look here. But if you want to shake your back, look at it. There are 6 deaths, one of which is not visible, but it makes you think "how was she killed?" The stranded theme reminded me of the Hills Have Eyes of 1977, which followed roughly the same concept, but in the desert with Canninbals. But, still Slasher fans, give this forgotten gem, I promise you, you'll be amazed!
