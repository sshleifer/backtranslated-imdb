This story, which took place during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, has all the excitement of a good Cold War book or film when a multinational group of foreigners tries to smuggle Jason Robards from Hungary to Austria. However, three things complete the story and make this movie an extremely good movie. <br /> <br /> First, the actors use the actual languages ​​of their roles. The Russian soldiers speak only Russian; the Hungarians only Hungarian; The Germans are only German, except to a lesser extent, to tell the story. Since Debra Kerr is English, she only speaks English, and of course Yul Brynner and some other important accents speak strong accented English as well. As a result, the empathy of the public becomes of the utmost importance for the travelers. The viewer shares all the confusion and tension involved in an illegal border crossing if he / she does not understand any of the languages ​​spoken around him. The audience arouses very strong feelings, and despite the intensive use of foreign languages, the audience is never averse to following the movie. There are no subtitles required. Secondly, <br /> <br />. I was in Hungary in 1995, and I'm telling you that this movie is going right. From gypsy music to dinner, to the underground caves in the buildings where action takes place, to the village scenes, the realism is incredible. If I did not eat in the actual restaurant of the movie, I ate twice. I thought I had actually gone down the main street in this village. (The movie was actually filmed in Austria.) Third, and most importantly, this film combines Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after The King and I) and the magnetism between them is as the story unfolds nothing less than Oscar qualifies. Of course Yul already got an Oscar for playing this relationship, so Acadamy would not give him another, but that's the quality of the movie. Do not miss this.
