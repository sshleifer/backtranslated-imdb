Let's be fair: there are no rules for script writing, so I'm not going to say the movie should be anything but it. I will only say my opinion. OK, I loved the script, the way things are told and the characters are introduced. However, I think that if a game is adapted to the screen, it might try to fit that other medium. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's no surprise that the movie became too theatrical. It is the first movie of the man who cries out loud! What I mean by that is that there are parts in the film - like the city of Nordestina, which reminds a bit of the set of "Hoje ia Dia de Maria" - that feels like we're not in a movie theater. We are in the theater! Lines are too formalized, characters move choreographically, and lightening is clearly meant for a stage. Sure, maybe that was the intention, but that's been done. On stage. Wonderful things have been done when you turn a game into a movie - for example, the beautiful "Closer". When I visited this one, I did not feel like watching a movie. But overall, it was a good thing worth seeing. It's a beautiful love story, sometimes funny and sad for others. My voice is a 7.
