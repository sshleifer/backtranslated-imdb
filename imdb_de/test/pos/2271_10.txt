If anyone has doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber, take a look at his new movie "Everything is Illuminated," which shows a man who is not only one of America's greatest actors, but also a new director who, indeed, is first effort is an inspiration and a harbinger of what should follow. Mr. Schreiber has adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material. The film exceeded our expectations, as we had no ready-made ideas. <br /> <br /> For those who have not watched the movie, you may want to stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Jonathan is a collector. His love for his grandparents is limitless. He watches his grandfather die and his grandmother lie on her shining bed. In a clear moment, this dying woman gives Jonathan a picture and an amber ornament for his collection. If you look at the photo taken a long time ago, you see a young couple together. Watching Jonathan think that it shows the grandfather and his girlfriend who have taken happier times. To see the snapshot, the motivation seems to be for this young man to look in Ukraine for the past of his ancestors. <br /> <br /> Jonathan has made arrangements with his travel agency Heritage Tours from Odessa for his trip to Trochenbrod, the mythical place where his grandfather came from. The agency is run by an elderly man who claims to be blind and his grandson Alex, a man who loves the pop culture that has captured his imagination, as well as his contemporaries in the country. Alex speaks a kind of English that nobody talks about, and his conversation and translation, because Jonathan's use is funny to our ears because he sometimes uses unheard of English terms. The old man insists on taking his dog, Sammy Davis Jr., against Jonathan's request, who does not want to sit next to the growling and barking animal while driving. <br /> <br /> When boarding In search of Trochenbrod, it is clear that his companions, especially the old man, have no idea where he is going. At this point, the movie becomes a road movie as the three characters traveling on the back roads of the country get to know each other better. When the trio reaches the sunflower field with the house at the end, it indicates that it is actually in the right place. Some places are a clear reminder of the conflicts of the past. <br /> <br /> The older woman living in an isolated place is the missing link in the story. She can put things in the right perspective. But here, the focus of the story of Jonathan, who has clearly come to the land of his ancestors, changes to the old man. We watch as this older man remembers things about himself. This, in turn, changes the dynamics of the movie as we find out how much Jonathan and his leaders were constantly connected. Some criticisms on these pages have expressed opinions on the accuracy of history, after all, it is a work of fiction and freedom. It would have been impossible to make another film that contained as much as it contained in the book. The great subdivision of the film into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what is to be seen. Elijah Wood, a great movie actor, does a great job of playing down Jonathan. Mr. Wood makes one of his best appearances in any movie with his interpretation of the lead character. The successful casting of Eugene Hutz as Alex, the Ukrainian tour guide and translator, seems to be an idea made in heaven. Mr. Hutz is about the best in the movie. His mysterious use of English gives the film a funny perspective, which pleases the viewer. Boris Leskin as Alex's grandfather and touring car driver makes a valuable contribution to the film, as well as Laryssa Lauret, featured in the final installment of the film. <br /> <br /> The excellent cinematography of Matthew Libatique brings the splendor of the Czech landscape in all its glory. The music of Paul Cantelon can be heard in the background, so that it adorns the film so that it gives the film a wealth. <br /> <br /> This is above all a success for Liev Schreiber, who for the first time director will certainly go far in what he wants to do next.
