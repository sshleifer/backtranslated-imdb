When I saw the preview of Armored, I thought that the movie would be either a very bad or a very good movie. Luckily the movie was entertaining, exciting and realistic. There is never the perfect crime, and Armored showed why. The film shows perfectly when people get into stressful situations and behave like animals. The last hour of the movie is very entertaining. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. Hard to believe that Dillon is 50 years old. I would buy this movie. I give eight out of ten Armored. No Christmas movie. Have I already written ten lines? Nope! There are not too many action movies anyway. Armored has a lot of excitement, which gives the moviegoer the choice between another comedy.
