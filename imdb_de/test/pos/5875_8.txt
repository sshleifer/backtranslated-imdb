This movie has become more popular than the miniskirt. A triumph in the post-war era that was almost forgotten by the 1970s, except for theatrical students. Recently it has begun to receive recognition as perhaps equal representation of the integration of soldiers into the post-war life that has ever been made (and definitely include films like "The Deer Hunter"). I like it, but my overall picture The rating is somewhere between these extremes. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Three very different soldiers who gathered after the Second World War (The Big One!) Fly home to their Midwestern city and try to resume or create a civilian life. One has a disability, one has a comfortable job waiting for him, and the other has nothing but determination. <br /> <br /> There are some good but unfortunately unequal services. Fredric March won the Academy Award for Best Actor for playing an old sergeant who returns to work at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserves it for "It's a Wonderful Life", which also deserves the Best Picture Award, but this movie has definitely mesmerized the young crowd. As I said, it was fashionable. March has a fantastic scene, a humorous speech reminiscent of a similar incident with the true hero of World War II, Pappy Boyington, and otherwise it is solid but unspectacular. <br /> <br /> I'm going against the grain here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was rightly ignored by the Academy. I barely caught a hint of heat from her. In fact, I always thought she was beating Frederic March for annoying her. She almost forgot every time they were together. There was definitely something missing in her forced smile and more tolerant attitude than her joy. I think all this nonsense that she is "the perfect woman" is only correct if you think a dispassionate housewife from the 50s is your ideal. You can not agree with that, but the voters of the Academy obviously did not do that. She's a big problem with this movie, a terrible miscast. Dana Andrews, a former soda rocker who became a war hero and then finds himself behind the counter, is amazing. He is saddled by a woman who apparently married him before he went to war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks grim. But then he got the chance to march's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic twist), and fireworks exploded. Both are great, but then comes this inequality that permeates this movie. A few moments of pure soap opera penetrate, interrupted by the classic classic line: "I'll break the marriage!" The romance is uplifting and reflects a general state after the war, namely the return of soldiers who find love after their return. <br /> <br /> Speaking of elevation, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic feature in his acting, or is it not acting, that sounds as true today as it did then. He responds to his situation and is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in the entire cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him to his bedroom to show her the truth about his condition. "I'm lucky, I still have my elbows, unlike some of the guys." Really great things. <br /> <br /> The movie has some moments that are rising. It also has some moments that go into the afternoon soaps. Take the good with the bad and see this for the highlights.
