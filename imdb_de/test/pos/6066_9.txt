We just watched the last series in the SBS network and will miss our weekly dose of Danish Delight. My wife and I recorded the show after the Swedish show "The Eagle" came to an end and it seemed to be a very poor substitute for our then favorite show on TV by comparison. Week after week, however, the show grew for me, and although she was not as shiny as the Swedish show and definitely more grim with regard to investigating everyday crime, she certainly provided a very satisfying weekly sightseeing meal. Prior to these 2 shows, I was not really one Fan of the cop genre and can not say that I am now, but the 2 Scandinavian shows really gave us an insight into life in these northern European countries through their special eyes police units.
