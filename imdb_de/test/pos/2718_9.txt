That's how I interpreted the film: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where you saw the villain (Taylor) torturing Ben's hands or nailing him on the wall. The same can not be said of the girls. In the end, you'll also see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message "There was no Taylor". And the whole movie was a fantasy of Ben. During the torture, there was no scene where one of the girls faced Ben or was in the same frame as Ben. It was Taylor all the time. But in reality, Taylor was Ben. If there were two different people, why was there no scene where both were shown in a series? But before you both see together, of course, and that it's just about Ben's imagination. Even when Ben was out of jail, the onscreen text clearly states that Ben's story was unrealistic and there was no place where he had explained (read mine, cars, etc.). Even after Liz Hunter leaves Kristy and returns to find Ben, she does not find him. Why??? Because Ben (Taylor) was looking for the girls. Instead, Kristy has all the time in the world to try Taylor's (Ben) webcam, photos, etc ... <br /> <br /> Somehow it all adds up to a fact that both Kristy and Liz knew that Taylor was Ben. My conclusion, then, is that Ben was schizophrenic and the film in which you see him and Taylor in a picture was nothing more than fantasies of his imagination. Otherwise, if there really was a Taylor, they would have had to find him out if he received all the detailed explanations from Ben.
