Bob Cummings is outstanding in this regard, as this technically brilliant Hitchcock movie is not as well-known as other of his films, but is still very well seen today. Priscilla Lane proves in this case that she can compete with other blondes who later worked with Hitchcock. She only made a handful of films after that, which makes her almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> There are sequences that remind the viewer of setups in the director's later films. The drama is so well done and the story so well done that this movie is still very entertaining today. Every person in the cast does a good job. There are several great scenes in black and white film. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie on Universal for Hitchcock. For a long time between the feature films he shot at Universal and the television series, Hitchcock made as many box office box offices as anyone else working there. This fact is lost in film history. <br /> <br /> Norman Lloyd is a real villain in this movie. The story continues very well, including Hitchcock's only Western sequence. This film is very good with many great works of all involved.
