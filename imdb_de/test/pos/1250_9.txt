Really a wonderful movie. Bruce Willis gives this message movie its always outstanding comedic-romantic playing power, and the film gives hope to the losers, many of whom know that we are them. A gift to all middle-aged people whose time spent seems both full and empty: There is more in the next turn and it can be great, rewarding and romantic. Leave the recent past, return to the lessons of the distant past and embark on a favorite flight into your better future. If we could relive our youthful experiences, if we could really remember the events that shaped us, would not we find a special kind of freedom? Watch the movie, open the gift.
