PLOT SPOILERS !!!! Dr. Boch (George C. Scott) is the chief medical officer in a large NYC hospital. He left his wife, his children released him, he is powerless, drinks a lot and considers suicide. There is also a killer roaming the hospital. Then he meets VERY strange Barbara (Diana Rigg) and falls in love. She wants him to run away with her - but can he completely abandon his old life and start a new life? Very strange movie with an Oscar-winning script by Paddy Chayefsky. It depicts a suicidal protagonist and shows us a hospital with overworked nurses and doctors operated in an incompetent manner. It somehow manages to make it look quite funny. It's not loud humor, but very dark humor. Acting is also exactly the goal - Scott is just great (and Oscar nominated). You see him trying to keep his mind in a completely crazy situation. Rigg's character is more than a bit strange, but her factual way works and she's also incredibly beautiful. The script is strong and brutal - but never too much. I think he fumbles in the end with a situation that goes too far - but it is still worth seeing. If taken seriously, it would probably be impossible to do so. Also, look for Katherine Helmond in a small piece and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guest in unrecorded pieces. I had problems taking this seriously. From what I've heard, hospitals were so bad in the 1970s, but nothing more. See it for the acting and the script. I give a 7.
