In France, Xavier (Romain Duris) is a twenty-year-old young economist who tries to get a job in a government department through a friend of his father's. It is recommended to specialize in Spanish economy and language in order to get a good position. He decides to apply for a European exchange program called "Erasmus" and move to Barcelona to improve his knowledge of Spanish culture and language. She leaves his girlfriend Martine (Audry Tautou) and promises close contact with her. Once in Barcelona, ​​she will be temporarily detained by a French doctor Jean-Michel (Xavier de Guillebon) and his young, lonely wife Anne-Sophie (Judith Godrèche), whom he met at the airport. Later he moved to an apartment with international students: Englishwoman Wendy (Kelly Reilly), Spanish Soledad (Cristina Brondo), Italian Alessandro (Fédérico D'anna), Dane Lars (Christian Pagh) and German Tobias (Barnaby) Metschurat). Then the Belgian Isabelle (Cécile de France) and Wendy's brother William (Kevin Bishop) join the group, and Xavier learns Spanish and finds friendship and love in his experience abroad. "L'Auberge Espagnole" is one of those films that make the viewer sad when he ends. The story is a delightful and funny story about friendship and love in a globalized world and a united Europe. In this very charming movie I felt good and happy, although I have never lived in a republic of students. The newcomer William provokes with his big mouth and his short mind the funniest situations in history. It's also great to see a new approach to student living that is different from the dumb American communities and their stereotypes common in American films. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Albergue Espanhol" (Spanish Auberge)
