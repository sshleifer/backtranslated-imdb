I do not know where this movie was shot, but because it was shot on location, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. It is the story of a young Englishwoman captured by the Japanese in South Asia at the beginning of World War II, along with a group of other Englishmen. There is no women's detention center, so they have to march from place to place for months because the Japanese do not know what to do with them. The courage and resilience of the Englishmen and the courage of the Australian soldier trying to help them are at the heart of the film. This movie is very long, maybe 10 hours. So you can see him as a series on PBS, a series that enhances the feeling of the woman's endless journey from England, beyond this remote island and finally through Australia. Story, movie, location and actor make this movie a movie you should not miss. My only question is why this was not released on DVD!
