I think every critic, "Tommy Boy" when he was released in 1995, should go back and look at him and learn that he's not a bad movie at all. Every critic has forgotten the films of Chris Farley and David Spade. Yes, "Coneheads" was funny, but had a premise with a joke and "Black Sheep". I agree with the critics that it is one of the worst movies ever made. However, "Tommy Boy" does not fall into the category "Coneheads", which could be a little funnier, and "Black Sheep", which is a bit of tripe. It is very funny and entertaining. I agree with the critics that Chris Farley was not John Belushi or John Candy because he claimed to have idolized those guys, and these guys had a genius for the comedy, but Chris Farley was very funny and I wish he was Yeah, he was not John Belushi or John Candy, but he was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as Nemesis are disturbing and the premise is also loud, funny. It's very sad that Chris Farley is not here to make us laugh, but we have films like "Tommy Boy" to remind us how funny he was. "Tommy Boy" is one of the best comedies of the 90s.
