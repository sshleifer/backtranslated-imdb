The summary is intended only for those who hate this movie because finding the movie is okay or average acceptable. Visiting this film on the IMDb made me nostalgic, since I can not hold myself back in 1994. It immediately became one of my favorite comedies, and it took a few years for her to become my favorite. How can I say what made this movie my favorite? Was it the excellent writing (the story was fine, but the script and dialogues were fabulous). Was it the power of superlatives? Was it the mood of the movie? <br /> <br /> After thinking about it for so many years, I say it has to be a mix. It's one of those movies that had no flaws, not even their music. (The other movie that pops up in my head is Sholay) Drama and Comedy Movies. Only a comedy is not enough. I want to mehreeeeeee ..........
