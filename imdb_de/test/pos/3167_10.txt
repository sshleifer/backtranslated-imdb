At first I could not say if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after, I had a unique taste experience movie or maybe a revelation. The film is a human search to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The leadership is clueless and cold. He is like us all, he wants to get rich, laugh, travel, eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a huge motorhome without guidance or motive, just to pass the time and talk. In the end it is too late. Since my first visit to the US, he has grown to be like a custom dream where life on earth is nothing but a weird experience. I am an artist and Buddhist and this movie has conveyed my senses. It was an ideal embodiment of transience. This may sound strange, but somehow this movie could touch me so deeply like no one else. I recommend it.
