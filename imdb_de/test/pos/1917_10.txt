I saw this movie on TV and loved it! I'm a real catastrophe fanatic and this one was great. The cast consisted of really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in his own league. He can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie as no one else. The story is great too. The idea of ​​following a timeline of events and using that time to prevent a global catastrophe is an interesting idea. And this movie gets it out in a way that's almost completely credible.
