The jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie. The only science fiction part are the woolly mammoths living today. Elephants attack villages in part of India, and these attacks kill people. An expedition is sent for investigation, and one of the members, an American hunter, accuses these elephants, who are frightened by Woolly Mammoths, who are considered extinct. At first nobody believes him, but they do it when the mammoths turn up in the end. An earthquake kills her. <br /> <br /> The jungle was filmed locally in India and has many beautiful landscapes and good Indian music, including some songs that make the movie well. The mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long tusks. <br /> <br /> Performers include Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (Catwomen of the Moon) /> <br /> The jungle is only worth seeing for the scenery and music. Very nice. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
