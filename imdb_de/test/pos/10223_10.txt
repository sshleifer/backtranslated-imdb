This is in my opinion the masterpiece of Clive Barker. The movie has a great storyline and some amazing makeup effects. The only thing I would like to see is a sequel. The movie was prepared for a sequel, and with improved technology, the second movie could be unbelievable. David Cronenberg has to appear in a sequel, as does Craig Sheffer. But this movie was a great original, creative and entertaining idea and I was able to see it over and over again. Cronenberg was perfect in this movie and Sheffer added an interesting spice to the movie.
