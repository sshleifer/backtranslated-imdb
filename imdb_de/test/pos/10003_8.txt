Bill Paxton picked up on the true story of the 1913 US Gulf and made a movie that's about more than just an extraordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches on the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both British and American institutions. But in essence, this movie is about the eternal favorite of triumphing against adversity. <br /> <br /> Acting is exemplary. Stephen Dillane, as always, is excellent, but the revelation of the film is Shia LaBoeuf, who performs a disciplined, dignified, and very sympathetic performance, as a working-class French-Irish child struggling through the prejudices of the WASP establishment in New England. For those who are only familiar with its slap-stick performances in Even Stevens, this demonstration of its maturity is a wonderful surprise. And Josh Flitter, the ten-year-old caddy, threatens to steal every scene in which he appears. An old-fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear direction and a great story to the end - the closing scene a loving allusion to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.
