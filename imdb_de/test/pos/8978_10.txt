Charlie's Wilson's War demonstrates with skill how futile wars can be, especially for the people who spend countless hours and money on their finance. Virtuoso performances and remarkably memorable characters, along with an irresistible sarcastic script, catapult the movie, led by the ever-unpredictable Mike Nichols, to the top of the Best of the Year. Politics has never been so much fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a Texas Congressman who was almost the sole recipient of the Cold War. He hangs heavily on drugs, women and scotch and is unexpectedly interested in events in Afghanistan and the horrors of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. With the help of Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a renegade CIA covert mission expert, and a wealthy celebrity Joanne (Julia Roberts), he is raising money to provide Afghanistan with the rocket launchers and antitank guns they need to inflict serious damage on the Russian military. Eventually, by the end of the 1980s, the Cold War would come to an end, and the funds would be reduced immediately so that any help was given to the rising country to rebuild and recover. <br /> <br /> The action is exquisite. although it is to be expected from the more than perfect cast. Much of this, however, should be attributed to the script, which makes every character undeniably well-developed and memorable. And a heartfelt support of this merit goes to the novel of the same name, which is hilariously honest. Tom Hanks delivers another unsurpassed performance as Charlie Wilson, the man who did so much for so many and yet is relatively unknown. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Gust, a character who is very lively in both his corporeality and dry cynicism. The inimitable Hoffman shows once again an excellent range in the figures he represents. Julia Roberts is perhaps the only weak link in the film, with her generic snobbery character and non-subtle accent. And then there's Wilson's "Jailbait" squad of young secretaries walking around to make him happy. Led by the ever-adorable Amy Adams, every supporting role has its wondrous moments. The defeat of the Soviet Union was not an easy task, especially given the many conflicting objectives between the various political leaders. "Why is Congress saying something and doing nothing?" asks an angry politician. "Tradition mostly," Wilson states. It seems everyone wants the Cold War to end, and yet the atrocities in Afghanistan are being turned a blind eye. It takes a trip to the war-torn refugee camps in Pakistan to motivate Wilson, as well as his main financial source Doc Long (Ned Beatty). Wilson uses strategic links with committees to increase the funding of weapons in Afghanistan with a simple $ 5 million to $ 10 million command, but the Pakistani president mocks the idea of ​​winning a war for such insignificant amounts. At the end of the Wilson campaign, a billion dollars will be sent to the Mujahideen to shoot Russian helicopters - the first step toward victory, as Wilson predicted. Beyond the frame of the film, the unresolved turmoil in Afghanistan has led to other, less negligible problems that Wilson probably predicted. <br /> <br /> During the war of Charlie Wilson, the main characters from the United States travel to Pakistan to Afghanistan to Jerusalem to Egypt, but wherever they go, the sarcasm always follows. There is a surprising amount of comedy in the film, considering that the political undertones in general are serious. Hoffman delivers a joke with just about any dialogue, just as Hanks does with his naturally witty women's hunts. A scene where Gust was repeatedly led out of Wilson's office trying to sort out a legal issue with his group of great women ("You can teach them to write, but you can not teach them to grow tits") " ) reminds me of a slapstick routine of the Marx brothers. <br /> <br /> With the press focusing on the drug allegations against Wilson instead of the important issues of the Cold War and the officials' conflicting desire for budget Their help, it is clear that politicians at the end of the film still do not know what is really necessary and because the script is so quick and ingenious, some viewers can not keep up with all the dialogue-intensive events, as the politicians show The difference between Pakistan and Afghanistan is, in essence, another argument in support of Charlie Wilson's point of view. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie
