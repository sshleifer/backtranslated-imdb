The Columbia Pictures Short Subject had no idea of ​​the production of "art" films. They wanted to give the movie exhibitors a little more for their money when they booked a Columbia Picture in their movie theaters. This would be twice as high in The 3 Stooges movies. <br /> <br /> MEN IN BLACK (1934) came as close as any of her comedy shorts as she received an Oscar nomination for Best Comedy. Although it did not win, it could be good. It was good enough, and even those who do not count themselves among the Stooge files still seem to be convinced of the lamentation "....... calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard! " This was the second installment in the long series of comedy shorts produced by the Stooges for producer Jules White, head of Columbia's Department of Short Subjects. Only WOMAN HATERS, described in his credits as "Musical Novelty", preceded her in Harry Cohen's sweatshop "Poverty Row". <br /> <br /> The film starts in the office of dr. Graves, the head of the hospital. He receives new interns and reports in his speech to the group that three of them are being passed on by Medical Conditionally since they have stayed there for so long. But the good doctor states that he will not reveal her identity as long as she does everything "...... for duty and humanity!" The Stooges run forward and pawn "... for duty and humanity!". They run out of the office and break the windowpane in the door. The game was on. <br /> <br /> The Stooges picked up and did not stop for the rest of the 2 reels. Every kind of gag was obvious. From broad Sennett-style gags to word games and humor to "theater of the absurd" and a surrealistic running gag with a sound system that seems to have a life of its own and the real guilty party, a radio tube has shot to a "... ..... he has me!" (It all goes pretty well, honestly!) The sets used looked very authentic and were undoubtedly borrowed from the Columbia features that were made at the same time. There are many wheelchairs, surgical cots, stethoscopes, surcical scalpels, etc., to maintain the illusion of a hospital. <br /> <br /> A true strength of MEN IN BLACK is the high number of Nameless players we all recognize. Together with them, the film has a variety of experienced comedy actors who always perform well and often steal the scene. People with names like Billy Gilbert, Hank Mann and Bud Jamison shine even in small parts. <br /> <br /> And last but not least we have the Maestro, the conductor-director Raymond McCarey, a little brother of Leo McCarey, who has shown him skills to get this little movie "in the can". He skilfully kept everything moving and at times acted as a traffic cop, with all the actors, extras and crew moving behind the scenes and out of the others. This does not apply to the Giant 3 Man Tandem Bicycle, The Sway Backed Horse and Miniature Racing Cars, not to mention the "Giant, Green Canaries!"
