Taken over by Sam Shepard, this movie features many game-like elements, such as a relatively solid setting (a roadside roadside motel in the southwest) and rich, intriguing dialogues. A woman "May" is being chased by a man named "Eddie" (played by Sam Shepard). She tries to hide from him in the remote motel, but he finds her. The film explores the history of their relationship, mostly from the childhood that led them to this point. It is very easy to sympathize with the characters and understand that their dysfunctional current relationship is a result of past events beyond their control. We mainly observe how they fight, make-up, fight, make-up and so on. One image that comes to my mind is that Eddie May stepped over his shoulder screaming and taking her there where she does not want to go. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also a perfect, soulful country with vocals by a lesser known artist "Sandy Rogers". She has this Country Doll voice, which almost yodels in some parts of the album! This is the kind of movie being held in part of your brain / soul. In other words, look at it!
