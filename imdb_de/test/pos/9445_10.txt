I loved this movie so much. I'm a big fan of Amanda Bynes recently finished show. I admire her (next to her body) for her acting skills. She is a good actress. <br /> <br /> The movie was great. It's about a girl named Viola who wants to play football, but when her school cuts off the girls' football team, she gets upset. Her brother goes to a prestigious school and decides to go to England. Therefore, Viola wants to make an impression by playing in the boarding school in the football team. She goes to school and tries out the football team. She gets in. Meanwhile, she meets Duke, a sensitive guy who plays in the football team. He likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey), who likes Sebastian, who is really viola. Sebastian goes out with Monique and suspects that Sebastian is not himself. <br /> <br /> This is certainly NOT chick strip and I really enjoyed it. It's so funny and adorable. I do not think I saw AManda better.
