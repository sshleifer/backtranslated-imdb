Since this is my first John Carpenter movie, I have to say I was very impressed with The Thing. The film attracts you from the beginning and never lets up on the tension. The special effects and models of the film are still in good shape today. Aside from Kurt Russell, I did not know any of the performers, but they were all extraordinary in conveying fear, paranoia and desperation to survive. The universal DVD offers a wealth of interesting extras behind the scenes. Highly recommended, 9/10.
