I saw Borderline at AMC a few years ago. I have been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, structural and sensual. This movie brought me somewhere like a dream and I did not care where. I'll never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way I tilted my head. I remember my expression when I saw him. I did not know what had happened when the movie was over, but I think life is like that. It did not bother me. The injustice of the final rejection of an innocent character seems sadly real to me. I loved the faces and the way the camera stood on them. The camera stared at the set with the fuzzy eyes of a daydreamer. Borderline was for me in a way real like movies. It was the lack of explanation, color, and sharpness that made me feel like a thief in the night. I love this movie. One day I will own it.
