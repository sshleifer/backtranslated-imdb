Right, this may be the wine, but it could be the best movie I've seen in a long time. Granted, I spent much of the first half hour wondering what the hell was going on, but once I agreed that I would never understand everything from the subtitles, I could enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Can you really hate a movie in which a staff transforms itself into a flock of birds that invades the enemy? What is the character development for a lesbian extraterrestrial princess whose people built the pyramids? Why is Buddha wearing seriously bling diamond earrings? Is this all important when confronted with the sheer magnificence of the images and the insidious humor of the characters? Every fight for my heart was won when I saw the main character dressed as a spider man - great! Many people will complain about a lack of story cohesion, but for a funny movie that you can laugh about with a bunch of buddies, you can not do any better, especially if you say, every time someone says, "I'll make you 10,000 years ", make an alcoholic.
