How good is this movie? Apparently good enough that they want to do a remake in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville, who gave us Le doulos and The Good Thief, wrote and directed the film. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost dumb. These are men with few words who prefer to let their actions speak for themselves. They live by a code that governs each of their movements. <br /> <br /> In this movie there are some great actors - Alain Delon (The Leopard), Yves Montand (Jean de Florette, Let's Make Love) and Gian Maria Volonte (El Indio of a handful of dollars & a few dollars more). The movie does not shine on her; They're on the drive Melville has for them. Melville makes the movie; They make it better. <br /> <br /> You see Melville's work in the Ocean movies, but they only have the idea. That can not work like him. A big loss in the seventies, but his work remains to our delight.
