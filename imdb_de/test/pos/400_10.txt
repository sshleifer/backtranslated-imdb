A very enjoyable piece of film work that should have been more widely used. Ian McShane is at home playing the soul-loving DJ who comes out of the can because he does not join the program and lets the world know what he's missing. The minor cast is also great and the music is the "soul" of the film. I just wish the movie would be released so I could get a copy of it for my movie library.
