I'm collecting movies on Super 8 and was able to make a full copy of this one on E-bay last week. It looks, at least for the moment, as the only way to see this movie in a country with NTSC video. I have seen it often on DVD of Region 2, but never in Region 1. <br /> <br /> I just finished it a few minutes ago and I'm thrilled. It is a powerful testament to freedom and the search for a place in the world. The photography and the music were wonderful, and I really felt sympathetic to some of the characters. <br /> <br /> I like the idea that I was probably the only one in the US who saw "When the North Wind Blows" tonight! <br /> <br /> Long live Avakum !!
