I have great memories of this movie ... <br /> <br /> I was only 12 years old when it was released, and Bejesus scared me. I really miss my Bejesus ... <br /> <br /> Zombies, cemeteries, mausoleums, how can you be wrong? It's like Phantasm's retarded cousin. <br /> <br /> This movie was released 1 year before the PG-13 rating was introduced. <br /> <br /> I claim that One Dark Night is the GORIEST PG movie (not (scary, mind you) that was ever released.) <br /> <br /> Can anyone make a selection? <br /> <br /> (FYI: I do not consider poltergeist Gorier). Terrible yes, but not gorier ...)
