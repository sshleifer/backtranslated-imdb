In a time when Hollywood thinks louder, faster, and bloodier are better, Manna From Heaven is comedic and touching on something we've all been thinking about: what would I do if a load of money fell from the sky. Interestingly enough, the characters took many years to realize that money had made no difference in their lives. They all become what they were intended for. Unfortunately, what they have become unfortunate in most cases, despite their fortune all those years ago. <br /> <br /> While Manna's well-known Hollywood story Good vs. Evil or generosity vs. Vulture, what characterizes this movie is that Good wins by converting evil, not destruction. <br /> <br /> I think the most important message of this movie is that you can change the world, even if you only ever do one person.
