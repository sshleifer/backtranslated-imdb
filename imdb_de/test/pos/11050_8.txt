I read all negative reviews for "Anna Christie". You know, the grip on the static camera, the outdated drama and the lyrics of the script. When I saw it yesterday, I found it remarkably influential and enjoyable. Yes, Clarence Brown's camera remains mostly stationary, and I'm pretty sure one of the microphones was hidden in the light of the ship. Yes, there are many dialogues and no spectacular action sequences. It is an early conversation with primitive technical aspects. But ... then there's Garbo, Marie Dressler, George F. Marion and Charles Bickford, who prove that great acting is timeless. I think "Anna Christie" is still one of Garbo's iconic performances. And it is a wonderful achievement of the Divine, in a role that is quite atypical of it. Yes, we've seen Garbo tired and almost beaten, but never with bags under his eyes or when she's whisking back. Garbo played so many (adorable) costume roles that it's fascinating to play a contemporary woman. She is not burdened by heavy clothes or makeup. This performance seems pretty raw by Garbo. <br /> <br /> The plot from the O'Neill game follows the tired Swedish ex-prostitute Anna and her reunion with her fraudulent sailor's father. Annas had enough trouble for every twenty-year-old girl, as she tells the drunken, sloppy Marthy (Dressler) in a bar. She finds solace in a life at sea and romance with a hard-core but kind-hearted fisherman (Charles Bickford). But her past threatens to ruin everything. Charles Bickford is overlooked in Garbo's long line of (largely inferior) leading men. He is an actor who can actually share the screen with her and not be swallowed up by her magical presence. They both have great chemistry and seemed to enjoy working together. Dressler can never be accused of being subject, and once again the great lady is up to her old tricks, but in her role she is grand and persuasive, never annoying, like the terrible "Dinner at Eight." I have never really heard of George F. Marion, but he was wonderful as Garbo's father. <br /> <br /> This is pre-code and pretty gloomy and dark for MGM's standards. I really enjoyed it, and while it can creak in some places, it's still wonderful.
