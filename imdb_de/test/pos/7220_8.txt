I do not think the world was ready for this movie. I dont know. I expected it to be a standard low-budget, low-flow potboiler. Instead, I got the most intelligent adaptation of Shakespeare since Peter Greenaway's Prospero's Books. This was to be the final movie version of Romeo And Juliet. Of course not. But that is the loss of the world.
