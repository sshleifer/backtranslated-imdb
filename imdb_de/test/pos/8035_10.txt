This is probably one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. It has action, but not this bullet, good guys - evil, Van Damme - Stallone action, but fast, realistic and nervous action, it has an action, because by the end of the movie you do not know how that will come to an end There are characters, Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley are just perfect, and there is tension, this movie just will not let you go before you see the end. <br /> <br /> Although there are few characters, it was not difficult for me to focus my attention on the story, and as far as the story goes, it is basic (not too hard, but simple and raw) and realistic . <br /> <br /> If you want to experience a movie with a good story, some action and great acting, look at that and I promise you will not go until you see the end. At the very end of it.
