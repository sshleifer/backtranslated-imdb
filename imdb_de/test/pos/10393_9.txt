Beyond the clouds is in many ways the strangest movie I've ever seen. Not because of his cult incentive, because of his blood or even because of his ideas, but because of the elements that make this a masterpiece of cinema. Beyond the Clouds was led by Michelangelo Antonioni, one of the most famous directors in Italy. However, if you would only briefly consider this film, passive, I mean, it seems to be one of those melodramatic and often meaningless romances. This movie deserves a lot of attention until he hugs the whole cheese. I do not mean a slice of cheese, but a whole brick cheddar! The music seems to come from an Italian porno, the story and the dialogue like a dirty Japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious that you want to beat yourself on the head. <br /> <br /> But once you get it all, you are busy with an existential work of art. The cheese flows into the subtle films and draws our attention perfectly to what needs to be known. The basic plot consists of four chapters that have nothing to do with each other, and all about love. What we learn is that people can not communicate no matter what happens or what is said. Instead, they can only communicate with each other. I think that's why dialogue and conspiracy are so cheesy because the conversations are too irrational and lack causality, and the people's response is too melodramatic. <br /> <br /> I left the film to myself; Maybe all life is a big melodrama. We judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful. I hate it because I have a reason. But what does the hated think? Maybe they think that my hatred is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic. <br /> <br /> The melodrama is thus an existential function. A hackneyed romance is simply a human interaction that can be seen under a magnifying glass, revealing the futility of who we are and what we do. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I recommend it to everyone!
