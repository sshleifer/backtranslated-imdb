I'm definitely not a Footie fan, but I saw this with a friend because there was nothing on the box at the time. (Thank God). Not only did we laugh from start to finish, but about a week later in the bar when we started talking about it, and we got right with uncontrollable laughter. Is this inclined slope actually there? I have posted my e-mail here. So if anybody hears about his future availability or a replay on TV, let me know. Definitely the funniest thing I've seen on TV !!! King leek was good too !! another Tim Healy classic
