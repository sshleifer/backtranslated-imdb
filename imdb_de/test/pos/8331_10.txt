Great "documentary" about how scientists believed that dinosaurs had behaved, recorded with one of the most spectacular CGIs since "Jurassic Park". Seriously, like a prehistoric episode of Nation Geographic. Start your attention from the first picture and never let go. My favorite part was when the Diplodocus fought the Allosauros. <br /> <br /> 10 stars. That's what science is all about.
