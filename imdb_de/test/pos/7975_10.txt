This is an excellent movie and I recommend it to anyone. Mr. Drury's drama is top notch as always and it goes well with the other actors in the film. I can not give away any of the tension or the drama in the movie. To pay hell is a must movie !!! The story was very exciting. I would watch this movie over and over again because it has all the elements of a great western movie. It was very authentic, as they showed the components of this film, including weapons, horses and clothing. The soundtrack is fun and gives the movie more flavor. James Drury has the right grade when choosing a film in which he is involved. This is another winner of the Western genre. !!!!!
