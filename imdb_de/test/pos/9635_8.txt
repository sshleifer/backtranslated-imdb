OK ... this movie (like Segal's last films) goes over the "knock 'em down" again, kicking her groin, shooting her in the face and taking revenge on the bad guys for hurting my niece's cousin "stuff" Seagal was in for a while in. Geepers, Steven started to think and used his money to make movies with concrete ideas ... sure .... there's plenty of action in this movie, but also a bit of thought and heart It's not an Oscar movie, but it's worth the effort, unless the viewer is so brain-dead that it hurts to think for more than a second, it's worth the rent ... or two !!
