I blame "Birth of a Nation" itself - for the beginning of the long tradition of the Hollywood travesties of history, of which there are only a few larger examples. Apart from the names of Custer and his 7th Cavalry, Crazy Horse and Sioux, and President Grant, the geography was correct and the fact that Custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man, the rest only requires an overwhelming demand and an invention ridiculous limits. Throw some downright trite scenes of the purest depictions (try to learn Custer and his wife, the fake "Gold Rush") to excuse the invasion of the Sioux Territory. Custer's statement to Congress pleads for the rights of the Indians it's all Custer storms into the president's office to ask to return to his post), frankly, there's a lot more of it, some of these scenes are almost weird in her madness ... ... And yet, and yet it's still a big action with Flynn like never before, DeHavilland as seductive as ever. The young Anthony Quinn began as Crazy Horse and director Walsh in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the turbulent action sequences. Ford taught us in "Liberty Valance" to believe the legend of the truth. I think we're closer to the legend legend, but hey, it's just a movie and a great, wonderfully beautiful classic Hollywood movie!
