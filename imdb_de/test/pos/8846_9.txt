Aaah ... The Thing. <br /> <br /> Seeing a horror movie in which not only every character is over thirty years old, but clearly unsightly, makes a refreshing change and reminds me of those distant times The actors were chosen for their talent and ability to play realistic characters, and not because of their youthful appeal for a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a cameraman who can create realistic environments, rather than overly-styled parodies. And there's no tricky "twist" ending, no cameo or lame pseudo-romantic subplot. <br /> <br /> And I really miss physical effects on the set; with all the 20-year-old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. In the five years between 1979 and 1984, we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, Howling, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, A Nightmare on Elm Street ... what an era for horror effects! Do not let me start with the death of matte painting. The dull work in this movie is beautiful and seamless. <br /> <br /> What do we have now? Third-class CGI, former music video directors and professional stylists make even "grim" horror films look like shiny MTV videos. <br /> <br /> Now I go to Netflix 'The Howling'.
