It's hard for me to explain this show to my adult friends. I have a bunch of Shasta Daisy in the backyard, whom I affectionately call "Chuckle Patch". My friends laugh at me and look at me like I have 2 heads. It would be great to see this series on DVD for us who like to remember our other childhood memories, or show our friends that there really was a giggling patch! Where children's television today consists of violent cartoons, enchanting characters, or a talking sponge that lives in a pineapple under the sea, The Magic Garden was in the respect that taught us good values. <br />> I'll have nice memories of Carole and Paula and the Chuckle Patch.
