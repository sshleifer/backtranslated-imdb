I love this movie! I know some people might say it was not a great movie, but I really do not agree. The comedy is in the classic Mel Brooks style and the performers have been superbly selected. This was my first encounter with Cary Elwes and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood. He has great comedy timing and the right attitude for this kind of movie. Dave Chappelle is obviously much taller now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did a great job on Achoo. The characters were all very well planned and added their own little quirks to the movie. I strongly suggest you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some good friends!
