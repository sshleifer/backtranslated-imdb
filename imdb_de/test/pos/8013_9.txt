After seeing this movie, I experienced a new sensation. I had watched a movie in which the lead actor had shown a performance that was almost the same as legend Chevy Chase in 'Fletch'. This does not mean that the services are comparable, but both deliver their products virtually error-free. This actor is Marc Singer! Singer is Jack Ford, the "Droid Gunner" of the title, which burns his livelihood with androids. There are some mutants, topless amusement droids (!), A Scandinavian smuggler, and possibly a halfhearted attempt to make a statement to the class, or even to globalization, or ......... well, that does not matter. What is important about this film is the dry way in which Singer delivers his productions, which leads to mutual sense of humor! In this film, it is important that director Fred Olen Ray seems to recognize that serious science fiction system rarely works. If your budget is tight, you should not take yourself seriously. Olen Ray said that everyone involved in the film had a lot of fun and this was transferred to the film. I dare to criticize a film that allows to portray the futuristic earth as eternally dark and neon-lit and then ends up in a 'pipe and valve' 'department store. Self-parody is a very redeeming feature. In summary, Fred Olen Ray is an ambassador for independent film productions and Marc Singer the perfect B-movie lead. If only Olen Ray in Tim Thomerson could formulate the equation, we would have a film in our hands.
