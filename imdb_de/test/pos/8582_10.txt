A fabulous movie that I've seen several times since buying the video four days ago. Yes, I'm a Colin Firth fan and Colin was his usual talented, natural, gorgeous self. The interaction between Colin (Matthew Field) and Fissy (Sammy, Nimi's 7-year-old son) was very special and so natural. They were funny together and also touched my heart strings. The scenes I loved the most were Sammy and Matt sitting on the wall chatting to Matt. Then Matt fell off the wall in a funny way (I will not reveal the content of their discussion so as not to interfere with the plot). It was also very funny when Sammy asked Matt about sex. Colin and Fissy were perfect in this scene, making a clumsy topic between adult and child so natural. Colin's words and face at the end of this scene were so adorable and said it all! simply brilliant. The recognition must of course also go to Fissy Roberts for his delightful portrayal of Sammy. He played such a lovable and cheeky child character. The two actors were just perfect together. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matt) and Nia (Nimi) was perfectly balanced and I could not agree anymore that the chemistry between them was wonderful and love showed excitement and of course passion. It was exciting to see their delicate flowering romance developing gradually, as well as their cultural and social differences affecting their relationship, and it was good to see Colin and Nia Matt and Nimi being sensitive about how they discovered these differences , accepted and overcome. It held me to the end of the movie on television and advised. <br /> <br /> Colin's portrayal of Matt's vulnerable and youthful side was so perfect that it was hard for me to watch if Matt was so mean and childish to Sammy because he (Matt) felt this Sammy. Relationship with Sam's mother Nimi got in the way. One could not feel disappointed, angry and frustrated with Matt for treating Sammy this way, and that in turn threatened to ruin Matt's special relationship with Sammy and Nimi. Colin's special talent "dipping into the head of a character" and showing the audience the different sides of a character was very clear and purely magical here. I must also mention that Colin also has such a good relationship with young actors (see also "My Life So Far", a wonderful and not to be missed film). <br /> <br /> I also have the relationship between Matthew and his wife Jenny, both of whom were great at showing the audience the dark side and tensions within their marriage, and that not all seemingly "happy marriages" are like that as if they were appearing from the outside. <br /> <br /> I must not forget to mention the Reverend, which I found in a serious way very funny! Nimi's mother and family were also hilarious, revealing the importance of Nimi's culture and her situation. <br /> <br /> The downsides are not really detrimental, but objective to the movie and to be credible to my review. The only negative comment I would make is that the scriptwriters did not explain exactly why Matt collapsed in the car. There was only a vague suggestion from Nimi that something is wrong with his heart. However, this did not affect my enjoyment of the film, far from it. I just had to rewind the tape for a second shot. <br /> <br /> I felt that this movie has everything entertaining, uplifting and I loved the rich colors and the sunny scenery. The movie warmed up a cold winter day and made me smile :-)) All the essentials were there, laughter, love, tension, sadness, anger, drama and a warm feeling Good factor, with, yes, there are many delicious Colin Firth Moments, including a very soaked Colin in a wet shirt scene that no fan should miss, what more does a girl want ;-)) <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie, especially Colin Firth fans ;-)
