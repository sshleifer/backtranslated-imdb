I love this movie! I love all the characters and I can see it again <br /> <br /> and again ... and I keep listening to the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Although I saw him about two years after it was done and I've never been as young as Jip and Business, I can understand them and I love their stories. And if someone thinks this movie is crap, I do not agree and I say it's full of positive energy and friendship and love ... and full of youth! <br /> <br /> The weekend has landed ... enjoy it!
