This was a modern TV classic! The story goes like this, Bob has a girlfriend named Alicia. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to marry. Bob has a bud called Owen he works with. Owen is jealous of Alicia. He likes to hang out with Bob. Now Owen is hanging around with Bob AND Alicia. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very prone to accidents. It is also, if you have not guessed, somehow lonely. She also hangs around with Bob and Alicia and Owen. Sometimes Alicia wishes Bob has no friends. By the end of the first season, it looked like Owen had finally become a real longtime friend. Bob and Alicia drove in the night before their wedding, drove around in a tiny car and then got stuck. Get out of nowhere! What happened after that? What about poor Heather? Has anyone married? Sorry, the series ended. <br /> <br /> Not even a request from TV Guide made FOX think twice about getting it off again. It was a great show with a great cast. I also loved Heather. She looked cool in those glasses and was hilarious. I miss this show very much. It's like reading a good book whose end is missing ... sad.
