After seeing A Texas Tale of Treason, Cox's arduous correspondence efforts could not even afford the massive arrangement Stu made without a budget. It tells a story about devotion, sweat, whiz, fire and punk rock. I love it! My favorite parts are the interviews with Marci (she's such a hot baby and she digs me, but she does not know yet) The Japanese office worker mumbled his lines and that got me done, the sex scene was really cool, I'll see if Stu eventually comes over and does the box-light-wave thing when I do it with my wife, the intro and of course my 5 seconds at the credits I know that brings me some chicks ... I hope to see more of Antstuie because I know that I can count on the unexpected.
