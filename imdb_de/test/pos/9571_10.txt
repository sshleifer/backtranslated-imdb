This movie should be considered one of the funniest films in history. His cousins ​​A powerful wind, Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman are already a big hit, but Best in Show makes the cake. <br /> <br /> A film about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners who show their dogs competitively. It's the subtleties of the characters that make them so good. After watching the movie about 75 times, I've come to the conclusion that there's no weak character or actor in this movie. There is very little interaction between the "groups" of characters, but this only seems to contribute to the beauty of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and do not find it as funny as I charge it, look at it again. The first time I saw it, I found it useful, but not overly funny. It's a movie that grows on you. Definitely a movie that you will often cite. <br /> <br /> Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: A + When you get the DVD, you see how those characters were "born", and it was amazing that those two could beat it on the head. And to find that they really did not go to a script and somehow made up for it. <br /> <br /> Gerry and Cookie Guggleman: A cookie is especially funny and she sells the cookie character fantastically. Gerry (Eugene Levy) delivers his standard stellar performance of the humorous discombobulated weaker half. <br /> <br /> Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan A + Find a funny character as Scott Donalan. He will be typed forever as this guy for me because he was so natural and never seemed forced. Stefan (Micheal McKean) was also very good and the interaction here (and a short gig with the Gugglemans) shows why he's always in those movies. A great actor with a razor-like joke. <br /> <br /> Harlan Pepper- B +, I do not want it to look like it's not funny. He is sure, but since he is the only "solo", he can not be as funny as the others over. He uses the dog more than others and has a few other peculiarities that are aimed at him. <br /> <br /> The rest is great too, there is no weak character. Watch this movie at least twice. Buy it, you will not regret it.
