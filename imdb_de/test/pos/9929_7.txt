Often considered the last "great" movie by Argento, this entry into the Giallo canon is undoubtedly better than any subsequent Argento movie (though I have yet seen "Mother of Tears"), but its the last "great" movie to call It could be that it is stretched a bit. <br /> <br /> The direction and style - the hallmark of all Argento movies - is in fact present, with some of his suspense sequences ranked with his best (the "peep-hole" sequence) is particularly memorable), and The cinematography of Ronnie Taylor is outstanding (the fluorescent lighting is beautiful). <br /> <br /> However, the narrative is missing, which is a hit in all Argento films and is missing. There is indeed a strong sense of mystery and intrigue, but the plot draws on a series of murders, with one following the other, leaving no time to construct a proper, focused puzzle that must be resolved. All this leads to a climax that is ... well ... anti-climatic, because the movie did not invest enough interest to really interest us. Regardless, this is simply to be recommended the masterly direction and the beautiful pictures that Argento evokes. However, I would not recommend this as a starting point for Argento's films (I would recommend either "Deep Red" or "Suspiria"), but if you like them, or even some giallo, then this is a very good complement to your repertoire.
