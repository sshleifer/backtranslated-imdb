Imagine spending the summer without family or friends from school and meeting new people. Or you are the first time that you are a nobody, and the only person you can rely on is someone from the camp. "Meatballs" offers a lot of comedy in this movie. In the camp there is an eccentric advisor (Bill Murray) who knows how the boys and girls can talk well. Enter a child named Rudy (Chris Makepeace), whom no one can look up to. He does not suit anyone, only gonorrhea can be fun. The rest of the tin is as crazy as gonorrhea. Camp Northstar is an average camp with an above average team. Camp Mohawk, on the other hand, is an elite camp where they fight for their money. In basketball, the Mohawks got a waistband! And in the Olympics, the Northstar teal egg got the revenge it needed when one of the members brought the saboteur out. And Morty (Harvey Atkin), this poor soul can never get started if he tries. A very, very funny comedy, and I'll say, a great keeper. This movie shows that the camp can be fun if you wanted it! 5 Stars!
