Dark Harbor is a moody little excursion into murky emotional waters that run extremely deep. It's basically a three-character piece with a finely layered performance by the always-awesome Rickman, with Polly Walker and Norman Reedus (also excellent) forming the other two sides of this weird triangle. A perfect late night cable movie with a surprising ending.
