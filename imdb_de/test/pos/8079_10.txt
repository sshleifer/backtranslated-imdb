In 2000 (remember, this is two years ago, not four years ago), two men had the motivation to create the most wonderful work of art on this side of the Mississippi River. Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now look forward to Second String, a delectable television movie that tells the story of a flick gang gang of second stringers (the title) due to a series of bad oysters in the Start position are pushed. <br /> <br /> Due to the motivating direction of both director Robert Lieberman and the last minute of Buffalo Bill's QB, Dan's "Give 'em Hell" Heller (portrayed by Canadian actor Gil Bellows) was often the Super Bowl snake beg Bills are in the ultimate position. <br /> <br /> With a fascinating mix of inner and outer conflicts, a love story, camaraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring, and a general theory the outsider has to offer, Second String is an excellent movie worth seeing every moment on TNT. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this production is the spelling of the first name of Costume Designer, Jenifur Jarvis. <br /> <br />
