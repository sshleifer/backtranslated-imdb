It may not have had the big budgets, celebrities, or supporters of Scream, Urban Legend, or I know what you did last summer, but Campfire Tales had one thing that was missing from these three films: real horror. <br /> <br /> This movie a year before the aptly titled and less than riveting Urban Legend tackled the topic of urban legends. It was fascinating, masterfully written and logical in a way that I know what you did last summer. Eventually, it kept its focus and ended with a hustle and bustle as Scream hissed and died. <br /> <br /> The most exciting thing about the film is the variety of horror that writers and directors reached. The overarching story of teens at the campfire was a classic fear of the unknown (but certainly awaited) fatality that awaited them in the forest, but in the stories themselves, the movie really did shine pure, fast urban myth. It's based on a popular legend, and the director plays with the style and pace of the action, making it more exciting because we know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> The first story around the campfire is a forward thriller. Based on another popular myth, we realize this only at the end, because it fits so well into the story and because the plot holds our attention. A thriller of the trilogy, this film depicts our fear of the unknown and contains several well-crafted "jump" sequences that are not nearly as cheap or squeamish as in movies like Scream or Urban Legend. <br /> <br /> The second story is more exciting. Although the characters still do not know what's going on, we do that and that's the horror. No cheap thrill is needed here. <br /> <br /> The last story contains elements of the supernatural and uses a spooky / trippy atmosphere to scare the viewer. Since we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation, our fear comes from their intensity and what they can not explain. This is the true ghost story of the trio. <br /> <br /> I did not expect to enjoy Campfire Tales when I rented it. I figured if I did not like his more acclaimed, cheaper colleagues, how could I like it? <br /> <br /> The truth is that this film is successful, with the others lagging far behind.
