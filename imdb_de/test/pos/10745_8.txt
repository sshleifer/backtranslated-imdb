Sequels are an unpredictable post where the original is almost nonexistent. Sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original. Some critics (like John Charles) have stated that Project A2 is better than the original. I disagree somewhat, but this film is still a worthwhile episode and fits in well with the release of Hong Kong's brilliant action cinema in the 1980s and Jackie's own oeuvre. I wonder, with such a great release of great movies, that his later films were not so good. He made only two films in the 1990s, and no one went beyond that, but he had a lot of influence in many films where he is not the official director. Earlier in 1987, Jackie had a brain operation behind him catastrophic case in the film adaptation of Armor of God. This encouraged him to work on his next movie nearby. This did not encourage him to risk his life and his stunt team to amuse us. The result was quite a hit at home, which surpassed the original in box office (31 million HK dollars compared to 19 million for the original). Jackie Chan is again an exceptional policeman Dragon Ma, and he is assigned to work with "Three Wan" Superintendent Chun (Lam Wai, Royal Warriors), who is the only Chinese police officer allowed to carry a gun. He is supposed to make arrests so he looks better and ignores the crimes of a Triad Lord named Tiger Au (Michael Chan Wai-Man, Dragon Lord). Apparently, Chun has too much power to be directly defeated, but he's fired from the district of Sai Wan (now he's "Two Wan"), which takes over Dragon Ma. This inefficient and corrupt office will soon be redesigned, and there's a great scene where three officials who do not know who they are dealing with attack Ma to teach him a lesson about complaining about police officers. Soon he took care of the district ship form and Tiger Au. The fight choreography and stunts with Tiger and his men are quite impressive. My favorite stunt was a beautiful brutal fall from the second floor into a large vase, and this vase did not seem to be soft. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, a few subplots happen. There are pirates who have survived the first movie and seek revenge and food. Then there are revolutionaries, including Maggie (Maggie Cheung, In The Mood For Love) and (Rosamund Kwan, Casino Raiders), who are trying to raise money for Dr. Ing. To incite Sun Yat-sen to overthrow the Qing government and government officials who are trying to find these rebels. Add a mix of corrupt Hong Kong and British cops as well as legitimate ones, and you have a stew that gets a bit too many ingredients but still seems to merge. This works well if there is a scene influenced by Marx brothers (the Marx brothers did this kind of scene a few times with The Cocoanuts (1929) first) with Maggie, where everyone is looking for someone while standing in front of somebody hiding other things. Many weeks were spent alone in this scene and the effort is certainly evident. <br /> <br /> There are some mistakes in the movie. There is a certain didactic nature that creeps into the film, which seems a bit inappropriate. Above all, a small speech towards the end, which holds Jackie in dealing with the revolutionaries on the mainland and the extremely simple implementation of pirates who have survived the first film. Female characters are again little used, especially Maggie Cheung. I was not as satisfied with the continuation of the plot as the first movie. The individual scenes dominate my feelings for the film, rather than viewing this film as a coherent whole. I can not blame the movie because he was not able to have Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao as the first one (I heard the main reason that these two Eastern Condors shot, but I wonder if Jackie is a little Waiting a bit to call them on, they would last work together last year in Dragons Forever, but they are missing. <br /> <br /> I found that very enjoyable and good movie making and rightly so One of the better comedic action movies of the 1980s, this movie is also pretty good in some unexpected locations, the art direction is superb (Eddie Ma Poon-chiu), the costumes are exquisite, the cinematography is good and the movie looks quite authentic There are stunts, comedy and action on this movie and there is a chase with a handcuffed dragon and Chun that is outstanding (part of the ax throwing scene would be in Shanghai No to be used on). The last twenty minutes are full of impressive hits, falls and chili peppers as a buddy (Jackie writes in his autobiography about how he used real peppers in this scene, you can see him during the game in a lot of mouth pain outtakes at the end) and is a worthy conclusion of this film. The most famous stunt from this sequence is his homage to Buster Keaton of Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928), except that there is no hole and only a weak section through which his head shoots. <br /> <br /> Fans of Jackie and / or Hong Kong's action cinema should consider this a must see. I certainly do.
