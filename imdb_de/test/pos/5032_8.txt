Michael is probably too naughty for most of the action movie fans and Hollywood for the intellectual audience, but I found it extremely funny and very touching, though it's both base and formulaic. When three skeptics are sent to him Find a man who claims to be an angel, escorts him on a grand tour of the Midwestern countryside, only to find that it is each of his own hearts that needs to be examined There is not much new material in most of today's films, but overall it has a refreshingly original approach and is unsurpassable enough to keep you entertained. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a "family movie", it is suitable for all ages and a good movie that can be shared with the whole family or that special person. <br /> <br /> "Michael" is not a great movie, but it sure is a good movie, a touching movie and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> KWC
