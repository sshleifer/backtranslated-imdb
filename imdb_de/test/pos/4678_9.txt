I wonder how many MINI Cooper automobiles were sold thanks to this movie. The sale of this little car shown in this movie, as well as an attractive cast, can not change. <br /> <br /> This is a very, very entertaining chase movie. It has a "cool" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> The best pursuit scene begins with a boat pursuit in Venice, Italy. The film does not exaggerate the violence, has a pretty intelligent script (with a few exceptions). has interesting characters and is pretty tight. The cat-and-mouse game between the characters of Norton and Theron is exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> Once again, we are being manipulated to rummage through criminals called "the good guys". How many times has this happened since the days of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" in the 1960s? It's twisted Hollywood for you. Here, one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the leader and father figure (Donald Sutherland) of the gang. He is the worst of them all and the villain of the movie. Also, Theron's character is in Hollywood's typically overflowing feminist fashion, where women can do all things (including driving) better than a man. A third little irritation is Seth Green's smug, smart attitude, which we should join because she's hip and cool. <br /> <br /> Despite these obstacles, it is a very entertaining movie, and it does not trump obscenity or sex. And yes, these little cars are cool. Everyone with whom I spoke, who saw this movie, enjoyed it.
