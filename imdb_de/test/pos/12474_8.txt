After seeing this for the first time, I thought, "Wow, this is the most spectacular movie I have seen visually." Since then, I've seen some who have outdone it, but it's still among the best in this department. I'm just disgusted that the long-awaited DVD was made so bad, the quality of this transfer is hardly better than the VHS tape. The jungle scenes are shot in Cameroon and "lush" is the best adjective to describe what you see. Apart from jungle sounds, "seeing" is certainly almost everything initially, as there is almost no "hearing", no dialogue, until Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) befriends Ian Holm and vice versa .... so be prepared if you have this Movie not seen. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, I'll just say that this is not the Tarzan that many of us have met in Johnny Weismuller's films ... but that's not a complaint. If you feel like action and are not interested in cinematography, you just have to overcome the silent introductory phase. In this Tarzan version, our hero goes back to Scotland (his roots). Adjusts to this environment (for the most part ... and a bit too fast for credibility), and then returns to the jungle without Jane. This is allegedly more applicable to the Tarzan books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The special effects here were achieved by Rick Baker, one of the best in the industry. Sharp DVD or not, this is still a stunning movie and very interesting during its 2 hours and 15 minutes.
