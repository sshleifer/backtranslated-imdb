Peter Falk shines as 90-year-old Morris Applebaum, the patriarch, who has decided to "check out" after a recent blow-out round. His three children, Lauran San Giacomo, David Paymer and Judge Reinhold, are notified by letter and immediately come to his door to deal with their eccentric father. There is a great father / daughter chemistry with Laura San Giacomo, whose character grows strongest through the ordeal. It is a well-rounded example of your average dysfunctional family and their memories, pain, growth and ignorance / tolerance in each other's lives. The music is one that you will enjoy, and the one liners are well tuned and funny. Although I found the actual "Checking Out" party disappointing, the rest of the movie will certainly make you laugh, cry and leave the theater with a smile on your face. Move over "Big Fat Greek Wedding" ... the "Big Fat Jewish Suicide" is here.
