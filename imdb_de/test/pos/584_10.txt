The Muppet movie is immediately a classic. I remember the opening scene with the bird's-eye view of the swamp and Kermit, which (in my opinion) was the most popular song in the history of the songs. At this point, my mother always sang with Kermit. <br /> <br /> If you look at this title as a young adult, it makes me smile. I can still sing to my heart's content. Like many Muppet movies, there are jokes for adults that (in my opinion) are still funny today. My favorite line of all time is actually from this movie, it's the last one that my green, spherical hero Kermit has spoken about "Life is like a movie, Write your own end". I intend to do that! Thanks, Jim Henson.
