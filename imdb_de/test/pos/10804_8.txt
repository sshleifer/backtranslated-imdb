Unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/, this movie has no background information. It will show a snapshot of Danton's case, his mock trial and his execution, but if you have not thoroughly studied the revolution, it's hard to understand where the characters come from (Fouquier-Tinville, Philippeau, Desmoulins, Robespierre ...) And to appreciate them for what they are: Danton and Joe Blobb could be the same person to the viewer. For example, Robespierre & Desmoulins have been close friends since their youth, and this explains how Robespierre acts. Those who know the facts will be able to easily orient themselves and appreciate this good movie, with actors delivering solid acting, no unnecessary subplots, and a good reconstruction of time. Desmoulins and Danton are the best characters, but they all do a good job, even the "demented" Saint-Just, who is portrayed as a kind of psychopath. "Terreur" was a time of massacres whose significance is not fully documented and which was driven largely by ambition, greed and the resolution of personal disputes that were passed as the next epochal measure against the tyranny of ignorant San Culottes.
