This film was adapted from the well-known sutra of Journey to the Western, where a monk with his three students seeks a long-lost book on the teachings of the Buddha. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the case As solemn as the previous films, which according to the legend were created, succeeded however to bring romantic and funny scenes full of fun. <br /> <br /> This movie's real purpose revolves more on the monk who saved it from consuming demonic flying creatures. One of his disciples, the monkey god, managed to get him out of the battle in time, but was captured by the demons and thrown into the deep throat of a dragon trapped in this particular dungeon. <Br /> <br /> The monk awoke in a small village where he found Mei Yan (the so-called Ugly Snake Daughter), who fell in love with him at first sight. Although she was ugly, she did not let her distract her. However, the search for the rescue of his three disciples soon revealed that they were filled with obstacles that turned out to be Mei Yan following the monk. The problems crept deeper and here the conflicts between the relationships are getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story would be at your leisure, but suffice to say that this movie does not depict the typical story of the movie book, it's more for those looking for a fun and easy picture of it want to find out what Journey to the West and the love obstacles really mean. <br /> <br /> At the end the whole summary can be described with just one word and that is love. The monk showed the Celestial Gates, the Heavenly Palace and the Buddha himself how love itself can overcome the worst fear of all and is considered the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powers /> A wonderfully designed and amusing action awaits those who buy this ticket. Of course there would be no remorse, at least from my side and those who were in the cinema that day watching the same movie.
