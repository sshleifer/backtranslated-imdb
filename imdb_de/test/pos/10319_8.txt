For the record, I'm thoroughly a Curly fan. But I have to say that Shemp was not that bad in reality. Yeah, maybe he did not have the same kind of slapstick Curly had, but he was funny in his way. At least he was not as bad as Joe Besser. <br /> <br /> In BRIDELESS GROOM, Shemp plays a music professor (Stooge, a professor, yes, right) who has recently inherited half a million dollars from a dead uncle, and Moe & Larry have to prepare him for a wife to marry six o'clock that night, or no money. <br /> <br /> This was one of Stooges' first skits with Shemp before they started to recycle their material. Perhaps it's not surprising that Shemp was one of the Stooges before Curly came into play, so he seemed natural. The slapstick gags are hilarious, especially this one scene with Moe and Shemp in a phone booth. Indispensable stooge, to be honest.
