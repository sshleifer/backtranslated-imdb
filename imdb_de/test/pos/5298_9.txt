I have a strong feeling that what you think of this film will depend very much on your frame of reference. If you've never seen a Miyazaki movie before, it's likely to confuse you. If you've ever seen a Miyazaki movie, it's likely to confuse you. But you do not care. I found out that when I saw one of his animated films for the first time, I tried too hard to figure out what happened and why - and that influenced my enjoyment of the movie. Now that I have seen pretty much every Miyazaki movie, I see the bizarre and just shoot everything - and enjoy the beauty of everything. In many ways, these films (at least for the Western audience) are like drugs - many strange and beautiful images that do not always make sense at first, but feel really good !! Of all the Miyazaki films, this could have the most unusual and incomprehensible plot - even more than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But like these and many other Studio Gibli movies, if you sit back and watch, you'll be rewarded with a fabulous story. But because it's so hard to describe (and others have already done that), I will not go there. <br /> <br /> As for the artwork, it's typical for one of those Japanese movies. There was a noticeable change. What the background looked like crayons, was used very intensively. That was not a bad thing at all - the beautiful, pastel-like look was very appealing and unique. In a way, it looked like a small piece of Bill Plympton's art was poured into a typical Miyazaki movie. With a high frame rate, exceptional character animations (which infuse you with plenty of personality) and a great "wow factor", this is an extraordinary movie for all ages. Although much more designed for younger audiences (especially the TOTORO fans), it's a bit scary here and there (during the storm segments), but there are plenty of great things for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically like that) I loved the cute stuff and applauded the strangeness of the movie. <br /> <br /> A great movie - among the best Miyazaki. I do not give 10 because I'm hesitant to do that - and I liked a few more movies from the studio a bit more (especially TOTORO). But that does NOT mean you should not get out and see it now - do it and do yourself a favor.
