This movie has almost everything. The action is cool, it's funny, 2 great captains and a really wicked villain that I really hated. Not many movies have bad bad guys. Only mainly comic villains. He really deserves a kick. <br /> <br /> Jake Scott really has the talent of his dad to know how to make great visuals. The direction is flawless and feels irresistibly carefree. I do not usually like movies shot in the old days, but I loved that because it gets boring, as it does in many other epic films (sense and sensuality, age of innocence and the absolute worst) Duke) , This will restore your faith. Thanks to Craig Armstrong's amazing score. The music is both atmospheric and ethereal and in action scenes it is very exciting. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and has a very grainy and muddy, anamorphic image of 2.35: 1.
