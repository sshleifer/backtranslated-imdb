I was so happy to learn that Hari Om 2007 will finally be theatrical. I saw this movie three years ago at the Vancouver International Film Festival and have been waiting for its release ever since so I can send anyone I know to watch it. It's like a trip to India ... colorful, magical, thought-provoking. Apart from a rather strange Hollywood-style rickshaw scene in Hollywood style, this film is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood-style song and dance movie, but it has drama and romance and humor. The interactions between the Indian taxi driver and the French tourist reflect the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western lifestyles and philosophies. The characters are a bit broad, but the acting was very good. Visually, this movie is a treat, because you really get a sense of what it's like to drive through Rajasthan ... dreamlike. Sometimes it's hard to believe that everything you see and experience is real ... the movie has the same quality. Great soundtrack!
