After all these years, I'm confused why Julie Brown (West Coast) is not a household name or a very famous comedy star. She is one of the funniest women in the world. In this parody she attacks Madonna, who is one of her favorite targets. She is Medusa, an extremely successful singer, like Madonna, who also had the documentary "Truth or Dare". Julie Brown mocks Madonna as Medusa from Wisconsin, the land of dairy and beer. I remember the section where she went to Wisconsin to visit her family and a grave. I can not remember if it was a parent or a pet. I remember someone who said that Medusa did not do anything original. She only copied others. I have to say that I hope that this parody documentary is available on DVD somewhere. Julie Brown was different at her best ridicule and spoofing.
