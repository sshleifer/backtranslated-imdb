Farscape is the best sci-fi show period. For one main reason: everything the show tries is very good. Technically, the music is original and perfectly attuned to the show. The special effects are fullness and higher quality than almost everything you will see on your TV. Acting is also great, too many shows nowadays use only the American market for actors for their shows. Remember the first time you saw The Matrix, and you said, Wow, where did this Agent Smith come from? It's the same feeling that you're watching Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tupu, Virginia Hey, and especially Wayne Pygram. These Aussies are great and it comes through in this great show. <br /> <br /> The plot is unique. The next thing closest to me is Babylon 5 during the Shadow War episodes. It's a real treat to see all episodes sequentially again, the intricacies of the characters' interpersonal relationships are well written and executed. The entire plot is both original and thoroughly entertaining. I always itch after the next show. <br /> <br /> The funny episodes are funny, the drama episodes are touching and the action sequences are tense. At the beginning of the second season, there were some great comedic episodes that made me laugh out loud. This rarely happens when watching TV and is not South Park, Sealab 2021 or Seinfeld. The drama is even more difficult, regardless of whether Crichton meets his mother or the characters are confronted with their mortality - everything happens with heart and intensity. After all, it goes without saying that the action is tops. This is sci-fi. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of science fiction, if you like good TV at all, if you like good serial action, you owe it to yourself to see Farscape. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Ben Browder owns.
