I was addicted to the first 10 seconds of Pitch Black. I had gone into this movie and thought that it would be just another cheesy sci-fi movie. Instead, I found an extremely entertaining, thought-provoking action movie on the edge of your seat. The movie goes beyond your basic special effects. The actors are amazing, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and others ..) as Fry is really a joy on the screen, while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so intriguing that you'll die just to hear him speak again. > <br /> The look of the film is breathtaking, the contrast of blue, yellow and orange due to the three different suns is amazing. Followed by the total darkness of darkness. I would really recommend any lover of ALIEN movies or Radha Mitchell (which is why I looked at him) to watch this movie. I'm sure in the end you'll be looking at the darkness in a whole new way.
