I think it's unbelievably hard to write a full review on Giorgino just because it's one of those viewer-dependent, complex, poetic and philosophical films that carry a brain when you're having fun looking at its shell and its core at the same time but there are some things that are sure and unequivocal to any art lover (which I hope I am). The first thing: It is a certain masterpiece, even of this kind of art, which persists for a long time. Second, it is one of those rare "dark" films in which darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive, and much sadder than depressing, like the art of Pieter Brueghel or Caspar David Friedrich. As far as the core of the film is concerned, someone called him Kafkian, although I disagree with that, because he is far beyond Kafka's misanthropic logic and more like Edgar Poe's parables: dark and scary, but in fact that he touches the most gentle threads of our souls Giorgino is on the poetic side (which is much more important than the narrative) a story about the eternal peace and love that can only be achieved through the eternal childhood of the soul. Those who have such souls are usually branded crazy by our society, but from another point of view, they all have the virtue that everyone else has lost when they "grow up": the virtue of God's love. In fact, Giorgino is a very Christian film: "Be like children" (Mt 18: 3) is a true hidden tagline, though the film never deals with any kind of morality and focuses only on Christian philosophy. True God is beyond every human morality. However, I think Boutonnat is too harsh to portray "adult" humans as some kind of demons trying to steal childhood from the rare surviving souls, but it is his point of view and he has the right to think that way. When looking at Giorgino, do not try to look for hidden symbols (though there are some), look better for thoughts expressed by the characters and their behavior, and learn from them. Nor can I mention that the film looks amazing with excellent photography, especially through the rational use of color filters, a very responsive editing, a wonderful spectacle of cast and, of course, the atmospheric beauty of the Winter Mountains that reminded me of Brueghels Snow". Interestingly enough, the scene of death in the form of an old woman with sunken black eyes driving on a cart immediately reminded me of Pesta (Plague) from the series of drawings by the Norwegian painter Theodor Kittelsen depicting a black man plaguing the plague the population of a small town in the mountain valley. Is it a coincidence?
