I remember my dad set these episodes to video. My whole family loved them, and now that I've moved away from home and have my own life, I try to share these fabulous Jim Henson creations with my husband and stepson, but as I start to find out, not everyone is one Henson fan. What a pity, because they just have to come to terms with this series. But even if they do not find that interesting, I can recommend anyone who grabs the storyteller. You are in a world full of stories from a time when people could only speak through stories about inexplicable situations and how people have to deal with them if they have ever been confronted with these situations.
