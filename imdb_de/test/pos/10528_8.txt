I saw this TV version of a Christie Mystery story when it was shown on Channel 5 in New York City in 1980. At the time I was surprised that it was not shown on Channel 13, the public service broadcaster that showed most of the Masterpiece Theater programs, but (apart from some Dorothy Sayers "Lord Peter Wimsey" stores and THE MOONSTONE) The BBC productions seldom engage in British detective stories. Another series, THE RIVALS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, dealt with stories from the Victorian and Edwardian epochs, so these stories were brought on Channel 13. <br /> <br /> The plot of WHY IS NOT BY YOU ask EVANS? It was a young couple stumbling over a dying man whose last words are just the title of the story (the novel was originally WHY WAS THE EMANS NOT?, But was later renamed THE BOOMERANG CLUE). The young couple starts investigating the murder and investigates the crime of a group of people surrounding a questionable doctor (Eric Porter). Despite the warnings of the hero's father (John Gielgud), the hero (James Warwick) and the heroine (Francesca Annis) are investigating - even as it gets darker and more dangerous. The death of another suspect by suicide increases the obvious dangers as the killer begins to silence the two amateur detectives. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, even though I think it was a bit too long for a single night of entertainment (if it's like the later Miss Marple episodes with Joan Hickson or the Hercule Poirot). Episodes would have been made if this had been better in two parts). But it has strengths. One is the correct use of Porter as the prime suspect and a clever scene later in the film in which he seems to spy on the young couple exploring the puzzle. If you stick to the movie, you'll experience a fair surprise later. <br /> <br /> But one failed. If it is a Christie novel, the characters in the story must be in a strict sequence of movements, so that the reader can find out what the secret of the plot is. I will just add that if you hear the dialogue at a certain point and how a little boy was almost killed (but not), you will find all parts of the story together and what the rogue's motives were. Apart from that and the long time it takes the Telefilm to tell its story, it's a pretty good movie and one of the best programs based on a Christie story at a time when they were suddenly renaissance in films after her novels.
