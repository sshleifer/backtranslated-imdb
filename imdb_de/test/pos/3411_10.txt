A few weeks ago I lost my beloved companion and friend of fourteen, a golden retriever named Sasha. When I came home from the Animal Hospital, after making one of the most painful decisions of my life, my teenage daughter was by my side. , .and we talked about this episode of the Twilight Zone. I could be wrong, but I remember a line that Arthur Hunnicutt said when Satan tried to bring him to hell, but his dog could not go. , .and his dog growled defiantly against the gatekeeper, who tried to make the old hunter "step inside." , "It would be 'a hell of heaven if dogs were not allowed," and the spirit of the old miner and his dog decided to turn away from the gate (from what they had considered heaven to roam alone for eternity) What a tearful moment when they meet a "good old country boy" on this eternal road to find out he's an angel, sent out to find them, and "a safe neighbor, of course dogs are allowed to go to heaven." <br /> <br /> I admit that I cried when I talked about it with my daughter while mourning the death of our beloved Golden.Rod Serling was really a genius, a voice, in the early sixties against racism, hatred, "know-nothingism" and a deep inspiration for me was to become a writer.This episode, for over forty-five years, was a consolation message for all of us who have lost a beloved friend h urge you to get one of the marriages in the Twilight Zone or buy it next time. There will be some tears, but also comfort. Thank you, Rod, for everything you've taught us. , even now.
