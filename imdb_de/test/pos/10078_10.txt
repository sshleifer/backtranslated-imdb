It's curious how the least-known films are sometimes among the best you've seen. This movie has all the elements of a modern thriller, rifles, techno, bad guys, cash, etc. and yet is something very special. I would attribute this to two very charismatic people. Christopher Walken has a cool confidence and Lorraine Bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women I've ever seen on screen. Another important reason why this film stands out is the shift to Jamaica after the beginning. The Jamaican resort is so beautiful that you wish you would sit by the pool in the evenings with a Run'n'Coke. , , I know that I did it. I am very glad that I saw this movie - it was just too good to miss!
