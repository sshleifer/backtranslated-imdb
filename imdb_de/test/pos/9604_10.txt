As you can see, I have submitted 2 comments on this show since 1991 ... and no, ITV still has not made it available for general publication. However, I recently contacted ITV to see if there was a way to get a copy, and that was their answer ....... <br /> <br /> "Unfortunately, there are no plans to publish this program on DVD / Video, but you can purchase copies from our Requers Requests department, your email address is: viewers.requests@itv.com". <br /> <br /> I hope you all now have the chance to enjoy this classic short comedy again. > <br />
