The working girl Kitty (Sothern) is engaged to Bill (Kelly), who neglects her by working long hours in his garage to save money on her marriage. After Kitty got up on her birthday, she goes to a double date / blind date, where she meets the department store heir Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). She falls in love, but leaves him when his expressions of love seem to cover the desire for her mistress and not for his wife. The faithful Bill gathers to comfort her, and finally gives in to his repeated demands to resume her engagement, which was in part put under pressure by Bill's support of her family after she lost her job. But if Bob returns and is convinced he wants to marry, will Kitty follow her heart or conscience? <br /> <br /> This movie was much better than I expected. The character of Bill initially appears as the kind of noisy Irish comic type that Jack Carson played so often. But Kelly (and the script) give the character real love and compassion and Bill turns out to be the best person in the whole group. Spectators can rummage him against the wild Hartwell! The tone of the film, however, varies between carefree romance and a much darker side, especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather terrible accident in Bill's garage. <br/> <br /> The cast is rounded off by the trusted Jane Darwell as Kitty's mother, a mischievous but not overly obnoxious Mickey Rooney as Kitty's younger brother, and Spencer Charters as Kitty's ne'er-do-well Father.
