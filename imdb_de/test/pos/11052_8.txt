78 years ago ... the premiere of "Anna Christie" with the slogan "Garbo Talks!" The movie lasts 16 minutes and viewers reach the height of curiosity: Greta enters the bar and experiences a long-awaited transition from silence to sound: a few seconds to complete her quiet era, and finally Greta Garbo says a historic line : "Give me a whiskey, ginger ale on the side and do not be stingy, baby!" <br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" (1930) is the film by Clarence Brown who introduced a great silent star Greta Garbo to Talks. Nowadays we can only imagine what serious transmission was for actors and actresses. The career of many had to end, which we barely or not at present see. And it was no coincidence that Clarence Brown initiated the first conversation with Swedish beauty. Garbo confided to the director after two of his major silent film productions, FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1926) and A WOMAN OF AFFAIRS (1928): films that achieved overwhelming success at the box office, both with Garbo in the lead. <br /> <br /> But we are in 2008, and the fact that the film is now purely historical seems to be of lesser importance. For today's viewer, the question is not how Garbos voice sounds, but whether the film can still be seen after these 78 years. In other words, we all strive to answer the question of whether the film has lasted for a while. Does it? <br /> <br /> When I saw it recently, I came to the conclusion that "Anna Christie" is still entertaining except for a few minor technical issues, including a static camera. It is, on the one hand, a wonderful story of a life, a reality that faces the young woman (based on Eugene O'Neill's play), and, on the other hand, an artistic manifestation of real splendor in the direction of directing and acting: let me explore these two aspects analyze in separate sections. <br /> <br /> CONTENTS: Chris Christopherson (George F. Marion), a heavy drinker, lives a sailor's life on a barge. He is filled with sorrow, he is comforted by a letter from his daughter Anna ( Garbo), whom he has not seen for fifteen years, says she will return to him and begins to change everything, but forgets that his daughter is no longer a child without experience, but a 23 year-old woman who has gone through various things on a Minnesota farm where she lived and worked and forgets that she has the right to accept another kind of male love in her life ... Tue ese short presentation of the content not from the main character's perspective But the one introduced to us earlier than Anna (her father Chris) lets you see how universal it is. After all these years, no letter was simply deleted from the entire text that seems to be life. Cases discussed here in 1930 are still reasonable and valid ... PERFORMANCES. There are not many characters in the movie, but there are two who really shine in the roles. Of course, Greta Garbo herself has done something extraordinary in her 15-year-old phenomenon whose presence has strongly influenced the history of early cinema (something I've already discussed in many of my previous comments on her films). But Garbo is a bit different here. I admit there are moments in this movie where she does not feel comfortable with her role. This seems to be due to her new experience with sound in English. However, your performance is, as always, real and unique. But everyone expected that from Garbo. The true surprise of the film for the 1930s and also for us is Marie Dressler as Marthy. Her facial expression, her accent, and the overall portrayal of a drinking woman looking at life from the perspective of the "whipped bottle" is excellent. One of her best moments is talking to Anna Christie at the bar, who preceded her jolly talk with Chris. The rest of the minor cast is fine, but not great (here the German version makes up for it). In particular, Dressler, with the exception of Garbo, is an absolutely flawless choice. If you asked me what I like about "Anna Christie" these days, I would tell you: It's a classic movie. There is one more thing that I must mention in the end. It's humor, wonderful joke that makes itself felt everywhere. Although the content is quite serious and "Anna Christie" in no way possesses a comedian spirit (Garbo's only comedy was NINOTCHKA), there are times when you will split your pages. For example, do not skip Anna and Matt's visit to the theme park, especially in the restaurant where he orders milk for them, thinking about how virtuous and innocent she is, beer for herself, and suddenly Marthy comes by accident them ... <br /> <br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" is a perfect movie for classic fans and a must for those who are a little interested in the true splendor of performance. If you have enough of these modern stars, look for such films and you will be satisfied. Worth your search! <br /> <br /> Skaal Greta Garbo! Skaal Marie Dressler! Let's have a toast to the great jobs you did in the movie! Skaal after all the years when wine tastes much better and your senses are in a different sense with us ...
