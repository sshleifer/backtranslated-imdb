This movie is not only good, it is incredible. Apart from good performances, original action, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and much more, it was a hitherto completely invisible world for the public. This is the first science-fiction movie to take us to the unknown space of our galaxy with such great effects and a breathtaking reality that the audience will be left without words. I'm only 16 years old and that's why I grew up in the movies to a world of modern effects and 3D animations. Nevertheless, I was really, and I mean completely, overwhelmed by the quality of these effects even after almost 40 years. The visual effects were just one of the benefits of this film. The camera was amazing and charming in true Kubrick style. It feels like you are consumed from the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the circular control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera, and the sheer size of this movie caught me off guard, though I'd already seen the review before I bought it. But this movie has more to offer. The meaning of this film can also be interpreted to your liking, although I think there are some clear points about humanity (also true Kubrick style). As humanity goes beyond its development, it is only maintenance on board and is therefore not required by the computer, one of the tools of the humanities. How we act in space like babies, learn to walk again, lose control of our tools in weightlessness and breathe through the equipment like fish out of the water. At the height of evolution, we began as a simple primate in the never-ending adventure. Many may think that the length and slow pace of this movie is boring? ridiculed? or just a waste of time. But before you can get to those conclusions, you should consider why Kubrick spends a few minutes with quiet music and a spaceship in the middle of the room. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect of the audience. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb and relax, we can not enjoy this movie as it was meant to be. This is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies. This requires time, thoughts and, above all, commitment and feelings to look at them. All this together makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving images. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.
