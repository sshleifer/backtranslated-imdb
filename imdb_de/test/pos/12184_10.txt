I have to say that this movie is absolutely incredible. I do not understand why it was rated so bad. It has romance, music, darkness and vampires. Also Stuart Townsend was a great job as a lestat, the acting was great. Usually I do not like this music either, sometimes too. But I have to say, in this film, the music fits perfectly. If you like dark movies about vampires, this is definitely for you or even if you do not have a love story about it. My rating is defiant: 10 out of 10. Anyway, I seriously suggest that you see it. I remember that I did not see that for years, I looked at it again about a year ago and am addicted to it again. lol. Great movie!!!
