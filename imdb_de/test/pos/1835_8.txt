This movie is so cool. It told me that I should thoroughly enjoy every moment of my life. I think Bonnie Hunt (Jerry Maguire) is good at writing and I am so happy that she gave the aging actors the opportunity to play such big roles in the film. That's really nice, in a society that worships wealth, health and youth, it was nice to see a movie about ordinary people. The movie reminded me a lot of "While you were Sleeping", which I really love. If you do not like this movie, you should work on your sensibility skills. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quotes: Megan Dayton: "All I'm saying for safety's sake is do not shave your legs, because then you definitely will not let it go too far." Grace Briggs: "Megan, it's one first date." Megan Dayton: "I've married a first date, I'm sure you plan to be prudent, but once you're in the moment, the male brain, I do not know, everything they say suddenly seems brilliant Legs are your only connection to reality. "Favorite scenes: Megan (Good Will Hunting) on ​​her bike. All scenes in the garden. The conversation and the camaraderie between the grandfather and his friends in the restaurant. Please do not miss this movie, it will warm your heart!
