I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival in the Family section. I am not sure if one of my children really has the movie, but I have to say that it was a wonderful short film. <br /> <br /> 'Nostradamus and Me' is an interesting short film about the hopes and fears that we all grew up in the 80's, which in turn affects the way my children feel today. Then we had Regan, today we got Bush. Instead of nuclear war we have terrorism. <br /> <br /> I really identified with the main character, and I dated a high school 'Curehead' myself. We all felt "nothing meant" when we were 16, but it's great to see a movie where they discover that everything is important !!! <br /> <br /> Again, I probably would not have included this in the family area ... There were a few too many cursing words for younger kids, but it was a wonderful and entertaining movie.
