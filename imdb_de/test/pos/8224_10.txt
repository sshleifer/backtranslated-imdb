The Regard of Flight, written and performed by Bill Irwin, is a true classic drama that works well on a small screen. It's full of quick and sparkling dialogues and some of the best physical comedies of the decade. It is 99% over "99%" of today's "comedy". I am sure that someday it will take its rightful place with such great shows as "The Fantastiks" and "Waiting for Godot". Why it is not yet available on DVD is a mystery and a tragedy.
