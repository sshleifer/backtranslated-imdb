This movie is a great movie, but like most films, it is very predictable. The biggest highlight of the movie is, of course, the star character Amanda Bynes, which is absolutely stunning and funny. She is one of the few people in the world who can use all 53 muscles in her face to make the strangest and bravest faces ever made. It is good for the kids and in the end contains male nudity and suggestive nudity. All in all, they have done a good job updating an old classic, and it deserves to rest on the movie with O and 10 Things I hate about you. The other actors also do a good job on their first debuts.
