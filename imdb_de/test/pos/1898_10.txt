Yes, that's one of the big names in the black action genre. A bewildering mix of racist comedy and racist violence (sometimes a disturbing mood even for a fan of the genre), this movie is not your shaft in the park. Wonderful pieces of the Rudy Ray Moore comedy stand out that do not seem funny, at least not for a white boy like me, but great in context. Much better than his dissimilar sequel "The Human Tornado"
