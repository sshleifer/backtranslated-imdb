I saw Marigold in a preview show a few days ago and thought it was a thoroughly exciting and entertaining movie. The film is about a not-so-successful American actress going to India to act in a low-budget movie, then sitting there, finding on arrival the funding of the film along with the producers and investors disappeared. A chance encounter with an Indian movie being filmed nearby causes her to be hired for a small dancer role. Since Indian movies contain a lot of singing and dancing, this is a problem for Marigold, who has two left feet, not to mention a personality so tightly rolled up and thorny that she can barely hear, let alone feel, the music. as Prem, the choreographer of the film, she advises to do so. <br /> <br /> But "Prem" - the word, not the person - means "love" and Prem - the person, not the person word - seems to embody this emotion in his dealings with him, be it his friends Production assistants who introduced Marigold to the filming, the narcissistic and arrogant threads of the film, or the bitchy and stocky Marigold herself. Marigold soon finds his feet under expert guidance and amiable treatment - literally and figuratively. I have to say a word for those who are not familiar with the use of singing and dancing in Indian films. In contrast to American musicals, the story progresses through these dance numbers, while the development of the action unfolds and character changes take place parallel to the dance. It should also be noted that Indian dance is much more than just movement. An essential part of this is the staging of the dancer's emotions and emotions as the story of the dance is told. This is the main purpose of the dance and the dancer. <br /> <br /> That the marigold reaches this stage of perfection is shown in a stunning dance number half way through when Marigold performs the dance she is supposed to do for the film in the film, also expressing her love for Prem , It's an amazing performance by Ali Larter, especially considering that she's not used to dancing in her films or that she has felt the dance's feelings about her character. It shows her ability as an actress and how much hard work she put into the role. <br /> <br /> Of course, no romantic movie can work without a credible Prince Charming. Salman Khan, who plays the role of Prem, adapts the role to a T. Even if it turns out that he is a prince who is not so charming, he does not lose the sympathy of the audience. For many years, Salman has been ruling Hindi cinema (sometimes called Bollywood), and it's worth remembering that his first starring role was Prem. He is absolutely charming, sweet, charming, sexy and vulnerable. For those who have never met him on the screen before, be ready to be met with mega-cans of pure magnetism! He and Ali Larter make up a lovely couple and are well matched in their acting as well as their looks. <br /> <br /> Will they be able to solve their problems? It does not seem possible when we hear the last song of the film, a nice mix of facts and fantasy, reality and metaphor. The end certainly surprised some of the viewers I saw it with, but they were satisfied. The songs are used very skillfully. They are in Hindi (without subtitles) for the film sequences and in English for other occasions. However, their meaning is always clear from the context and the choreography. <br /> <br /> Marigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy - yes, there is also some humor here. The Indian settings and costumes give it a fairytale quality that matches a story comparable to a modern fairy tale. <br /> <br /> If you are or were curious about Indian cinema, however, you were undecided in the attempt. This is an excellent introduction. It captures the color and vibrancy of Indian films, not only in the costumes and jewelry (which are quite impressive), but also in the lively dances and world music. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ali Larter, you should make sure that she is a selfish, demanding, "high caregiving" woman who nevertheless has an inner attraction that awakens the love of two men. If you are a girl, you will enjoy admiring Ali's beautiful costumes and cheating on her as her leading man. If you're a guy, you can not just admire Ali in her sexy costumes, but learn from Salman Khan what it takes to make the loving heart of someone as brave as Marigold.
