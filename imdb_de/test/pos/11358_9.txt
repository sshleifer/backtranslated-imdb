Great and charming. Justin Henry is beautiful as the blessed and mischievous Howard Kaylan, the singer of the top ten hit band The Turtles. The real magic is the title sequence with an Oscar worthy of Royale Watkins. A performance that completely captures the mystical and down to earth Jimi Hendrix. Unbelievably not many movies can find the essence of a special moment in life and times. I want this to be available from any home video retailer. What is the deal? <br /> <br /> Thank you, Eddie. A worthy addition to the history of psychedelic 60s. A clear sparkle in the mind's eye.
