<br /> <br /> As a teenager I have about a hundred years of films to catch up with. I try to see a mix of classics, mainstream, art-house and other films. The 70s are one of the most important decades for movies: it was not until the average, classic films changed to embassies and antisocial behavior. It was like nothing anyone had ever seen before. What A Decade Under the Influence essentially shows is how important all films from The Graduate to Star Wars are. Richard LaGravenese and the late Ted Demme are the main interviewers in this documentary, which interviews such people as Dennis Hopper, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Jon Voight, including how these few years changed the cinema forever. It's a very professional, sophisticated documentary that is even funded by IFC films. However, since this is very professional, I would think that they at least laugh at the sound of someone behind the camera laughing. For me, that meant how neat and clean the whole thing was. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's a very interesting documentary about the film of the people who do it. Of course, they do not bomb their own movies or the like, but they honestly show what they think of the movies and what they meant by that. I do not know much about film (but I want to take care of it when I grow up), so I feel like someone else like me. This movie is a great asset. I've seen a lot of movies mentioning them, like Chinatown and One flew over the cuckoo's nest, but a little more insight into those movies was very revealing. It's not as bad as the cut, it seemed to take its time initially and quite relaxed, so did not have enough time to get to whatever they wanted to show. In the last few minutes, they were crammed into Star Wars and Jaws when they were two of the most important. It seemed like they were trying too hard to show a lot of clips, and that's fine, but some of them were unimportant, like an extended one from Network. <br /> <br /> Overall, Influence is very exciting. Informative documentary that at least helped me learn more about a second golden age in American cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Reviewed with R for language and pictures of sexuality, violence and drug use.
