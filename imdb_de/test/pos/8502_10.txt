Do not forget the lover on the page !! She is a 'hottie', Karen Parsons is delicious, she is wonderful in acting and beauty and style. It's just his job! HO, well, here's a show that hurls writing into your stomach and while you're doubling, you kick your butt! She quoted Peter's wife (The Associate / Writer / Producer) and said when she saw the "previews" for upcoming "new" shows at an ABC network party, she looked at her husband after the preview for "the job" was played and said, "That does not look like anything else on this network. You guys have problems." That means it looks very good! But it does not look like the regular "shiny, happy people" or "over-the-hair dramas" of them (ABC) would be regular "air". From the moment I saw this, after the first episode was over, I made sure I could not miss the time window next week. I was immediately addicted to "The Job". Wit and cynicism, outrageous situations and laughing writers make this series a hit !! <br /> <br /> Then I felt anger and the feeling of being disappointed that the show was just shot from the air. I wondered which leader had decided to demolish an important cornerstone of comedy for their network. <br /> <br /> I talked to other people about knowing some, some not, but I know the stupid network did not promote this hard enough or I should say it visually enough: If they had it, it would have at least three to five seasons, maybe even six I simply believe that it is known to know network problems and too much to sign one or the other "formula" that they missed the boat here. There was so much room for expansion, it had just begun. The situations were funny and serious, fast and sometimes slow, though it did not keep up much pace. A few years later I found it on DVD for $ 50.00 new. For me, it would be worth $ 1,000 to have this in my entertainment library. I watched in amazement as I went through both seasons for the third time on DVD and the ending "Betrayal" ended in a totally serious drama segment where they discovered a murder victim. It was better than most drama victims unit 'and' policeman 'now shows on air !!! They walked into the scene as seriously as a heart attack, believing that they did not even miss a beat. Just as it should be meant to be, I am so impressed by the "versatile paths" Tolan and Leary brought to the storylines and scripts. <br /> <br /> In another outrage of the "entertainment week" I learned that the beautiful wardrobe, made of silk ties and expensive suits with pressed shirts and ultra-stylish shoes ... all for the movie "In the cut" (2003) sold for only four hundred dollars, that's it !!! ! I'm sick. Did you see what they all wear for every show? A good overcoat alone could do so much. <br /> <br /> This was some of Denis Leary's finest. I recommend this great policeman "Dramedy" for East Coast motors or wherever you are in this country. I even heard that people from Ireland made jokes with Leary, the 'bathroom' episode, and repeated lines from him because they saw it over there. (****) A very intuitive, funny New York Leary / Tolan Cop show.
