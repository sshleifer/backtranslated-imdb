Frank Sinatra took that role, chewing it up with the rest of the landscape and spitting it out in his own way. TMWTGA is staged, the end is banal, some scenes need a bit more editing, but that's all. It's a great conversation from start to finish, and as you look at it, you find Sinatra, the long-dead MOR crooner, junkies, gangster card games, and all the urban hustle and bustle of the US in his blood. There are all kinds of directing touches to amuse you, and the (undated) soundtrack cooks all the way. The marathon card game defeated Goodfellas, Sopranos, etc. by forty years! So it was not true to the book? Which movie is? And I can not imagine anyone remembering when Brando was let loose; The cold turkey scenes would have been embarrassing, rather than nervous, convincing and moving with Sinatra. Nobody mentioned the shabby, lazy and cynical policemen - absolutely right! And Eleanor Parker would have * fucked * me.
