This may be one of my favorite movies. It tells the story of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs), who lost his mother at a very young age and was therefore bought by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. On her birthday, however, the Snow Queen (Bridget Fonda) comes to the hotel owned by her father and abducts Kai. Gurda then follows Kai and follows him through the four seasons to save him. It has wonderful special effects and the story fits together very well and is easy to follow. I think it's a great movie for the whole family. I've looked at it every time since it came out, and I'm never tired of it, so I gave it a 10!
