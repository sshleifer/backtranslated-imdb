A rousing and deeply moving love story with powerful performances by Ralph Fiennes, Willem Defoe and Juliette Binoche. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a badly burned man (Ralph Fiennes) being dragged off a plane during a flight and tells his story to his nurse (Juliette Binoche). Shortly before the war, he fell in love with the beautiful Katherine Clifton (Kristen Scott Thomas), although she is married to Jeffery Clifton (Colin Firth)) and the two begin a passionate and forbidden affair. <br /> <br /> A very haunting and tragic story of love and desire that takes place in some absolutely beautiful places in the desert. Especially if you are a fan of Anthony Minghellas work, but be prepared to shed many tears that are very moving, especially in the end.
