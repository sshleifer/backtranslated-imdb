Shazam was okay, but Hero High was my favorite when I was a kid. I mean, before Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006) came, there was Hero High, a school for superheroes in training, for teenagers with super powers. Help the police catch bad guys, and other times they get into embarrassing situations like The Greatest American Hero (1981). It was a funny cartoon, which was also fun, was the live action stage show The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam. The actors who have voiced the characters also have characters on the show. Rex Ruthless (John Berwick), Misty Magic (Jere Fields), WeatherMan (Jim Greenleaf), Captain California (Chris Hensel, who also sang the title song), Dirty Trixie, Glorious Gal (Becky Pearl), who looks the love child of Superman and Wonder Woman) and Punk Rock (Johnny Venocour). The whole cast was just about anything when it came to jokes. The cartoon was a funny superhero comedy, I support that he will come back in live action like Fat Albert (2004).
