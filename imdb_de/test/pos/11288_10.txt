I would like to anticipate this review by saying that I have no idea what "Begotten" really is about. All I really know is that in the beginning God kills Himself and gives birth to Mother Earth, who then soaks with the seed of God. She then gives birth to a son. The rest is quite subjective, and you have to interpret it in your own way. <br /> <br /> How I decided to interpret the film was that; God, who killed himself, marked the beginning of the scientific revolution as people began to question the teachings of the church such as the geocentric view of the universe, and so on. Mother Earth symbolized the people who started to think for themselves and reject the church because God says so. "The people of the tribes was the church that struck against them and tried to push Christianity down their necks not quite sure how Son Of Earth fits into all of this, Mother Earth and the people of the tribes seemed to argue about him, so maybe he represents the freedom of humans or something in that sense. <br /> <br /> Me I do not know what the last parts of this movie are supposed to mean, the clapping, ravaging, and dismembering of earth and earth's son and mortars like mortar and pestle rolling into the ground could mean anything, but here's the fun of this movie; can interpret it at will, it does not have to have definitive meaning, you can let your mind wander, sometimes you do not even know what to look for, because it is in an unusual way l is picked up or out of focus. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed me was that I really had an expected frightening movie. I figured I'd get a call with an unsuspecting seven-day warning right after that. What I got was pleasantly different. It was not scary at all, but it excited me. Trying to decode the film's cryptic message was a creative challenge. There were many scenes that were really beautiful. Mother Earth shortly after her birth and the last stop of the forest path occurred to me. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie very much. It's certainly the most abstract movie I've ever seen, but that's not a bad thing.
