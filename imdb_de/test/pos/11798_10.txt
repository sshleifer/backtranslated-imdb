I had never heard of this movie when it was given to me for translation, so I did not know what to expect. I checked it for IMDb and became curious. It did not take long to realize that this was a gem. Outstanding achievements, great history and both well-directed and well-written. It's hard to compare it to other movies, but "Stand by me" comes to my mind, although it has so many differences from "The cure" like similarities. The story of an extraordinary friendship between boys and the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this film and "Stand by me". Besides, "The Cure" is a great movie that deserves further recognition. It is dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous. I can not think of anything that bothers me. Nevertheless, I do not want to give the impression that it is a "perfect movie", whatever that means, but that I enjoyed it very much, was moved by it and would not change it. I will not go into a detailed description of the story / plot, partly because it is too general or too instructive, and partly because you can find that information elsewhere on the site. In the end I can only say: Wonderful movie, see it if you have the chance.
