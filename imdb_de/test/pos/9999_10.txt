Although I'm not a golf fan, I saw a preview of this movie and was absolutely thrilled. The historical framework, blatant class distinctions, and seeing good and evil on both sides of the dividing line kept me going. The actors and their characteristics were all fascinating. And I was at the edge of my seat during the golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting, but also easy to follow. At the end of this movie, "Seabiscuit" came to mind, though "The Greatest Game Ever Played" is a far less complex story than this movie. In both cases, the fact that the events actually took place reinforced my interest.
