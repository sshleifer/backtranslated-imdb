This movie is really a classic 80s movie! A must in every '80s' movie collection! Weapons, Bad Guys, CREEPS, gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is the best Death Wish movie I think. Tons of action without interruption! <br /> <br /> And if you stick to the classic 80's "Bad Guy vs. Good Guy" movie, this movie is about anything but the norm and about guns and CREEPS! We see how Bronson mills thugs and CREEPS with a 30-caliber heavy machine gun from the Korean War! A heavy submachine gun to scream Laud! When Charlie no longer has ammunition for the heavy machine, he runs to his cradle and takes his arms in his arms with his long-range, high-caliber pistol! This gun can stop a damned ELEPHANT, and Charlie pokes holes the size of hubcaps into baddies! And if that's not enough, Charlie also packs an anti-tank grenade launcher, which by the way is only good if he can ball up the CREEPS ha "great and many off-the-wall actors (mostly CREEPS) perform throughout the movie! My favorite scene is where CREEP leader Broson faces jail and calmly explains, "Tell me what I'll do ... I'll kill a little old lady ... only to you! ... start it in the 6 o'clock news ". <br /> <br /> Is this movie violent? Oh yeah, but you'll laugh and comb all the way !!!!
