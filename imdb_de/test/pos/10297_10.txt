This is a fabulous movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a good yarn and is imaginatively narrated in a series of flashbacks and alternative perspectives. What was intentional and what was coincidence? Who is in love with whom? <br /> <br /> You have the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of the individual characters (sometimes literally) and this helps to define the individual figures to a satisfying depth /> <br /> With little effort after the twists and turns you can understand each of the characters; and important events in the film are re-recorded from the point of view of different people. <br /> <br /> Take the opportunity when it comes back to your art house cinema; It looks good on the big screen. <br /> <br /> More than guessing, the plot revolves so much that you just sit and watch what unfolds - I can not predict anyone! <br /> <br However, you will probably need more than one visit - I have seen this three times in the images of the original publication, and it has gotten better each time. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good, with an outstanding showing by Romane Bohringer as Alice, torn apart by the three other characters of the ensemble in three directions. <br /> <br /> A classic. The second best movie of the 1990s.
