The adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll story is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virgin librarian who rushes down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her self-image. The films were made at a time when adult films were creative acts with actions rather than just a series of sex scenes. This is a nice little movie that looks more like the low budget movies of its time. In spite of what you think, this movie actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. It's a naughty little story for adults. If you're wondering if my recommendation is good or not, keep in mind that for the better part of the last three decades, the movie was only available in its non-hardcore version, just because the movie gets by without sex. So I saw that Film years ago on cable TV. The relatively new home video release on DVD brought the sex back (in horribly grainy inserted clips), which makes it clear that removing the recordings was the best choice. If you are an open-minded adult who likes something sharp, I can recommend this little movie as a nice change.
