This is a funny and delightful adaptation of the book by dr. Seuss, brilliantly animated by UPA at its finest and fully deserving of the Oscar. Special mention should be made of the excellent music score and sound effects that make this cartoon a memorable and entertaining cartoon. Later episodes of the series (of which there were four in total) were not actually based on original material by Dr. Ing. Seuss, although all but the last used his well-known rhyme style. The three episodes were: Gerald McBoing Boing's Symphony (1953); As now Boing Boing (1954); Gerald McBoing Boing on Planet Moo (1956) - though he also appeared in a later episode of Mr. Magoo.
