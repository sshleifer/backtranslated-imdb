Let me first say that I was very surprised with the production value of this film. I've managed to see an early show, and I have to say that this is the best (if not only) Christian movie that has been released since The Passion. <br /> <br /> Do not let the PG-13 rating put you off The rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are covered in this movie (divorce, teenage pregnancy, drug use and suicide), but nothing in the film is unfounded. This is definitely a movie a junior high youth group could see without disturbing (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. Best of all, this is not a movie for Christians, it's a family movie without the cheesy feeling of the Seventh Heaven. <br /> <br /> The laughs are there and several times in the theater laughed all the humor was natural and seemed neither in scripts nor forced to, and that ensured a good pace in such a serious movie. Teenagers and young adults, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many, if not all, characters of the film, and I was surprised to have dealt with such issues in this type of film. The plot is in no way predictable, and in the end the hits are closer to home than many will admit. Fortunately, Christians are not shown because all the powerful know that it is "The Word". Instead, people simply try to understand life. People make mistakes and nobody is perfect, not even in this movie ... not in the long run. <br /> <br /> The acting is first class, the writing place is on and you will not be ripped off head with all the preaching of Christian rhetoric. This is a great movie that will make you and your teens think, talk and maybe question their own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to see a high quality family movie in January, check out the local entries for this movie and you might learn something about yourself. <br /> <br /> And I'm a 25 year old man who just wanted to watch a free movie.
