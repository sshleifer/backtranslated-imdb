As far as faked documentaries are concerned (fakumentaries anyone?), This one is up there with the best! It looks very real and that's what it's all about. In light of recent events (Guantanamo), this film is even scarier. So you could say he was ahead of his time when he was released in the 70s! <br /> <br /> One can only hope that such a government does not exist! Are you looking for terrorists and questioning people like that? Of course, the interviewed people all seemed to have the same opinion (mentality of the 70s): the politicians and the politicians in general screw. Maybe that was not so smart, you might think ... but do not forget: It's just a movie! ;O)
