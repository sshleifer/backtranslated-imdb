"The Thing" is the best movie by John Carpenter. Merging his talents for tension build-up and dampers with decent production values, he created a perfectly crafted sci-fi / horror movie. By filming in really difficult conditions, he creates a very credible, isolated research base that sets the tension before anything else has happened. The ensemble cast works well with Kurt Russell and is a charismatic lead actor even under the beard. <br /> <br /> As the tension builds slowly with bloody horror scenes (courtesy of master Rob Bottin, currently Freddy vs Jason) Carpenter creates a movie that's rarely matched. Considering that this came out in the same year as ET, it could not be more different! <br /> <br /> Worth a watch / repeat. 9 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> p.s. the DVD is excellent. Lots of extras and the best DVD comments (with Carpenter & Russell). Also remixed in Dolby Digital for even creepier sound effects.
