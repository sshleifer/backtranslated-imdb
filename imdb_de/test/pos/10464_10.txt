This film embodies the soul of the modern "elite" culture, even though the film is 17 years old. The basic principle of the film is: food is more than just nutrients. It is also a strong symbol and a medium for culture. The main characters literally get drunk on fine wine and fine food, inspired by idealistic thought and culture, letting go of their puritanism and their passion-defying table manners. The short story by Karen Blixens takes advantage of the difference between Northern Europe and Southern Europe to highlight their fundamentally different diets. As the austere and rather boring Scandinavians are penetrated by "Eros" from the South, the party starts. So, what are you waiting for? Look at it ..... again!
