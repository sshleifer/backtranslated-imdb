What can I say about the series, the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Except that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled !! They have actors of all ages, the somewhat known and then forgotten actors. Everyone plays their part in perfect perfection! These shows always have a kind of moral story that is mostly (if not always) true! One senses that the man whose voice is synchronized over the credits and beginning and end, believes what he wholeheartedly says! Not only do these shows have great storylines, they also throw you in, get your thoughts going, and get your blood pumping. The original outer borders were a black and white in the 60s. These shows made a triumphant comeback like I've never seen! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun, but the new OUTER LIMITS are here! If you have not seen: I ask you to check these episodes, and you will see exactly what I mean! Long live the new outer limits !!!!!!!!!!!!
