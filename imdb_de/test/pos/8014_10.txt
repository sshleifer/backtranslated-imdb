Therefore, it is important not only to talk about the movie, but about the DVD release. Tales from the Crapper is a movie that only a studio in the world can deliver. The one who has brought us innovative and original REAL Independent films for more than 30 years: Troma. This is really a very special movie, because it is certainly not my favorite of the Troma productions, but is released on a CD that, due to my remarks, is one of my most cherished and popular DVDs. I count not only the countless Troma discs, but also my entire film collection. The film itself is the result of an unfortunate plan to produce a television series directed by a director who has been entrusted with a considerable amount of money (especially for Troma) to create something wonderful, and delivered a lot of unfinished and incomprehensible material Stop (or get fired, I'm not sure what's in this moment). To avoid having to make a huge investment in the bathroom, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz decided to bring together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the backbone of a movie. A movie that really consists of two, in the beautiful old Tales From The Crypt anthology fashion, hosted by the Crapkeeper, played by Mr. Kaufman himself. But, as I said, not quite my favorite of all her films. This is largely due to a strange sense of discipline in the various sets, forgetting the strict Troma rule "No Alcohol on Set", which was discovered by an angry Lloyd and other less respectable collaborators, the Troma at the time of filming had the added scenes. All this made it almost impossible for Mr. Kaufman to make a worthwhile product in the cutting room. But Lloyd Kaufman is a genius, and with the disturbed added scenes to an already misshapen launch product, he has no less a masterpiece. The film itself is as good as the circumstances would allow the most brilliant filmmaker to cut it together, and it is certainly highly entertaining, totally confusing and full of elements that have made Troma great and certainly unique and unique. As a film, however, not as brilliant as many other Troma productions. However, the genius of Independent Cinema made the DVD of this movie far more than the release of a movie with some extras. The film is, if it really matters, only a part of the entire DVD, which in its entirety is a document of the difficult situation, serious filmmakers who have to live in a world that is dominated by the few very big ones. Actually, do not allow anyone else Players on their market. A document about the problems one has when trusting people that they are at the level just to find out that freedom is sometimes something that is hard to fulfill and the realization that access to a film budget, though the boss is not around, even these can falsify who should really know better. The brilliance of this DVD is that the movie is not perfect, and that Lloyd knows it and nobody wants him to believe it is him. The detailed commentary is a show in itself (as is often the case with Kaufan's audio commentaries), which mixes humor, sneers at those who deserve it, and highly interesting information for anyone interested in independent film, in such a way. It's interesting to watch the movie again with this comment after looking at it for its own reasons. It's hard to stop. The feature-length documentary THE THICK BROWN LINE takes us behind the scenes of the various places where Lloyd visits sets, just to take the helm sometimes and get the most out of it. We see that he is sometimes a little bit disillusioned, unlike other making-of documents like Fart of Darkness and Apocalypse Soon, both of which are included in the very own MAKE YOUR DAMN MOVIE box. <br /> <br /> Added scenes with James Gunn (who began his career at Troma to succeed as a writer and director in Hollywood) and Trey Parker (another who begins with a work published by Troma, later National hero with his South Park series) are entertaining and probably (as in this release also much different) a reason to get this CD for anyone who is interested in the work of these two characters. Loaded with a lot more than I could mention here (including a SECOND audio commentary), this is one of the best Troma DVD releases.
