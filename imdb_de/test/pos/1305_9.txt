I saw this movie on vacation at a branch of Duane Reed Pharmacy in New York, and it seemed a bit silly to me. And surely the whole premise is indescribably ridiculous - but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action movie for kids and their parents. <br /> <br /> 10-year-old Ricky Bernard (Jordan Garrett) He has his head in the clouds most of the time, much to the dismay of his father (Larry Miller). As a member of his school orchestra, Ricky and classmates fly to a concert performance ... and Ricky's thoughts "take off," suggesting a criminal conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly supported by best friend Sashi, who is a fan of spicy sauce (which was a strange craft of action) and others who are trying to solve the puzzle. Oh yes, and Ricky's 1,000-hour flight simulator experience turns out to be handy when he's asked to save the day in the movie's exciting climax! It was nice to see Eric Roberts and Mark Dacoscos playing a family movie. And watching the DVD interviews all seemed to be fun. <br /> <br /> I totally liked Junior Pilot. charming and good-natured performances, funny action and a real one; Sense of pleasure and sheer stupidity. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a fun family movie, you can do a lot worse than buying it.
