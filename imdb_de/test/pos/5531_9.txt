It is not always certain that you will generate laughter by mixing comedians. The comics involved must really like or admire or be willing to bear each other. GO WEST with the Marx Brothers had Buster Keaton write the script as Gagman. Groucho did not value Keaton's ideas too much and was ashamed of him at a script meeting. And although some of Keaton's gems still appear in the finished film (eg, the gun that turns into a brush that turns into a gun), the film was one of the weakest, the Marx brothers have ever done. <br /> <br /> A better movie, but also affected by weird egos, was WC Fields and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE, who dropped the script for a series of duels of a liner liner liner. But the one-liners were equally funny, so the movie remains a success. <br /> <br /> But SIX OF A KIND is an example of six movie comics that worked well together. The reason is simple: There are actually three comic teams working together: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, George Burns and Gracie Allan and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland were seen in about half a dozen comedies in the 1930s, usually with Boland as a somewhat bossy woman and Ruggles as a nervous wreck of a husband. Fields (usually a single act) were paired with Skipworth three times (TILLY AND GUS and IF I A MILLION had the other two times). Skippy always considered how to control or combat her husband's activities - in the present film, she grabs the stolen money she seeks, even into her hand (she knows the local Sheriff Fields is not the one) , For Burns and Allan, they manage to easily deal with the attacks on Ruggles and Boland on their overland journey by car. Ruggles quickly realizes the mistake she was prepared to make to travel Gracie - at some point she manages to drop him off a cliff and dangle on a branch. He is relatively helpless if she insists 1) photograph him on his pole and 2) correct his grammar. The presence of George and Gracie's giant dog ("Ran Tang Tang") does not make Charlie and Mary travel planning easier. <br /> <br /> Fields has some crucial moments. If he insists on yelling at the quartet, he says he can - he's the sheriff! He also explains the improbable story of how he got his unearned nickname "Honest John" during a pool game. You have to listen carefully to the story as it is interrupted a few times with its attempts to play billiards (if they were accidentally drilled by a pool ball), but it shows that there were elements that even Fields would have had no reason to steal , <br /> <br /> Oh, in the "Summary Line" I mentioned a forgotten actor named Bradley Page - he was the man responsible for the trouble Charley Ruggles suspects. Bradley must have a reason to leave the city to catch the careless Ruggles and Boland, so he calls his girlfriend. He asks her to call back his job and say that he has to leave town because someone has died. There is a pause when he apparently hears a question from the girlfriend. "EVERY BODY!" He says - clearly annoyed. Although the bulk of the humor in the film is carried by the sextet of performers, Mr.Page had the most amusing unexpected line in the movie.
