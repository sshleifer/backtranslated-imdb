I loved "Flash Gordon" as a child and watching the show again on DVD brings back such memories. Each 15-minute episode features the adventures of our hero Flash, the lovely Dale Arden and the intrepid Dr. Zarkov on the planet Mongo, with Flash escaping death on every turn: The Shark Men almost drown him, he's standing in front of the Fire Monster in the Tunnel of Terror, and he's in mortal danger in the Static Room! <br /> <br /> The characters are still having fun: Buster Crabbe is anything but the blonde dreamer and Jean Rogers is a petite and beautiful Dale Arden. Princess Aura is still planning to steal Flash for herself, King Vulture of the Hawk People still has his laugh and his angel wings, and Ming, the merciless, emperor of the universe, still gives everyone the evil eye and crawl. <br /> <br /> This series may not interest kids today with their hokey effects - oh, this spaceship! - but it's a funny nostalgia for those who liked it the first time. The actors are playing it straight and do not play down on children. I appreciate that young viewers were expected to read the chapter summaries in fairly big words. <br /> <br /> I am glad that this was released on DVD. It's great fun to revisit this classic sci-fi series.
