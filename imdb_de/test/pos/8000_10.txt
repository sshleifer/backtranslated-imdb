Batman is said to start in the first Batman movie "to get it right," but I think that's a terrible exaggeration, because I think the new Batman movie, even though Batman Forever and Batman and Robin are bigger as Tim Burton's classic. with this one is the best of the five. The darkness is beautiful, as is the music and scenery that makes Gotham City a mysterious cityscape, as opposed to Batman Begins, where Gotham City is a normal-looking city. The bad guys are great in this movie. You literally can not take your eyes off the penguin and cat woman. I welcome Tim Burton for using the penguin originally as a freak and not as an ordinary criminal or as a clone of the old Batman television series. In Batman Begins, we have the scarecrow whose screen is not nearly as demanding as the penguin or the catwoman. Not only does the movie have to focus on Batman, as we already know its history, and it's the bad guys we research and try to find out, and it's them who make the plot, with the penguin fighting for mayor and revenge to seek the desertion of his parents by killing the firstborn sons of Gotham, a task he does not fulfill. Danny Devito delivers the best performance a superhero has ever shown in any movie, surpassing even Nicholson's Joker. The final scene, in which the penguins drag the body of the penguin into the water, is touching and powerful. It is a tragedy that Tim Burton was not allowed to complete his trilogy because Warner Bros., interesting in the marketing appeal, wanted to "lighten up" the Batman films. And they got their wish ... unfortunately. Tim Burton planned to shoot the third film with the Riddler as the villain, without Two-Face and Robin to mess it up, and I'm sure Michael Keaton would have signed. So that's the last big Batman movie. Batman Begins is dark but boring, boring, ordinary, full of lackluster rogues and a playboy Bruce Wayne. A decent Batman movie, but the best Batman movie ever? Never. Batman Returns holds this crown.
