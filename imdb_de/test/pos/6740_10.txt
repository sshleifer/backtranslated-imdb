Like many of us have read a book or seen a play, and when the movie came out, we were terribly disappointed. Well, maybe this would be one of those movies for those who saw the play as well, but as someone who never had the opportunity to see it on stage I was extremely excited about this movie. The characters were funny, the music was great and the story was interesting and you have a real compassion for the characters, mistakes and everything. Jonathan Silverman has such good comedic timing, and especially his lines are funny. I will not give spoilers, it's just a well-made, funny movie that shows the inner workings of a middle-class family during the Second World War. So, if you've never seen the piece before and enjoyed other Neil Simon films, do not let the few negative reviews you see here hold you back. Brighton Beach Memoirs is a great movie. I guarantee it (no money back).
