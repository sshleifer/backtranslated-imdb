This film was a new direction for Natalie Portman. A much more adult role, though she herself comes from the footsteps of a child in the film itself. Ann ((Portman)) and Susan Sarandon, who plays their newly divorced mother Adele, travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to Beverly Hills. There, these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and relationship as Portman's character grows up. Ignoring Adele first, she grows up and becomes a better mother. Ann sees her mother telling her that she wants to be an actress, or at least she thinks. Adele uses this crutch every time there are problems in her life. We see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms with each other and being alone and leaving their old life behind. <br /> <br /> The acting is first class of both. You seemingly mother and daughter before your eyes. You can almost feel that there is a bond that goes beyond the actual movie. <br /> <br /> Although this movie really does not lead us to new ways in these movie types, the fact that the acting is well done and the story is not too flawed, let me recommend it. <br /> <br /> But I will say that she will probably disappear soon. I do not think she can have the stamina necessary for a huge Christmas season of movies starts in a week or so. See it now, before that happens, if you like one of those actresses.
