When I reviewed the video for a local magazine, I called it "the greatest achievement in the history of American cinema." That was not completely turned upside down. TW & TL is still the best work of Milius, and it is sad that he has so little opportunity to work. However, TW & TL is still an impressive portrayal of what was once known as The American Character, mainly because of Brian Keith's excellent portrayal with Teddy R. (Obviously, Milius - and Keith - admired that TR made two films about him) It's hard to fault this film at every level: a great balance of action, ease, relationships, and the serious theme of America growing up in the world. In addition, TW & TL is exceptionally attractive on the whole: Observe the statistics that show that they are best rated among women under the age of 18, 18 to 29 and over 45. Candy Bergen has apparently addressed both women and men.
