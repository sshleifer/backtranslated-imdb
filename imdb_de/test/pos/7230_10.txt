TROMEO & JULIET - 10th ANNIVERSARY <br /> <br /> William Shakespeare's play Romeo & Juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in movies. Sometimes literally following the original text (sometimes unclear in directional directions), sometimes in new interpretations where the directors have decided to show their own view of the piece. Some are good, many are mediocre. The film by Lloyd Kaufman is certainly one of the most original, cutting-edge versions of the Bard's creation. It's in a modern, decaying New York, full of modern antisocial behavior, body piercing, dismemberment, and confusion of sex (which Shakespeare did not discourage for the more than random reader himself), but at the same time it sticks to the overall feel and content of the piece incredibly close to what a bother is. Kaufman wrote the script with his co-director for the film James Gunn, who is now known for writing two successful Scooby Doo films, making the impossible possible by making a perfect remake of his Dawn of the Dead screenplay already made perfect film and directed one of the best horror movies of the year: Slither. Lloyd Kaufman's innovative directional perspective along with James Gunn's original and unqualified writing suggests Shakespeare's play that not everyone may "get" right away, but is certainly recognized by a truly unique and extremely important view of a classic play. With a script written entirely in Iambik, performances by Motorheads Lemmy and a massive, powerful soundtrack that Tromeo & Julia watches, no one will forget anything. In addition to its historical significance Tromeo & Julia is a treasure for film lovers of all kinds. Not only for the script of James Gunn, which Hollywood has now well influenced from the inside, but also because it contains an early part of the legendary actress Debbie Rochon. Anyone familiar with movies produced at lower budgets is well known. The 10th Anniversary Edition on DVD is helping to add so many undiscovered gems that not only present all the information one would want about the film itself and the experience of making it Turning off the DVD will make impossible, but also a very honest (and disturbing) look is given to the way in which independent cinema has to survive these days. In many ways, the extras on the CD are an invaluable complement to the already impressive crowd that Kaufman's film school "Make Your Own Damn Movie" has given. Other historic elements from the Troma vaults, including James Gunn, Debbie Rochon, and all others who contributed to this masterpiece, are included. Aside from looking better than ever, no fewer than four audio commentaries are accompanied by informative, painfully funny, and everything done to complement the film rather than the boring and nonsensical comments that are commonplace today. There are new comments (one related to Kaufman and Gunn), but also the one James Gunn made for the original release of the DVD, which was not included because it shows some honesty he has about other people on this CD presents. With fan replicas of some of the film's scenes, a video diary of Lloyd Kaufman's visit to the set of James Gunn's Slither and a visit to the two gathered at Eli Roth's hostel birthday party, this is the ultimate set. You're a film historian, someone interested in listening to Bard's great work, a fan of big movies, a fighter for independent cinema, a fan of James Gunn, who wants to learn more about shooting on a low budget, a fan by Lloyd Kaufman or whatever: This is the most important DVD release of this millennium!
