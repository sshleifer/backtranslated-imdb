Farscape - is the one Sci-Fi show that started to renew my interest in science fiction. <br /> <br /> But Farscape is so much more than plain and simple sci-fi. Comedy, drama and much more :) The acting is very good. Fortunately, Farscape also survived his denial and showed with Peacekeeper Wars that it is not dead yet :) I hope there is a future for Farscape :) In my opinion, it is not a problem that some of the characters in the show are Muppets , You have to look behind it and you will see what a beauty Farscape is. <br /> <br /> Farscape has set a new standard on television and I think it will be really hard for new shows to prove that they can be the same or better than Farscape. I love this show :) <br /> <br /> SapphireJD
