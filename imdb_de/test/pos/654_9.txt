Very memorable comedy. It's fun to see the many situations evolve and eventually come together after a long journey on the largest collection of eclectic people (and the world's largest honky-ton) - the Great American Freeway. Like "... mad, mad world" there are lots of talents, old-time politicians, good comedy and dialogue. Contrary to this goal, it's the target, not the ignorant seekers - they have no idea what they really want when they drive on America's great road. It also does not have the weight to have a big thug, who is saved in the end only by a big belly laugh. However, the end-stunt sequence is spectacular with spectacular film editing, humor and timing, and the big-city banking scene is hilarious with a very original spectacle of a particularly talented character. The total excitement of the city residents in the face of chaos leaves a feeling like the proverbial fly on the ceiling. The slapstick is funny, but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and seen because it's surprisingly loaded with nuances and character reactions that are easily overlooked. All in all a very funny reflection about who we were and are, good or bad, and the silly situations in which we are. It should only be funny and it is!
