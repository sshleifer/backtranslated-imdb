This movie is the funniest Danish movie I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> The plot is funny, surprising and extraordinary. Danish humor is different than any other and brings you every time. The entire audience laughed 90% of the time ... it was amazing. The characters are so well played, and the two actors Mads mikkelsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas are doing their best! <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend seeing this movie. You will not regret it, )
