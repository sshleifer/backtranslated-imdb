Well, on the day that Rob Schneider plunges further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies, he plays in the absolutely unwanted "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" (hmmmm ... was not a movie called Roadtrip, followed by a sequel And now there's Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, followed by Sequel Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo ....... I smell a pattern, maybe there'll be Spiderman soon: European railways are hotter .... or not ) I write about this (at the time of publication) very vicious movie. I was one of those bad guys, I have to admit. I turned my nose up, though Chris pushed Farley's cocaine into his nostrils and the SNL cast was battling through one of the worst seasons in 94-95 history, despite the McDonald mooring standard. Movies like Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came out in the couple of years after that period and we realized that the caliber of the Spade Farley Schneider Sandler movies had a dark future. However, I saw this movie the other day, ten years after and 8 years after Chris died and could not stop laughing. Yes, it is not very demanding. Farley does what Farley does (not unlike Manny Manny), but his motivational speaker, Van Down By The River, complains that he does not "wash enough" or "wear well fitting clothes," or "Using Deodorant More Than Twice a Week" translates well here as the ever-self-injurious character recognizes that he is not the smartest, not the best-looking and could lose a few pounds, yet he tries his best And David Spade throws off his dogged one-liners just as he did for "Spades Hollywood Minute," and expresses Farley's self-esteem - there's really not much else to say, I love the one scene When Farley catches Spade beating his monkey and then joking about it, I can not remember what the first one is, but the second, they're lying in their hotel beds and Farley says to Spade, "Do you like Ba? "Spade murmurs something inaudible and Farley says," The New York Yank-ees? "Anyway, Farley makes his awkward, painfully sensitive frat-boy guy. If you like, you like it. I could not stop laughing.
