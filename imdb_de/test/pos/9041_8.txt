No movie could ever do justice to Faulkner's English. But they did a pretty good job here. Lucas Beauchamp is exactly as I introduced him to the book, just like Chick. What the movie really could not do was that Beauchamp was not liked by the Negroes because he was just as stubborn. Not that it's a bad thing, but from my perspective on the book that was his attitude towards the world (yet I felt that white society racism was the beginning and had an impact on the Negro society until that his attitude became everyone. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is that you see Yoknapatawpha County (actually Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as Faulkner wrote about it (the movie was made when Faulkner was still alive) It does not look much different today, so the film is worth a watch considering it's filmed in the backyard of Faulkner - an absolute must for Faulkner fans.
