When Monte Hellman's legendary roadmovie "Two-Lane Blacktop" of the early '70s was more like a austere, slimmed-down, taut, and uncomplicated, brooding mood influenced by this decidedly unyielding, rough, ornate piece, very harsh and ragged Australian macho and topped with a generous sprinkling, desperate, utterly hopeless punk nihilism that would end up without the end of the road, it would undoubtedly be very similar to that disgusting dark and atmospheric knockout. <br /> <br /> Nice factory worker Mike (an appealingly worn-out Terry Serio) falls in love with mocking, fadish racing champion Fox (an absolutely hateful Richard Moir) when he steals Fox's unruly model girlfriend Julie Deborah Conway away from him. Mike and Fox are racing in more and more deadly races, with the stakes rising and rising with each fight, which finally results in a particularly vibrant all-or-nothing race, with only a true winner allowed. Mike, supported by his troubled, but loyal Italian mechanic buddy Tony (a gloriously gentle twist of Vangelis Mourikis), who is cared for by blind, hippy 50s greater (wonderfully maxed out by Max Cullen), likes to give his life up the line because of his reputation, the affection of his old lady, the money and, above all, the chance of overthrowing the haughty Fox from his morose, somber litter. Staged with the utmost gravity and intensity by John Clark, written by Barry Tomblim in laconically rectangular perfection, with a trembling, meat-crawling synthesizer score by Peter Crosbie and apparent, unadorned cinematography by David Gribble, this authentic gnarly presents the concept in the early '80s The race car is not just a funky alternative lifestyle, but also an all-out obsession and a reason to live (it's the only thing most characters in the movie are really passionate about) with a remarkably sharp and ceaseless eye. With a shattering downbeat ending and a relentlessly gloomy central message about the bitter price paid for a top dog, this fascinating depiction of a dead end is considered an extraordinary movie performance.
