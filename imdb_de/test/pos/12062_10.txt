This was one of the few shows that my wife and I agreed to watch. I was upset when I heard that it had been canceled, especially because I did not know the ratings were so bad. As far as I knew, many spectators were doing very well. Almost all of my friends and most of the people I talked to saw the show. Now we're stuck to watch either crappy shows or DVDs. How bad was the show? Does anyone know the actual results of the shows? I know that on Thursdays it was harder for me to catch. Many thanks to G * d for DVR's! <br /> <br /> Still, it was a real surprise to know that there is no "The War At Home" anymore. If other networks see this, PLEASE STOP THE SHOW !!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!
