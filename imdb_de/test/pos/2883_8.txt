I enjoyed this movie and after it's done, you're still thinking about it. I think Jeremy Brett is brilliant in this role, even though his "death" action was a bit over the top, but as Jeremy Brett I did not mind. <br /> <br /> This is a good deal of drama and does this follow the novel by Oscar Wilde very carefully. If you like this movie, I recommend you watch "An Ideal Husband" with Jeremy Brett as Lord Goring. <br /> <br /> This film gives a great insight into the mindset of Oscar Wilde. And it reminds the audience how Dorian Gray is Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas and Basil Halward is Oscar Wilde.
