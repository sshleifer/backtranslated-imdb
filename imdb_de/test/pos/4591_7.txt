Many things are wrong with this film. I will not lie. I'll say that most problems feel like they're due to a budget cut out under the movie and some nasty hack jobs. <br /> <br /> This is not an office space. Do not expect the office space levels of comedy. It is very funny. It's a mess, but very funny at the same time. A funny confusion of a movie. In the way that Caddyshack is funny. A jumble of disjointed funny scenes, filled with very annoying, inglorious scenes. <br /> <br /> However, it works as a whole, and it certainly deserves a big release. This is the best commentary on the Wal Mart / Starbucks / MTV nation you could hope for. The fact that a movie explores the idea that stupid people brood at an alarming rate, while the intelligent people do not, is great in my book. Not very politically correct, but at least worth a debate.
