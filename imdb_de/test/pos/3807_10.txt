I loved this movie, I saw it when I was about eight and almost seven years later, tonight I saw it again. I really thought it had an interesting idea, it only disturbed me at the end that I thought was a police officer. "It's hard to find this movie all around, and I was fortunate to have seen it on BRAVO. I also expected to see more Drew Barrymore here!
