This film should be seen by as many people as possible, as it focuses on human rights issues in Burma. When I saw this movie for the first time in the mid-1990s, it completely changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her democracy movement. That affected me, so I wanted to know more about the situation. Any movie that wants to learn more has done its job right. Patricia Arquette is outstanding as an American lady who, due to her personal tragedy, has become reckless with her own life choices and become involved in the ensuing conflict. It's a strong movie about a topic that deserves more publicity. As the film itself says, the massacre of pro-democracy activists in 1988 was not televised and therefore went largely unnoticed by the world. I ask all who read these comments to take the time to learn more about the current situation of the Burmese. <br /> <br /> It's about time that the movie is released on DVD. Can anything be done?
