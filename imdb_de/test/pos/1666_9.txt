I've heard that they would remake this French classic in 2007, and I see that it is in development in 2011. This will be a shame, since Hollywood writer / director Jules Dassin has quit because of the infamous blacklist. You should not have the right to re-make one of his films. <br /> <br /> I love "Caper" movies and "Film Noir", and this combines the best of both. <br /> <br /> Tony (Jean Servais) gets out after completing his career, and after beating up his old girlfriend (Marie Sabouret), he plans with his friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Jo (Carl MÃ¶hner) a great score Flick is the attention to detail in planning the robbery. You see that in the caprices of George Clooney Vegas. Nothing is left to chance. <br /> <br /> The capers sound great, but Grutter (Marcel Lupovici) sends his sons Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset to Tony and the gang. After they blow it with Mario, they abduct Jos son. Many bullets fly before it's over. <br /> <br /> A great movie by a great director. The standard by which other capillary films are measured.
