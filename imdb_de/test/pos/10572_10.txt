I saw this movie recently and fell in love with it. I loved the story and the actors. It has something of everything. I was totally excited about the story's development. It has so many surprises on the way. I highly recommend it. I loved it so much that I ran out of book. I felt I had to read it to appreciate the art behind the film. I also wanted to make sure that I did not miss anything that was in the book but was kept out of the movie. I recommend to people who love the movie to read the book because the book, especially in the second episode, has enough differences to read it. It has become my favorite movie. I am now a fan of Sarah Waters and Elaine Cassidy!
