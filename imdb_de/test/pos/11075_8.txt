I'm from eastern PA, right on the border with northern New Jersey. I still have the feeling that this was more of a documentary than a movie. I have friends from New York and New Jersey, and this movie represents the kind of lifestyle that "still" exists in lower income areas outside of the "big city" lifestyle. If you have not seen this movie yet and have ever wondered what REALLY happens in the urban jungle, watch this movie. Not really big names, it's like they just pulled the guys off the street and said, which underlines the realism of the movie, but the gigs are still AWESOME! SEE THIS FILM!
