America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every way. It has a great host, great guests, a great production, and some of the best professionals in the modeling world doing something they have not achieved yet: Showcase a true American supermodel. Of course, this is not easy to do, so the US and the world already have ten top models fighting and fighting each other in this cruel world. <br /> <br /> But it's obvious that it's not going to showcase America's next top model, but the Next Pop model of the US. The show brings together a number of models that have no experience with different personalities and major personal, professional and financial problems. So you have the chance to realize a dream or make your life valuable. It's obvious that Tyra Banks uses all this to her advantage, she gives the dream, but in return she gains audience and more popularity. Anyway, she deserves it because she's intelligent and, if I could say so, a pioneer of this kind of show. Tyra is also a great observer and knows how to make informed opinions that are different from other models and hostesses of foreign versions of the NEXT TOP MODEL franchise. In Brazil, for example, Fernanda Motta is the host and once-a-time top model. She does not even have 1/10 of Tyras professional skills, which keeps Tyra Banks at the top. Tyra has a professional and personal knowledge of what she says, and she is a great mentor because she not only criticizes but also points out the mistake and teaches the right way with wisdom. <br /> <br /> The show has no big problems, it does and fulfills what it promises in the cycles. The models chosen for the show are in fact not the best unknown models in the country because Tyra Banks sets the difference, and she's right because she (and a good portion of her audience too) thinks it's time for that Modeling is world to change some straight parameters. During the cycles, she and her team are really giving fair consideration to where the weakest are disappearing, and the promising ones have new opportunities to prove their abilities, but have to be quick otherwise they will lose it. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting thing is that Tyra can also decide who should win or not, even if it is against people's opinion. She knows that the one who wins will become famous, but has few opportunities to become a world-renowned top model. In the same way, she knows that the second place is sometimes more valuable than the first, because the first place wins the title, the second, however, does not get the title stigma. She makes no mistake when deciding on the future of a model during the show. After 9 cycles, the show gets a little tired with old ideas. It's time for Tyra to change some things and lines It gets boring and compared to the first few cycles, we see that she too gets bored, so she has to do that if she wants the show to last longer. In any case, the show explores fashion and modeling the world, but it's also entertaining for those who live outside of it all. There is an opportunity for some girls and also the market and also gives good tips for those from the audience sharing the same dream.
