I loved this movie since I saw it for the first time many years ago. I'm not sure how many times I've seen it, maybe 10, maybe 20. The last time I saw it, I noticed a detail that I had not noticed before the end of the picture, the slain heroes are slipping into brought the city back. There are a few close-ups of the dead. The one that impressed me the most was a shot of the blonde teenager. All you see on the screen is his profile from head to hand. His hands hold a flickering candle. The wind blows and his thick blond hair dances in the wind, in tune with the flickering of the candle flame. The contrast between death and the life he lost is incredibly powerful. The moving hair and the candle flame remind us of the life force that once inhabited his body. Every time I visit this movie, I see something new.
