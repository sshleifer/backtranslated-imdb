Contains Spoiler <br /> <br /> This is a movie by Peter Watkins. If you've seen his BBC masterpieces "Cullodden" and "The War Game," you'll recognize the style (and your voice) within seconds of starting. It was built in 1971 and is in a very near future, as the Vietnam War has escalated even more and now seems to include China. Nixon is still president and civil disobedience, and protest is violently dealt with eardrum tribunals (outwardly civil with judges of the "everyday citizen"). Because "prison buildings can not compete," an alternative is introduced: The Punishment Park. Delinquents can choose between severe jail sentences and hunting in a hostile environment, in this case an 85-kilometer journey through the California desert at 100 degrees F. When they reach the end of an American flag without being caught by the National Guard or Riot Police they are released or must serve their sentence (or be dead, as we shall see). The film is being filmed in a completely documentary style, with three European teams covering a tribunal and the trial of two groups already condemned. Scenes jump between the tribune tents, the hunting teams and the convicts. Watkins's rare comment gives us raw background information (time, temperature, etc.). The tribunal scenes show on one side a kangaroo space and on the other hand a multitude of personalities, ranging from real terrorists to "unwanted persons" to innocents (eg a total pacifist who can not hurt a fly). The defender (who takes his job seriously) must be abused by both sides. What makes these scenes particularly uncanny is their similarity to the rhetoric of today's administration down to the last detail. Meanwhile, some unfortunate events in the desert make it clear that the "rules of the game" do not really apply. The question remains whether the troops will be manipulated or arbitrary from the beginning because of the events that lead to the result (I suspect they are both). At the end we are again in first place and the next group goes to the "Punishment Park". This description may indicate a strongly biased (or even demagogic) propaganda film, but that would be misleading. The behavior (all participants were not professional as usual at Watkins) looks and sounds real (the tribunal's scenes may even contain textual material from real contemporary trials). I would say that this could easily be sold as "real". At Watkins "The Forgotten Faces", the response was, "We can not send that, or nobody will believe our real newsreels anymore (because that's not a reality)." It should be the same with Punishment Park. In the US, effectively banned, as far as I know, this is a must that has not lost its strength or relevance (especially today).
