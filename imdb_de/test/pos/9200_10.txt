I usually do not comment on movies or TV shows, but I had to comment on Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Of course, here in the UK, we are about 2/3 through Season 3, and although I did manage to watch the last series of Season 3 (in other ways), I'm still down every Friday Glued 21:00 clock. <br /> <br /> Since the first episode of Season 1, I've been a big fan of this show and have heard something all three seasons on DVD, yes, I can not wait for Season 4 to start in October. <br /> <br /> Why do I love this show so much? Well, I have to agree to the last poster ... James Caan, I know that a person can not form a team, but Big Ed Deline was made for Caan, or maybe it was the other way around, I read that the producers Martin Sheen for Ed Deline considered. ! I also agree that Caan's character is getting very soft. I also preferred to take the hard Take No sh * Big Bad Eddy D that we saw in Season 1 and 2. He seems to be mature. <br /> <br /> As I said, nobody does the team for themselves and of course the other cast members Josh Duhamel / Danny, James LeSure / Mike, Vanessa Marcil / Sam, Nikki Cox / Mary and Molly Sims / Delinda, all Make a good contribution, even outside the cast As Cheryl Ladd as Jillian Deline, Harry Groener as Gunther, Dean Caine as Casey, Mitchell Longley as Mitch, who can perform six or seven times during a season, can fit as well as they do <br /> <br /> This show has it all, drama, action, excitement, laughter, romance, glamor, glamor and big celebrities who often play themselves. <br /> <br /> Many people disagree, but this is one of the best shows on digital TV, and I hope that it will be a long time after Season 4.
