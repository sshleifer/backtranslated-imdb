After my daughter was born in 1983, I had to lose weight. I tried the 20-minute workout and was addicted. I lost about 50 pounds. It was the most weight I've ever lost in my life. I can not believe this show is forgotten. It would be a blessing if you start a cable channel for training only and include the 20-minute workout. I think that was the best training video ever made. I wish I could buy it somehow and somewhere. The routine was easy to learn and you were working up a sweat. Your workouts today are too complicated and too hard to learn. Please do your best to get this video back in circulation. I pray that it will be a blessing to all who see and use it.
