The Women is a sweet movie about women of all ages (but mostly over 30) and their problems in life. Not only men and infidelity, but also relationships with friends and family, time to connect with others, problems with the image, impairment of your values, successes in life and finding what really makes you happy. > It's also about being true to oneself. Many times people give advice but do not really follow it. Sometimes they have created a delusion for themselves, and should you really go the same way or react to your feelings? I really liked this movie. Admittedly, it was a bit like trying Sex & the City, but that probably helped. The difference here is that it's like the sex & the city star's discoveries after the stretch of life - most of them are married or have crossed the point of finding a man. Now they are trying to find happiness in their marriage and their lives. <br /> <br /> Obviously it's not an Oscar contender, but it's entertaining and serves its purpose out there were equally men and women in the cinema (most were with their wives / girlfriends), and the men actually laughed. :)
