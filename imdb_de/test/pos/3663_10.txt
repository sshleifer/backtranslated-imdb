I loved this movie that I just saw at the Philadelphia Film Festival. In March 2005 I was in India with two friends and this movie was very real. I referred to everything and enjoyed every moment. The characters are believable, gripping the story and the end realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the show. This film shows very well the mixing, but not complete mixing of two worlds (east and west). The side occupation was wonderful as it depicts the life of a tourist in India realistically. The humor is subtle and sometimes dry, which makes it all the more realistic as it is woven into the daily antics of the characters. It's so easy to identify with each of the situations presented.
