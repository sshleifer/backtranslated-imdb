A group of young travelers who are running out of gas, go to a strange wax museum called "Saluesens Lost Oasis", owned by a strange man named Slausen (Chuck Conners), because the dummies are controlled by a mysterious force and a madman with special powers want her dead. <br /> <br /> One of the most underrated horror movies of the late 70's! This Charles Band (producer of "Re-Animator") has become one of the scariest and most unique low-budget horror productions of her day, bringing together some psychological issues without any nonsense like the usual Slasher movie had to. The film keeps the viewer on the edge of his seats with excitement and some horror. The film has since become a cult diamond for the genre, and this is worth a look. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "Pin", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)", "The Hills have Eyes (1977)", "Maniac (1980)", "Magic" (1978), " Dolls "," May "," Before dawn "," House of the 1000 corpses "," The Devil refuses "," Sleepaway Camp "," Mother 's Day "," A Nightmare on Ulmenstrasse "," Friday the 13th.
