I have seen many action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever! There are very few films that I even consider several times, and this is one of them. In this movie, everything is just right: Clint as the outstanding protagonist, Rene Russo as a stupid partner (a very rare combination - sad, but true!). Of course, John Malkowich deserves a lot of praise for his outstanding villain, but let's not miss Eastwood's first buddy, played by Dylan Mcdermott, who, in my view, fits in perfectly with this role. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - but unfortunately never released an original soundtrack CD (shame about the producers!). The action makes sense and there is no pace penalty, the audience is constantly excited about the outcome of the duel between Eastwood and Malkowich. I give this one 10 stars!
