My friends and I watched the movie last night in Austin on a show for AGLIFF (a film festival). This movie was one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and warm - and funny as hell! Everyone in the audience laughed throughout the movie. Texas is a big state - with many small towns - and of course many teenagers who grew up as "fat girls". I know that many people will be personally involved in this film. Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were great - they were so great in those roles, it was as if the script was written for them. Speaking of script, it was very well written (very believable) and Ash is a great actor (his face alone made me giggle). It's an independent movie - but do not be fooled ... It's a good movie! Seeing this caliber of work from someone so young is really inspiring.
