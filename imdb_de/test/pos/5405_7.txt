"Imaginary Heroes" is a 2004 film starring Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch, Michelle Williams and Kip Pardue. <br /> <br /> The story is about a dysfunctional family that becomes even dysfunctional with the oldest child (Pardue) commits suicide. <br /> <br /> "Ordinary People" was often mentioned in the context of this movie. It's a kind of "ordinary people" with a roll swap. The mother, Sandy Travis (Weaver), is in this case more accessible than the father Ben (Daniels), who is clearly devastated and unable to cope. Like "Ordinary People", the younger son Tim (Hirsch) is the focus of the film. <br /> <br /> For me, the film was so absorbent that it can continue to watch, but it has a strange distance. There were some wonderful interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (Williams) and some unusual moments. What never clicked was that Ben was part of this family or had chemistry with Sandy. This seems to have been the goal of director and author Dan Harris. In a grocery store scene, the checkout child assumes Sandy is "about 30" and gives her his phone number. In almost the next scene Daniels Sandy asks if she wants a plastic surgery for her birthday. Weaver was 55 when this movie was shot, probably 54, and he looks phenomenal. So what is Ben looking for? However, there is something unusual about Ben's complete separation because the viewer does not really see how Daniels was ever linked to this family. <br /> <br /> The end has a few twists and some very touching scenes. All are very good, with Weaver and Hirsch being the challengers. <br /> <br /> There are not many dialogues and many looks in this film. The script could have been sharper. But "Imaginary Heroes" is a good effort.
