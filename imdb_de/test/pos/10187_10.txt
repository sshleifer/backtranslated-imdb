It's not a movie, it's an experience! <br /> <br /> Not the usual eye candy that I thought was her. There are too many things going on at the same time, your senses almost could not handle it. A product of cutting-edge technology (we were torn between leaning back to enjoy the show and turn our 3D glasses on and off to decipher the magic), the music is great (it's a concert!), The It's funny, it's magical, it's exciting - I know this sounds like an advertisement - but it's really fantastic! Beats Christmas, if you bring forth the child in you! <br /> <br /> This attraction alone is worth going to Disney for. ;)
