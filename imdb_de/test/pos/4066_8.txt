At one time, buddy cop films dominated the box office. It seemed that every summer herd of Beverly Hills cop Wannabes came to the theaters of our nation. No longer. Lately, the chopper is hardly dried dripping. The drought has eased a bit with the release of Showtime, a really fun and consistently entertaining example of the genre. Mitch Preston is a committed policeman. He is by no means a Dirty Harry guy. He is just incredibly focused and absolutely intolerant of anything that hinders the performance of his duties, such as a TV cameraman. Mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and gets into the hands of Chase Renzi, a producer who seeks a killer hook for their "reality TV". Police officer show. She believes that Mitch will give her the 'annoying' boost she needs for a hit, but believes that it's unlikely to be alone on the show. Join Trey Sellars, a patrolman actor who has watched far too many repeats of the Police Story. Of course, Mitch and Trey mix like oil and water, and there is a lot of happy chaos. <br /> <br /> We know that Mitch and Trey are bound to become best friends at the end of the movie. This is how Buddy Cop films should work. It must be said that Showtime seldom deviates from the proven clichés of Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. There's a high-tech McGuffin to get the ball rolling (in this case, an automatic rifle that fires shots big enough to stop the tanks). There are chases, shootings and explosions. We all know that this is so, and we have a pretty good idea of ​​how everything will develop. You know what? There is nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know that the well-worn bases are touched, but the fun here is the journey, not the destination. Showtime is not stressful to be original. Instead, his energies are channeled into the characters and humorous situations. As a result, Showtime does a competent job with the action sequences, but really shines in his comedy. Robert De Niro is as dry as Mitch. In the past, I thought De Niro was a cold and expressionless actor who was terribly assaulted when asked to comedy. But he has grown up with me lately. He seems to bring more humanity into his roles. Eddie Murphy is weird like Trey. The best way to describe his performance is that Trey is what Murphy would be if Murphy were not so talented and did not reach the big time. Rene Russo has a droll time playing with a motorized show-Shiz-Shark Chase Renzi. She sneaks through the movie and hunts with overwhelming determination high Nielson ratings. In her zeal, she brings back Mitch's life to make it more camera-friendly. She even calls T. J. Hooker himself, William Shatner, to show Mitch how he is a "more authentic" police officer. Shatner is funny and plays the way we expect him to be, loud, forgetful and a bit disgusting. Ten years ago this film would have been a guaranteed success. Today, it does moderate business at best. That's a pity, because Showtime is a lot of fun.
