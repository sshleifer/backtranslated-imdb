What a pity that this movie was never released. (It is now being played over the cable.) I have appreciated my esteem for the stars and have been rewarded for watching a movie that is much better than the one I recently paid for in theaters. I like to be surprised. Often films are marketed as "offbeat", but in reality they are more of the same old recycled poultry. This movie is really different, with the benefit of a heart-warming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel. Although he is required by the plot to sing some of the most peculiar sentimental songs ever written, he makes them so good that you do not mind. Cathy Bates and Rupert Everett are well-staffed and outstanding, but a newcomer in the role of Cathy Bates' daughter-in-law steals every scene she's in. Give this movie a chance.
