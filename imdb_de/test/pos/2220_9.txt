For those who have ever been looking for happiness, "Half Empty" is a must. This original intercultural music comedy has funny numbers that make "The Producers" boring. Writer Bob Patterson teaches his soul to share his thoughts on life, wisdom, and happiness, and even write inspirational comments on index cards as his girlfriend fills her heart and ends her relationship. As his "lucky charm" "North Star" in the States has no success, send him to his publishers for a book visit to Germany. As he explained her decision to Bob, the boardroom breaks into a rousing song that would make Monty Python proud. Since his arrival in Hamburg, Bob's complete ignorance of the German language has clearly put him at a disadvantage. However, he makes soldiers, insensitive to the true feelings of his hosts, until a wildly devoted fan arrives and changes all reactions to him. The original songs drive the film and often describe the subtext of the story in a lateral split accuracy. The performers, led by Robert Peters, show an impeccably dry sense of humor and inhabit their characters as if they were not acting. See it for: A case study of how good intentions are completely irrelevant; How merciless Americans are seen abroad; How little reason is needed for a song, and above all for a stupid, entertaining and unconventional laugh.
