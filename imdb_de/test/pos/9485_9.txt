I'm a professional musician who was inspired to play the guitar almost 20 years ago after hearing Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin II. While I do not play in the same genre or style, the effect of this man was enormous. Well, almost 20 years later, I finally saw something more than the not so good The Song Remains Same Seed. Again I have seen so many bands performing, some small ones - some of the current "masters". No band, no where, by no means HOW has ever managed to produce the magic that you can really taste by watching this DVD. <br /> <br /> Robert Plant can be a bit busy at times, and you can almost feel that Page is annoyed when he forgets the lyrics, but that did not matter, I think - especially for the era. Bonhams genius shines on this DVD more than on any album with Zeppelin, the Band of Joy or Lord Sutch. JPJ is pretty common - but the magic of this DVD is how well the four play together. The world liked to think that she had black magic (k) and so on - that was just a question of Page. The magic (note, I say that often) is that this DVD shows a rare look at the rudeness of 4 young guys who can play brilliantly no matter how sloppy they actually play. It does not matter. <br /> <br /> A short break. On the first of the two DVDs lies the true magic. They should be able to feel the power and rudeness Zep had in their early days. At the end of the second DVD, Page fights with his mind during the Knebworth songs. (It's no secret he was heavily heroin at the time.) Well, I would recommend the first record to any music lover, and the second to the only true Zeppelin fan. <br /> <br /> For some guitarists, I may go too far here, but I would say, after looking at it, Page is certainly more creative and resourceful than Hendrix. Yes, I said it. And if you disagree, look at the DVD.
