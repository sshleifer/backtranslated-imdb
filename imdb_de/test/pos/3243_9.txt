Heath Ledgers, who act in this movie, really annoys me, but overall it's a great watch. Bryan Brown is excellent when I do not usually like him, but then his whole gang is a great work. Jimmy is a hapless would-be gangster who seems to be doing nothing right (SPOILERS: loses Pandos money, acko's car and almost bumps into bank robbery), but still gets on top of it. <br /> <br /> did not know what the two kids were at the beginning, but they combine some story lines nicely. All in all a damn nice piece of australian cinema 9/10
