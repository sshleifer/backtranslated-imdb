Barbara Stanwyck probably did not think so, but it's a relief to see her in an ever-darker hairdo (if it was not a wig) than the one she had to wear in Double Indemnity the previous year. The movie, during the premiere "Film Noir" and a great movie all around, gave her a great role, but oh, that hair. Here she is fancier and certainly not a femme deadly, but she is certainly a woman from the 40s. She has become accustomed to life without men since most of them are at war, and as a successful columnist for Martha Stewart she writes a cozy column describing her country house when the camera pans over what it really is. We meet her boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea she lied, and when he pushes herself away from her supposed home in Connecticut for Christmas, she must have a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and a baby before we "jingle bells." can say. Hungarian cook S.Z. Sakall steps in to help and lands with Irish Una O'Connor in a cutsey pie. "It's not goulash, it's Irish stew". Sakall just takes the pepper, pours most of it, and says, "Now it's goulash," which completely changes what she has prepared for lunch. Then, when it comes to the flapjacks, he turns and she shovels. For years, a few friends and I use this line every time pancakes pop up in a conversation. "I'm not freaking, I'm scooping!" She will not even turn one over for Greenstreet and says, "I've never struck in my life." O'Connor can get on her nerves when she screams again and again in some movies, but here she is lovingly loveable and her company with Sakall is very charming. <br /> <br /> It's obvious in the Romanic department that Reginald Gardiner is not the cup of Barbara Stanwyck, especially when she meets the pretty Dennis Morgan, who is a bit grumpy when bathing the baby and eats soap, which worries Stanwyck a bit. He should suspect something immediately, but he does not. But it does not matter. The movie is so appealing with the landscape filled with snow, a plethora of rocking chairs and a dog coming towards them as the sled comes up. After living in New York City for 25 years after growing up in a small town in western New York City, I missed this kind of Christmas. While Central Park is beautiful after a first snowfall, and the Rockefeller Center's Christmas tree is also exsquisit, you may have a view of a snow-capped tree and occasionally catch a glimpse of deer, rabbits or other wild life. <br /> <br /> This is a great holiday movie that can bring a Christmas out of season, and works great with another Country Christmas movie by Barbara Stanwyck, "Remember the Night", an underrated gem. Add Christmas to the big city from "Meet John Doe" and you may have found one of the busiest stars of holiday movies.
