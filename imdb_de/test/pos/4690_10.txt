I looked at it as a small child and then watched my videos. Now I watch the DVDs, I love that. Ray Winston is 'The Dude', the rest of the cast is good and even with the change of Robin Hood everything works. Great stories, twists, and the way they were filmed - for the untrained eye (not that mine is trained) can be interpreted as inappropriate, but they increase the audience's attention. With the green hills and the contrast of the lush, sunny forest to the dark corridors and dungeons of castles - It's great. Personally, the final interpretation of the Robin Hood legend. I can not stress how much I think you should see this. If you have a chance, you MUST adhere to it.
