This is a well made piece by everyone's favorite master of suspense. As usual, the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are excellent (especially for the film time). I did not find the first part of the movie very exciting, but the latter made up for it with one exciting scene after another. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like about this movie was choosing Farley Granger for the role of Guy Haines. Somehow I did not find him very believable. On the other hand, Robert Walker shines as an eerie "villain" Bruno Anthony. <br /> <br /> Overall, I highly recommend this.
