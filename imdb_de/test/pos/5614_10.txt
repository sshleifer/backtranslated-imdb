As you can see from the few comments posted here, my last may be last, unless there is a big DVD release or TCM is playing it again! - This is a kind of "Our Gang" movie with many different children. MGM was certainly the musical studio - if the musicians, dancers and singers were not under contract, they were on call. Heifetz was one of the most expensive ..... that makes it a little charity work !!! The fee he received during this time was outrageous. Another music film with Jose Iturbi (Mexican pianist) showed 100 children who played a simple melody on 100 pianos. The skeptics who think that little children are not musical are mistaken: I was a <br /> Like all writing, "Frankie Smith" - good old American name - (Gene Reynolds) was the evil but good guy who is brought by the owners of a music school off the street. Can you believe that Walter Brennan ("Prof. Lawson") of all these western films was the man who led the school? Joel McCrea ("Peter McCarthy") and Andrea Leeds ("Ann Lawson") were the bigger stars in "They Shall Have Music," with a number of well known extras (many of which later became stars themselves) rights). As others have commented, almost all children in the orchestra (actually The Meremblum Symphony from Los Angeles) have made great achievements in their lives, either as musicians (for the studios) or as other companies. <br /> <br /> Sadly, there are not so many young orchestras today - a sad mistake. Parents whose children are at school are usually so busy keeping their heads above water, and many do not even know what's going on with the kids at school. Music lessons can be expensive, and almost everyone would rather have a football team ... This is the cheapest concert by Jascha Heifetz that you'll ever hear in this movie. .... at that time a quarter. His playing is brilliant, even if he looks like he would rather be somewhere else ... emotionless. By contract, every Yo-Yo Ma concert is so happy that you feel like buying and buying a cello. This guy has a good time .... like the kids in the "street" concert when they let Heifetz play in the school. <br /> <br /> All the orchestra numbers were played by "the kids" and they just sound. I love this kind of movie - their actions are so simple that it does not take you two days to figure out if you enjoyed the movie at all - or understood it. We need some new films like this - I can not do anything but inspire younger children to play instruments other than guitars ... Bravo!
