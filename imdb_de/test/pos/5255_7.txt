My sisters and cousin forced me to watch this chick movie. It's not the kind of movie I'd rather see, but it was not that bad. I would not want to see this movie, but after seeing it, I could not say it was bad, just not my kind of movie. It was very accurate when it came to what the woman is really talking about and doing in certain situations. As a guy, I was not too amused by the jokes, but man the women were safe. They related to the movie and it was funny to see yourself on the big screen. I have never seen the original, and I would not care. If you're a girl, this is a must, but maybe girls would say that this movie is probably crappy. I do not see a 13-year-old who leaves. "Wow, I remember throwing when I was 30." so much.
