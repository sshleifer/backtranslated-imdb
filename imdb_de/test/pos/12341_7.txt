Thorn-BMI is out of business, before they stopped making movies, they made a cooler out of a movie. Use of E.S.P. and telekinesis as the basis of the daughter, whose father had a terrible power. It was not until her father's death that Olivia discovered that her Raymarovitch father Raymarovitch had actually murdered 6 girls and was planning two more with the Psyhic Vampirism technique. <br /> <br /> Our image starts with 6 coroner carriages and music to bring together the grusome discovery of the 6 girls. Dead everyone with their eyes open in a cupboard. There were all sorts of objects in the walls, the men of the coroners pulling up an old man as blue lightning touched the ceiling, causing a circular hole to form that only made the movie more bizarre, extremely frightening scenes for you. If you can not see corpses from years ago in every decay stage, you should not see them without a friendly companion. Like "The Changeling" it has a heart that stops the horror. I rated it 7, it's in color, the actress Meg Tilly debuted in this movie if you can find her.
