Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), a bigot who gets drunk there, takes it as a joke at first, but then the story is confirmed in the evening news. Instead of calling the cops or something like that, Joe decides that the guy killed a hippie and that they have to be related ghosts! He blackmails the man to become his buddy. The film was initially harsh and judgmental, but it turned out to be a complex portrait of contemporary society. Yes, I think it exaggerates a little, but in a funny way that does not really diminish the power of his messages. Susan Sarandon debuted in this movie, and it's a shock to see how pretty she was at age 23.
