Great movie! Oh yeah! Full of energy, full of fun and presentation of our generation, of our alienation: a hymn of positive thinking despite the world we live in, a story of a big party, a story of a group of friends who need to do something on a weekend and the only thing to do is the club. But fun and ecstasy will not cause boredom! Very funny, nice grotesque in a few points, nice shot ... and great soundtrack!
