Are you looking for a comic drama with suspense and ensemble cast? Find this little sleeper. John Lithgow and Billy Bob Thorton are great in this little twister. Do not forget the cameo of Jamie Lee Curtis. A touch of the 60s, a touch of "Prince and Pauper" and a touch of local gold make a great little story.
