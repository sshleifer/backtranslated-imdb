Many of us only find art enjoyable when the masterpiece itself touches something deep within us. That is, the finished creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow deal with it personally. It was winter, here in Australia in 1992, when I saw Batman Returns in the movie theaters and blew myself away. Both "me". I should belong to an ideal, a standard, but at the same time I lived a different life. Tim Burton was the first filmmaker to say it was OK for a comic book to be dark and to admit that darkness can happen to us all. After Tim Burton's interpretations of Batman flooded many dark comic heroes and anti-heroes the cinemas. The comic folklore had for decades told of friendly, sympathetic heroes with fancy smiles and magical superpowers flying into the sky, harnessing powerful nets from their wrists, wearing red boots and having the power of a locomotive. But what happens when you are only ten years old and your parents see you executed cold before your eyes? You snap Somewhere in your psyche your young tender psychological make-up breaks apart. The only way to manage such pain and injury is to create an alternative persona. You make a promise. Your other self will be stronger, use all the trouble to use every possible means to avenge your parents' innocence on this criminal, these criminals, every criminal. This is the life that is seen through Bruce Wayne's eyes. Both couples. The world he sees is dark, gloomy and cold. Although he patrols the streets and people hear him drive by, they do not rush to his autograph. He is her savior, not the winner of a personality contest. Batman Returns are about losers. Batman remains "the only lonely beast in town" for another Christmas. Bruce Wayne must never lawfully arrest the obnoxious Max Shreck. The penguin must never let go of his pain of being rejected by his parents to the citizens of Gotham, and Selina Kyle is forever mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero does not get the girl or the cat. This film makes you want all of us to be so desperate to have a home, as expressed by Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot. The film expresses a need We all are respected by Selina Kyle, Oswald and, of course, Bruce Wayne, respected and not ignored. But sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another. We are told that we should be an ideal to behave according to a certain standard. That's until we finally snap. There is only hope left at the end of the movie as we see Catwoman step into the night sky. But what can we all wish to wish all men and women goodwill? I can not say that I will reach a point where I believe my problem will be reconciled with duality. But that's okay. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not only the best of the Batman movies, it's an extraordinary masterpiece of storytelling.
