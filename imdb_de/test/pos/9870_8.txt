... does not like this movie and everyone would understand why. The plot is bad, as is the acting. But in my opinion, it's better than Halloween 5, though that does not give many surprising moments. Some scenes are really well directed. But these few moments provide no reason to rent them. I do not despise film violence, but H6 offers exceptionally strong and bloody scenes that are not in the tradition of Halloween movies. The best aspect of H6 is the lack of tension. No comparison to the first masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 gets only 4 out of 10 stars from me. If you want, rent it. But do not expect a great horror experience ... <br /> <br />
