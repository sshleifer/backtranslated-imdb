A really scary ghost story, full of goose bumps and sensuality, this movie just misses what it promises. It is apparently based on an old ghost story and may be a little too dependent on a simple premise. For the most part of the journey it is imaginative and sincerely gripping, but in the end it is almost like Oshima who has lost interest in it and brought it to a quick stop. Her younger lover kills her husband so they can be together. But her failure of nerves and his recurrent mind condemn her to insanity. His beautifully crafted scenes with imaginative scenes and the passion of the lover are beautifully presented. But too often the movie does not keep its promise, almost as if Oshima loses his nerve as much as the lovers do it. Dexterity as a filmmaker with a few animated films that sweep the audience is not a real classic in the form of films like Onibaba or Woman of the Dunes.
