I saw this movie when I was a kid and I've been looking for it ever since. He is highly rated with Cabin in The Sky, Stormy Weather and Carmen Jones as a must-have in movies showing the unbelievable talent of African Americans. 60's local TV stations in Los Angeles had a movie of the week and some channels showed the same movie for 5 days. Porgy and Bess were one of them, and my whole family would be watching the TV every 5 nights and only post on the commercials. South Pacific, Oklahoma and The Sound of Music are all classics that you can pick up at any video store. It would be a shame to let this collection of some of America's best talents forget or lock it in a vault. Please make the film available to the public.
