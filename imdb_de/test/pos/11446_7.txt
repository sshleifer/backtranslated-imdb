Night of the Demons is more than any other film of this time the brainless and extremely enjoyable horror pics. It's an uncomplicated fun with many unpleasant make-up effects, great-looking (and awesome) teenagers and adorable clich√©s. A group of party animals, led by Alternative Angela, celebrates Halloween in an abandoned funeral home bearing an eerie urban legend. It all starts in a typical and "innocent" way with dancing, drinking and occasional flirting between teenagers who can not keep their hormones under control, but soon a bloodthirsty demon owns the hostess. In the most ingenious way you've ever seen, the rest of the cast are viciously slaughtered to return as horrible creatures seeking blood. What makes this movie better than most kitsch horror movies of the 80s is that it finds a balance between a reckless camp and an atmospheric horror. Some sequences are really scary and the funeral plant gives Night of the Demons an excellent tone. Director Tenney uses the set pieces (coffins, crematorium, endless dark corridors?) And his young, enthusiastic performers obviously love what they're getting involved in. Of course, the obvious aspects of love and horror fanatics are the large number of severed limbs, pinched eyes, and crushed skulls. But the ultimate highlight is Linnea Quigley's trick with the vanishing lipstick! This nymphomaniac Bimbo pushes a whole tube of lipstick into her nipple and continues her sex murder! Great! Night of the Demons received two sequels in the 90s, and although they are still worthwhile, they focus more on comedy than chills.
