"Two Hands" is a fun, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay faces the world of fast money and deadly acts of inexplicability of fate and circumstances. In a subtle way, we are asked to reflect on the concept that important events in our lives are sometimes generated without us being aware of the causes. The forces of fate and circumstance lead Jimmy, the protagonist, into situations that bring about the realization of his superficial dreams and ultimately the understanding of a more personally promising world with an ingenuity of Heath Ledger is a child who has grown up without opportunity. The highly paid crime world offers the greatest appeal to his blunted senses. The love and help of friends takes him to a higher plateau. <br /> <br /> The film is well directed and well played. The gang of criminals straddles amiable and despicable and lets us be interested in their crazy antics throughout the movie.
