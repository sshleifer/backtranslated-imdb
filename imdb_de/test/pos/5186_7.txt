This is a catastrophe movie that takes place in London. Starting with several hurricanes, the superstorm and tornadoes are being moved eastward on Scotland, plunging the coast of England and later the south. After several hours of heavy rain, the London barrier over the Thames is about to overflow and paves the way for disaster. Then a colossal tidal wave is unstoppable in the East, causing devastation and jeopardizing the lives of millions of Londoners. At the heart of the story is a climatologist (Tom Courtenay), a climatologist trying to save London from the effects of the giant wave, convincing the authorities that the city's dike was unsafe, a marine engineer (Robert Carlyle), and his ex-husband Mrs. Samantha (Jessalyn Gilsig). They were trapped in the barrier and fell at sea. Meanwhile, the HQ secret agent, ruled by Nash (Joanne Whalley) under the direct order of the Deputy Minister (David Suchet), is trying to control many displaced persons and avoid more deaths, about 200,000. They have some time to save London from total catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Absolutely acceptable drama disaster with good acting. The great Tom Courtenay as a climatologist predicting a disaster, and Robert Carlyle and Jessalyn Gilsig as an ex-marriage reviving their love. The film features stunning high-tide scenes brought to life by the stunning computer generator special effects, better than the 70s classic, such as "Earthquake, Inferno Towering" and similar to "Armaguedon and Day after tomorrow". Although this is not a clear denuncio, we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and global warming that causes the ozone hole. The film is well directed by Tony Mitchell. I would recommend this movie to people who like disaster movies. Another adaptation via floods are the following: 'Flood (1976)' by Earl Bellamy with Robert Culp and Barbara Hershey; "Hard Rain (1998)" by Mikael Salomon with Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater; "Flood: The Flood of a River (1979)" by Bruce Pittman with Richard Thomas
