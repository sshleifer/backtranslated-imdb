At a press screening I saw "I smell the dead" - sorry, "I sell the dead". Glenn McQuaid, the screenwriter, director and editor of the film, is a filthy Irishman who introduced the show by announcing that he would "pint as long as it went". I do not hate him for a drink, but-by telling us about it-he seemed to feel he had to confirm his meanness or his irrationality or both. As the opening credits rolled, there was loud laughter for the names of all the actors or crew members who had found friends in the audience, and silence for those who had not. McQuaid later returned for a witty question and answer. <br /> <br /> This horror movie is not serious, which is good because its humor is much stronger than its horror. Only one scene is scary even from a distance, and most of the "horror" is just rough, but I laughed throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be playing in Ireland around 1850, which was the time when the Graobubende died most of the time). The story is told in flashbacks: we get flashbacks inside Flashbacks and the narrative character flashbacks stuff he could not know about, because sometimes he was not present or (in one case) because the storyline unfolds behind his back , <br /> <br /> The story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine. Guillotines were not used in nineteenth-century Ireland, but for once we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence. The prisoner fights on his way to execution, the rope clamps are accurate and the prisoner manages to look up to see the blade above him. (And there's a reward later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the Guillotine itself.) <br /> <br /> The characters are supposedly Irish, but one of the main characters speaks in Cockney slang: phrases like "a scratch game" and "Take a butcher" (for "look"). For once, actors in the 19th-century roles show 19th-century dental hygiene, but almost all the clothes and hairstyles (and women's make-up) are determined to be the 21st century. I do not complain in the case of Heather Bullock wearing a black miniskirt miniskirt that looks like PVC. Phworr! <br /> <br /> The main characters (except Ron Perlman) are excellent, but most of the cast have no sense of the Victorian era. The worst culprit is Joel Garland as a customs officer whose characterization is anchored in the 21st century. Just when I thought that Garland's performance should not be less Victorian, he used his fingers to make "ironic" air quotes. <br /> <br /> The sets (especially Angus Scrimm's lab) are detailed and impressive, yet impressive I could not convince myself that people actually lived and worked in those places. There are burning candles in almost every interior, but I have never seen what would have been there if it was Victorian homes or workplaces: remnants of previous candles. <br /> <br /> One scene shows an alien: I was annoyed that McQuaid plopped down for a stereotypical "gray" swan alien and not for something original. <br /> <br /> There are great montage sequences, but McQuaid chooses eye-catching effects - split-screens, overhead shots - that does not serve history. I was impressed by a recurring blue-screen device that Put heads of the main characters on other backgrounds. Less effective was a recurring motif of "creepshow" motifs, in which actors' faces were transformed into drawings reminiscent of blackboard art from the fifties horror comics. I'm a fan of EC Comics, but they're not part of 19th century Ireland. The money McQuaid has spent on the eye-catching photo F / X demonstrating its cutting abilities without serving the story should be spent on accurate costumes. <br /> <br /> BIG SPOILERS NOW. Ron Perlman gives an "Oirish" performance with acting school tics. He allegedly plays an Irish priest from the 19th century and writes with his left hand. (In Victorian Ireland, left-handed children were punished for using the "Hand of the Devil" and forcibly retrained to right-handed.) But Perlman's character has a reason to hide his right hand. Elsewhere, a character is bitten by a zombie, but does not suffer the consequences, so I knew there would be a payout later. Several scenes that would logically take place at night are recorded in daylight, apparently only because it was easier and cheaper. (Since McQuaid is a seasoned director and editor, he could easily have taken "day in and night out" photography ... but using a process-photographic effect to tell the story seems to interest him less than showing off his eye-catching editing techniques br /> <br /> McQuaid seems to pay homage to these great old Hammer horror films, but these hammers were so great because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we actually had happenings in Whitechapel in 1888 or anywhere else "I Sell the Dead" almost conjures up the 19th century Glenn McQuaid shows talent as a director, scripter and editor, but in all three areas he makes weird decisions ... then largely these decisions can not justify I enjoyed 'I sell the dead', rated 7 out of 10 and looking forward to his next movie.
