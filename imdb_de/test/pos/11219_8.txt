Above all, NORTHFORK is a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography. Just for that, the movie is worth the time. The barren, vast plains and wastelands of eastern Montana are captured in the soft, muted earth tones of autumn or spring. The gigantic gray cement Fort Peck Dam is the protagonist of the film. The film subtly and not so subtly comments on a dozen editions of Western Landscape. The dialogue can sometimes try, but the images and concepts are strong enough to lift the movie. The 50s work so well here and are so well executed. I think the past years will be friendly to this movie.
