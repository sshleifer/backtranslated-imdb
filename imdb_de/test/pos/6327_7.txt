Nearly three and a half years after scratching out a run last month (October 7-31, 1953) at the Coronet Theater on Broadway (on West 49th Street, since renaming it O'Neill), MGM relied on the former solid ones Wasted a wonderful cast on the success of the play in London, and most of the time, on a sadly downplayed screenplay of this cunning subversive boulevard comedy, was "carefully" prepared and rewarded with a modest success. Ava Gardner is the increasingly frustrated wife of Stewart Granger, an internationally successful and totally satisfied "workaholic" (before the term was coined), who used the ever-frustrated David Niven to try to rekindle the passion in her spouse. When Gardner's "second honeymoon" cruise resulted in Granger setting up the trio (and Granger's dog) on ​​a South Pacific island (were there any other survivors planned for later action), Granger is building the world around him around on big hut for himself and his wife and a small title for Niven - or for the unconnected man. <br /> <br /> The core of the game's storyline does not begin until about half of the movie, as Niven suggests that Granger and he take turns as tenants of the Little Lodge - the only woman on the island to share Granger was ready to share the only pair of shoes (his). <br /> <br /> Reason (the Granger is for his) (Strong Point) rules and frustration reigns - for a while. <br /> <br /> David Niven and Ava Gardner are outstanding in their appointed roles as seductive seductress and seductress, and Stuart Granger - usually only asked to be handsome and masculine in action roles and the weird Miscast Specia lty ( a screaming handsome boy as Apollodorus in Shaw's CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA in 1945) - gives one of the better theatrical achievements of his film career than the husband, who may be as smart as he believes. Thirty-three years later, he showed this endearing urbanity towards Rex Harrison in Granger's first (and BOTH last) Broadway engagements in a revival of Somerset Maugham's THE CIRCLE, which ended with Harrison's death. We would be much richer if Granger had used those skills more often. <br /> <br /> As promising as the menu is, this is a very British boulevard comedy AND Hollywood in the fifties that (as opposed to the source play) very little sex actually continues. To be honest, if you do not give in to the ideas that drive the gadgets, it gets a bit stupid (the same basic conspiracy develops more satisfactorily three years later at Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr / Robert Mitchum / Jean Simmons.) (Stewart Granger's Act Ms.) THE GRASS IS GREENER, based on an even less successful game, but for some reason, the superior trifle at the box office failed. <br /> <br /> As wasteful as MGM put the play there. There were unfortunate omissions - the Stupidity that ends your stay on the island is caricaturally predicted, which should have been a moment of excitement - the sinking of the yacht that blows it on the island, ultimately giving us only about three quarters of an hour of the true Little Hut, but ninety Good minutes from David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger make the movie a fun change but a dignified, guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> We even get some very nice side dishes in Walter Chiari (who was supposed to be the real lover of Ava). One of his better speeches is: "Boola, Boola!"
