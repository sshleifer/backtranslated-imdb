Who would have thought that a non-disabled actor could be so realistic and immensely powerful in a film as a disabled person? Probably someone. But no one, really nobody, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotional and powerful performance of the two actors in this film. Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a disability home people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as we were told right from the start, he has big communication problems. It really is a lifeline when the disabled member Rory (James McAvoy), who can speak normally, understands him. This is the beginning of a friendship based above all on (ironically enough) communication. <br /> <br /> In a hilarious scene, they manage to move out of their own homes. After Rory had been turned down, the kind-hearted Michael applied for a move to his own house. Rory, who already had a bad reputation with the "judges", should be his interpreter. <br /> <br /> But soon there were problems. They begin to walk with good-naturedness to a girl they met in a pub some time ago. She hesitates first; She does not know these men, but seems harmless; This is another friendship, but not necessarily a good one ... <br /> <br /> This film is not only poignant, but it really depends on the actors. That's not a bad thing. For a non-disabled actor you see Rory, although he can communicate properly, frustrated with how completely he is dependent on other people and has no life of his own. The real star for me is Steven Robertson. He acts with such an emotion, the longing to adapt and sadness / happiness that really makes him win for the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Excellent. <br /> <br /> Total: 5 out of 5
