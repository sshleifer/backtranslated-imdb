Do not change your husband on the one hand is the beginning of a series of light marriage comedies by Cecil B. DeMille. On the other hand, it is his first picture featuring Gloria Swanson, probably the greatest actress of the silent era, and the movie that made her a star. <br /> <br /> Although the old DeMille formula began to change, and his films became more verbose and less purely visual, with such an expressive cast as Swanson we regain much of that quiet narrative style. Your character does very little, but communicates volume through subtle gestures and facial expressions? with a special talent for scornful looks. In real life, Swanson herself had come to the end of her catastrophic marriage with Wallace Beery, and it was possible that this fact fueled her compelling performance. Framing and close-ups are particularly strong here. He uses cinematic technique to show acting? Does Swanson often hold close-ups in important moments? and also to visually illustrate the story. For example, when we get to know the character of Toodles, it is shown three times in a mirror of the dressing table. Her character disappears from the story to become important towards the end. This eye-catching first shot helps her to remember who she was. Later, at the anniversary dinner, Swanson and future husband number two, Lew Cody, are framed together in one shot, while Elliot Dexter is isolated in his own setting. Likewise ?? and that is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general? There is a lot of use of reaction recordings? For example, the disapproving look of the bishop as Cody plays with the wedding figures his intentions. In contrast to DeMille's visual narrative method, the increasingly verbose screenwriting of his colleague Jeanie Macpherson. As I noted in several other comments, Macpherson could put together a strong and dramatic story, but like DeMille, she tended to formulate her themes in a somewhat overbearing and extravagant style. And so we get these very long quasi-philosophical title cards on the pitfalls of married life, which, if they improve the story, are only because they are unintentionally funny. For example, only Jeanie Macpherson could point out with a line like "Fate Lurks Sometimes At Christmas Shopping." Fortunately, most of the titles in this image are scenes, rather than partitions. <br /> <br /> Although the pictures he made at this time were rather small in size, DeMille seemed to develop his taste for the spectacular at this point. You can see him begin sneaking apologies for a bit of razzmatazz, like the little fantasy scenes that shower Swanson with "enjoyment, wealth, and love." It would not be until the early twenties, after the unofficial embargo on historical images had been lifted, that he would get the chance to do anything with the big spectacle. <br /> <br /> All in all, do not change anything The husband is a pretty decent DeMille dumbbell, although, to be honest, only Gloria Swanson's presence is above average. It's strange that this is probably a comedy, and Swanson was at least partially cast for her background in the slapstick factory of Mack Sennett. She hated comedy acting and gives a dramatic rather than a funny performance here. So it makes sense that the only direct drama with DeMille, Male and Female was by far the strongest collaboration.
