I have long wanted to see this romantic drama (with a shot of World War II), and now I can only say that it is a true masterpiece of Russian cinema! The Soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandistic approach, which, fortunately, is free of this emphasis - with a firm interest in the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl who is doomed to failure by the outbreak he likes to volunteer, but he will never return. The girl (a notable feat of Tatyana Samojlova) is also loved by the young man's cousin and if she does not get any news from her boyfriend, she gives in and marries him. However, he is an aspiring concert pianist who is bitter that the war has limited his chances of success, and even knowing that the girl is still devoted to the soldier begins to neglect her. Eventually, the message reaches the girl of her beloved husband, but at the end of the film, she has learned to accept this as a sacrifice to her homeland, and is content to live with her memories of him. <br /> <br The film offers a truly astonishing camera work that makes the most of the screen space and, with the frequent use of tracking, tilt and high or low angle shots, gives great power to the unfolding emotional drama. Individual sequences are equally impressive - two particularly: the breathtaking scene, frenetically edited and sped-up, in which the girl saves a deserted boy from being kicked by a truck; and the premature demise of the young man in an unfortunate incident at the front, undoubtedly one of the best of his kind that I have ever seen (with the sun moving away from him symbolizes the life seeping out of his body like him it imagines) wedding day he will never have!). Noteworthy, however, is the scene in which the girl looks at home for her parents, who were hopelessly devastated during an air raid. as well as her final violent surrender to the concert pianist, whom she wants to resist by repeatedly being struck in the eye, during an air raid, and most efficaciously using a series of billowing curtains! <br /> <br /> Disappointingly, the R1 DVD of this great movie is a sheer affair (the RusCiCo edition includes some additions, but as export goods, they are way overpriced and hard to find!); Criterion released it in conjunction with another Russian classic from the war, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959), of which my friend told the local DVD distributor that he will be out soon ... <br /> <br /> The only other film I have seen by this director the arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969, albeit about the much shorter US release version!), An international production based on true events based on international stars. Unfortunately, given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING, I did not manage to miss his famous documentary I AM CUBA (1964) when I was in Hollywood last year: apart from a week-long theater run, more than once on television shown, accompanied by a full-length "Making Of" !!
