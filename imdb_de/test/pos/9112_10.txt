I'm a HUGE Tenacious D fan and I think that this is not the funniest movie in the world, but the most entertaining. It's not a laugh-minute, but the D did not want that. I went to the movie, watched all HBO shows, memorized both albums, and that made it even more fun. Many insider jokes from earlier Tenacious D albums and HBO shows. Since I already knew the new album, I knew 40 minutes of the movie because it's a musical comedy. I would say it has the best first 5 minutes of a movie and the best 5 minutes of any movie. Hands down. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie now!
