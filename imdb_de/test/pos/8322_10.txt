John Grierson pointed out: "The documentary can be defined as: the creative interpretation of reality." <br /> <br /> This fabulous 180-minute documentary marks the first time that a computer-generated project on dinosaurs respects the intelligence of the dinosaurs beholder. <br /> <br /> When I saw Jurassic Park, which I awaited with great excitement, I was extremely disappointed. Of course, the dinosaurs were great, but storytelling was unnecessary. I thought, "What if you made a documentary about dinosaurs, no weeping kids or bad puns, just as realistic dinosaurs as possible, so we can wonder about the former reality." <br /> <br /> My dream came true. The BBC has released an intoxicating documentary about the different eras of the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> This section addresses all people who do not think that they have had to guess at many points regarding the behavior skin pattern etc .: Of course they must. Nobody was there. I think it's fantastic that they could present something so realistic. The guesses are all based on the knowledge of many paleontologists and allow the viewer a pretty good idea of ​​what it was like. If you want to stick to what we know for sure, just visit a Dinosaur Bone Museum. That's why I added the quote from Grierson at the beginning of this commentary. Anyway, the author has something to say.
