Crack House (1989) was one of the few films of the 80s that fall into this genre. What an anti-drug movie should be turns out to be nothing more than a white exploitative exercise in perdition. There is nothing wrong with that. The video presentation even includes an anti-drug message from one of the show's stars Richard "turncoat" Roundtree, <br /> <br /> The film follows two young lovers in high school. One of them is a tough guy and the other is his girl. One of them is found out by a mutual friend, while the other gets a trip to the slam and later has the chance to return to his ex-boyfriends. Jim Brown appears as "Mister Big" of the movie. He is a bad guy who can still kick everyone out. He is a very sadistic guy, who likes to hit his heels and knock the tar out of his hands trying to resist his word. Luke of General Hospital is also a star for guests. <br /> <br /> If you like hard-boiled, then this movie is just right for you. Unfortunately, Hollywood does not do this anymore and if so, it's neither exploitative nor entertaining. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Sleaze fans.
