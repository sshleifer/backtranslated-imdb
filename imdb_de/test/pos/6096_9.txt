This must be one of the funniest Danish movies ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are weird when they drive through Sweden. I do not know how Ulrich Thomsen does that, but somehow he manages to play crazy. BUT if you do not understand Danish (I'm not referring to your pastry here), are not you wasting your time doing that? I do not think it would work with subtitles.
