If vampire stories are your blood, then this goth feast, based on the Anne Rice vampire chronicles, should be a satisfying experience. A true consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting, "Queen of the Damned", led by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness and of the unfortunate souls living there for eternity. <br /> <br /> The vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored of a world that does not arouse him, has been sleeping for many years. but suddenly the sounds of this world, which he hears from his prolonged sleep, change, and as he likes what he hears, he dares to examine himself. What he finds is a world full of new sounds, a new kind of music - driving and penetrating - sounds that attack the senses and make him feel alive and welcoming. And he knows that finally his time has come, that it is time for him and those like him to step out and face the world on their terms. For this purpose, he becomes the front man for a band - a singer and performer, as the world does not know him yet. He presents himself as a vampire and quickly gathers a following that reaches far beyond London (where it all starts) and eventually takes him to Death Valley, California, where he wants to give a concert that promises to be beyond anyone has ever seen or experienced. <br /> <br /> Lestat is powerful, without question, but there are those of his kind who do not rate the fact that he revealed them positively, one of whom is Marius (Vincent Perez), a vampire, who is powerful on his right - the vampire who "made" Lestat so many years ago - and they gather, get together and plan to meet Lestat at the concert. And they do not go for the music. But there is something else: At one point, Lestat accidentally aroused the "mother" of all, the most powerful of all vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who wants to announce her presence to everyone and above all to the one she calls her king ruled her side: Lestat. And rest assured that Akasha will be there at the concert. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this is Lestat's story, and Rymer presents it in an atmospheric setting with exquisite moments. although his film has less bite than saying "Interview with the Vampire" or "Bram Stoker's Dracula". He sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide a thrill, but overall, the movie is not as threatening as it could be, or as much as you might expect. In effect, the amount of meat that is burned actually gains more than the actual bloodshed, even though there is more than one taste of blood and more than a good amount of lips and mouths dribbling with the red stuff. There are also good F / X values, especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires, as they move faster through the air and race through the air than the naked eye can detect. It's a decent job for Rymer, but he could have put in more teeth if he had played the alienation suggested by Lestat; It looks like you have a sense of detachment, but not enough to get you fully involved. <br /> <br /> In an interview with the vampire, Tom Cruise gave Lestat a charismatic star power. But Townsend is even more effective, with a look and attitude that captures Lestat perfectly. He plays him with a sense of acceptance, and on closer inspection, you can even find a hint of regret and longing. It's a good performance and one that convincingly sells its character. <br /> <br /> As Marius, Vincent Perez also does a good job - he is indeed one of the movie's strong points - but his character is somewhat ambiguous; However, this has more to do with the way it was written than with Perez's performance, which is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Marguerite Moreau also stars as Jesse in notable performances, a young woman too curious for her own good. and the beautiful Lena Olin as Maharet, Jesse's aunt, who ultimately plays a crucial role in the result of the play with Lestat and Akasha. <br /> <br /> As Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolutely fascinating presence. What more can you say about her than she is a gifted performer with tremendous talent and beauty. And tragically she left us too early. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman) and Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Roger) Maudy). With a much stronger history than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice fans in particular will be pleased with "Queen of the Damned", a film lovingly crafted and supplied by director Rymer and his captivating cast. By focusing on the drama of the story - and the way it's presented - Rymer has managed to bring out a real horror movie that's definitely a cut-up and may just be a cheap thrill to whet your appetite. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this as 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
