Based on a true story. , , <br /> <br /> The premise of this film is to illustrate that through fairly normal events it is possible for an outwardly "decent" mother to become involved in heroin addiction. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** Some scenes are pretty inaccurate - while others almost make you want to fix the problem. <br /> <br /> Computer Technician / Graphic Designer with a good relationship with her young teen-child spirals Look for a colleague who is a 'chipper' (someone who can enjoy it every now and then +) - Then she becomes too an addiction that eventually causes her to score 'street vendors' after she has lost contact with her steadfast dealer br /> <br /> The scenes in which she comes down and gets 'sick' are often very real - especially the first real "night sweat". Before all these events, she began a relationship with a guy who happened to have lost his wife to the bottle and insists he has an internal radar so as not to let such women down. Some radar! However, after a few late risers and comical behaviors, the friend asks them to "what's up". His radar begins to amplify and demands that she empty her bag. She hits the roof and storms out. <br /> <br /> Due to the excellent and open relationship she had developed before this tragedy, he is the first to find real evidence in her pocket. Then he looks around the tube for her 'hiding place' - apparently his sensitivity comes from teaching drugs - and when he discovers a large hiding place in the bathroom, he flushes it out! NO HAPPY WIFE, if she takes her next bath and "disappears". <br /> <br /> The child holds one back and puts her on the dining table - she then goes into further refusal - admits it and says it's no no worse than dope. <br /> <br /> Thge's kid does all the right things, calls her friends and usually puts them in a position where she has to come "clean" - if you excuse the pun. <br /> <br /> The film takes the viewer through some pretty arduous situations where the danger is not far. <br /> <br /> She may get help from a professional organization and make a cold turkey movie to see what happens next. , , ,
