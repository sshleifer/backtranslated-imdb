I've seen this movie since I was a little girl, and when I was from New York and remembered how people lived then, it brought back many beautiful memories. This movie is not just about having a fairy tale ending, but also about becoming the fighter, a better person, woman, and provider that Claudine has been trying to do. It was about the social system bringing women into a binding situation. It was about the injustice of a system that had invaded and made demands on a family to stay afloat. Diane Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and he was deserved. If you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful bonding moments, look forward to Claudine. Your goal as a spectator is to stay open and understand the general frustration.
