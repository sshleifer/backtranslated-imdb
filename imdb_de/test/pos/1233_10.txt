Hello to all Denver fans! <br /> <br /> I could not agree with you anymore! This show was so cool and cute, I saw her as a kid in the late 80's. Also among the most popular in Denver are Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I'm 24 years old now, but it's still one of my favorite shows and my favorite cartoon from the 80's. It brings back all memories. The theme was great too, I get goose bumps when I hear it. It is sad that it took such a short time, but it has remained a firm favorite. It's great that I'm not alone and that there are people who like it. This is one of the cartoon shows I will keep for future generations. <br /> <br /> Viva Denver! :)
