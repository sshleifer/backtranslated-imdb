I have just seen Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the film leaves much to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's development to overcome his youth and upbringing in a biased south, and the creativity of a teacher, despite his diverse backgrounds and difficult backgrounds Circumstances in contact with the students. As a teacher, see how a teacher adapts to his students and prepares them for all the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks. This is a valuable concept that we all need to remember. The thread about the Vietnam War is still valid today. Worth a look.
