Seriously, I do not really understand why people beat it up here. I mean, the idea of ​​a killer snowman wreaking havoc in a tropical island paradise is quite absurd. The good news is the producers have recognized it and made it a comedy in the style of Army of Darkness. <br /> <br /> Especially in the second half of the movie, when the little killer snowballs attack, I laughed at my ass. For example, you can put one of the little guys in a blender (a la Gremlins 1) and mix. After that, it turns into a snowball again and screams in a high voice, "That was fun!". <br /> <br /> Conclusion - an incredible movie, loan it.
