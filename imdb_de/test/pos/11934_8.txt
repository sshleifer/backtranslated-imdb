I first saw this movie a year and a half ago and I loved it, I chose the DVD for my birthday last year. He has the right amount of suspense, action and drama. This film is about preschool The Regis School and its rebellious children, in which a child William Tepper (Sean Astin) has difficulty adjusting due to earlier rejections from other schools because he could no longer control his rebellious act and now at the Regis School commits more acts From a rebellion, the school is taken over by terrorists on a fortuitous day. The real reason is that the father of the leader Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff) was put in jail, so to get his father back. <br /> <br /> In addition to William Tepper, his rebellious friends are in the Regis School, one of whom is Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton), in which this guy has a troubled past to live and be sent to a mafia family to The Regis School because she hates his father, who he is, and what he now has to deal with taking over the school by these terrorists. William, Joey and their friends need to band together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and dangerous tactics /> <br /> This movie was really great and I think people should pay more attention to it, because when people think of a good hostage movie, they would say "The Hard" and although I would have to agree with them, they must realize that Toy Soldiers was a good thriller, my heart was beating because the students were my age and I was afraid to confront terrorists like this, though they would take over our school ... But overall this movie is really worth 112 minutes of your time and if I had the decision to rent or buy it ... I would buy it! I recommend it with a lot of hype! 8.10
