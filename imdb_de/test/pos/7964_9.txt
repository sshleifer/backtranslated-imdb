Hooray for Korean cinema! Last year I saw "Chungyang" and "Nowhere to hide". Now I'm catching Hur Jin-ho's directorial debut "Christmas in August". The variety of topics and the level of performance speak of a national cinema ready to be discovered. The main themes of this film are death and love. The graceful and thoughtful way in which Jung Won (Han Suk-kyu) cope with his imminent death and the sublimation of his wishes towards Darim (Shim Eun-Ha) out of true love for her. I was deeply touched by his careful handling of behavior and emotions, which protects Darim from unnecessary pain without rejecting it. The success of this kind of movie is based on the skill of the actors. Han and Shim are characterized by their expressiveness and naturalness. A number of minor characters, the relatives, friends and customers of Jung Won, are quickly demarcated to enrich the story without compromising their main focus. LIFE means to love, but everything has to happen. The pain subsides. Life goes on.
