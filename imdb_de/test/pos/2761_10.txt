Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the best TH game in the series. Next to the subway. It deserves a strong love. It's a crazy game. There are huge levels, huge unlockable characters ... it's just a huge game. Waste your money for this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even if the graphics are shit, that does not make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at that time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES? As they say in Canada, this is the fun game, aye. (You can travel to Canada in THPS3.) Well, I do not know if they say that, but they could. Who knows. Well, Canadian people. Wait a minute, I start from the topic. This game rocks. Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it. It's pure brilliance.
