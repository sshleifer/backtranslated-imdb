This movie is one of my favorite childhood memories. The muppets (at the peak of their popularity) in Hollywood see, sing and dance, with Miss Piggy cheating on her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear giving his best as everyone's manager and a generous cast of "extras" delivering a movie that was shot "okey dokey ". <br /> <br /> Kermit's melancholic ukulele number "Rainbow Connection" was nominated for an Oscar this year, but was beaten by Norma Rae's "It Goes Like It Goes." I will choose Kermit's song every day! Get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy ... one day they will find it, the rainbow connections, the lovers, the dreamers and me!
