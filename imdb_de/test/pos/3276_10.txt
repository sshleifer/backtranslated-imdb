I'm not the biggest fan of Western. My two personal favorites, however, are Unforgiven and Tombstone. I loved this movie! It was great! The plot was well done and it was a funny movie. Everyone involved in this film was excellent! I even think that both movies were somehow exceeded. Well, not really forgotten, because that was a great movie, with which the two can not be compared in the long run. I think it beat Tombstone. Both had their strengths. For example, both had excellent well-known performers, very good acts and very good shooting. But Posse defeated Tombstone in four ways, in my opinion. First, the characters in Posse were unique. The music was better in posse. The idea was original unlike Wyatt Earp in Posse. And the biggest difference, the action sequences! Oh my God! Posse was a western with really good action sequences. I mean really good! The action was fast. Like modern shooting films. The action also had big budget explosions! The fist fights were pretty good as well. Mario Van Pebbles was great in this movie! I recommend buying this excellent movie!
