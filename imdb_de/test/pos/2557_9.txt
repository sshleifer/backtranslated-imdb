Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), or Ale for short, works in a car body repair shop at the so-called Iron Triangle, a twenty-block block near twenty blocks of auto junk yards and sloppy auto dealers near Shea Stadium, Queens, New York , Customers do not wonder if parts of stolen cars are or not, and why they can get so big discounts. They just give their money and hope that everything is up to par. Sleazy outskirts such as these are not highlighted in the guidebooks, but Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani introduces them to Chop Shop, a powerful indie film that found much affection in Cannes, Berlin and Toronto last year. Bahrani succeeded his celebrated "Man Push Cart" and spent a year and a half at the site that F. Scott Fitzgerald called the "Valley of the Ashes" in the Great Gatsby. <br /> <br /> Chop Shop is not a socio-critical work, despite its bleak portrayal, but like Hector Babenco's Pixote, it is a poignant character study of the survival of a boy at the price of his innocence. Filmed on location in Willets Point, Queens, Bahrani gives you the feeling of being there and sweating in a hot and humid New York summer with all the noise and chaos. The film focuses on the charming, street-wise 12-year-old Ale, who lives on the fringes without any adult support or supervision except his boss (Rob Sowulski), owner of the Iron Triangle Garage. Polanco's performance is rough and a bit rough, but he has fully earned the standing ovations he received at the Cannes film premiere, along with a hug from the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami. Squeezed into a small room above the garage Ale is like his 16-year-old sister, Isamar (Isamar Gonzales), who works for the delivery of food from a lunch cart, one of the replaceable spare parts he deals with. In the city that never sleeps, he dreams of owning his own van food van, but he knows that the only thing that can make the "top of the pile" is another dented mudguard. In this environment, Ale and Isi have all the means to keep their heads above water, while their love for each other remains constant and they still laugh and live out the childhood that was never theirs. As Barack Obama says in his book "Dreams From My Father", the change can come later when their eyes stop laughing and they have something self-contained in them. In the meantime, Ale added to his revenue by selling candy bars in the crowded New York subway, along with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata), and sliding DVD discs on the street corners, while Isi lends trickery to the trucking industry. Drivers save enough money to buy the rusted $ 4500 van, where they hope to start their own business. <br /> <br /> Although Ale is a "good boy", he is not over the theft of purses and hubcaps in the parking lot of the Shea Stadium, events that Bahrani's camera observes without judgment. In Chop Shop, Bahrani has a compelling Antidote the underdog success stories produced by the Hollywood dream factory, and given us a film of overwhelming naturalism and respect for its characters, which in many ways resembles the great Italian neo-realist films and the recent Iranian works of Kiarostami, Panahi, and others. While the results of the characters are far from certain, Bahrani ensures that at Shea Stadium we see a huge billboard that reads, "Make dreams possible," and let's point out that in Rumi's phrase, the drum of the Realizing this promise "
