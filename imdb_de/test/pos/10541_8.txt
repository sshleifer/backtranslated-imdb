I know what you say: "Oh man, Pinochio is not scary!" but this movie goes far beyond a crazy pinochio. The story behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who strangely hangs from her doll Pinnochio and seems to be talking to her. The only strange thing is that nobody but her can hear the doll. In the end, it's a shocking revelation that will shock you like me too. Look at it. Try it.
