This is a great example of no Hollywood movie that is very thoughtful and moving and not without humor. Kevin McKidd and Paula Sage are outstanding. <br /> <br /> I actually saw it on late night TV and I can see why I missed it in the cinema. It's not the kind of movie that today's multi-screen "mega" cinemas show. <br /> <br /> I will search for the DVD. Not for those who prefer, the current trend for special effects and no story. If you liked the best-selling book, The Curious Incident of the Dog at Night, you'll enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best Scottish movies like "Small Faces" and "Trainspotting". All the movies in which Kevin McKidd plays. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
