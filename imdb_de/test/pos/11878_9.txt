What is not to like? <br /> <br /> I caught it again tonight and wondered how Hugh Bonneville captures the essence of Philip Larkin without resorting to tics and cartoons. <br /> <br /> There are many layers depicting the complexity of the main character and Hugh brings them to life. His prudish mother, his unresolved problems with his father and his inability to commit himself to a wife. <br /> <br /> His poetry is consistently interlinked and some scenes are contained in that he tells her the wife of a friend, whom he suggests later on, rather innocently, almost casually. It is not hard to see where his attraction was to the many women who fell in love with him (and knew each other to see him and continue to see him!). Cerebral, cheerful, jazz lover, faithful friend. It's always more than just a look, the women have gone beyond their baldness, numbness and myopia. And a beautifully nuanced idea of ​​Eileen Atkins as his mother is an added bonus. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
