There were many people who tried to make a movie that was identical to Heart of Darkness. Some movies are based on Heart of Darkness, like Apocalypse Now. In 1993, Nicholas Roeg made a film that was exactly the same as the book. Heart of Darkness The movie is almost identical to the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. Heart of Darkness is about the journey of a sailor named Marlow sailing along the Congo River to meet the super-rich ivory trader Mr. Kurz. The movie Heart of Darkness has the same beginning and attitude as the book. It takes place on a boat in the Thames, and Marlow tells the story to four other men on a boat called Nellie. The entire film is a flashback to Marlow's trip to Mr. Kurtz on the Congo. Marlow works for the Belgian company, which trades ivory along the Congo River. He talks about his account in the office of the company and all the cards he saw in the office. Marlow sets out on a steamer to Africa. He arrives at the Central Station, where he receives instructions from the Director-General. The general manager tells Marlow about Mr. Kurtz and the ivory trade that Marlow would take over. Marlow soon learns that CEO Kurtz does not like him because he fears Kurtz will replace him. Marlow has been waiting in the central station for months because his ship has been destroyed and repaired. Marlow sees the harsh treatment and enslavement in Africa while he is at the main train station. When the ship was finally repaired, Marlow, another African figure named Mfumu, and other crew members sailed the Marlow steamer for Mr. Kurtz. In the Congo they are attacked by African natives of the wilderness. When Marlow's crew is attacked by the African natives, they shoot and kill Mfumu. When Marlow finally arrives at Kurtz, he meets a Russian who explains the power and fame of Kurtz. Marlow is then led to Kurtz's dorm. There he sees many maps and pictures that Kurtz has painted. Finally, Kurtz enters the room and begins to tell Marlow about everything he has done in Africa, and he talks about his lover. Marlow soon learns that Kurtz is crazy because the Africans call him God. Marlow gets angry at the hardness and enslavement he sees in Africa. After Marlow has finally met Kurtz, Kurtz begins to die. While Kurtz lay on his deathbed, he called Marlow to his room. Kurtz's life begins to flash before his eyes, and his last words were "The terror, the terror". When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's fianc√©e, Marlow tells her that her last words were Kurtz, to hide the darkness in Kurtz's life. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it's full of action and mystery. The film is at times slow, but overall very interesting. Heart of Darkness will really enhance your mind and you will learn a lot about how to interpret different scenes.
