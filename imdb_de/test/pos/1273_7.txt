If Christopher Nolan had done Memento before the follow-up game, all the bugs in Follow would have been fixed. In Memento Nolan designed the switches in time. We could tell when it was the past, when it's up to date, and so on. However, Nolan experimented with it and it just does not work. Although he had a small budget and could not use colors (which Memento worked in a way), it was just too difficult to distinguish between the times. There is a function on the DVD that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order. I wanted to write my review after I saw it, so hopefully it would be more useful, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> You can not blame Nolan for not having any original ideas. A young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored and decides to follow random people on the street. He finds one, Cobb (Alex Haw), who interests him in particular. Soon, Bill befriends Cobb and goes with him when he breaks into houses and robs them. Then a naughty young blonde (Lucy Russell) enters, and the movie becomes even stranger from there. <br /> <br /> The end of the following is one of the most shocking ends I've ever seen. Sure, the Fight Club had an amazing ending, but the end of Folges End was amazing. I felt someone hit my head and got a concussion. Nolan has a good idea for good endings (well, maybe not, I could guess Insomnia from a mile away) and can really build a great story. Following may not be the easiest way to track or look at it, but it's such a finely crafted, original story with a shocking ending that you'll probably want to see all of your 70 minutes again. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for language and some violence.
