I was swept along in the series just as the sea would take hold of me. Although it started slowly, I found out that the realism of the ship's portrayal, the variety of characters, and the lively dialogue allowed me to observe. The protagonist was destined to be challenged, grow and change on this journey, and I wanted to be there. I was not disappointed. The series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in between, often in the same scene, the same breath. There was a wealth of emotional overlay, interaction and expression - relentless and compelling to watch. The movement of the ship added an almost imaginative component to the many scenes, which made the characters sick the next moment and added humor the next. Edmund Talbot is a complex character we do not like to see often. We may know where the captain or Mr. Prettiman is, but they are older men who get in their way. Talbot was young and arrogant, still learning and testing. He had difficulty getting on with others and making mistakes as a real person would, but he had a heart that could be touched, and that grew with every hard-learned experience. I appreciate the excellent characterization. It is too rare in movies and on TV.
