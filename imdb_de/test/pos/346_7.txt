"Meet Sherri ... for an evening full of pleasure and terror!" "Favorable special effects, cheesy lines, yep is the original movie from 1978." "Nurse Sherri". Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmond and Jill Jacobson as Sherri Martin and directed by Al Adamson. <br /> <br /> The film is about a bad old ghost who owns a nurse in a hospital. Then she starts killing doctors one after another. Acting was okay, but part of the acting was robot. The plot was good, but the sex scenes were just thrown in to get more views. The direction was bad, and the special effects looked like a drawing, the effects do not deceive anyone. The death scenes were pretty good, but the director mingled too many things that did not make sense, like the sex scenes, the nudity, the football player, and more. Overall, it's a good movie, but not the best. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
