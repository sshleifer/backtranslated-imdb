I looked at the perfect storm and thought about another film by Wolfgang Peterson, who is much better - this one. In The Line of Fire is a movie that is certainly not based on a true story. It has a great story with a great cast. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance as a scary killer with a grudge against the government he served only too well. Eastwood is good because the tortured intelligence and Russo are good for the eyes. If you have not seen it, definitely rent it or buy it like me. In any case, one of the best thrillers of the last decade. 9.10
