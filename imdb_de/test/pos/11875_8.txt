One night at McCOOLS / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> According to Harald Zwart, director of "One Night at McCool's", " This film "is a dark comedy about women's power over men and how a group of people can perceive different realities. It's the same story told from three different angles, and every time we tell the story, we try a little bit more about what actually happened, what nobody really knows. "One Night at McCool's" is the feature film debut of Zwart, an award-winning director of commercials and music videos, who began producing short films at the age of 8. I always get nervous when a director of commercials We've seen as many examples as these guys think they're producing another commercial or music video for television with their productions, and Zwart resists that tendency, starting in "One Night at McCool's." a certain humorous truth from a witty, complex script by the late Stan Seidel, though it's often a bit confusing. "One Night At McCool's" introduces three men who have their own experiences with one particular In some ways, this movie is the comedy version of "American Beauty," but in others it's a world apart. <br /> <br /> "One evening at McCool everything started, "explains each of the three men to his various listeners. There's Randy (Matt Dillon), a tender at the local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser), who stays until the store closes. Detective Dehling (John Goodman) arrives when the salon becomes the scene of the deceased friend's deadly wife, who is accordingly named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her while a person treats her unfriendly. He stands up for her, and before you can tell SEXY, they have violent sex and she moves in with him. At first, Randy hesitates: "The sex and the violence, all in one night? It's a bit much." But who could avert a jewel like jewel? Jewel changes the life of each of the three men. For Detective Dehling, she pulls him out of a hole of grief since his wife died. For Carl she lets him forget his loving family and his pretty little suburban home. For Randy she ignites some positive and negative fires that later persuade him to turn to a bingo batsman named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to put an end to their deceptive ways. <br /> <br /> It's interesting how the movie perceives the three different chronicles - even the costume of Jewel is relative to the man who tells the story. Dehling sees Jewel as a beautiful, fascinating gift from God. Carl sees Jewel as two sexy legs and a lot of cleavage. Randy is not sure what to make of her, an awakening for his otherwise boring way to nowhere. The most intriguing element in this film is Jewel himself, but always played by the ever-charming Liv Tyler ("Armageddon"). She is not really interested in the men, but what they can offer her. Their motives are all too simple, not truly devilish or evil. She is simply a young woman who learned from an early age that through her beauty she can get what she wants. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun with its material. "One Night at McCool's" uses most of his humorous ideas from the enthusiastic entertaining cast to their fierce, witty showdown. What makes the movie even funnier is the different view of the three men. The actors also have fun with their characters. Goodman is strangely bizarre; Reiser goes well with his confused, windy part; Douglas is smart and mysterious in one of the funniest performances in the film; Dillon gives his character an arrogant personality, even though Randy is a dull nobody; Liv Tyler is dazzling. She injects Jewel with the perfect amount of boastful charisma and enticing wit. She reminds us of Mena Suvari's intimate performance in American Beauty. <br /> <br /> "One Night at McCool's" is the first movie to come from Michael Douglas's new production company Furthur Films. It's a creative, real and sexy production. Along the way, we often get caught up in the curvy structure, but that's a natural reaction to a movie that purposely blends multiple angles into a single story. The film ends with a black and funny note. This is another of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way. the black comedy. Many films of this genre are either black or lustful. "One Night at McCool's" is one of the few that actually work. <br /> <br />
