The philosophical, meditative tone of this film makes it unique. I would give it 10 stars for it alone. But what struck me with particular force was what I may mistake for its art direction. Many of the interior shots show a rich mix of color blends, seemingly based on very conservative Munsell color model gradients and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the film probably unrealistic for contemporary eyes, but very nice for me as an aesthetic work in itself. I think this movie is truly unique to this quality, and if for no other reason does it deserve a full, careful, digital restoration. Fox, are you listening?
