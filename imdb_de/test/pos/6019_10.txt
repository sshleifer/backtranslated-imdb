This is undoubtedly one of my favorite musicals of all time. Bette Midler gets as close to the real magic on screen as anyone else except Gypsy Lee's stupid, bosomic, brave and very sinister mother. It evokes a sense of despair that is sometimes funny and tragic, but always sincere and beautiful. She is truly a pioneer without borders. This limit is discovered for the children. Who in turn has to forge his own in a world ruled by his domineering mother. <br /> <br /> This specific version is, as I understand it, in its entirety, including the brilliant choreography of Jerome Robbins and the original director's instructions.
