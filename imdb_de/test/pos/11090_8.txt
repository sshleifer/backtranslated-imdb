"Belief in the Great Other, as an invisible power structure that exists in the real, is the most succinct definition of paranoia." ?? Slavoj Zizek <br /> <br /> This is a review of "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman," two films by director John Schlesinger. <br /> <br /> Although Hitchcock and Lang were the "conspiracy thriller" of Hollywood, the genre did not thrive until the late '60s and' 70s with such films as "The Parallax View," "Z," "Marathon Man," "Capricorn One "," The Manchurian Candidate "," Three Days of the Condor "and" All Men of the President ". This was the era of Vietnam and Watergate, the public was deeply suspicious of all political leaders. <br /> <br /> In the 80's and early 90's, the genre stayed quiet until the TV series "X Files" came to life. With slogans such as "The Truth Is Out There" and "Trust No One," the series set in motion a world of massive conspiracies and government plans that the ordinary man faces at all sorts of ridiculously elaborated schemes. The only way out of the labyrinth? "Fight the future!" as the slogan of the last season of the series was announced. It was apparently our duty to sift through the labyrinth of information and discover an elusive "truth" that secured our own freedom. <br /> <br /> This trend ended with the upsurge of the Internet, and conspiracy thrillers that now give way to "conspiracy documentaries." The Internet generation has thrown together independent documentary films such as Loose Change and Zeitgeist, while Michael Moore tickled his audience in the mainstream with stuff like Fahrenheit 9/11. All of these documentary films believed in a "secret order," a cabal of wealthy politicians and business people committed to reducing human rights and enslaving the world. They strive to create a mono-myth that combines various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single, comprehensive narrative that explains the purpose and purpose and future of everything. <br /> <br /> This needs to "streamline narratives" make them "more efficient," reflected in the scientific community struggling to create a "grand unification theory" and ultimately a "theory of everything" to summarize everything from quantum mechanics to the special theory of relativity into a single comprehensive formula. <br /> <br /> So the "conspiracy thriller" is ultimately rooted in people's desire for control. The modern theme is one that shows complete cynicism towards the official institutions and at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies (an invisible other that pulls the strings). This seemingly contradictory combination of cynicism and faith is closely related to the downfall of the great Other. Their disappearance causes us to build another's (conspiracy) to avoid the unbearable freedom that causes their loss. Conversely, there is no need to take the Great Other seriously if we believe in another's Other. We can therefore show cynicism and faith alike. Man, then, tries to claim control of a wayward universe, to create a kind of paternal babysitter (be it God, a mathematical formula, a conspiracy theory, an explanation for violence, conspiracy, murder, war, etc.) who is Meaning and symbolic order delivers. The Great Other gives reassurance to the believer. It's a "lifestyle choice," like a religion whose place in the world depends on sheer irrationality. <br /> <br /> The problem with most "conspiratorial thrillers", from the innocent days of Hitchcock's "Topaz" to modern foods like "The Da Vinci Code", is twofold. First, they are not wrong in claiming that something is "wrong" among the "elites" or "best", but they are wrong when it comes to individualizing and personalizing social, collective and systemic processes. This means that this just is more a matter of personal morality than of social structures. Second and foremost, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that the Great Other simply does not exist. There is no symbolic order in which the threads are drawn. <br /> <br /> Some modern "conspirator thrillers" ("Eyes Wide Shut," "existence," etc.) confirm this with their distinctive lies, accidents, truths, and half truths, do not add up, make no sense, the real and the hyperreal, the truth and the desire, all blurry, no apparent zero point, but these are mostly films of intellectual directors. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman" are positively archaic compared to these modern "conspiracy thrillers". "Marathon Man" is a student (Dustin Hoffman) who is involved in the business of his big brother (Roy Scheider), which unfortunately has to do with spies, weapons, double agents, diamonds and evil Nazi dentists. Scheider is polite, Hoffman is excellent and Schlesinger meets us with some nice pictures (the unveiling of the Eiffel Tower is breathtaking), but the most interesting thing about the film is the way the different plotting lines overlap after an hour. Even then, it will take half an hour for things to make sense. Unfortunately, the film ends with a clichéd showdown between the villain and the good, all neatly resolved and explained. <br/> <br/> "The Falcon and the Snowman" is a bit more ambitious. Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton play two friends who sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. Hutton works with a civil protection contractor and smuggles information from his office into the hands of Penn, a small drug dealer who has no reservations about the KGB. Penn does so strictly for the money, while Hutton is disillusioned by the US government (especially trying to depose the Australian leader) and sells the secrets strictly because he hates his country's crimes and espionage activities. In other words, the film is a conspiracy that is undertaken in response to conspiracies. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man"? 7.9 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The Hawk and the Snowman" ?? 8/10 <br /> <br /> Apart from a weird slapstick car accident and its clichéd ending, "Marathon Man" is an effective thriller with several great scenes. "The Falcon and the Snowman" is even better. Penn has shown a memorable performance.
