Well, the sci-fi channel's original company made some pretty shitty movies (House of the Dead 2, All Souls Day, etc.), but if you got the job done completely by the horror lead actor / writer and now director Bruce Campbell Get one of the best damn TV independent horror movies ever made! I usually hate those movies, in my latest report, House of the Dead 2, I could not believe how awful the movie was! But somehow I liked this movie, which he likes very much. The violence is good, just like the black comedy in the movie. I recommend you to get it, a true masterpiece by Bruce Campbell! Now that there are only a few more lines left, I can say what I want to say about this film: IJAJKASIF YHJDJ NXD FNEHSD FHNCFNFVHS
