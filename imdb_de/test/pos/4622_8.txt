Many other viewers say that this is not a good movie because they feel it is not "realistic". How can it not be considered realistic? They believe that the incest part is not easy to understand, that it is not common. I can assure you that you have met more people than you believe an incest has occurred. Many of them will not come out and say it, and most of them are victims. In addition, many people are gay and still around, because no matter how much they would like to, they know that they are ridiculed and may even be abandoned. And tell me, how many children went to high school with whom she eventually got pregnant or had an eating disorder? I bet a lot, and though most pregnancy does not come from incest, it's still easy to refer to. Who can not relate to being an outsider or getting bullied? that happens all the time. and many viewers are probably studying education like Marcus. Being a stoner seems pretty common nowadays. So there are many things that you can identify with. More than the rest, no matter how popular you become, sometimes you feel invisible or alone, are not perceived or overlooked like the suicide victim. How can you not feel like you could get in touch with the movie? I think the movie may seem pointless to others, but I think it's important. It is an interesting way to show that suicide happens and to be aware. it comes from people who do not show their unfortunate thoughts, that's very surprising. The people who show problems there sometimes commit suicide, but when you hear about suicide, the one who suspects usually runs through the heads of most people. <br /> <br /> The end surprised me, I did not expect it The girl that was to the end was mostly an extra in the scenes, not even imagined. The story, even in its description, states that there are approximately six teenage lives, though it was actually seven. My only real disappointment was that we were not among the characters we could learn about. The movie was pointless to see if the real victim was just a random chick. until I thought more. It made perfect sense to be a big surprise, because suicides are like that. And who should choose who had the other students had more reasons than the others. <br /> <br /> Although this film has some bad points, most films have some, but I would recommend this movie. as long as you can deal with the tragic moments of suicide and violence and obscenities shown in this film.
