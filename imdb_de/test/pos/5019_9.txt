Why should this movie be so good, but bring in only an estimated $ 95 million and NO prize nominations? John Travolta knows what he is doing. He knows he is Michael, a fuming, effeminate, magical archangel who has found shelter with a dying woman and is now in the car with the staff of The National Mirror and his dog Sparky on their way to Chicago. It then becomes a road trip that is both awful and great. I do not think that the death scenes (3 to be exact) make that a tearjerker. The soundtrack is the best with Heaven Is My Home, Up Around The Bend and Chains Of Fools. I have very high expectations and say that it should have had a little more respect in the 90s. Read my comment. Bye!
