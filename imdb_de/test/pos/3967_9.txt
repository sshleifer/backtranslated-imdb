Diora Baird is absolutely hot in this movie. But really all characters are amazingly fun. <br /> <br /> (MINOR SPOILERS) As usual, the main character B is the most reasonable. B has this crazy idea of ​​starting his own college when he's rejected by all the colleges he applies for. He is known for making fake ID cards. Therefore, a confirmation letter is not a problem. <br /> <br /> Because B's dad is a harsh @ $$ and is suspicious of the university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university. Sherman was admitted to a large college and fears being arrested for fraud. He's very fast witty lines, but his mistake is that he wants to be socially accepted too much. Glen, Hands and Rory are the three henchmen who follow B Glen has a zero on his SATs and has no trains of thought. He's always beating Battle Royals, but he's very good at making smoothies, which gets him a lot of hot girls. Hands was a great footballer who did not get the scholarship he was expecting, and turned to the craft to cover his lack of athletics. Rory has been preparing to travel to Yale since the first grade and has not been accepted. She spends her time meditating. <br /> <br /> Uncle Ben was my favorite character. Picture Lewis Black plays himself. If you have no reason to see this movie, you'll see Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. They are amazing. <br /> <br /> Monica is the love interest of a B. Since most of these stories are common, she is more popular than him and only notices him in the middle of the film. Unlike many other stories, however, B gets them and keeps them to the end. Monica is actually a good figure for herself, but of course she is there for B first and foremost. <br /> <br /> There are more supportive students at the college who are fun. The name of A. D. is self-explanatory and strangely ends in the meditation class. Kiki is a hot ex-stripper who goes to school head over heels and is finally in love with Glen. Maurice is a former military idiot who lost his G.I. Bill and wants to study rock'n'roll at school. The last guy is only known as a Freaky Student who thinks he can blow things up with his mind. They, who have little faith in him, wait until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bad guys are the dean of an opposing university, the president of the university of his student body, the friend of the president and the circle of friends. <br /> <br /> Every character is adorable. I think this movie has a good storyline and is well done, although many people say. Although the overall story is predictable, the characters let you guess and make the movie great. Watch this movie. I give 9 out of 10 points.
