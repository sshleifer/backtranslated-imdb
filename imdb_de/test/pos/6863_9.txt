I was shocked how good this German version of films like Scream was. It surpasses all modern American efforts in Slasher films. <br /> <br /> It's what all these movies do not do. Lovable characters, true mystery, suspense, graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This stylish horror movie is one of the best of its kind released in years. German cinema is getting stronger and stronger lately. It is a shame that more people do not see such films because they are missing. It is easily available on DVD, and even if you hate subtitles, you should see it in my opinion. It's going to be one of the best horror movies you'll see all year.
