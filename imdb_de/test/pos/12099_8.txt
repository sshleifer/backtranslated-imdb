German-born Turkish director Faith Akin captures in his film the infinite variety of different music and song styles in Istanbul, a city that bridges East and West, a city uniquely located on both sides of the Bosphorus in is Europe and in Asia. Kurdish sounds, represented by Aynur, who plays her own brand of Kurdish gospel music, passionate and melodic. We get acquainted with the instrumental instruments of the Roma, with Orhan Gencebay, who was called the Elvis of Arabesque music. Music can be heard everywhere in the city, while Faith Akin brings us to underground clubs, street performers and recording sessions. German bassist Alexander Hacke, who comes to Istanbul to play and learn Turkish music, quotes Confucius: "To understand the place, one has to listen to the music that he plays". Akin's fine documentation does just that - giving us 90 minutes of music that helps cross the bridges. The reputation of the film was particularly interesting for me as I recently visited Istanbul during my holiday and spent four days there. The city fascinated me with its images, colors, crowds, liveliness and visual beauty. Now I can add the sounds of music to the ever-changing Istanbul portrait.
