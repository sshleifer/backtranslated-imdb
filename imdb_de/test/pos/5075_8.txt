Most of this political thriller was featured as the biggest part of the mill movie, with a slightly better performance of many of the main characters, which was much appreciated until the BIG shoot and the powerful climax to the twists and turns of "Silence of the Lambs" recalled. or "The sixth sense". Reese Witherspoon as the desperate wife of the missing Egyptian husband and Yigal Naor as a heavily armed interrogator provide strong benefits. Unfortunately, Jake Gyllenhaal has a more two-dimensional character and has to grapple with a stereotypical portrayal of the emotionally torn CIA analyst previously featured in other films. Early on, the beautiful scene comes with an explosion that resembles a scene at the end of "Saving Private Ryan," the silent scene so effectively used to reflect a series of violence. The script also provides a little more insight into the mindset of the "enemy," but still does not give the audience much understanding so that the audience is once again flooded with stereotyped characteristics. Cinematography and photography are also somewhat disappointing because, unlike "Jarhead" or "Blackhawk Down", the clear, raw visceral presentation that makes it impossible for the audience to really be in the film is missing. There is a certain distance that keeps the audience from recognizing the intensity of the emotions that appear on the screen. Overall, however, the film eventually self-relieves and gives the audience an appreciable look at the complexity of the United States' rendering and the possible complications and consequences that may arise from its use. Eight out of ten stars.
