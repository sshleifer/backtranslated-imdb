I'm not particularly into "cop" movies, but this movie is supposedly a classic. When I found it cheap, I bought it and put it on a shelf just to look at it yesterday, and I liked it! Now you can have New York City, but as a backdrop for a movie like this, this is perfect in the winter months. Roy Scheider is a member of an elite police force called The Seven Ups, five men who fight crime in secret. In an opening scene, they fetch a shoebox full of money from an antique shop by distracting the crooks with a "bull in a china shop." But that's just the beginning. It seems that there are two types who pretend to be police and abduct mob types and consider them a ransom. Richard Lynch happens to be one of those sleaze bags and he's as scary as ever. When one of the Seven Ups posing as a limousine driver at a funeral gets his cover blown, he is beaten and stuffed into the trunk of a car, leading to one of the most exciting chases I've ever seen. Amazing how easy traffic is in NYC for chase scenes, but this is still amazing as Scheider follows the two kidnappers through the Bronx and then on a turnpike, and finally Scheider's car comes to a standstill in one of the most breathtaking finals of a chase scene I have ever seen. As the police officer is dying, Scheider and his men are under suspicion because the police commissioner knows so little about their activities that he wonders if they are being made kidnapped by gangsters. Of course, this kind of thinking has to be taken in the bud Scheider tirelessly got to the bottom of it. All in all a decent cop action / drama, not really my cup of tea, but I liked this. Look for Joe Spinell (Maniac) in a small role. 7 out of 10.
