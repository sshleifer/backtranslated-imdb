This is a very moving film about life itself. The challenges a disabled person faces in a country where perfection is expected will be visible and hopefully understandable to all. It should teach the bigots of society that we are all humans, and while some of us are gifted with one mind, one heart and one healthy body, there are decent people who exist in the world who are not so lucky or maybe we too. they are the unfortunates. We do not always see the beauty of the world because we are wrapped in our blind ambitions and only see in one light "what can this world do for me !!!". Maybe we all wish we were like radio, a loving, happy person ... who loves everyone.
