No music. No stupid masala. A fairly realistic representation of the police system in India and based on a true "encounter specialist" in India, Daya Nayak. This is Ab Tak 56 (56), symbolizing how many criminals have killed the leadership role of "Sadhu Agashe" - you already know that) - Brilliance radiates Nan Patekar in the role of a relaxed and calculating Indian policeman easily predictable, yet intriguing: another of Ram Gopal Verma's films The Factory, films that are either decent or really good, are almost very good by Ab Tak CHappan The 70 best films released in India, including commercial ones and artistic. <br /> <br /> What's great is that telling stories is more relaxed and eventually (in a Native American movie) showing how the police network works.The cast is really damn good But seriously, the one-liners are hellish funny (although I do not know if the subtitles seem funny). The producers are trying to release a Cannes release, which is very intere ssant is made by debut director Shamit Aman (I think that's his name). <br /> <br /> Again 55 years old Nana Patekar i He is brilliant at his stupid, screaming roles of the past, showing only what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good things. If you are interested in Indian films and are disgusted by the nonsense that some of our people are spilling, this is definitely a relief. <br /> <br /> Again, Patekar is the guy who likes to wear the movie on his shoulders and the epitome of the movie is the style of the movie - laid back, funny, intelligent and calculating. Good dialogue, good acting, all in all a good direction. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Ram Gopal Veras Company (both Indian films)
