This is a good movie and you probably will not be disappointed, but once again Roy Scheider, after making "French Connection", has a cop named "Buddy". They also use the catchy Wheelman from "Bullitt". At first, you think you've already seen the chase if you still remember his face. The chase is great, but as in many car film scenes, there are some technical and processing errors. Check "Puppet on a Chain" and "French Connection II" for more good, long and intense chases.
