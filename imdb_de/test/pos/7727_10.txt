I really enjoyed Carmen, better than Original Sin (Angelina Jolie & Antonio Bandaras), who have some thematic similarities and I really enjoyed them too. I felt the drama was stronger here (Paz Vega showed more reach, more fire and Sbaraglia was great too). All in all, their acting was grimmer and more believable (less dreamy than Original Sin, and both actors had less celebrity status and a pretty face they needed to rely on to make the film work). Vega definitely burns, like expected. <br /> <br /> Director Vincente Aranda has also created a detailed world (again better than Original Sin) where you can feel the filth and daily bustle of archaic Spain - for example, when people unload goods from a cart on the street, workers changing the candles of street lamps, all in the background of the action. <br /> <br /> While I'm very sympathetic to the recent idea of ​​redeeming the Femme Fatals (like Brian de Palmas Femme Fatale), Carmen is a poignant, modern interpretation of the tradition of the classic Noir classic Double Indemnity and represents a delightful one This is yet another fine example of the triumph of daring European cinema about glittering and safe Hollywood fare.
