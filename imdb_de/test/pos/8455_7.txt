All the right elements seemed to come together here to make this thriller an unforgettable experience for many years to come. They have the outstanding cast - Michael Douglas in an uncharacteristic "Free Spirit" role that has quite begun his film career. Fonda plays her typical, sincere wife, who does her part for the women's dragonfly, and Jack Lemmon is sure as we've ever been shown a man a crisis of confidence. Give them a hot-button topic about duplicating large companies, and that's encouraging for an upbeat, but when life imitates the arts as soon as possible, the dream of a marketing man is. <br /> <br /> The script is impressively taut and intelligent but mercifully limiting the jargon to a minimum, and the director has a real sense of sustained tension in the game as our three protagonists fight for the clock. If you like "whistleblowing" dramas, this is not quite as good as "The Insider", but the whole thing is more than nervous enough.
