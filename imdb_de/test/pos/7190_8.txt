I do not know the English version of this movie, but the Norwegian translation is the funniest movie I've seen in many years. The characters say so many funny things and make so many crazy references to current events that I'm surprised they had more and more options, like the architect, who can never really say the name of the magician Miraculix. It becomes things like Malcolm (i) X and "utenriks", which is Norwegian for foreign policy. <br /> <br /> Like the word "utenriks", many translations have no meaning in English, and probably not even in French, so the translators must have made their own jokes and done so well. Of course, they have a very good base to build on, with a movie that's funny from start to finish! <br /> <br /> Recommended in all languages ​​with good translation!
