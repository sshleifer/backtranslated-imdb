A few years before SCREAM had faked the genre Slasher / Horror with fake, self-confident young things that knew every trick in the book, what to do and what not to do in a precarious situation, a small film produced in Russia struck the Stage without grandiose claims. <br /> <br /> This movie was MUTE WITNESS. With a cast of unknowns (with the exception of a very short cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were supposed to be filmed eight years before the actual filming of this film), he told the story of the silly make-up artist Billie, who is working on a film in place Russia, produced and directed by her friend Andy. Unaware that the set was closed when she was about to retrieve her belongings, she stumbled unintentionally on a porn shoot that is extremely bloody. Overwhelmed with horror, she alerts the killers about her presence, a prosecution follows, and eventually she is rescued by Andy, who brings her home while alerting the police. The problem is ... there is no body, no proof that something similar has happened. Still, a mysterious inspector on Billie's side of the story seems to be ... <br /> <br /> And more to say would be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is the kind of film that requires a closer look at the sight, much like the most complicated, cleverest thriller, for as much as it is a convoluted thriller that is also responsible for films like WAIT UNTIL DARK and the best of Hitchcock's Choice of Camera cuts, dead humor, Americans reacting in foreign countries, where they are powerless, and exciting tension, until it looks as if something should snap. Even if the story becomes a bit too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the center of an even larger conspiracy, the film fails to outsmart the audience with cheap footage (for example, the sudden appearance of a person) Camera accompanied by a falling violin swarm), but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away. Very smart.
