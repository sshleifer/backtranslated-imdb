Although an idea was successful during these "golden days" of silent films, you could bet on your bottom dollar being repeated. although "reworking" is the term that is used. Of course, one could argue that this reworked business has never left us, for success in cinema or television is always a trend; With all competing parties who dared to fight with their own version of the said film or television program. <br /> <br /> We do not agree with this last premise; because that's copycatting or plagiarism, plain and simple. <br /> <br /> DIES, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, must have been well received; ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach / MGM, 1929) has not been reworked once on Roach Lot but twice over the next three years. We were treated with LAUGHING BLACK (Roach / MGM, 1931), in which the goat was replaced by a cute little doggie. In addition, the weather turns into the dead of winter in the midst of a blizzard. They also made other cast changes when Landlord Edgar Kennedy was replaced by Landlord Charlie Hall. The second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach / MGM, 1932), who replaced a female monkey from a disbanded and deceased circus, to which Stan and Babe belonged to former employees. The circus paid off its employees with their fortune, and the boys were given the chimpanzee's last payday. <br /> <br /> BACK to our original "victim", today's topic ANGORA LOVE. To remember? THE short starts easy enough. The boys meet the goat in the street and the nanny follows them back to their room. after Stan feeds her a donut. The following comic moments are created by the interplay of L & H and long-time distiller Edgar Kennedy, their landlord. The effects of the incident are compounded by the fact that the interaction takes place at night. And how lucky it would be; Your room is located directly above the lodging of the landlord. <br /> <br /> In addition to the noise, the bathing of the goat, the smell and the suspicion of the landlord Edgar, that Laurel & Hardy illegally has another person in the room; We were most amused by a small throwing gag that the censors may have overlooked. While admonishing the boys about the noise they had made, reminding them of the house rules that unauthorized people stayed there overnight, regardless of their gender. ITS camera shot is taken from The Boy's room over his shoulder. He warns with Edgar in the hallway and in front of them; "Remember, this is a handsome facility!" Just as he says so, a lady in evening attire walks over and behind the Landlord; followed by a uniformed sailor swinging his hat forward POODLE SCHNITZ !!
