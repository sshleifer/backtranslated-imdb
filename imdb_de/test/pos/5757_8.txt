Bottom has been my favorite sitcom since I watched it on TV and the movie is even better when I'm a fan from below. I say that is a must !!! The plot is that Eddie and Ritchie operate a hotel called guest house paradise, but it's not all good for them when customers leave until a famous actress comes to stay there. They try best there to impress them cinema so buy this and you will wet yourself with laughter. also with Simon Peggi (shaun of the dead) and also bill neigh (love love) it might be that the box office does not look good or look like this on this website, but do not listen to them, buy this and me Swear she'll love it
