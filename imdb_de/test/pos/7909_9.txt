This 1955 Producers' showcase version of the musical Peter Pan starring Mary Martin has the benefit of showing off most of the original Broadway cast, including Kathleen Nolan as Wendy, who was a more natural actress than the girl she did for the color television game from 1960. It's a shame that most people are left with nothing black and white, because this past production appears in many ways in the IMDb lists when you put "Peter Pan" on the search engine! - is superior to the more cute color version that most people have seen. I received the original on disc and then edited it to make it look and sound better digitally. Well, when I put on the color version of 1960, it looks glaring in comparison. I suspect Mary Martin himself had undoubtedly preferred this original version of the 1955 b / w Producers' Showcase on TV. <br /> <br /> As an added benefit of the CD, I also got the original ad and the opening promotion. How far away the fifties seem now - such an innocent time compared to today. I miss it.
