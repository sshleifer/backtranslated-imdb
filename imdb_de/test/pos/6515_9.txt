Sally and Saint Anne is a very funny movie. The first time my mother told me about it, I was 7 years old, and Saint Anne was just the Saint I had for my Saint Communion. My mother knew that, so she told me to look it over with her. I've seen it many times, because it's really funny. Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith Show was there, and Sally's grandfather was the man who played Santa Claus in Miracle On 34th Street. So we also saw many actors in TV shows. There's a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house, and Sally tries to get St Anne to raise money so they can keep the house. This includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brian, who plays her older brother. This is a good and funny movie that I still love.
