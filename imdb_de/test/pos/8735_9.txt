Everyone told me to see "cactus flower", and I finally did. What a wonderful movie - the perfect meeting place for a Sunday night / Monday morning. Matthau and Hawn were good, but Ingrid Bergman really did make that movie - after all, it was really about her. The really great actors can do it all, and Miss Bergman proves it. It shows us - in a movie - a series of people being shown throughout their careers. The scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching. Even as the film came to its obvious conclusion, I cheered Miss Dickinson as if she were the Boston Red Sox. Luckily, she made (no pun intended) much better. ;)
