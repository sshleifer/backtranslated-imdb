The actors in this dark movie are truly credible and well-staffed. The quality of the camera work gives you the feeling that you are there. The script is intense and does not move. The plot lets you look a second time at the perspective gained from the end. We showed this movie to a small group of guests at the Gadsden Center for Cultural Arts. After the movie, every customer was eager to discuss the film, and one person called me the next day to say she was still "disturbed." As we limit the movie from the age of 18, I watch the movie with a youth group, as this is a very real portrayal of an ugly situation and sets the stage for great conversation.
