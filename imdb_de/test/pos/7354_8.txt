After the return of "horror movies" (come on Scream is not scary!), I did not have high hopes for this three-story, low-budget horror movie. But I was positively surprised! Man, that's scary !!! The first 2 stories are just awesome. The first about a new couple driving in their campervan in a dark forest when they meet a wild guy ... (watch movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man obsessed by a little girl who is home alone for one night ... I know it does not sound special, but it's scary. I promise you. The last story is not scary, but at least not bad. It's about a biker and a haunted house. In fact, the stories are based on real legends from the city (I think Kevin Williamson can also steal ideas). I'd say I'm the scariest horror movie with three short stories ever made!
