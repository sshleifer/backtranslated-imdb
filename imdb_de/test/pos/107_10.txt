Easily one of the best Indian films of all time. Granted, that does not say much (I made that conclusion after 15 minutes). But I can really say that fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Beautiful for its imagery. The best example I can give is the parallelism between the two female leads (Radha and Sita) and the eponymous characters in Hindu mythology. Sita, for example, is the wife of the revered Lord Ram. Legend has it that Ram subjugates his wife by running her through a fire to prove her purity. In response, Sita cries and leaves him to unite with her mother (the earth). This story has all sorts of crazy connections to the stories of the 2 Indian women (Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). The word "fire" suddenly has many meanings - marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood and probably a few others that I could not catch. <br /> <br /> Brilliant for its social overtones. Many who were offended by the premise for this film should indeed see fire first (eg, my mother, who really loved it). Why? For although fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. In other words, that's his strength, NOT his weakness. Traditional conservative social customs (whether Indian or Canadian or American or whatever) are useless if they enslave you. Gender roles and self-denial can both do that. <br /> <br /> These are the things I took with me after seeing a fire. Hats off to Deepa Mehta ??
