Definitely worth a rent! Good, clean family entertainment. My 4 and 5 year olds (and me) loved it. Keep them on the edge of their seats. I recommend parents to sit with their younger children to see this as it can be quite exciting for them. It's not too often that you find films that you can see with your children, and this is a rare find. Part of the drama / realism is sometimes not quite there, or maybe it's a bit hackneyed, but kids do not seem to notice or care, they love it. Parts are predictable, others not - like trying to find out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. The movie has no really scary / creepy things, and I doubt it will give the kids nightmares. It inspires children to dream. This is something we need to encourage and promote among our children. Rent and be blessed!
