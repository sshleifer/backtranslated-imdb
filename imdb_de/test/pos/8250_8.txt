A jewel of a British caprice comedy. Poor American slap Pinky Green (another bad guy, but this time an adorable guy) leaves a British jail and tries to go straight, but his maintenance job in a bank is too attractive for his never-reformed criminal friends from a really bad Ivan (David Niven in one of his last roles). Pinky resists, but the lure of all that money is just too much for him. Things are being riddled and re-rolled, and it's all enjoyable to look at. Jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career, but he has never played the same thing twice - this is just too adorable to hate him. Niven never played a slimmer evil, everywhere oil. We lost two good actors, I wish we had back.
