WrestleMania 6 took place on April 1, 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. <br /> <br /> Match 1: Rick Martel vs.. Koko B. Ware - It was a very solid opening game for that. Koko was always popular with fans, and by that time Martel was still a heel talent. In the end, Martel can capture the win in a pretty un-memorable match. <br /> <br /> Match 2: The Colossal Connection (Andre The Giant & Haku) (c) (with Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan) vs. Demolition (Ax & Smash) for the WWF Tag Team Championship - At this time Andres health was really terrible, so his performance was really nothing special. The amount is 100% per demolition in this game. In the end Haku is fixated and we have New Tag Team Champions. After the match, Andre turns off Haku and Heenan and turns around, which turns out to be his last wrestle mania. <br /> <br /> Match 3: Earthquack vs Hercules - Very short match. Big dominant heels were very popular at the time. REST IN PEACE. to both men in the game. John Tenta (earthquake) leaked not too long ago, as did Hercules. In the end, Earthquake commits Hercules to victory. <br /> <br /> Match 4: Mr. Perfect vs. Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake - The first really good match of the night. REST IN PEACE. to Curt Henning (Mr. Perfect). Really sound back and forth from both talented guys. In the end, Brutus gets the victory thanks to a great support of his fans during the game. <br /> <br /> Match 5: 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper vs. Bad News Brown - No technical classic, but pretty decent brawl for WrestleMania. Piper comes out in a classic moment half black / half white. In the end, both boys fight with a double victory without a clear winner. <br /> <br /> Match 6: The Hart Foundation vs. the Bolsheviks - Complete Squash Match. The Hart Foundation wins easily. Surprising that WWE used to have a tag team division. <br /> <br /> Match 7: The Barbarian vs Tito Santana - Bobby Heenan's "Heenan Family" is better in this match as The Barbarian wins the win over Tito Santana. Not memorable, but good to look back years later. <br /> <br /> Match 8: Randy Savage & Sensational Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire - Great team fight between the sexes. Dusty Rhodes wears the uncomfortable polka dot outfit to the ring. In the end, Rhodes and Sapphire win over "The Macho King" and Sensational Queen Sherri. <br /> <br /> Match 9: The Rockers vs. the Orient Express - Surprisingly another tag team match. At that time, day wrestling was so much better. A young Shawn Michaels and his partner Marty Jannetty lose in this game against Orient Express. 10th Match: Dino Bravo vs. Jim Duggan - Duggan gets a decent reaction bauble despite his American patriot. Bravo, a member of Jimmy Hart's group, joins the ring with Hart and Earthquake. Although he has support, Duggan wins the victory. <br /> <br /> Match 11: "The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase (c) vs. Jake 'The Snake' Roberts for the Million Dollar Championship - The first major event of the night. Roberts was extreme with the fans. The game was pretty good for what it was. DiBiase can win a victory against Roberts. But Roberts owns DiBiase's money and gives it away. <br /> <br /> Match 12: The Big Boss Man vs. Akeem (Slick) - One Man Gang's sad attempt to be an African dream named Akeem. A really short game that took a little more time to develop as a game. Boss Man wins with a slam. <br /> <br /> Match 13: Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka vs. Rick Rude - Heenan gets in the ring with Rude for this match. Snuka, I never did it well at WrestleMania. He always seemed to be at the end. After only 5 minutes Rude wins the victory over Snuka. <br /> <br /> Game 14: WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior - Called "The Ultimate Challenge", we get some interesting promos from both men earlier in the night. The match was actually very good because people think that Hogan can not wrestle. Many near-falls that really brought the crowd and the people watching at home. In the end, Warrior wins the Hogan win and wins both titles. A stunned crowd watches as Hulk Hogan suffers his first defeat at WrestleMania.
