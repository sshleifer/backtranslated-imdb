I recently took part in Sundance, as I have often done in the past few years, and I was treated to the small pleasures of the nervous little indies, the flood of dark comedies and the now predictable portraits of malfunctions. But then I saw Mark and Michael Poland's "Northfork" and remembered why I fell in love with the movies so much. "Northfork" sweeps the canvas with visionary daring and points to the seminal early work of Terence Malick and the existential landscapes of Antonioni. It's an impossible movie that can be easily explained, which is one of its many strengths. Suffice to say that it is a fairy tale for adults with many carefully layered levels of meaning. It awoke my imagination and cast an imposing shadow on all the other films I've seen this year. It is a careful craftsmanship and a refinement of writing that is not seen in most American films. I plan to visit this movie several times when it comes to my neighborhood theater. For it is a beguiling piece of magic and mystery, a haunting work of roaming the plains of Montana in search of angels and the nature of heaven and earth. The cast leads this luminous piece with striking conviction, most notably James Woods and Nick Nolte, who remind us of the nerves and daring they have shown throughout their careers. Perhaps 'Northfork' is helping us to find a new wave of American cinema in which great craftsmanship and writing skills become more of a norm than an exception. See it when it comes on its way and take your friends with you, because the questions will be numerous, and the thoughts and feelings evoked by 'Northfork' will bring back memories of a great movie, once in a lifetime Their past was Polish brothers.
