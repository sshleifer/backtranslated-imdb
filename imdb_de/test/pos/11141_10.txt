I loved this movie because Bobbie Phillips really can fight! I always hate when actors are not credible on plot parts. It was great to see, not an insult, but a woman skilled in martial arts and martial arts. If you compare this to most action movies with women, you will definitely see what I mean. You do not have to work with someone who can fight, and it flows better. I was very impressed. I hope there is more!
