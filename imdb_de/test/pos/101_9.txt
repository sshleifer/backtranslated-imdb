This is a very, very strange movie ... one that is so weird that it's best to see it for yourself. The film begins with a demolished professor who insults his class because the students have the audacity to not be as brilliant as he is! It is easy to see that this man is a total cynic - to find the value of practically nothing but to cling to his inner self-esteem. In addition, he seems tired and bored by the monotony of life. Later in the film, he goes into a bank robbery and can annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head. Strangely, this is only half of the movie, and a very bizarre narrative of the last seconds of his life followed. Then the movie gets exciting because the style of the narrative resembles a novel by this literary professor - one who is smartly written and says things the way we wish we could all say them. <br /> <br /> See this funny movie - it's amazingly captivating and not like anything I've ever seen before.
