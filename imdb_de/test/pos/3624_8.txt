I hope Spike Milligan can see and enjoy this movie from his seat on Heaven's Comedian throne, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have brought along a book that the author himself wrote "almost went insane". <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the Irish city of Puckoon and the problems that have arisen in the separation of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which breaks through the village center and breaks through the middle of the more troubling cemetery. Some of the deceased, who are buried in the Catholic cemetery, are now in the Protestant north. Therefore, the local priest, supported by a large number of eccentric locals, wants to bring the bodies back under the darkness, thus avoiding the bureaucratic British border guards. <br /> <br /> It was inspired by the work of playing the Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes as Madigan. He brings an innocence to the fore, especially in his objects in front of the camera (where he usually interacts with the spokesman for Richard Attenborough, who allegedly plays the director / director of the film). Daragh O'Malley, who plays Father Rudden, is also worth a lot of praise. and the rest of the cast, from the well-known names like Elliott Gould and Griff Rhys Jones, to people normally referred to as "small parts" - like Spike's daughter Jane, who plays Madigan's wife, does not give 100% to the wonderful ones Characterizations that Spike gave in the original book. <br /> <br /> I could argue that the movie is a little too long or that Elliott Gould's Irish accent leaves something to be desired, but that would only be of minor importance and does not detract from the excellence of this film.
