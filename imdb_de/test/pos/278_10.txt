This is a very moving film that takes a new turn in a place where we all were: a relationship that is about to end. Kristen Thomson's performance as Tessa, who desperately tries to keep her connection to Bobby for just one more day, is extremely compelling and moving and leads you straight into the story. Who was not yet confronted with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to cry crying: "Only one more night!" If he gives her one more night, the journey that these two people share will make you stop and think about how valuable any really close relationship can be and how each, whether permanent or otherwise, should be treated with respect and not just thrown away.
