If you only see one Ernest movie in your life, do it here! This is by far the best in the series, with uninterrupted laughter and smart humor suitable for all ages. The other "Ernest" movies have been good too, but most people tend to get tired of them quickly (but not me.) Murderer The murderer Nash happens to look exactly like our grumpy hero Ernest. Mr. Nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by putting him out of the traffic, so we can see Ernest reacting in the slammer. If you have not seen it yet, look at it!
