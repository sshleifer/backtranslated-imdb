This movie was not a great movie, but definitely a good movie to see with your family, especially with kids 10-15 years old. In this film good discussion topics are discussed, eg. As bullying, the environment and working to get things right. Jimmy Buffet's music was a plus and the scenery was wonderful ... The young actors were excellent and this is a movie I would expect on the Family Channel or the Hallmark Channel. Apart from a few words in dialogue, a middle school could show this film to begin discussions in the classroom. Hopefully it will be shown in Drive-Ins this summer so more people can see it. It followed Carl Hiassens book well and it was fun to see him in a cameo performance.
