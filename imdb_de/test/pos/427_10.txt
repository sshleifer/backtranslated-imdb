I've only seen three episodes of Hack with David Morse, and it looks like I've missed 37 episodes! Well, that's when ITV 3 displays them in chronological order. I just saw 'Misty Blue' (Episode 38). I really enjoyed the 3 episodes, but then I'm a David Morse fan (especially St. Elsewhere). Hack is excellent for anyone who reads this. Too bad that it will air on ITV 3. The cast is strong, although I can not get used to the idea that David is playing a bent policeman. Nevertheless, we all know that he is the good who is wrongfully accused. I see Gary Cole has guest actor, what happened to "Midnight Caller"? I'm just wondering if Hack is (still) available on DVD. I love it. Cheers.
