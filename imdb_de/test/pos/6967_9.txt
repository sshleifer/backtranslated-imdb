Ghoulies 4 is a pretty scary sequel. The Ghoulies look very different than the first three Ghoulies, but still cool. There are some nice flashbacks from Ghoulies the first movie. Jonathan is back in this. However, he was not in Part 2 or 3. The movie is at times low, but fun. They have Tony Cox as Dark Ghoulie and Arturo Gil as Light Ghoulie. The ghoulies in this movie are actually good guys, rather than evil as in the first three movies. Both Ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie. Then you have the very hot Alexandra! It's a great dark comedy and funny! Any fan of Ghoulies films can watch Ghoulies 4. The DVD will be released in July 2007! Hopefully, Ghoulies III will one day be released on DVD in the US. I would also like to see a sequel to this movie someday. I doubt it will happen anyway. It is now 2007 and still no sign of a sequel. If there is ever a sequel, I hope Jim Wynorski will make it. <br /> <br /> I enter Ghoulies IV 9/10
