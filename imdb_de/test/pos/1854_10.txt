I've just seen this train for the fifth or sixth time and I'm still in love with it. I still have to cry and sing, care and celebrate. <br /> <br /> I almost wrote a letter to Bonnie Hunt telling her how much I love him. David Duchovny's mourning scene is really real !!! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when Duchovny says, "I miss Elizabeth, but I'm hurting for Grace." Oh man! I'm crying, just thinking about it. ALSO ... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are such a perfect couple in Chicago! I know her I swear! I'm related to them, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> This movie is shot three times a year !!! I would see it once a week, but I'm afraid I would get used to it too much !!! I always want to make it a special day when I see it !!
