This is a great comedy that highlights what it was like to live next to racist Bigot. But it also shows that both main characters are actually so bad. Based on the hit ITV comedy, this is not politically correct. And it's even better for him, comedy is to entertain. The real drawback of the movies is that there is not much plot. The cast, however, is as good as usual. Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker form a damn big team that play each other out in a way. It has been many years since I saw this movie and last week I finally got it on DVD. The fact that the film still contains real laughing moments means that I can recommend this film, just as I would in the 70s.
