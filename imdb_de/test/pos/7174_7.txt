On June 22, 1941, the city of Przemysl, Poland, is divided between German and Russian. When the German invades the city, the Nazis send the Jews to a ghetto. The young Catholic Fusia Podgorska (Kellie Martin), alone with her young sister, houses and hides many Jews in her attic for two and a half years until the end of the war. "Hidden in Silence" is another good story of human sympathy during World War II. This movie looks like "Savior: Stories of Courage" and is based on a true story. Unfortunately, actress Kellie Martin plays a strong and powerful protagonist, but she is very weak for such a role. In many dramatic situations, the expression of her face can not convince. I've found many IMDb users liked their performance, but I'm not sure they really like their wonderful character or performance. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ocultos no Medo" ("Concealed in fear")
