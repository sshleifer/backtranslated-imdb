When I saw this movie for the first time, I was just a kid, and I fell in love with it, they really do not make any more movies, I look a little older now and still love it. <br /> <br /> The humor is perfect and fits in well with the movie, all the jokes are kind of childish but will make adults laugh, and in a children's movie that's really rare. <br /> <br /> The animation is amazing and watching hand-drawn animations is a real touch of fresh computer animation we see today. The backgrounds are stunning and the color scheme is amazing. <br /> <br /> The characters are exactly the characters you fall in love with as soon as you start watching girls think the chipmunks are adorable and the guys the chipettes are really sexy somehow. <br /> <br /> The songs are also fun, and some just like to cry or get up and dance. It's also fun to look at visual humor to accompany it. <br /> <br /> The Voice Acting is undoubtedly great, even though most of the voice acts have high pitch, but it turned out to be an interesting thing and it was one of the songs from this movie, but it slowed down and the real voices showed behind them and it's really fun to watch. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a shop or other place to rent, I say it is really worth seeing and a perfect family movie. It's absolutely amazing, words can not express this movie.
