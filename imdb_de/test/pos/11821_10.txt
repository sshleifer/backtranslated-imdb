I had seen The Cure when I was a kid, and I loved it then. Well, years later, I almost accidentally got a copy and looked at it again. As a child, you do not really have the ability to procure the things you want, usually a parental privilege - but when I looked at it again, I was sorry that I was not trying to get a copy of this film at that time, and has almost forgotten it to this day. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful movie. It tells the story of an unlikely friendship between a hardened, inappropriate child - distracted from his terrible, abusive mother - and his neighbor, a slightly younger boy suffering from AIDS. <br /> <br /> you say. Another one of "those". A tear wanker. A bucket movie. A moral tail. Yes, I know, I hate them too. Only this is not. It's one of the few films I've ever seen that leads to a very rare trick: it conveys a really sad story (and yes, a moral story), but without a single moment of being cheesy or in any way feels "hollywoody" in other words. It shows a REAL relationship between two REAL boys who interact like REAL children. And through this interaction, the good-natured, affectionate character of the older boy, Eric, seems to shine through his person with the "tough guy," while taking on some sort of fraternal care for Dexter, his HIV-positive younger neighbor. Together they embark on an adventure to find a cure - which seems to be Erik just around the corner - so that all this dumb AIDS thing will disappear and they can be friends forever. <br /> <br /> The production is first class. But what really carries this movie are, of course, the performances of the two main roles - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Above all Mazzello, who is simply mind-blowing - he gives a sense of infirmity that a sick boy needs, but at the same time he manages to make Dexter a truly energetic and determined character. He shines in the spot where the boys face pony: his urge to protect his older friend pushes him forward, forcing him to say what he says - and only then is the horror on his face portrayed as he realizes what he himself said is true: his blood is poison ... Renfro also has his moments, especially the scenes with his mother: he shows perfectly how this macho, a street-wise boy, is completely frozen and deaf when he is with confronted by his abusive, storming mother. and can not intervene to contradict her, as she forbids his relationship with the sick boy out of fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also performs a remarkable performance as Dexter's mother, who eventually becomes a mother figure to Erik. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in America when I was at school and I loved it - not at all about movies of this kind. But the kids' behavior in this movie was so real, that I could relate to them easily. Ironically, the teacher who showed us this film (a wonderful woman, I'm still in contact with her) got into trouble when a cocky parent complained that he had the scene where the two boys were a playboy consider ... pathetic. Seriously, Americans will ever get over this ridiculous phobia, I do not know. There was a barely distinguishable recording of a Playboy cover in the movie and so it is not shown in schools ... how sad. Children have to see this movie. It's more inspiring and instructive than all the "official" after school specials. Oh, and something else. I know that I'm walking, but still ... The score. It is great. I am a musician and as such I know Dave Grusin of his records: He is a well-known jazz pianist and record producer. Until this movie I really did not know that he also made film scores, although later I found out that I had unknowingly seen several films he had been working on. Really a wonderful job. <br /> <br /> All in all a solid ten. I would recommend this movie to anyone. And I'll definitely see it with my younger siblings - they can use a movie like this one under the usual special effects hysteria they normally see.
