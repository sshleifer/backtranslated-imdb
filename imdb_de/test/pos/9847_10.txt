It's the best actor's movie I've ever seen. All artists are old Turkish theater actors, they are great in this movie. It is sometimes said that "they do not act, they live it", you can really see that in this movie. The director is also competent, you can not see many moving cameras, but the positions of the cameras are also good. But after acting, the content of the film is the most outstanding part. It gives people happiness, enthusiasm, lust for life and the meaning of real friends. We all started to live one by one today, in this movie you can see that there is someone other than us. And above all, you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is the love of loving your friends and loving your darling. All people should see this movie ...
