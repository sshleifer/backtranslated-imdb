Richard Abernethie, a very wealthy man, has died and his relatives have gathered for his funeral. At the funeral party, Abernathie's youngest sister is Cora Galaccio. Although Cora has not come from the family for at least 20 years, everyone agrees that Cora has always been a bit different. When Cora says something about Abemethie's murder, most people laugh it off as one of Cora's eccentricities. But obviously someone takes Cora seriously. The next day, Cora is found dead in her bed after being severely beaten. Is there a connection between the two deaths? It's up to Hercule Poirot to find a murderer. <br /> <br /> After the Funeral is one of the best compiled episodes of the entire Poirot series. I have always been a fan of this particular Agatha Christie book. As far as I remember, the film is as faithful to Christie's source material as any other contribution by Poirot. The mystery is first class with many clues, suspects and red herrings. And as I've already written, I always enjoy a Christie story in which Hercule Poirot gathers everyone in a saloon for the final revelation. It may be old-fashioned, but that's the way I like it. Beyond the plot, technical and artistic After the Funeral is a winner. Sets, editing, directing and cinematography are as good as in one of these films. The spectacle is equally impressive. I expect from David Suchet as Poirot a gratifying performance and he does not disappoint here. The rest of the cast is equally strong, with Monica Dolan being particularly notable. Apart from a small problem with the fast way in which the characters are introduced, I have no real complaints. It's a good show everywhere.
