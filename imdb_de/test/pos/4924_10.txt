Although it's not the first movie I've bought for myself, this is certainly the movie I've seen most. The animation was well-drawn by the Tokyo Movie Shinsa experts, and the animators often used clever techniques, such as causing the sun to "lens flare", soaking the camera (and the "camera operation" cleaning the lens!). etc. While the film was avoided becoming an "animator's gadget feast," the judicious but generous use of such techniques gave the film a "more realistic" feel than the typical cartoon. <br /> <br /> History has many interwoven acts that seemingly have little to do with each other until everything comes together in the end, in a way the authors selfishly admit. Each of the great storylines has its own musical theme, ranging from "Pop goes the weasel" [Hamton & Plucky] to the love theme "Romeo and Juliet" [Fifi & Johnny]. The transitions between the lines of action are slightly different, but consistent. <br /> <br /> Really a wonderful movie; There is not much original music, though the new lyrics to "Spinning Song" are smart and enjoyable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
