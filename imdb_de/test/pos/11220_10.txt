I loved the movie "Northfork". I did not know anything about the movie before I saw it. Therefore, I had no influence or outside information to show myself on the screen what I saw. In retrospect, I would advise everyone who is interested in the film to watch it, if only from the high-quality actors. Do not read anything about the plot, the story or the rating of the movie. Stop reading in my comments, though I believe they are general and would not ruin the movie. I do not want to reduce the value of the movie. Find your own meaning path in this movie or it is limited in its potential. <br /> <br /> In general, I found the three benign strangers in Northfolk confusing. As the film evolves, they may qualify as three entertaining refugees from a mental hospital, or the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish boy or three angels who find the "lost angel." The sick and perhaps dying boy tries the three "strangers "to persuade them to give up the search for the lost angel, to become his guardians (mother and father), and to take him safely away from Northfork (at least 1000 miles). He even explains that he is the lost angel who tries to manipulate them all to be his guardian. Only one of the three reacts positively to the boy. The other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this commitment. <br /> <br /> The priest who cares for the sick boy shows deep concern for the people and a deep conviction of his faith. He transcends the devastation and emptiness of Northfork and its people; He is the light of good and hope for both Northfork and the movie viewer. Near the climax of the movie, the boy and the new guard travel across land to a field where an airplane is waiting. They go aboard to find the other two strangers on the plane; In fact, one is the pilot. The engines start and the plane takes off. <br /> <br /> Who are the 3 strangers? If only one stranger was interested in helping the boy, why were all three on the plane? Where is the plane going? Did the other two find the "Lost Angel"? Is there a lost angel and if so, who is it? Who are the six men dressed like funeral directors? If all these are just the feverish dreams of the sick boy, how was one of the three strangers to help one of the men who dressed like a mortician when he jumped and struck his head (neither the boy nor the strangers had contact with them men)? <br /> <br /> One or two sentences written under the title telling people what this film is about is a tragic mistake (this is not a spoiler, it's just a statement about advertising). So if you have not seen the movie Northfork, the questions above will only show you some of the interesting and funny forks on the road of thought as you watch the movie Northfork. If you've read the commercial summary of the plot of the movie before you've seen it before, you should look at some of the questions above and have a look again ... I know I'll do it. <br /> <br /> Terry
