Rated with TV-14 for sexual content and language. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing about this show in 1998 when she was on the Teletoon channel. I did not see her then, but now she continues to play the channel, Razer. I've seen about four episodes of this show and I have to say it's pretty smart and funny. <br /> <br /> The show features Jason Alexander von Seinfeld and Tim Curry of Rocky Horror's Picture Show and It Fame. The show is about a duck who is a police officer. He basically does his job as a police officer, coping with personal problems. This show is sometimes quite funny and fans of the comedy will like that.
