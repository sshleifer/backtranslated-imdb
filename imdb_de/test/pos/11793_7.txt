ALICE is the kind of movie they made in the 30s and 40s. Never try to be an "event". Will only entertain. And it does. I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland. In a role that could be a clich√©, he has made it true. The plot makes allusions to ALICE IN WONDERLAND. A white-dressed guy walks through a hole and jaw drops one. Like ALICE, the plot revolves, but with a freshness not seen in small films. I loved the director, Sutherland, just a very quick and interesting movie.
