I have to warn you, there are some spoilers in there. But first of all, I got "Spanish judges" in February, I think. It was mentioned that it was the last copy, but I see it was not reordered. But anyway, I have it. I liked it. I wanted to see it mostly because of the great actor Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised no one mentions the scar in the reviews), even though it's a kind of low budget. It would be worth having enough money to make this movie. Man, what a good actor. <br /> <br /> The story of a competitor named Jack (Matthew Lillard) who claims to have been called "Spanish Judge". If you do not know what Spanish judges are or have not seen the trailer, and this is the first review you have read, I will not even say what they are. I think it would be a big turn because nobody knew what it was. He needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also crooks, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) and a rogue known as Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who will not tell anyone her name because she's from Mars, she said. So call her (mainly Jack) "Mars Girl". It all starts well, but then it becomes a big game. A game that brings with it some lust, lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There was a lot about acting (Matt and Valeria and Tamara did not belong). There were scenes that could have done better, and the score could have been a little better. Some points were actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. The fight scene at the end could have been a bit longer and a little bit heavier, but what can you do? Another comment to Matt: Damn, he plays a smooth, smooth cheater. <br /> <br /> I know this is a review, but I have to make a correction towards NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino not a freshman According to this site, she has been acting as an actress since 1983. For me and hopefully for others, she is known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in the two "Hot Shots!" Movies. But good review. <br /> <br /> Although I think it's one of the rare movies I've seen that is really good (which is why I gave it a 10-star rating), I'll give the mark of what I thought when I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
