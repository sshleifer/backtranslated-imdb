When I saw Flatliners for the first time, I was astonished. It had all the necessary qualities of a good movie: The cast was outstanding, the plot was superb, and in the case of thrillers, there was definitely "thrill." <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland did a great job as a male lead actor in the play, depicting a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and bringing him back to life awakening, essentially "stealing" the secrets of death. Kevin Bacon performs excellently as the morally decent counterpart to Keifer, while Julia Roberts represents her most compelling role. William Baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and apparently has intercourse. And in another outstanding performance, Oliver Platt represents the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent. <br /> <br /> The story is relatively simple but original, and the acting is refreshing - definitely an outstanding point of film for the genre and one who set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
