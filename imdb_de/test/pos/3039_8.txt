Not only do I think that this is the best movie Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but also a real tribute to teachers. <br /> <br /> Despite unbelievable adversity, Pat Conroy (Voight) achieved this by reaching a group of students and bringing them from scratch to a basic education and a world consciousness. His methods have been criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs such as Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners for him he has not exaggerated the role and I found him absolutely credible. Voight is Conrack. <br /> <br /> In addition to the love of teaching, we see another important point in this film. No matter how good you are in your job, if you rock the boat, the bureaucrats will get you.
