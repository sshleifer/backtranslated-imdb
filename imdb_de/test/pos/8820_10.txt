Michael Sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant portrayal of a weird genius. If you are familiar with Kenneth Williams manners and diaries, this drama captures the essence of them perfectly. When I read how Kenneth sucked in his swimming trunks, I laughed and then it came to life on the canvas, but this time I did not laugh because it was put into perspective as the actions of an oppressed and tortured man. It must have been such a lonely existence in Kenneth's skin that demanded attention, but avoided it when it really mattered! The last 20 minutes are heartbreaking as you see Kenneth gradually sinking into the depths of despair, considering suicide as the only alternative. I've seen it a dozen times and still cry uncontrollably at the point where he commands LOUIE Goodnight. I can not recommend this drama enough. Sexually explicit, but it makes it clear that Kenneth could not let anyone penetrate into his world and here lies the grief of the man. For a genius that made so many happy, it is a shame that his private life was filled with such despair and sadness. Pauly
