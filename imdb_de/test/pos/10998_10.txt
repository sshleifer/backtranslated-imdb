When I saw the movie for the first time, I found it cute - a family movie. For the rest of the night and over the next few days, however, smart moments and funny lines crept into my thoughts and into our conversation. Malick's plot is simply hysterical. Called it a "feel-good movie," the joke and the fun are rejected - it's smarter than it seems, just like "It's a Wonderful Life."
