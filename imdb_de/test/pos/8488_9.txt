A few days ago I saw the fantastic "House of Sand and Fog" and I was impressed by the amazing performance of Ben Kingsley in the lead role. I chose Ray and tried to understand how and why Ben Kingsley did not win the Oscar for Best Actor. After seeing Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles, I agree with the Academy: it really deserves to be honored. I like Ray Charles, I was not his fan, but it's amazing how Jamie Foxx is with him. The film is fully supported by Jamie Foxx, who participates in most of the shootings, and his moves on stage look like he's a reincarnation of Ray Charles. In terms of history, I saw the extended version on DVD, too long but also very pleasant, with lots of beautiful songs and scenes that mainly show a junkie Ray Charles. My biggest surprise was that Ray Charles was dependent on the heroine and how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ray"
