This movie is 80's and I like it so much. It superbly conveys the feeling of this odd decade. The reality that Russian nuclear weapons could obliterate you at any time. Reagan in the White House told everyone that things were great as more and more social programs were cut. Young people broke out, but not as far as their 1960s parents. Young people still went to school, they just smoked so much dope that their sentience was almost dead. Nothing affected her, not even the death of one of her classmates by one of her friends. How strange it is to realize that the murder was wrong, but you do not know exactly why. Seeing how the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and tells of a very sick society. Glover is great, Keanu is great, Hopper is amazing. One of the most memorable movies I have ever seen.
