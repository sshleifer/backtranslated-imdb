** SPOILERS ** Looking for a little more excitement as the crocodiles at local wildlife reserve sisters Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn & Maeve Dermody, are fed together with Grace's friend Adam, Andy Rodoreda, they opt for a trip to the Desert and abandoned, human-inhabited, Australian mangrove forests. <br /> <br /> With their swamp leader Jimmy, Ben Oxenbuld, at the helm of his motorized boat, the four are swarmed by a giant saltwater crocodile that quickly snaps at another, terrifying Jimmy along with him. Grace Pat and Adam land on a tree in the swamp, and Pat hangs on his capsized boat. The rest of the movie has the hungry and determined crocodile, a cat-and-mouse game, or a crocodile and a human game with the trio ending in a showdown in a mud bank, right where the dead and dismembered body of Jimmy finally came to rest. <br /> <br /> Both the director and the actors of the film make full use of the swamp, sometimes making it far scarier than the giant crocodile that floats in it. We can only see the killer crocodile in the movie about half a dozen times, but each one of them beats you, and Jimmy Grace Pat & Adam lying in the stomach. <br /> <br /> Suspense has always kept them busy The huge reptile is always doing its damage from below, which is so unexpected that the Crock attack has much more effect if you do not see it coming in, like in the last ten minutes of the movie, if you do. Right from the start, you're asking yourself who would end up surviving the crocodile attacks and ultimately live to tell about them. The end of the human confrontation between Crocodile and Vrs was about the weakest and most unrealistic part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The crocodile, so docile and effective in the previous scenes, seemed to be beaten or swum. He himself had neither the strength nor the speed to grasp it with his deadly claws and finish the only survivor of the expedition. In fact, the killer pot was so ineffective that he could not hold on to it even after he had defeated his victim. This proved to be fatal for him in the end. <br /> <br /> Similar to "Jaws", the movie "Black Water" has the killer crocodile, like the great white shark in "Jaws", more interest kills its human prey and then eats it. With all the food available in the swamp and rivers where he lived in the crocodile, it was only the quartet Grace Pat Adam & Jimmy who invaded his water-rich region that he believed was the great rulers. And to dare, they had to pay with their lives!
