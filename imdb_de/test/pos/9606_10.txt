I've already seen that 99 and I remember that I loved it. To this day, I can remember parts of the movie in my head, like the pitch. Unfortunately, I could not remember the name since 99 until I had reviewed the filmography of a friend of my uncle and came across this (he played Clive Kennard). Immediately after reading the description, I knew what it was. After catching up, I was shocked to discover that it was not just publishing on video or DVD, but still needs to be repeated. This is a huge shame, I ask you to repeat ITV, repeat this great TV movie. Nick Hancock showed in this film that he can do more than just show with his character Mike Tonker. This is a movie that most football fans would love, and even those who are not interested in the sport can enjoy the comedic value of this movie. Yes, this is a short review, but there is not much to say, apart from this underrated film that deserves to be released repeatedly or on video / DVD. ITV, me and other fans of this movie ask you. PLEASE NOTE ONE OF THOSE!
