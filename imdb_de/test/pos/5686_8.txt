Black Water, co-directed by David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki, is very simple in its execution, yet effective. The film is an Australian low-budget movie that unfortunately does not get the recognition it deserves because, as far as creatures are concerned, this is one of the best there is. The setup is rather simple. Grace, her husband Adam and her younger sister Lee tour mangroves in the Northern Territory as a saltwater crocodile turns her boat around and leaves her in the trees. The whole movie is about survival while the crocodile lurks below waiting to strike. Unlike Greg McLeans Rogue (another killer crok movie released in early 2007), Black Water is not about having the audience having fun guessing who will be eaten next, hoping and praying that the three will People will come out for sure. <br /> <br /> The three unknown actors do a great job with quite demanding roles as they were filmed on site with a real crocodile instead of CGI. The characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue appears natural and not forced. The tension is built up throughout the movie, we do not see much of the creature, but just knowing it's nearby is scary enough. This is an absolute highlight and highly recommended if you like original and scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> 4/5
