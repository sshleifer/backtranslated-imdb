Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes resp. Watson, the second of the Universal series, in which is again recorded by a written prologue that the famous detective is legendary and spans time. This helps to make things comfortable here in the "present" era of the early 1940s. <br /> <br /> In this offering, Holmes goes through several different disguises (with the very salient features of Rathbone, is it likely that people really do not realize his true identity?), as he is a physicist before the Nazis as well protects against Holmes' best nemesis professor Moriarty (now played by Lionel Atwill). The scientist has developed a bomb sight that will greatly assist the air strike, and he has promised the British his plans. But Moriarty wants to get it so he can sell it to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> A good start, fueled by the participation of rogue Atwill, now cast as Moriarty (though George Zucco was no match on THE ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES). It's always fascinating to watch Holmes and his greatest enemy connecting witty banter ("the needle to the end, like, Holmes?").
