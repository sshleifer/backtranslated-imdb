As a film THE ITALIAN JOB is fine at best; good (not great) drama, <br /> <br /> nice visuals and tempo, a mediocre conspiracy, but nothing bad <br /> <br /> to go out. But as a car spot for the new generation of MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers, this movie is spectacular! <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Okay, that's typical Heist movie with the odd twist (underwater safe cracking was nice, though not unlikely), and the cast was pretty solid (with the exception of a lazy Wahlberg), but when everything came The real "stars" of this image were the three MINI Coopers in all their high-flying, fast-paced races, ramp jumping, slimming ball, gold drop, shinier new shine. The audience I was sitting in was actually "ooed" and "aahed" when Theron's little <br /> red number came on the screen for the first time (oddly enough, neither she nor <br /> brought Wahlberg the same reaction. <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie starts off promisingly and Mos Def, Seth Green, Donald Sutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham all start off as an interesting and humorous group of characters The only real uninspired performance is that of the normally good Mark Wahlberg, why he claims that this is his best movie I can not imagine, his <br /> <br /> character is complete monotonous and he plays him so mildly that it is as if Mr. Rogers had come back from the dead and inhabited his body. "Charlize is fine as Sutherland's daughter, though <br /> <br /> nothing magical Seth Green's character is perfect and the <br /> <br /> Napster jokes in progress (dar under a cameo from Napster founder, Shawn Fanning) are funny; he and some of the early <br /> <br /> lines from Mos Def add some much needed humor to humor. Unfortunately, Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland are not near the screen time. <br /> <br /> You can see the bulk of the action from a mile away, and the <br /> <br /> dialogue is full of bad ones and give-aways, but I doubt the <br / > <br /> Filmmakers wanted to reinvent the wheel here, so as a <br /> <br /> typical action / suspense strip it gets fixed. Worth seeing on a <br /> <br /> budget night I would recommend. <br /> <br /> 7/10. Gold is not worth it, but makes nice fillings.
