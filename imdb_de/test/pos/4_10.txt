Unfortunately, this film was under-represented, but it turned out to be really extraordinary. On entering the theater, I did not know anything about the movie, except that a friend wanted to see him. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the high quality of the film. I could not imagine Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance was a true example of his character. This film is extraordinary and deserves our financial support unlike many other films. It's not easy for me to recommend a movie, but in that case, I strongly recommend that everyone see it. <br /> <br /> This movie is really extraordinary!
