Irene Jacob is intriguing in this last episode of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as she combines all three films. I'm just overwhelmed by the amount of talent needed for one of these stories, let alone all three. Everything seems to fit so closely together, all elements of filmmaking are so eloquently executed and the end result is much larger than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic by nature and belongs to every list of great cinematic achievements. Just awesome!
