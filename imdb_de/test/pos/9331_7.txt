Music videos are often ignored in any film discussion, with most people assuming that they are a lesser form of art. While a large majority are just eye-catching clips to promote the latest hit single by a popular performer, a few are truly outstanding and become their own works of art (anything directed by Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry is always worth watching). While "art" is not exactly the word I would use to describe Michael Jackson's "Thriller (1983)", it's an extremely likeable mix of horror and music and an outrageously charming short film that's almost remarkably adorable for 25 years later. The thirteen-minute music video, which was both the longest and the most expensive at the time of its release, was directed by John Landis, a filmmaker I'm not so familiar with, though "The Blues Brothers (1980)" is a classic. and I hear that "An American Werewolf in London (1981)" is an incredibly entertaining horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> Whether or not 'Thriller' qualifies as a music video is debatable, however, it's not to be overlooked that Jackson's efforts with the 'Ghosts' of 1997 (38 minutes) and the fact that the title song is less than half the total duration. The video opens with a short movie inside a movie as Michael reveals to his girlfriend (Ola Ray) on a quiet and brightly lit night that he is "different" from other boys and turns into a vile werewolf. The nightly clouds are diverge to show the full moon. While presumably beheading the unfortunate heroine, we come across Michael and his girl in the cinema and actually watch this drama unfold in a horror image. When the girl is scared, both leave the cinema and head home, whereupon Michael starts to sing the first lines of his latest song "Thriller". However, when a bunch of bloodthirsty zombies emerge from the local cemetery (their entrance is scary told by Vincent Price), the situation starts to get interesting. Thriller 'is considered one of the biggest music videos. It can not be just that the song itself is a lot of fun, and Michael Jackson? although he has since become the joke of all comedians because of his peculiar personality and actions? There is no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer. A decent explanation for the popularity of the film is perhaps the incredible amount of work that needs to be put into this film. Nothing has ever been like it has ever been before, and there is still a curiosity in the world of music videos. The cruel monster makeup effects were developed by Rick Baker and are surprisingly graphic for a music clip, though everything is done with a lot of fun. A few moments provide an exciting excitement and successfully capture the atmosphere of the films he is parodying (albeit with a cheesy twist on the usual formula). Simply put, you'll never look at a zombie movie the same way!
