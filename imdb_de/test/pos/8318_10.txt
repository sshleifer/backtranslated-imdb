Walking With Dinosaurs is an amazing documentary that is of great interest to dinosaur ignoramuses as well as dinosaur lovers (like me). I admit, I was very young when I saw this on Discovery, but I was instantly obsessed with it. (Spoliers !!!!!) The series contains 6 episodes dating from the late Triassic, when the dinosaurs developed just before the late Cretaceous at the end of the reign of the dinosaurs. When I saw this movie for the first time, it was like I was really traveling back in time. The majesty of Diplodocus, the adventures of the Opthalmosaurus and the caring mother version of T-Rex surprised all my family and me. It's an amazing movie, and I think the BBC did exactly what they wanted to do. Impressive work!
