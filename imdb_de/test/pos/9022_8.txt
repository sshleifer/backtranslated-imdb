I love this movie. I first saw it about 10 hours ago and had to rewind it so my sister could see it. This movie is so funny. There were two times that I laughed so much that my pages hurt. I did not expect to watch a movie so funny; I just wanted to see it because Laura Fraser is there. I saw her for the first time in Titus, which is also a fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> As other critics have said, too many people expect a deeply moving movie. You will not get it. What you get is humor, eye candy, and the ability to wonder exactly what your perfect partner would look like if you could do it. You may also ask yourself what it would be like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> In a hilarious episode, Justine sees herself first as a naked man. I cracked. <br /> <br /> I swear this movie is the most imaginative teen movie I've ever seen, and now it's my favorite created; as entertainment not philosophy in motion. Remember and you will have a great time watching virtual sexuality.
