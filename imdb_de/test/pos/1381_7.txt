The rating '7' is not necessarily a smear - this movie was created on a low budget - but done well within the limits. <br /> <br /> A common boiler-kettle plot - a ship carrying a prisoner is destroyed in space, escaping humans and prisoners into pods and landing on an unknown planet where their presence wakes something up. Mayhem follows, it is consumed a lot of ammunition. <br /> <br /> The special effects were economical and well executed, highlighting the technology of the future with holographic displays and controls, rather than relying on voluminous, cheap-looking plastic supports. In addition, the tempo of the story moved, without the viewer getting bored, where he began to take things apart. <br /> <br /> I'll fix this as a light Saturday afternoon movie. You can get up and stop the refrigerator without a break, and it will still be enjoyable. Better yet, your girlfriend can talk through and through without affecting your enjoyment - and she'll be happy: after all, she talked to you! It's that kind of movie. Anyway, the real story has some holes after they hit the planet, but hey, this is an action movie from Guns 'n' Ammo. Consistent storylines are not essential as long as you have beer and chips at hand. So do not get over the end in a brain cramp.
