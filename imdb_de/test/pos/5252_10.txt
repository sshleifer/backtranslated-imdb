The lament and almost unbearable melancholy of the music of Amalia Rodriques goes to a place in the soul where only music can touch. In her voice and her magical presence lies the exquisite torment of Fado, an art form that I did not know until this film. <br /> <br /> For me, the success of this beautifully and lovingly designed documentary The fact that the filmmaker resists the temptation to work editorially leaves us easily absorbed in the magnetism and the elegant passion of this icon. There seems to be an inevitable correlation between the Portuguese Fado and the American Blues. <br /> <br /> The finest of documentary films takes us to a hitherto unknown reality. and after we get this insight, we are transformed. <br /> <br /> Abrigado, Sr. Almeida
