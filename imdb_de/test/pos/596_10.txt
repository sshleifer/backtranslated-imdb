I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with Muppets Sesame Street and only later realized how much effort and time was needed to bring those characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master of the Muppeteer. When I saw this movie the other day, I needed a while when I was younger and things were a lot easier. For this bit of time travel, I rate this movie as 10. <br /> <br /> The plot shows Kermit walking from marsh to Hollywood. The laughter and gags are classic Muppetism. I am glad that these films are still available for the next generation. I hope I will never let the magic of the Muppets grow.
