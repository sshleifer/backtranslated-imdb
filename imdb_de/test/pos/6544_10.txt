For those of you who have seen this picture on VHS, I would recommend the DVD. In fact, the VHS is total garbage. The main reason is that the film was shot in widescreen format (2.55: 1) and the producers did not have the money to make the VHS version and released them as 4: 3. The result is that several actors are not on the screen at all, and in many drag races less than half of the cars show up, as there is one on each side of the screen. The DVD is actually a sensible version of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many of the best scenes of the movie were cut before the final release. They were considered too insulting to minority groups. In fact, the prospect of a US release caused even more cuts in the film. For example, Americans supposedly did not understand words like Petrol & Strides. <br /> <br /> Mike's father and mother should be hippies. The father survives in the movie as a lavish dope smoking guitarist. But the following scene with the mother was cut. The scene took place in the roof area of ​​the house, which was filled with aluminum foil, fluorine lights and plants ... You get a picture. The producers had rolled up many real plants for the foreground, and when they saw the result on the big bow, they freaked out and the scene was cut. Cowards! <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is considered an Australian cult classic. In the best 100 films of all time on Street Machines No. 2, Mad Max II missed just barely. The latter had 10 times the ROE budget. In fact, the budget for ROE was so low that the director could not afford to ruin one of the cars ... even though there would have been a public outcry if someone had destroyed a real HO. (Compare that to Smoky and the Bandit or Blues Bros, where dozens of cars have been destroyed.) <br /> <br /> So there's a real GTHO and two fakes. One of the counterfeits was purchased by the local indigenous community in Cobar after the Standby GTHO crashed into the back of the Country Boy. (This was not scripted! The car should burst from the side of the truck.) Since the budget was so tight, the car was replaced with a normal brown masking tape, rather than the real object's gold painted decoration br /> <br / > The 55 chev is absolutely real. The car started as a very simple 4-door and was brilliantly and quickly rebuilt into the '55' in the movie '55 '. The engine was a marinated 545, which made about 1000 hp. This was reduced to around 600 for the shooting. The car could easily show in several scenes of the film up to 170 miles per hour. <br /> <br /> Just for the record: anyone with $ 12,000 could have picked up ALL cars after the movie. The HO, the Dodge, the 53er Ute, Rammer's 53 Chev ... the lot. Wonder where they are now? <br /> <br /> SW
