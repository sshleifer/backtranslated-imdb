Brown returned to his role from the previous year (in "Slaughter") for this rough episode film. In the original, he had avenged the murder of his parents by eradicating a huge mass organization in Mexico. Here he is pursued by a money launderer portrayed by McMahon (vergeltert). When the first assassination attempt fails, Brown is back in action, kicking the gangster all over the room and trying to protect his new girlfriend Hendry. While the original movie was a better and more coherent film overall, this film delivers all aspects of use in much higher doses, making it more enjoyable for fans of the genre. Apart from a rather dreary opening on horseback and a deadly car ride at night in a city street, this film is played out at a very lively pace. Every few minutes, one or more of the following options appear: drug use, sex, nudity, shootings, murder, or any other action. Brown is his usual dependable, amiable self, aided by his amazing physical presence, which clearly enhances any stiffness in his acting. McMahon is a rebellion! With tinted glasses and half hair (!) He shows instructions for his gangster and is overheard as he gives passionate love to his fur-clad bimbo. Seeing Johnny Carson's buddy in such a role is a perverse thrill. Stroud makes the impression of being a strong, racist bigot, while Peters has just a touch of class as a police officer who uses Brown's help. Unfortunately nothing is mentioned by Brown's original buddies Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown has a girlfriend (Hendry) who is sympathetic enough, but lacks the sensuality and personality that Stevens had before. Williams makes an impudent turn as pimp, who can seemingly pick any girl out of a bar and make her an instant member of his harem. The cinematography and overall direction are less polished than the first film, but it has a drive and a sense of danger that surpasses the feel of the original. The film spends a lot of time on the sewage of organized crime, drugs, prostitution and other vices, but remains interested in the creativity of its action scenes and the now frightening lack of political correctness. A strange note: A main supervisor of the first film was shown shot dead, but appears in a different role.
