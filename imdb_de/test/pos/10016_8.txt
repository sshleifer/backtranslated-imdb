I was surprised how much I liked that. Sure, it's a bit slow in parts, but what else would you expect from Rollin? There is also a lot of nudity, there's nothing wrong with that, especially since it includes a lot of the great Brigitte Lahaie. There are also some spectacular erotic female deads, perhaps a bit evasive but most effective. There's also a sci-fi-like storyline with a brief explanation at the end, but I would not care too much about it. No, here we have a very interesting exploration of the memory and the effect of memory loss and to what extent one "lives" without memory. David Cronenberg is featured on my DVD case, and although this may not be as good as his best films, there is a certain resemblance here, notably through the heavy use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of the interior. Since I've been trying to say that this is not an exciting thriller, it's a mesmerizing nightmare, like a movie making the most of its locations, including a stunning railroad backdrop at the end.
