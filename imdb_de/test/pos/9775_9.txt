Somehow, CHANGI lost to MY BROTHER JACK at the AFI Awards. The latter, a high-quality adaptation of George Johnston's immortal novel, was superb - but not as good as CHANGI in my opinion. I've heard that many critics dismiss CHANGI as irrelevant, unimportant, historically inaccurate, or even disrespectful. Who and where are these critics? CHANGI is outstanding. More than that. Brilliant. It should not be a documentary - certainly I can forgive the actual survivors of Changi (or even a POW camp survivor) for their disappointment with the production - but for the rest of us, CHANGI represents the remarkable power of partnership in times of extreme adversity. It contains a part of the Australian culture that seems to be easing when times are easier and less challenging, but we should never forget them: the Australians were respected worldwide for their comradeship and sense of humor after Gallipoli and World War II. Rating: 96/100. See also: GALLIPOLI; PARADISE ROAD; THE LAST BALL THE SUGAR FACTORY.
