Lt. Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship are washed ashore on an island by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). After some chance inmates, Rackham picks up Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Fortunately, Barbara Bach happens to be on the island as well! Unfortunately, there are some crazy fishermen who like to kill people. <br /> <br /> This exploiter produced in Italy seems to have it all - a touch of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON mixed with DR. MOREAU with a dash of WHITE ZOMBIE Voodoo and Atlantis. Despite some unusual-looking fishmonger costumes, the film benefits from beautiful location photography and a nice twist in half. All actors are good and Joseph Cotton even appears as an old biologist. Director Sergio Martino behaves well enough, as action takes place every 10 minutes. This can not be said for his belated follow-up THE FISHMEN AND THE QUEEN (1995), which is certainly one of the craziest and most outrageous sequels since HIGHLANDER II.
