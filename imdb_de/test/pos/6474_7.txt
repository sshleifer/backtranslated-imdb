Recently, Norway traveled from Bergen, Norway, and stopped in the small town of Voss, Norway, and there was a memorial in honor of Knute Rockne, who was born years ago in Voss. People all know about Knute until today and the tour guides are proud to stop at his monument. This movie is a great story of this great man and his great love for Notre Dame. Never knew that Knute has such great talents in chemistry and laboratory science, taught chemistry for years and trained at the same time the football team. Ronald Reagan played the role of George Gipp (The Gipper), who was an outstanding footballer; Reagan had a short role, but gave a great supporting role in this movie. Donald Crisp (Father John Callahan) was outstanding as a priest, who throughout his life in Notre Dame always had great faith in Knute. This is a great classic movie that many generations will see. Enjoy.
