Although I have not seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only someone with his talent would accept this daring topic - a comedy about Hitler. All great satire is based on going out on one edge. Even all the big comedies deal with the other side - pathos. This movie seems to frame both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove's The Great Dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is to laugh about it. And hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to see the world in a new light. Another movie that comes to my mind is Emir Kusturica's Underground and Fando And Lis. So, let me see the movie first.
