Any film that has a line of dialogue that looks something like this ... "Judy gets ready for her date, Butthole!" has to be good! I found the DVD not rated, unedited and was pleasantly surprised, there was a lot of work in this film. I actually enjoyed that more than many 80s movies that I've seen. Great addition to my film collection. <br /> <br /> The setup was great and ready to frighten the rest of the movie. Loved the GORE and the T & A. I never imagined that eyeballs that were dug out would look like a boil, the color of the eye spatter was disgusting! I keep thinking that "Rog" looked like Tiger Woods, but rather black, does anyone agree?
