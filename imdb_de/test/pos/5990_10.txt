This movie was released at about the same time as Pretty Woman. While the general theme is the same: The wealthy man meets and learns to love a poor working class, the characters of Romuald and Juliette are much lovable and worthy of our time with them. I have never forgotten her and I think that the movie Pretty Woman is superior in many ways. Juliette is a remarkable woman, and the clever way she helps her boss overcome his problems will delight you. The last scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in the romantic comedy. The efforts of Romuald to win the love of Juliette exceed the rickety climbing scene of Pretty Woman hundredfold. Watch this movie, it will warm your heart.
