A woodcutter finds a young cougar who needs help. Too young to be alone, the cat soon picks up the rough warehouse workers. Nicknamed "Good Time Charlie," everyone enjoys themselves first. His wild nature begins to cause trouble, and to reintroduce him into his natural habitat becomes an issue. This movie is one of the wonderful Disney wildlife movies that were in the 50s and 60s, often action, beautiful landscapes and a charming animal that charms you. These films were not long, but contained fascinating insights into the wildlife and the effects of human contact. Unlike Disney's animated talking animals, the animals in these films remained true to their own nature. Make great travel films to see the western states.
