Well, I'm a few days late, but what the hell? ....! Anyway, the word that best describes my reaction to "See No Evil" was .... SURPRISING. The movie is actually pretty good. There is definitely plenty of blood, blood and action with a modest amount of tension. It goes back to the good days of the contemporaries of the late 70s and early 80s. Remember "Madman" meets Leatherface with a shot of Norman Bates, and you get a good feel for this movie. While SNE is thin on the plot (which is mostly horror movies), he makes up for it in the manner of violence, blood, tension, and the fact that Kane plays the disturbed Jacob Goodnight very well. The title of the film comes from the fact that Jacob only looks at his victims with his fingers and keeps them in large glasses. Why?? You just have to look at it and see (pun intended). There are certain cinematic elements that come from other horror movies, especially Psycho, TCM and Madman, but they are not crass. After all, the SNE really does not go into an area that we have not seen for a long time. SNE is not a "punk" or "TCM 74", but it deserves a look imo. <br /> <br /> Recommendation by BloodStone: Join a matinee show on "See No Evil". Bloodstone's Rating: 7.5 / 10
