Although I fully agree with the previous commentary on Titta Di Girolamo's wonderful play by Toni Servillo, I would also like to add the beautiful filming and montage that make this film virtually a painting. The young director Paolo Sorrentino had the courage to experiment with different camera techniques, which reminded me of Darren Aronofsky's requiem for a dream. Both used the same MTV movies combined with modern (alternative / techno) music. Le Consequenze dell'Amore - stand out from the other crime / mafia films in their genre. Although the film may start at a very slow pace compared to the faster Hollywood productions, it should be enjoyed for its serenity, wonderful character representation, and glorious end. A must for anyone who likes European / Italian cinema. PS Toni continues to behave this way, we need an encore.
