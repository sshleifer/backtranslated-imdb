Let me say, I'm not a fan of this kind of movie right from the start, but Nightbreed has a certain fascination for me with a perspective on perspective. <br /> <br /> In the past, it was the people who inhabited Midian who would be called zombies, the undead. And from what Clive Barker has given us certain members of humanity, this Craig Sheffer has the potential to become part of this world. The psychiatrist David Cronenberg looks at first glance like the mild, professional-looking professional has taken a fanatical mission to rid the world of the nightbreed. He persuades the police to kill Sheffer, but Sheffer goes to a cemetery called the Midian Cemetery where the Nightbreed gather and live underground. <br /> <br /> Sheffer has also left behind a friend, Anne Bobby, who still has feelings for him even after he was killed and now belongs to the undead. She tries in her own way to be a bridge to humanity. <br /> <br /> The creatures of Clive Barker look pretty cruel and do not like people very much. But it's obvious that the Nightbreed, when left alone by humans, do not mind their turn. <br /> <br /> Her sympathy is definitely for the Nightbreed, especially after seeing a fanatic like Cronenberg and the police chief Charles Haid action. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker has been a gay man for some time and some have suggested that Nightbreed is a gay metaphor. I can see where that gets, especially since there are a lot of people who do not even think about gays, that they are human because they are being taught that way. <br /> <br /> Admitted nightbiting is pretty bloody with a lot of unfounded violence, but it makes you think too and I like the way Clive Barker turns traditional theology upside down and Craig Sheffer into a kind of Messiah for the Nightbreed creatures.
