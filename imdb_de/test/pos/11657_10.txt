The biggest effort plus the best cast ever put together by The Director Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon And Sean Penn in the front row. Somebody said that this movie is good because it was directed and written by Tim Robbins, but I can convince you that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon did a really great job in chasing my heart. Her acting is so real! No doubt that this movie is rated 4 and 3/4 out of 5!
