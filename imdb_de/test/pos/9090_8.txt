Flatliners contains all the ingredients for a good Joel Schumacher movie - intelligent, youthful characters, breathtaking cinematography, a gripping story and excellence. It's a fleeting fun, but it's done very well and has a positive spiritual message despite the worrying harbingers. <br /> <br /> Schumacher has a knack for finding talented young actors, and all five major players here have become bigger things (see cast list). Their credible performances help to raise this film above average. Kiefer Sutherland shines in his selfish med student role. <br /> <br /> The cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain, which I love about Schumacher. His use of light and location creates images that stick. It creates a disturbing, nightmarish atmosphere that makes you feel insecure while watching the movie and haunts you when you go to bed - reminding me of The Lost Boys. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that requires an amazing prerequisite - curious students I want to find out what happens after death, and successfully translate it into a fearsome, gripping story of salvation. One of Schumacher's best; highly recommended.
