I was surprised and touched by this emotional film that moved me very strangely. I was confused, sad and happy at the same time. I think too few people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least some will see it and make something out of it. The story of two friends linked by physical disabilities who (as a team) beat the medical health system and fight for their rights. This film shows a side that some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated, but emotionally portrayed. Hopefully, this film will help us better understand some of their desires and recognize the importance of having a friend in the world, especially if you can not express that fact.
