It took several insights to fully appreciate this film. At first I was impressed by the stylized sets, but the rest was slow and boring. I thought that such a sensational topic needed the Ken Russell treatment to outdo it. The forced restraint (put on the production by Mishimaa's widow) is now an advantage. Some of the quieter aspects of Mishima's life are repeated and dramatized by themes from his novels. I think it helps if you know the novels - that's what made the difference for me. I still have the feeling that the movie could be a little bit heavier and warmer overall, but it is truly unique and deserves serious attention. I love the fact that Japanese characters speak Japanese - not English. The Philip Glass score is fascinating.
