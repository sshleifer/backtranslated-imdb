The very first time I heard about the Latter Days was when I rented DVDs, and I was interested in being a member of the LDS Church. I found this film very warm and in some areas he made me cry. The reason for this is that many years ago I knew a young man who went through what Aaron (played by Steve Sandvoss) did on Latter Days, but unlike Aaron, this dear young man did not survive the ordeal. In the end he took his life after his church, his friends and his family because he was gay. There have been many people who do not believe that the things that are shown in the movie really do happen these days, but the pain and sadness is that they do. For those of you who are gay and young, you need to watch this movie, and if you are a gay Mormon, you must see this movie. When you receive the DVD, the DVD will help you out. The suicide of young people in the gay world is very disturbing and this movie touches him, but this part is hidden to some degree. The acting and the music is excellent. Although this movie was sold out every movie house, but only in larger cities and only to a very limited extent available. For those who want to watch this movie, I would recommend the DVD release. The only people I know who did not like the movie are members of my own church, and they did not see the movie because of the topic of gays and the LDS church. Watch the movie, experience the story and feel the emotions shown in this movie that you believe will not be disappointed.
