There is no action. There are no central signs. There are no moving cameras or close-ups. In fact, this film does not follow any of the traditional storytelling techniques used in mainstream film. However, Roy Andersson's Du Levande is a remarkable piece of film narrative. It's a touching look at the human psyche. <br /> <br /> Roy Andersson, consisting of a series of vignettes, offers an intimate glimpse into what makes us all human. In perfectly framed static shots, complemented by perfectly matched yet quirky music, Roy introduces us to a variety of characters in everyday life. Some bordering on tragic, other hilarious borders are taken on a Nordic journey like no other. <br /> <br /> It's a journey into the little things that make us human. Rather than excessive storytelling or visual techniques, everything is reduced to the essentials, so our focus is exclusively on the characters themselves. It focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are. our dreams, our despair. Through this simple observation of others, we can accept who we are as individuals. <br /> <br /> The washed-out colors and the fatally pale state of the figures only seem to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that they are different. We all live. There is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this movie, but you leave the cinema with a sense of life. Much more accessible than his previous film, second floor songs, Du Levande, is a truly inspirational piece of cinema.
