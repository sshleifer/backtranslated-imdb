This is a very successful film that shows the life of international students during their "Erasmus Year" in Barcelona, ​​which by the way is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and is an ideal place. <br /> <br /> The idea itself with all the different languages ​​is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries, but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their countries. <br /> <br /> I experienced "Erasmus" myself during my exchange semester in Italy and I can say that the film is incredibly authentic. I had a lot of experiences similar to those of the characters (except that I was not laid that often). The movie is also pretty funny, but not like all those stupid American college movies. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film also touches on some important topics such as the transition from student to working life / 10 (I am not very objective)
