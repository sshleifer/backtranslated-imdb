Obviously the previous reviewers are not fans of this genre here, but I think this album is pretty well done. <br /> <br /> It's twisted cute, clever and dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I fell in love with as a child. <br /> <br /> Also, I would like to watch some other Nadia films and many Youtube comments on how hot she is In this video. <br /> <br /> Sure, there's a Burton influence here, but I would not say Brad is trying to break it. <br /> <br /> He just jumps in and adds his talents to the genre I can appreciate. I like what he does and he does it well, says nuff!
