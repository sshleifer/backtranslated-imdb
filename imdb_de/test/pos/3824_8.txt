No, I did not see the original series and would not compare the two if I did. This series was shot in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well written every week in a different story. Some are few outside, but mostly it's the quality of the narrative. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a de-grogammer in a world where humans became slaves to a lizard reptile species. It's funny that the lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like V, but he has at least three days to program a man who is brainwashed in the brain of the alien species on Earth. The stories are usually a bit out of the way, but very entertaining.
