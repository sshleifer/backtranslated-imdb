Ingrid Bergman (Cleo Dulaine) has never been so beautiful. Gary Cooper as "Cleent" is as perfect as a laconic Texan who knows that this girl does not do any good. When the two eyes are closed on the French market, we know that this game will be full of sparks. Walking in her restored French Quarter House garden and playing the love theme is a dream for us romantics. <br /> <br /> The costumes are adorable; the sentence jewelery makes you wish, the "quarter" would be exactly like that. And that Saratoga still had this hotel with the wide veranda where all the old gossips were clapping. The novel by Edna Ferbers is about revenge for old injustice and the arguments about who trains the railways in the beginnings of this industry. <br /> <br /> In the scenes of Saratoga, Florence Bates steals every scene as a Grand Lady. <br /> <br /> But it's the scene where Cleo confronts her little lawyer. Relatives from New Orleans have sent her to buy her from this magical movie moment. After Cleo defeated him in the negotiations, he looks at her eagerly and says "May I say - you are very beautiful". And Cleo says with a happy, evil smile: "Yes, is not it happy?" They want to scream "YES". <br /> <br /> One of my favorite romantic movies.
