I really like the Show Surface. The show is very entertaining and it's a clean show. A showlike surface is interesting. It holds my attention. It has compassion and excitement. I love all the actors who are on the show. They are all very good decisions. I think it's very important to have the right cast of Any Show, because that makes every show a success and of course the scenes and the show itself. Television has changed so much over the years. It has changed in a good way and in bad. I like to watch comedy, action, suspense and romance. And scifi. But Surface is a show that I hope will return for many seasons, because it's a great show and families can see something. My children are grown-up, but my husband and I enjoy watching such shows. I appreciate your time and let me comment on my opinion. <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br /> Paulette Blackwell
