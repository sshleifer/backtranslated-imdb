Ali G became famous on the small screen - although the big screen did not cut him off either. Ali G Indahouse is a fun party to laugh in seconds - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or his stupidity, and behind all this no film is mindless. Ali reveals a human side in the movie. The idea that Ali G is running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is well mixed with the austere, harsh world of politics. The movie is also full of brilliant new characters. Instead of interview after interview, we get a real comedy movie that never gets boring or boring. Why did not I give it ten stars? Well, the end was funny, but also messed up and failed - none of it made sense. Partly the movie became offensive when he tried to be funny - but that's Ali G for you - if he's not offensive, he's not himself and he's totally and totally ruined. The big Screen debut of Ali G. was a success in my belief and should have fallen within IMDb in the average rating range of 6-7. But it could have been worse, and people have ambiguous opinions, especially about a movie like this one. <br /> <br /> On the whole, Ali G. Indahouse is a comical British comedy at its finest - and funniest and smartest. A great job! 9.10
