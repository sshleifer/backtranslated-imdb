I loved this movie, it was a great portrayal of a family that had a lot of ups and downs, but in the end, they knew they loved each other. I have seen many films with Jaclyn Smith, but my god was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago. This movie contained an All-Star cast, and most of all I loved that he opened my eyes to see other actors I have not seen yet. This movie was quite long, but I enjoyed every minute. It's a movie that you can sit and watch with your family, even though we have to cover the eyes of the children a few times because of the discretionary love scenes. Overall, I rate this movie at 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. The lifespan does not lift enough. So if anyone knows which store sells it, let me know, because this is a must.
