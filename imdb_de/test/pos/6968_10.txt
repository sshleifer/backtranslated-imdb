Okay, okay, I have to admit, I like Peter Liapis and I admit that this is not the best sequel to Ghoulies. I mean, yes, it had its shortcomings, like NO GHOULIES. But the two Ghoulies who came to Earth were really funny, I suppose, their names were Dark and Lite. I enjoyed the plot of the movie. And even at the end of the film, both Ghoulies hinted that there would be a sequel. Still waiting. lol. Peter Liapis repeated his role as Jonathan Graves, this time as a detective, how cute! Ghoulies IV may not be scary or exciting, but it's definitely funny. I thought I would comment on this movie and just say - it's not that bad. It is worth seeing, though the ghoulies are not there.
