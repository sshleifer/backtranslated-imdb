Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments in which Charlie joins the army to fight in WW1. First he goes to the training camp where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in the queue. This is a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping your feet straight! <br /> <br /> Next, you know he's in a ditch in France. One of the fun scenes is starving Charlie, who eats the cheese of a mousetrap and reads a letter from home over someone's shoulder. <br /> <br /> When Charlie goes to bed, he sees that his bunker is flooded and his roommate is snoring. That's such a funny part! I can not really describe it, just watch the movie. When Charlie wakes up, his legs feel numb, so he tries to wake her up. I had to roll on the floor when it turns out his second leg is still numb ... while Charlie is actually rubbing his roommate's foot! <br /> <br /> The movie then gets a bit grim as Charlie shoots some Germans out of his ditch (though it was done in a very funny way) and personify him as a tree to approach the enemy, to rescue a friend of his from a death squad. <br /> <br /> The last part is getting a French girl in trouble by hiding in her house. He then has to save her, catching the German Kaiser as well. For this he embodies a German colonel or something. I love it when Charlie is asked something in German and he is like no no no. The soldier looks at him funny, so Charlie changes his mind: yes yes yes! The Emperor is captured and Charlie is the hero ... but then he wakes up again in the Bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream! <br /> <br /> Charlie had one of those 'dream sequences' (The Bank comes to mind), but who cares? This movie was so funny that I had to laugh all the way. Chaplin also has something to say about this film (since his later work became more of a social commentary on several mishaps in the world) and is best explained in the last sentence of the film: "Peace on Earth, Good Will for All of Humanity. '<br /> <br /> In short: a classic by Charlie, very funny, timeless. 10.9.
