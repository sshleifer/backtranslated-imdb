I was fortunate enough to attend the London premiere of this film. Although I'm not a fan of British drama, the characters and the BAD CHOICES that made them deeply moved me. I was in tears at the end of the movie. Every scene was fascinating. The attention to detail and the excellent acting were quite impressive. <br /> <br /> I would have to agree with some other comments here that asked why all these women throw themselves on such a despicable character. > <br /> ******* SPOLIER ALERT ******** I had also hoped that Dylan would have been killed by William when he had the chance! **** END SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley has done a great job radiating beauty and innocence from the screen, but Sienna Miller's performance was really Oscar-worthy I'm sure this production is nominated for other awards.
