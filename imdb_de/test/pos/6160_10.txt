Nothing short of great photography / cinematography in this movie. The fact that you are constantly searching for and hoping for flying sequences tells you that you just have enough. The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly interwoven, and the dogs are great ............. <br /> <br /> A must see, rent or see. <Br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of subtitles ........ <br /> <br /> it's worth a little aversion therapy <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> < br />
