Reading the reviews of this wonderful BBC mini-series reminded me how much I liked it when it aired for the first time many years ago. At the time, I remembered the anticipated wait for the next episode and fell in love with John Bowe and Janet McTeer, two talented actors we do not see enough on television or cinema these days. <br /> <br /> I have been trying unsuccessfully to preserve some of the great BBC dramas of the past, including the 1973 version of Jane Eyre and the 1972 version of Anne of Green Gables, all wonderful timeless classic stories, which unfortunately is sad The BBC does not seem to have the intention to publish on video or DVD. If someone else learns, I would like to hear from them. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, we have to settle for our memories of how wonderful they were.
