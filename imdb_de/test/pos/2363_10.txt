I have just recently (last weekend) viewed and found it absolutely scary. Some scenes that I just could not stop laughing! Dennis is sooooooooooooooo fat sometimes and just says the dumbest things ... but at the same time, he's just cool to impress his girlfriend (who's going to be arrested anyway!) ! Not the greatest movie ever made, but certainly something to think of what to rent on a Saturday night when you're not as busy (like me). You may have to search for it - I was lucky because my local video store has it in stock.
