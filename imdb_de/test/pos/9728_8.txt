Robert Cummings, Laraine Day and Jean Muir play a 1940 movie starring Billie Burke in "And One Was Beautiful". At one hour and 15 minutes, this seems to have been a B-movie. Cummings is a playboy, Ridley Crane, whom many women wish, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Katherine is the Earthbound of the two, who likes to fix cars, and Helen is the blonde butterfly mother with the beautiful clothes. Ridley comes back to town, and Helen thinks he will not be at a party and decides not to attend. As the party is given by a family friend, her mother (Burke) sends Katherine in a high-waisted dress. Ridley is here and the two connect. But Ridley likes more superficiality and when he sees Helen at a dinner party, they pick up where they left off and go to a club. He gets terribly drunk, and Helen initially refuses to drive in his car because he does not let her drive. After walking awhile and breaking her heel, she gets into Ridley's car as he drives by. He falls off and she takes the wheel, accidentally hit a cyclist and killed. <br/> <br/> Ridley does not remember anything, so Helen blames him for his death. The heel of a women's shoe is in the car, and Katherine sees her sister burying her shoes. In addition, Helen becomes aware that Helen is not telling the truth. Ridley is convicted and goes to jail, and Helen marries a man she does not love and goes to South America. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, although at the time there was no A-list cast. Cummings plays a role that Robert Taylor played (it's an MGM movie) - he's pretty and very amiable, even if he does not have the dazzling looks of someone like Taylor. Laraine Day is a favorite actress of mine, somebody who borrowed MGM all the time because he did not know what to do with her. I'm wondering - a wonderful actress with a great face and a big voice, she has animated some movie. This is not different. Her Katherine is determined, sympathetic and totally amiable. Jean Muir is a lousy actress. <br /> <br /> So, who was the beautiful one? We all know ourselves, if not MGM. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended little gem.
