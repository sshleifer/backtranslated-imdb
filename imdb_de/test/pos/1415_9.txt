Stephen Hawking has one of the best minds, or if that's too easy to shape one of the most curious and courageous for him, he's also trapped in a body paralyzed by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer , to communicate . Maybe I did not know enough about Hawking when he went in (I always knew him as 'the guy who talks like a computer, who knows a lot about the universe and the stuff, you know'), that he's British, that he's rather an Englishman was a normal child and, perhaps most notably, the illness that might have killed him at the age of 21, puts him in a position to focus on his life. In a short history of the time, Hawking was already brilliant, in spurts (when other Oxford students were confronted with formidable algebraic equations, he answered more than three times as much in an hour), but, according to Errol Morris, it is equally curious and cool When faced with challenges, mostly from other scientists' other theories, he recovered with his own. Under some of the complex scientific lectures - and if you have less than a B - in astronomy like me, you have to keep your ears particularly exciting when it comes to the possible infinity of time or the peculiarities of the black hole a human being goes to just want to enjoy his goose on his birthday. Morris makes Hawking just right for those who can not get enough of his theories about how particles can go in and out of a black hole, or if there is a creator at all, depending on how much Einstein and time are taken into account , However, he also captures the background story about the man and his condition, which makes it a lot more interesting than if Morris had done one or the other. To talk too much about the cosmos would hurt your head and too much about your personal life, and you might wonder what all the excitement about this guy is, whose book title has been on the bestseller lists for over five years Almost in spite of his appearance, Hawking defines what it means to be a conscious entity in a universe that he says will not be separated from it, and if and when the universe goes down in another 10 billion years. In A Short History of Time we gain an insight into a genius and his humility through an unimaginable hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe (not to mention the ten cents of colleagues and his family here and there).
