I have not seen this movie for over 20 years, but it influenced me so much that I remember that I played the credits and a few more minutes in awe. This is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally published. I have just ordered a copy of it on DVD and paid for shipping overnight and can not wait for it to arrive. It is at times uplifting and also very dark and a bit disturbing. It's a story of a close-knit group of regular kids who grew up in the city center. It feels as if they are actually sitting on the edge, not looking at a movie screen or a TV. Hard to explain, but something has to be experienced. The story begins in childhood and traces the life of the four main characters through high school and their separate journeys. The entire cast has done an incredible job and is by far the best work in Jodi Thelen's career. I hope the DVD will be remembered and I look forward to seeing this Friday with a good friend.
