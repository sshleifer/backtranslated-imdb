Murder by Numbers is a pretty good movie. Although the storyline rolls at a snail's pace, mixing Sandra Bullock's character with her partner, and the film returns to an earlier trauma situation in which she found herself, the viewer manages to engage the viewer in the film. <br /> <br /> After saying that, I think it does a good job to create that weird sort of "who did it" atmosphere. One can only guess which of the boys was really behind the murder, if not both. I think Ryan Gosling and the other kid (lol) are doing a good job selling this relationship between Bully and Dork. I am not sure if Gosling is playing an asshole, but for a man who later plays in a movie like The Notebook, he did a pretty good job. Once the movie was shot, I was really involved in the story and kind of asked myself, "Oh my god, what would I do if I was in this situation?" Like I said, a good CSI movie, maybe not for the EXTREME Crime Drama movie junkie, but a good all-around movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
