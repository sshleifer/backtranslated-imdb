A real comedy. The dialogue is fast and very funny. Eleanor Parker at her physical climax. Since only Flynn can be a "charming villain" ... even though he is now past his Primus. Most scenes between the directors are short If you have not seen this movie, please take a look at it. You'll be surprised by Flynn's comedy timing. The scenes between him, Tucker, Parker and "Cudddles" Sakal, are hilarious. Only due to the outfits worn by the most attractive Parker, this movie is worth a look. The romance of the 1940s movie will not be lost to those watching films from Hollywood's golden past. My bet is that Never Say Goodbye will not disappoint.
