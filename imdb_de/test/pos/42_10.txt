This is one of those movies you just do not want to quit. The characters are rich as a well-woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters attract you and tell a story of the people who lived in a boarding house in the past decades around the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young man is being absorbed by a dynamic, generous woman who runs the house, and these are stories based on his experiences. It was done so well. S. Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as a nanny and she brings so much life into this role. They want to be directly among their guests. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie so much that I bought the DVD.
