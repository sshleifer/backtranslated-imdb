I had the great pleasure of recently seeing this beautifully filmed widespread adaptation of the 1943 revival stage (which was in contrast to the original 1935 production), which included extensive recitatives. This was the fashion of the time, which is why the movie was blamed for a 16-year tradition. The film should be seen, if only for Sammy Davis Jrs a brilliant, kitsch performance as Sportin 'Life sneaking in and out of the shadows. His seduction of Dorothy Dadridges BESS "There's a boat going to New York soon" is one of many highlights. Almost all the main music is intact and beautifully sung. It's certainly never boring what the latest versions of PBS and MET have done. It was a pleasure to see that time has not reduced the film, and hopefully it will be available in the near future for the generations who have not had a chance to experience it yet.
