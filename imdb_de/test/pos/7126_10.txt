I laughed so much most of the time that people stared at me because they did not hear my laughter. I literally fell out of my seat at some point. <br /> <br /> I'm a bartender and bouncer to live in the real world (note my use of the term "real world", unfortunately it always has to come first), and if I tell someone that I am RPGs, then usually one of two questions follows: 1. What, like D & D? I played that in junior high. <br /> <br /> 2. "Yes, really?" I have always searched or a group forever! Room for another? Very rarely do people not know what D & D and gaming are. <br /> <br /> That it has been said that almost anyone who watches this movie can get some. Even if you are not a gamer, there is a chance that there is something in your life that can easily make fun of "Geek Out", and that alone means that you are in with the hijinx in this movie Can connect. In one and a half hours, it's just carefree luck.
