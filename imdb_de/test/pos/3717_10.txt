Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which brought us Werner Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness". Le Dernier Combat is not "Sci Fi". It is more like a judgment. I've seen it at least a dozen times. It is indeed a fitting companion to Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness": "And in this time men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them." One day unfortunately today in Iraq. <br /> <br /> But back to Le Dernier Combat, watch the last second of the movie. I would not call it a "surprise end," but it's something you'll miss if you just assume that the end will not be more than what you've already seen.
