I rented this movie without having heard or read about it. Pity! This movie is intelligent, funny, funny, fast and realistic ridiculous. The characters manage to evolve without relying on clich√©d, tired stereotypes. It was refreshing to look at. I could not help thinking that marketing would have helped bring this not so mainstream movie to the craving for intelligent comedy mainstream. The quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors perform a wide variety of awkwardness, heartbreak and comedy is so rare these days - I felt that the actors really enjoyed participating in such a rich thing. How come National Treasure was number one at the box office three weeks in a row - it's too weak to mention. I think I'm just happy that movies like "Seeing .." are still out there somewhere.
