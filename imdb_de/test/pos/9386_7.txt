As Roger Corman said in an interview, low-budget filmmaking allows filmmakers to come up with unusual ideas. Well, it would be hard for you to find a movie as powerful on the offbeat as George Barry's "Deathbed: The Bed That Eats." The film has a backstory. and that's interesting. I refrain from passing on any details so you can hear them yourself if you take the opportunity. Suffice to say that the piece of furniture has an insatiable hunger and consumes the careless with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acid. <br /> <br /> "Death Bed" is an eerie, agonizing little streak that plays its absurd premise beyond the usual range of funfair prices. It occupies its own dream world so that I could take it seriously. It's a really strange and unconventional horror movie. It competes with exploitative ingredients - there are some delicious stupidities of female nudity - and yet it's art too, albeit art with totally distorted sensitivity. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not too bad for movies on a microscopic budget, and Barry gives the film a good and atmospheric "midnight movie" quality. The cast from the cast is as uninspired as one might imagine, although Patrick Spence-Thomas, as an artist / narrator, provides a considerable amount of gravitas and a particular point of interest is to see a familiar face at hand: the future "Boy Meets World" father William Russ! <br /> <br /> This film might not even have found the little cult he would have had if there had been no pirated people making the rounds; This certainly has to be considered one of the cases where such a practice ultimately helped the film - even if the exposure took years. <br /> <br /> If you have a predilection for truly bizarre, obscure items, "deathbed" could be just what you have in mind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
