If you enjoy tension, this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina is a damper adds to their unhappiness and increases the tension. The look of Alec Guiness was nice, but did not really add to the movie. I'm not sure if Evan Richard's role as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add humor, or if he was just an idiot. I found the cinematography excellent. This not only contributed to the quality of the production, but also to the tension. The bath with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful. Also, the scene where the knife shuts down and then changes to Andy Clarke, who cuts an extremely rare piece of meat, was very well done. I would call it good entertainment overall
