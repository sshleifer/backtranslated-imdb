This surprised me. <br /> <br /> I read a couple of reviews in the run-up that described him as a good B grade film and prepared for the worst. Halfway, I suddenly realized that I was completely enclosed in it and really enjoyed it. There were some really tense moments when you nervously fumbled with the remote or another object within reach. Overall, this movie definitely does not deserve the B-Grade day. <br /> <br /> Director Gary Ellis and authors Bill Boatman & Todd King must be honored for their film debut. I hope these people will continue with bigger budgets and some studio support.
