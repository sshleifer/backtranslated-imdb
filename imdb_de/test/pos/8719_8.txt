Another "oldie but goody" from about the same time as "Out of Towners" is "Cactus Flower" with a great cast: Goldie Hawn, in her first pre-facelift, Ingrid Bergman in one of her later and always funny Walter Matthau. The story is about a dentist pretending to be married to have an excuse for not marrying his girlfriend, which requires a fictitious wife to be used as evidence. He gets his spinster receptionist (Bergman) to take over the role, leading to numerous comic catastrophes and surprising romantic twists. It's in the same vein as the comedies by Doris Day / Rock Hunter. Fans of those - like me - will like this movie. if not, do not bother.
