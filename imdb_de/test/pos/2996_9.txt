When I saw this movie for the first time on video in a department store, it fascinated me. Considering the fact that I thought I was in love and I was the same age as the teenagers in this movie (although I realize that they are now old enough to be my parents), plus the soundtrack that Elton has John & Bernie wrote Taupin just before they were "big" here in North America ... I thought I had nothing to lose. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> So far I've shown it to a lot of people I've met ever since, and my current friend ... obviously they did not like it as much as I did. .. rather a "chick" movie ... but I still laugh and cry. This movie was heavily overlooked. It's nice to see that it's nearby to rent in one of the local video stores so other people can share the magic. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a bit far-fetched ... but it gives you a carefree feeling of innocence ... and a new belief in love.
