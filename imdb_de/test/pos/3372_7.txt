The creator of Donnie Darko brings you a story about the twilight zone of the strangest fashion. The film revolves around a middle-aged young couple who lived from 1976 paychecks to paychecks. One day a mysterious box with a red button appears. Later that day, a scary gentleman shows up and tells them that they have a choice to press the button and get a million dollars, but someone they do not know will die. It is a disturbing and provocative question, which is presented excitingly in the trailer and TV spots. But let it know that you do not know what you want until you see it. Sometimes overbearing and a bit melodramatic, the film is ultimately effective because of its good performances and fascinating topics. It would be unfair to ruin one of the twists of the plot for you, but let's just say the film will not deliver the aspects you expect and the ones it outlines. There is a lot of obvious symbolism and subtext in the film that is both interesting and annoying, as this was not so obvious in his other superior film, Donnie Darko. There's not much else to say without ruining the movie for you. it is to inspire a lot of caf√© chatter afterwards. But I also want to say that it was shot well and has a properly aged look and is worth watching. Listen.
