Peter Lorre presents one of his best achievements as a Hungarian watchmaker who comes to the United States to rebuild his life and one day bring his girl across the pond to be with him. Lorre's infectious optimism and bright outlook look very effective, which makes the performance all the better if he brutally burned his face in a hotel fire and if no one gives him the chance to work, reluctantly turning to a criminal life. Lorre's reach as an actor is seldom as obvious as in this film with his cheerful, good-natured immigrant, his depressing, melancholy, disfigured self, who seeks the truth behind what America thought he thought was his polite, intelligent, better Above average good-natured, to his sympathetic treatment of a blind woman, in which he falls in love. The story is good, has some interesting twists and lends Lorre many opportunities to shine. Director Robert Florey does a great job behind the lens, and all supportive actors help the film with Evelyn Keyes, who plays a particularly good role as a blind girl. I loved the end - and the truth - that existed in Lorre's character in spite of all the negative things society had done to him. For a small B-picture, The Man Behind the Mask is a good movie for his time.
