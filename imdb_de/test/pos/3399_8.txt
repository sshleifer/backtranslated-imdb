Thrilling drama with great sets, costumes and performances? although some people channel Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellently suited as two men who want to cultivate a friendship despite family and family relationships. Magnificent villains? They want them all to come to a very bad end. Many strong female characters in this? both, good and evil. Secondary storylines are also well developed. Several cameos of great stars of bygone eras. Good portrayal of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics. <br /> <br /> Take on a rainy day with your DVD or VHS player and a drink of your choice. A carpet and a cat would be optional.
