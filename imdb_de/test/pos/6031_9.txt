I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival at Prince George. I have to admit, the only reason I've seen it is that I'm a big fan of Callum Keith Rennie. And he did not abandon me. He gave a good performance with a rather unsympathetic character and provided the only comic relief in the whole movie. But there were a few twists that advised me. The characterizations were strong and the whole cast was pretty good. The only problem I had with the cast was Rose McGowan. She was so cold throughout the movie that we had no idea about the character or motivations of her character. Apart from her and a few minor continuity issues, this was a well-written, well-made thriller.
