This was a brave movie that appeared in Indian cinemas when it was released. The first movie that may portray lesbian tendencies among Indian women. The lead actress of the Indian cinema Shabana Azmi added the substance to the film with her hot, passionate scenes with Nandita. <br /> <br /> The movie was full of sexuality and the director used sex in the best possible way. The sex was not for erotic purposes, but related to the movie. The scene where Nandita Das loses her virginity to her husband was certainly the first of her kind in Indian cinemas. <br /> <br /> Good spectacle of all actors, especially Nandita Das, amid criticism from the Indian public
