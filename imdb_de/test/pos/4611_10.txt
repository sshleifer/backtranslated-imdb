This is a prime example of unrestrained filming at the highest level. Richard Greene (who does good in this role) is looking for his two missing friends and brings him to the Black Forest domain and castle of one-eyed Count Bruno (Stephen McNally), an enemy of the past he has never seen. Incredible movie has so many great elements (unique) in a single movie - a crocodile pit; a hulking damper (played by Lon Chaney Jr.); a clever doctor (played by Boris Karloff); a leopard hunt (very well done and very atmospheric); a Lovestory; a castle; a sword fight; a sadistic, one-eyed count and his two evil accomplices (played by John Hoyt and Michael Pate !!!); a fascinating background story that makes the movie even more interesting; and more!. Jerry Sackheim's script can not be integrated - to make a film that is highly recommended for anyone who likes unlimited films with a touch of horror and atmosphere.
