I think some of the American baseball movies are among the best films ever made. When this movie was in production and called it a rugby movie. I had read the papers about the Highland team in the papers, but had no high expectations for this film about a sport that did not interest me. Last night I saw him "on-demand" and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies. Ryan Little and the cast and crew did a great job. Neil McDonough was particularly convincing. As a "bad father" he showed a fine range and a subtle but moving character arc. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the actors of the Pacific Islander. I was fortunate enough to meet many of these fine people, and this film shows their wonderful spirit and culture. A flashback showing how Islander culture became a key element of the Highland team would have been a great addition to the film. <br /> <br /> In Utah, some pretty cheesy films have recently been shot. It's nice to see such a quality movie from Beehive State.
