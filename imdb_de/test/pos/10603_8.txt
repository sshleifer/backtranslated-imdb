I did not know what to expect. I've always considered Bam Margera and the CKY crew to be a team of knuckleheads involved in stupid entertainment. I did not know they could act. But everyone who played in this movie has performed well. The joy of the 'aaaaagh!' The scene blends perfectly with Ryan Dunn's depression and his revenge on his ex-girlfriend. Sometimes some scenes seem pointless, but at the same time they are funny. I recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh, but this movie may not appeal to those who prefer detailed storylines and a series of twists.
