I was very curious about this Wajda Depardieu trip and the time span is definitely fascinating. As a Wajda fan I was disappointed and that could be an understatement. The film has never really experienced a cinematic flight - there is no basis for hostility between Danton and Robespierre, etc. <br /> <br /> Basically, the script was weak (adapted to "The Danton Affair"). And yet the direction was masterful ... it's Wajda, after all! There were also some amazing actors, BUT they never attract the attention of the audience as they should. Depardieu is a quasi-dumb, nonchalant Danton ... not the picture we imagine. Woijech Pzsoniak is unbelievable, as always, but here too the screenplay limits, even actors with great talent can not collapse. Andrzej Seweryn and Bogoslaw Linda appear ... as Bourdon and Saint-Just ... and if you are familiar with Wajda, you know them. <br /> <br /> All in all, I was disappointed in the much-lauded movie. Great cast, great director, but no good base. Bad, undynamic script. We have to think in Danton (Walesa) and Robespierre (General J) ... what are their motivations? Eh ... who knows? One likes women, the other pulverizes himself? Rightight Ok, so if you're looking for a great French Revolution movie, I recommend "La Revolution Francaise" HIGHLY ... it's in two parts and oh-so-great! Excellent service, extensive scripts, juicy treats ... definitely a satisfying experience !! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is a much better Danton than Depardieu ... the wonderful Andrzej Seweryn has apparently taken some notes from "Danton" and is BRILLIANT as Robespierre. DO YOU SEE IT! NOW! As for Wajda fans, you are in better hands with "Man of Iron / Marble", "Promised Land" and the like. Cheers!!
