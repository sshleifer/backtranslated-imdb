(Mild Spoiler) Frankie Machine had had a bad hand in life. A card dealer in an illegal gambling den in his neighborhood in Chicago was beaten by him when the joint was raided by the police and given six months in prison. <br /> <br /> While he was behind bars, Frankie was treated at the prison hospital for his heroin addiction and learned to play the drums as part of his rehabilitation program. Now out of jail and back to his old neighborhood, Frankie tries to put his life back together by getting a union card in the Musicians Union and then a job as a drummer in a band, leaving his old life behind. Instead, he's catching up with Frankie in The Man with the Golden Arm in no time. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger's seminal 1955 film about heroin addiction, in which Frank Sinatra showed the power of his life as a drug-addicted, sharp Frankie Machine, the man with the golden arm. Frankie tries to escape from the life he leads, but has that monkey or, even better, a gorilla on his back that just will not let him. Soilden appearances of the entire minor cast, starting with Frankie's friend Sparrow, Arnold Stang. Sparrows try to get Frankie back on his feet by taking a suit for him and putting him and Frankie back in the slammer and almost into jail until his former boss in the gambling den Schwiefka brings him out. <br /> <br /> There's Frankie's emotionally and emotionally crippled wife, Zosch, Eleanor Parker, who sees her getting out of Frankie's grasp and slowly driven to felony and suicide. There's Frankie's drug dealer Louie, with Darren McGavin in one of his first acting roles. Frankie is only good as long as he's addicted and Louie makes every effort to make sure he does. <br /> <br /> There is the owner of the Gambling Joint, where Frankie works as top card dealer Schwiefka, Robert Strauss, who, like Louie, does everything he can to win Frankie back for him, even if he is arrested Again, Frankie's hope for a new and better life will go down the drain. And then there's Frankie's neighbor and friend Molly, Kim Novak, who makes almost impossible efforts to rid him of his addiction by locking him up in her apartment. There he goes to "Cold Turkey" and almost dies as he tries to tickle the habit in one of the most frightening sequences ever shown on film "The Man with the Golden Arm" to become one of the great classics of realism in moving pictures from the 50s.
