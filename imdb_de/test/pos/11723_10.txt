While he was great in Boogie Nights, I think this was Burt Reynolds' best performance. He is also a great director and has made a tough, violent film that does not hold back (the death of a hooker at 12) and a terrific detective story with some great actors (Brian Keith, Bernie Casey, etc.) and an outstanding movie is jazz soundtrack. 10 out of 10
