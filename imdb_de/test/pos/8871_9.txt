This movie was forever in a dusty stack of videos in my house before we saw it. We knew it was there - every time someone wanted to watch a movie, it was suggested. It would almost have been a joke ... "I know, let's watch Throw Momma on the train" ... I do not know why it was always rejected, it was just like that. We did not know what we had missed. It still seems to me why it took so long ... I mean, it stars stars Danny DeVito, Billy Crystal and Ann Ramsy (whom we call "The Lady of the Goonies"), an All Star Cast, who should have liked everyone in my household But there it was sitting for almost ten years. Until someday it was proposed and we could not resist it any longer ... <br /> <br /> It was like finding the tomb of King Tut ... <br /> <br /> No movie has made me laugh so hard and I doubt any movie will ever do it. I almost had to rewind for each line, as I still laughed at the line that came before, and lost the ability to hear or hear. Not just a simple laugh, but a laugh that consumes more energy than running ten kilometers in the cold. The kind of laughter you can not control causes the rolling and cramping, as well as tears and snot running down your face because it's just so weird. Once I memorize the movie, I'll say that this effect has diminished, but I do not think I'll be sick of looking at it and finding new quirks that appreciate. I think that's all I can say. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you do not like it, do not let me know, I'll probably be offended.
