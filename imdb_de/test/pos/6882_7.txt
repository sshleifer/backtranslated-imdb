The Koreans are now beating off American horror movies. But they do it in style. DOLL MASTER is a close copy of PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS, and even a little KIDS PLAY is here. Several young adults are invited to a special event in a doll-filled gallery to find out that they are targets of a vengeful mind. The dolls come alive and do pretty nasty things to the children. The gore level is pretty high, the values ​​for photography, set design and production are top notch, acting is not that bad and the fear is definitely there. DOLL MASTER might not be in the same league as A TALE OF TWO SISTERS or even DEAD FRIEND, but it's close. Give him a clock. You will not be disappointed.
