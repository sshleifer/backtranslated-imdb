A really great view of the world and the realities of the heroin addict. The film is one that will get too close to those involved in drug culture and has the knowledge of what a heroin addict is (or is nearby). Good movie that will never really be outdated. Outstanding achievements of all involved and the minimalistic set show how dark a world of JUNKIE can become. Worth a look - a kind of education. The golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the subterranean pain in which a junkie lives.
