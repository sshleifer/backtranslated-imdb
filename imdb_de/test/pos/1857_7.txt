The last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species". It is therefore appropriate that Jon Amiel's "Creation" was published. The film focuses on the time of Darwin's life (Paul Bettany), in which he wrote his famous work, and on the mild burden that weighs on family life. His religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly) and his guilt over his deceased daughter Annie, but I still like the idea of ​​Darwin's theory that he works like a karate shit on religious dogma. The US was one of the last countries where "Creation" found a distributor because of the debate over the creation process (yes, it still goes on). All in all this is not a masterpiece, but I recommend it as well as "inherit the wind". I hope that someday the debate on creation creation will not be an issue. If this film helps bring the debate to rest, then everyone in the film will have more power! With Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.
