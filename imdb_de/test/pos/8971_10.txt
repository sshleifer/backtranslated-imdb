The War of Charlie Wilson is a great example of how movies should be made. This film is of the highest quality and perfectly cast. Tom Hanks plays the lead role and delivers an extraordinary performance. In addition, Tom Hanks is supported by the unique acting power of the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. I've never seen him in a role that fits him so well. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny, intelligent and well written. Julia Roberts also plays a starring role in this film, but is easily overshadowed by the other two leading roles. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 10/10 and would recommend this movie to anyone interested in good cinema.
