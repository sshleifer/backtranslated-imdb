After watching this movie, it's easy to see why post-silent Soviet cinema is so little appreciated. Do not get me wrong. THE CRANES FLYING is extremely entertaining, at least for the first half, and offers a light touch that is totally unexpected in their country of origin. a fresh, brisk, generous technique that ultimately irritates as much as it charms at first; two stunning subjective set pieces; and a romantic swing flirting with Lelouch territory, but never quite falling into it. It's just that, in its subsuming of huge social, national and worldwide events, it's essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood movie to a love affair. <br /> <br /> Of course in a Soviet Union that emphasizes the state Especially in a time (World War II) in which individualism and the freedom to uphold murderous symbolism were suppressed, this foreground of two attractive young lovers is a relief , And the thematic similarities - all consumptive love, which are separated from the war - with two of the most beautiful films (SEVENTH HEAVEN, LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG) also contribute to their potential loveliness. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. Boris, a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family, and Veronika, a student, maintain an airy relationship at night, their only leisure time. Boris, cousin Mark, composer, also has Veronika in view. When the Nazis march into Russia, Boris volunteers, to the chagrin of his family and lover. He promises to write to Veronika, but never does, and may think she did not bother to say goodbye, or maybe the post office is simply unreliable. Veronika's parents die during an air raid, and she moves in with Boris's family and helps in the hospital, where his father cared for wounded soldiers. <br /> <br /> Annoyed by Boris silence, Veronika is also being attacked by Mark's attention, who was released from military service by bribing a local official. She is finally worn down and marries him to the disapproval of her adoptive family. Boris is now killed in action. Veronika, who has disgusted herself and her disgusting Mark, refuses to believe it, and waits for his return by sponsoring a young orphan bearing his name. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the birds that the couple sees at the height of their bird love, symbolically perhaps their transcendent, epiphany force. But this is illusory - the cranes fly in a V-formation, and this form permeates the entire film, through the geometric shapes of buildings, interiors, exteriors, groups of people, compositions, camera angles, the heroine's name - or by editing feet that going southwest in one story are kicked by feet in a different direction to the southeast. <br /> <br /> This is to kill the lovers, who have no control over their fate, and to point out the Stalinist power, which is never explicitly mentioned in the film. Although the couple seems to be seemingly free in space, be it literally in an uninhabited environment or privileged in generous close-ups, they are always ironic, minimized, torn apart - by circumstances, families, by crowds (see the brilliant, though obvious, Sequences in which Veronika is devoured by tanks or the couple does not meet in large numbers) or simply through the structure of the film, which constantly distances itself from its proximity through paralellism. Although the lightness and brightness of the style initially suggests a beautiful romantic idyll, it is constantly interrupted by strange edits or camera angles of distracting music scraps. <br /> <br /> What's most notable is how these blocks block romance is achieved by abstraction rather than by historical forces. The whole movie, but especially the war itself, is strangely unreal and dreamlike. We never show its harsh, brutal timeliness, only its impact on the lovers. In fact, it transforms into a majestic spectacle without evil Germans. <br /> <br /> On the home front, the air raids create delicious light and shadow effects or ruins of almost Gothic decadence. In the bunker, the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than the indifference Boris perceives. The empty, lonely Moscow, which at first hosts the lovers as Veronika with her mother, is less realistic than emotional spaces. <br /> <br /> When Mark tries to impose himself on Veronika, the air raid is less of a destructive reality than a symbolic release from sexual and emotional frustration. This is a brilliant sequence filmed with silent, expressionistic terror, in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence, all the more compelling for the wistful gentleness of the earlier scenes. <br /> <br /> Also at the front, where dispute over the honor of girls is more urgent than tactics, Nazis or despair. The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade into a final space is yet another abstraction of the experience of war, whose attitude in a forest gives it a sexual dynamic; and Boris' last look back on death is an extraordinary mix of dream fulfillment and heightened fear, in which what is desired becomes threatening and grotesque. From that point on, the movie gets a little less interesting, a bit more obvious. Another grip on Expressionist overload - Veronika's suicide attempt and the rescue of the child - is handled awkwardly; and her grim blame casts a paralyzing shadow over the whole movie. The use of deep focus, which at first glance is overwhelming, quickly wears off as it has no moral force or significance that Welles has used in BITIZEN KANE. After a seemingly cunning criticism of totalitarianism in favor of the individual, it is cruelly betrayed when the suffering of the individual, as so often in Russian art, is transformed into symbolic (ie, sexless, dehumanized) hope. A shame.
