Well, since I saw it, it was NOT what I expected, at least not to the end. I read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of Amazon and was glad I did. After meeting Park for the first time through Oldboy, I was curious how he would handle the genre, and was quite pleased with the clever way he performed it. I think Park has matured in terms of presentation, since Oldboy and some of his other work have very nice and deliberate camera work, he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I had not seen in other Vamp films. For example, the scene in which Father Hyeon recognizes the "beast" that grows in him as he gives his shoes to the ever barefoot Tae-ju and he is able to see the blood pumping through Tae-ju's skin and his eye gets bloodier for it. That was a nice effect. I was also glad that Park did not make the crap out of the movie and that is actually very little CG. I left Bakjwi because I was completely set to think something was going to happen, and I would go into park mode. I also liked that Park played with a bit of symbolism and inversion, whereas we do not usually understand this in the Asia Cinema. At the beginning of the film, we see how the plot develops slowly, get to know the characters, and feel like an invisible observer of what is in motion. Park treats you a bit like the future of Ghost of Christmas, which shows you, albeit a bit boring, how life outside of your world is. Ah, but then we feel a little kinship with the infested father and his burgeoning desire for Tae-ju and a conflict with duty as a priest. We almost begin to root it down, even until Park does not turn us back so well into reality and we really see that in the end Bakjwi is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong. It will not spoil if I tell you to look at Bakjwi from the mindset of a priest, and I think you'll accept what Park is asking you to do. Do not expect Oldboy and stylization, because you will not get it here. A very interesting version of the genre. Those who missed the LOTS of literary elements and religious allusions looked at another film, not Bakjwi. Take a look at Bakjwi's "Let The Right One", it's not what you expect.
