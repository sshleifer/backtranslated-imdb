Stars: Danny Devito, Billy Crystal, Anne Ramsey, Kim Griest, Kate Mulgrew, Oprah Winfrey and Rob Reiner. After college, teacher Larry (Crystal) wants his ex-wife dead and Owen (Devito) wants his mom (Ramsey) to be dead. When Larry announces that he wants to see his wife dead, Owen knows what he needs to do to help Larry kill his mother. Devito is absolutely funny in this regard, because the brainwave would-be writer, who has daydreams of poisoning his mother and scissors through her head. He has a childlike role that makes him appear more like a confused man than a murderer. Ramesy was actually nominated for an Oscar because of her wonderful performance as my old wife Lift. In addition to the comedy, the film also has heart. A scene between Devito and Crystal seems to start like a joke, but goes deeper and makes me a little sad. Danny Devito staged the film and did a good job of bringing the dark tone in his direction. For any fan of comedy I recommend that. <br /> <br /> My rating: B plus. 84 min. PG-13 for language, sexuality and violence.
