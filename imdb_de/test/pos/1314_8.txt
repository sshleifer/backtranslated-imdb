Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote Mishima, clearly drawing parallels between the life of Yukio Mishima and his work. The film is divided into four sections: Beauty, Art, Action, and the fateful day when Mishima hosted an army general and spoke to the garrison just to ridicule him and his Bushido ideals of the Samurai code. Mishima committed a ritual Seppuku on November 25, 1970, which he planned as a combination of beauty, art, and action. Schrader edits scenes that were recreated on that day with three different scenarios from Mishima's novels: Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko's House, and Runaway Horses. The Seppuku's moment is perfectly realized in terms of its shocking climax by simultaneously retracting the camera. <br /> <br /> Black and white sequences mingle with the colorful moments portrayed in Mishima's novels. The black and white scenes show memories of Mishima's childhood and youth. Schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from the novels that often coincide with Mishima's life, such as his stuttering, developing his bodybuilding obsession, and promoting the samurai code. Each of the three themes of beauty, art and action is illustrated in the selected representations from the respective novels. The color sequences are reminiscent of early, rigid Technicolor films and may give the film an intended surreal quality in relation to the theme. <br /> <br /> Ken Ogata plays the real Mishima with tireless determination and goes to the General Office on this fateful day and resembles the real Mishima. Schrader took an enormous risk with this film by focusing on his novels and thematically tied to Mishima's private life and his literary ambitions. The adaptation of the film between the three main sections of November 25, 1970, the black-and-white growth segments, and the colorful romance scenes clearly points to the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art, and action in Mishima's life. Sometimes it is difficult to follow, and for the uninitiated viewer, there is little to recommend. *** of 4 stars.
