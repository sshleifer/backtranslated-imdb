A beautiful romantic war history that should receive more attention. The Czech pilot who played the piano gives the story a gentle touch. The flying footage may not have been enough for me, like aviation fans, but it's not really an action movie. Although it has nothing to do with the James Salter novel "The Hunters", which became the film about Korean F86 Saber pilots, Dark Blue World had a similar feel, but had more romantic elements. In some ways better than Battle of Britain because it's not based on big actors. Suggest this movie with some Czech beer and some Czech dumplings called kneldniky (sp).
