First of all - I'm a big fanatic of horror movies, but I'm pretty fed up with the damn US horror movies. They are about the same thing - blood and violence. It's not even scary. Well, there's nothing wrong with the blood and all that - do not even bother me - but that does not make a movie scary! That's why I find this movie entertaining - it's fun to see a satire that makes fun of the concept of "main horror USA". American Splatter / Gore movies, they should not be scary, just funny. No problem. But when they are "scary," it usually gets pathetic. But there are a few great American horror movies (Poltergeist, Psycho, Birds), but in the end everything is the same. That's why this film was a relief. Evil Ed is not only a cult movie, but a classic! I can not wait for Master Director Anders Jacobsson to do another goddamn splatter movie! Until I have to look at Evil Ed again - and again - and again! But I do not care - it's such a great movie!
