Dead man walking, absolutely brilliant, in the end in tears! You can not watch this movie and do not think about the problems it poses. How can you justify killing (be it murder or the death penalty) and to what point is forgiveness possible (not just on a spiritual level) Do not look at this movie when you're down! But watch out !!!
