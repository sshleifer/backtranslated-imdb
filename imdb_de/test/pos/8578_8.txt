I love this movie. There is something for everybody. It's funny, sad, passionate and dramatic. The mixture of two completely different cultures creates a completely new world that the viewer can not help but to be part of. I have to admit that I'm a bit biased because Colin Firth is my favorite actor and therefore, what he does is wrong in my eyes (!), But in this movie his tremendous acting talent is obvious and becomes even more beautiful promoted drama of his co-star Nia Long. Ironically, the problems her love affair suffers make her more believable, and the simple features like the contrast between the colors of Matthews and Nimi's clothes alone make this movie all the more enchanting. I oppose anyone who can not be touched by this story. I find it adorable and have seen it at least ten times since I bought the movie a week ago!
