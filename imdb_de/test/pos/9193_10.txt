Someone rated this film a "waste of time" because he / she expected the "beautiful landscape of Brazil and Portugal," but then everything looked "washed out" or somber, or something similar. I think that person missed the whole part of the movie. That's the reality. This film is about showing that life is indeed not ideal and showing what people go through in their lives for family, love and survival. A young man leaves his slum in Sao Paolo, Brazil, to visit his mother's home after his death. He discovers that not everything is free and that Brazilians are looked down on by locals from Portugal. He eventually finds a life, a love, but the story does not end as expected and this is not a "fairytale" story. The part that impressed me most was the closing song "Zeca Bailero (Honey Baby)" by Gal Costa. It fits the movie so well; especially the end.
