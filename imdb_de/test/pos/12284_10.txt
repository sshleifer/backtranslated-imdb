Most Hollywood films seem to follow one of the few pre-formulated and very predictable acts. This film is not a perfect example of what I IFC is looking for. <br /> <br /> There is a man, Michael and his girlfriend, who left him without a word. He wants to know what happened. Is she okay ? Can he say goodbye? Maybe a closure. He was unable to contact Grace and, to find her, he made a film asking for your help. Michael believes that we need a reason to help him, so he tells us history by reliving his relationship with the help of a friend (Nadia) to play the role of Grace (the girlfriend who left). The hind sight is 20/20 and Michael is no different. By telling his story and receiving feedback from his friends, he realizes his mistakes and how much he appreciates what he has lost. Unfortunately, this is a lesson we all had to learn (or need to learn) and is easy to identify. That's why you want to hear more of Michael's story and want to know if he finds Grace.
