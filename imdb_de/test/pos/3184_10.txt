I can only record so much of Filipino films, especially if the trend today is sex, action and slapstick comedy (which I hate). The fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and puke me off during the movie was a big plus. It has good movie scenes and the cut was great, especially the camera. I think that Claudine deserves the best actress here instead of getting a movie in Milan. the fact that there are only so few Filipino movies that I really like. I think Cholo Laurel did a great job in this movie. I really loved this movie, technically and in terms of character development. The plot was complex and that made it great.
