Impressive! I took it off the shelf because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in 'Trainspotting'. This is a phenomenal movie; It has action, romance, tension, intrigue and wit. If I did not laugh, I was on the edge of my seat. This is definitely a movie I would recommend to people who are interested in the intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century. This movie has everything that makes me happy!
