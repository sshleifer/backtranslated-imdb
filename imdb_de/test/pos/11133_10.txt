"Fame" (1980) is brilliant. All these qualities have made the films of the late 70s so great. He is proud of his directness and is not ashamed to be exaggerated. <br /> <br /> What really counts here is the journey, not the destination. Ignorant idiots with soap opera mentality will never realize that Fame is about the fights, fears and successes of these young people, not their careers. Fame has made it to Hollywood. "Fame" marked the end of an era. The end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness. It is the last statement of a generation that had its own voice. <br /> <br /> 10/10
