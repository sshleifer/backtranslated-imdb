I finally saw the third movie in Mehta's trilogy: "Fire." At the beginning I would say that "water" was the undeniable masterpiece on all levels. The fire comes next with the earth in the order of quality. Fire: There is so much going on in this movie that I need a few more sightseeing to drink. The writing is excellent, the script creates friction that triggers the whole process of "heat" from beginning to end. When it really breaks out into a fire, the conflicts become a complete break in relationships. <br /> <br /> Mehta is a brave woman: she clearly sees a lot of jaundice, falsity and repressions about the great society from which she comes. India is changing rapidly, but much of it is economic change. The fact that she has met with so much opposition to the emergence of "water" after clarifying the script shows that there are still many taboo subjects that Indian people can not look in the face, that they can not investigate or discuss , Worse, if someone like Mehta has the guts to hold a mirror to these questions, it threatens death threats. Just as India thinks of itself as a pluralistic, tolerant society, the facts are not always the same. While "earth" was merely a historical scene of the civil war after India's independence, fire and water point to personal, social and religious issues that, as said, are so strongly (in the negative sense) considered open. Artistic dialogue is still alive many years away. As I write, this "water" will actually be shown in India by the end of this year. I believe it when I see it. <br /> <br /> Fire faces a similar sexual and emotional puzzle that I saw in "One Prize for Rubies". Whether arranged marriages (as happened to Jews some 150 years ago, or as is the case with many modern Indians), they run the risk of forcing a miserable match between both men and women; or just loveless marriages ..... This is not the real problem though. Mehta is clearly impatient with the completely rigid religious attitudes that enslave either widows in misery (water) or women in loveless marriages (fire). I am not an expert on secular or Hindu divorce laws. The film seems to imply that the stigma (divorce) is almost as bad as the sad marriage. In any case, Mehta's film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that puts modern Indian relationships to the test. For me, the fact that all three of these films have manifested themselves as an unjustified attack on their culture sounds like the predictable noise of a repressive mindset. Mehta forces you to check the topics, no matter how much flack. I admire her work and can not recommend her films enough. Superb, disturbing, provocative, shocking taboo.
