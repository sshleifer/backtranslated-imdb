I remember seeing this movie when I was quite young and quite disturbed. I found the plot very disturbing and still remember the various bullying techniques. One was special when the other schoolchildren spat his soup before he could even taste a spoon. They also tied him up and shaved his private parts. That was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. However, I have the feeling that even if he was good in games, he would have been bullied because it is hard to decide what makes someone popular. For me he is the kind of person who would always be selected because children work that way. Popular kids are popular because they are somehow "cool". Popularity is hard to define. Even if he succeeds in his career, it makes no difference and he is still tormented. I found the end rather disturbing as there was no solution.
