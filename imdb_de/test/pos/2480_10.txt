First and foremost, the entire script is mostly improvised, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are looking at is a real documentation. Second, Watkins' dedicated actors were selected to showcase their true political alliances and backgrounds. The hippies pictured are real hippies, the government officials (though not necessarily in the government itself) are at least really hearty conservatives within the system, and some of the cops are real cops. Given Watkins's textual freedoms, a violent brainhead ensues, with even Watkins himself convinced that an actor was actually shot. (We hear him in the background screaming "Cut! Cut!") <br /> <br /> An amazing movie, even though American critics were pretty harsh in their reviews I've never seen it. This is not entirely unexpected as the revelation of America's oppressive Communist mentality would surely rattle some cages during this time. This pseudo documentation definitely requires open-mindedness. However, if you are seriously looking for a very accurate representation of the 1960s culture, this would be the movie you should watch.
