"Bronenoset's Potyomkin" is a milestone in film history and one of the few films that deserves to be called a classic. It was the picture from which Sergei M. Eisenstein made a movie character at that time. And today it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema that it always was. <br /> <br /> 'Potyomkin' is a movie that you absolutely have to see as a unit that you do not have to choose. Do not just watch the clip shows featuring the sequence "Odessa Steps" and switch to "Citizen Kane" or "The Godfather". See it all in its glorious 75-minute running time to truly understand and enjoy it. Do not expect that every detail is perfect. I mean, the Scooby Doo looks like a master of understated realism. Certain action points may seem illogical and some of the battle sequences are outdated. But it is still a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> The most memorable moments in the film are the mutiny on the battleship, the body of Vakulinchuk falling from the ship, the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier. The mother holds her dead child, the stroller on the steps of Odessa and the lion rise to roar as more slaughter occurs. For each new pair of eyes looking at it, 'The Battleship Potemkin' comes to life again.
