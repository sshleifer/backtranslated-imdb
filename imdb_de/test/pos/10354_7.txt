I felt compelled to comment on this film because it is listed on the IMDb as the fourth-lowest sci-movie of all time. WHAT!?!? Sure, this movie is shitty, but it's unbelievable! It's not terrible on an Ed Wood level, it's unreal and uneven. <br /> <br /> There are some classic moments in the movie. Brain surgery is rude and great, and even crazier, considering the movie was rated PG! Gor chased after his dolly before dropping battery acid on his face - "Mine! Gimmee!" Zandor Vorkoff's speech at the beginning of the film: "Before Amir, Kali was just another weak nation struggling to free itself from centuries of stagnant feudalism!" Angelo Rossito also has some great lines - "No, Gor! No!" "You want these keys, my beauties?" It is absolutely wrong that this is the fourth most popular sci movie on the IMDb because it is ENTERTAINING. No matter how bad a movie is, if it still manages to be weird, whimsical, disturbing or entertaining, it deserves credit and does not deserve to be dumped. I will not defend most of Al Adamson's films, but this one together with Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR are so entertaining that they can make up for their horrors.
