For the record, the 1949 version of "The Blue Lagoon" is not the original movie, as many have said. <br /> <br /> This story was filmed in Britain in 1923, shortly after the novel was written. As much as I would like to see the 1949 version, I would take the opportunity to see the true original release of this story on film. Granted, the 1980 movie with Christopher Atkins, Brooke Shields and the two teenagers was filmed with a beautiful camera. Acting did not seem to me very good when I saw this movie for the first time, but after watching this movie a few times ... it's obvious that two kids growing up on an island without an adult's guidance actually have one simplistic style have approach to life .... whether in their language, their appearance or in their daily activities. <br /> <br /> Although some were fortunate enough to see the 1949 "Blue Lagoon", I can not wonder if there is anyone alive who can remember the 1923 story being published, to film.
