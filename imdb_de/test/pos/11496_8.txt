This film could be compared to "comfort food" for the soul. Anyone who has ever tried and tried to save a relationship can refer to this film. So many parts are so funny and so many parts are so heartbreakingly true. It is not perfect in its production or even in dialogue, but the story is unique, which means a lot for modern "romantic" comedies. Luke Wilson is bland at best, but Heather Graham does an extraordinary job in my opinion. Try it - despite the banal-looking DVD cover. The character of Joline raises many questions in our self-service culture. She asks us if the commitment really applies to the other person or to ourselves. Actually, we are. Keeping promises (from marriage to a job for a friend) is a great feeling. Moreover, our word is nothing more than a shape-changing cloud of smoke. Joline is like a wake up call. We need to be aware of our words and commitments, they mean more than we think. At the same time, we can not commit ourselves to someone who is unable to do so.
