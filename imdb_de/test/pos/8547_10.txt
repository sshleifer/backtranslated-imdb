I saw this movie years ago and never forgot it. The topic is very up to date. It was TCM this morning and I wonder why this wonderful movie is not on VHS or DVD. I have searched extensively for this film, but can not find it. I believe that if enough people wish, the movie will eventually be released on DVD. I am amazed that such an impressive performance by Quinn and such a powerful storyline are not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing is present in many parts of the world today makes this film a must for teachers and students. This film is a great educational tool from the past, but in many ways as contemporary as "Crash." From previous comments, I can see that this film has left a deep impression on everyone. Unfortunately it is not available for sale.
