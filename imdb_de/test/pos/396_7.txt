This is another good western that I enjoyed. It's not an epic or anything, but it's good for what it is. These are three furry catchers, led by a man named Jed, who is raw and uncivilized. Friends find themselves as scouts for a fort, which is the only thing between them and an Indian band that upset Americans in their country , and want to take it back. That's the core of the story. What follows is action, excitement, even a little humor and forbidden romance. One of Jed's friends, Gus, reminded me a lot of the character Quint (played by Robert Shaw) in the movie Jaws. They both have that crusted, rude behavior. As a western fan you should find a lot to this entry. I think he deserves a 7/10
