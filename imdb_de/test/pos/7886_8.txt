I remember as many things as you saw this movie during its original theatrical release - the afterglow of peace and love after Woodstock, along with the tension of fear of fear and paranoia in front of Watergate. It's hard to believe it's thirty-seven years later, and I can still remember the thoughts that went through my mind as I watched the movie with my best friend. As with Peter Boyle's characteristic of the ultimate redneck, you'll be amazed to typify him for the rest of his career (oh, how wrong!) And how the counterculture destroyed the sensibilities of most parts of the country. To this day, my buddy and I still use Joe Curran's line from my summary above when a dilemma arises; I'm curious how a simple line can stay with you for decades. <br /> <br /> It's curious to read comments about the movie from others on this board, especially those that say the film has an outdated quality and how over the top were the characters. However, if you were at that time, the picture shows a fairly accurate representation of the polar opposites of that time, quite side by side, as the events in the story reveal. If you really want to be dated, when did you last hear the words Macy's and Gimbel's in the same sentence or a line like Joe's - "Come on, come with the Pepsi generation". From a historical perspective, you have this great Nixon poster in one of the background scenes - "Would you like to buy a used car from this man?" The director John Avildsen captures with subtleties like this many of the subtle but ever-present references to life four decades ago. <br /> <br /> Today's reputation was only the second time that I've seen the movie, and I have to admit, I do not remember Susan Sarandon in one of the lead roles, but this was her first shot. The scenes of nudity and free love at the time were something really new and daring, in fact shocking, as filmmakers began experimenting with their ability to move the covers of decency and conventions. "Joe" made a big leap in that respect, especially since it was a "mainstream" picture. <br /> <br /> Over time, Peter Boyle impressed me the most as he overcame the stereotype of Joe Curran to appear or play in some of my favorite pieces. I mean, how do you go from "Joe" to this hilarious rendition of "Puttin 'on the Ritz" in "Young Frankenstein"? And in my all-time favorite episode of "X-Files," as Clyde Bruckman, Boyle has a tender, tragic, witty, and serious depiction that turns Scully and Mulder upside down more than once. And as a career capper Frank Barone must be one of the funniest characters in the history of television. Even repeated episodes in the syndication are funny when - whenever the older baron lets go with one of his observations. He is an actor that this audience already painfully misses.
