This definitely would not have been my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on TV and said it was really good. At his recommendation, I bought a copy, as I did not know if it would ever appear on TV again. I had never heard anyone except Armand Assante. At first, I had a hard time dealing with the story because the first part of the movie is a jumble of pictures - and it makes no sense. Only later in the film, everything comes together. Cutting the scene - if that's what it's called - is a bit shaky - it sometimes looks like some frames have been cut from each scene and the scenes are jerky - but I think that was added to complete the scene Unusuality (if that's a word). The story turns here and there, and by the time you've found out everything, everything is turned upside down and you have to think about who the villain is and who is not. Or bad woman. Acting is very good - I've always thought about how much Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio. The end was a real twist, totally unexpected, which I liked. A good show.
