As part of the exclusive film program on complicated relationships in some European courts, last night's film theater hosted Anna Boleyn, a film directed by the great Germanic film director, Mr. Ernst Lubitsch. The film shows the terrible story of the Queen's Wife of the British King Henry VIII. She was executed by her husband (well, not exactly, the king ordered the hangmen to do his dirty work), not to mention that this marriage was a important political and religious historical event caused the English Reformation. <br /> <br /> The movie stars are Dame Henny Porten, Germany's first screen superstar in those early years, and Mr. Emil Jannings, Germany's thickest actor in this quiet time. Both play their characters appropriately. Dame Porten is an innocent aristocrat increasingly interested in the power the court offers her and Mr. Jannings as unscrupulous, bizarre and wife-addicted British monarchs. A character who is very suitable for this German actor, who, given the extravagance and excessive personality of his role, acts appropriately on the character himself. <br /> <br /> In the early filming stage, Mr. Lubitsch was known for his outstanding costume films. Colossal productions on a large budget ("Anna Boleyn" cost about 8 million marks, a fortune even for this German count) with great decors, which can be seen during the coronation process in the scene in Westminster Abbey, with 4.000 extras (large German coworkers became busy), which caused revolutionary workers excitement, as the German Federal President Friedrich Ebert visited the stage during the filming. , <br /> <br /> In addition to the spectacle is one of the most important aspects of this and every film by Mr. Lubitsch, even during his epic, d. h s the complex relationship between the main characters. We are experiencing a game of different interests, double meanings and the complicated art of flirting, but what is easily dealt with ends in tragedy. The importance of these historical facts is effectively brought to bear, but Lubitsch is more interested in the changing relationship between Henry VIII and Anna Boleyn. <br /> <br /> And now, if you will allow me, I have to say goodbye temporarily, because this German count has to make sure that one of his rich and wealthy heirs does not lose the head of this Teutonic aristocrat. <br /> <br /> Mr Count Ferdinand Von Galitzien http: // ferdinandvongalitzien. blogspot.com/
