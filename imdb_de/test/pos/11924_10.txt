I loved this movie since I saw it in the theater in 1991. I was 12 years old and Wil Wheaton was my favorite actor and teenager. I'm 23 now and I still love this movie. The best part is, whoever I am loves it too because it's a total macho movie! It's packed with action and chaos to keep men with the shortest attention spans on the screen. I just wish it was available on DVD!
