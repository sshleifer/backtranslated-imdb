It is possible to spend a good time with this movie while at the same time regretting everything it is not. In the 1980s, an ingenious US Congressman (Tom Hanks) engineers assisted Afghan partisans who fought against the Soviet Union. Hanks is in a lethargic, hailmate form as mischievous, politically incorrect Charlie Wilson, first saw a hot tub with three deep women available. If only the movie had the same carefreeness; Apart from Philip Seymour Hoffman's attempt as a cynical CIA agent, he also tries to be perceived as patriotic. Aaron Sorkin's signature staccato dialogue serves its purpose, but the story is no more plausible than any of Wilson's great stories. And there is a strangely unspoken subtext: Wilson's Afghan friends later mutated into the Taliban and other anti-Western groups, making the world worse off than was the case with those events.
