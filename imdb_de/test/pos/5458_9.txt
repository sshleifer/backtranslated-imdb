Over the years, I have seen this movie often from "HBO" and now have a copy on DVD. I have to say that it is very memorable and entertaining. Meanwhile, it is also interesting and educational. Any television fan can refer to the early 90s when it was time to replace Johhny Carson, the TV legend of The Tonight Show. Who will be Jay or Dave? This original HBO movie "The Late Shift" stays in shape and shows very well the real events that show the behind-the-scenes battle between NBC and CBS network bosses, and even ABC, all fighting for the services of Jay and Dave , Acting makes it seem real, as very few TV films are screened with real people, while the actors portraying Leno and Letterman make it so real. I did not read the Bill Carter book, so I do not know if it stayed true to the pages, but I've enjoyed this movie over the years. From the moment CBS entertainers are shown outlining Leno's submission to Johhny, they decide that they want to participate in the late-night game. When Carson announces his unexpected retirement, NBC wants to keep Leno's loyalty. However, the conflict occurs when Letterman also hopes for a crack in the slot at 11:30. It was fun to see the crazy meeting with Michael Ovitz (Treat Williams), who gets all the networks to consider Letterman for a show. It was interesting to see the scene in which Johhny Letterman telephoned directly to run from NBC and consider CBS. By the way, Rich Little was great when Johhny Carson could not keep up with his performance. There were many thrilling moments when he showed Leno's talent manager Helen, to whose quarrel the NBC heads forced him. Overall, a great movie that showed what television really looks like and proves that networks starve power and money while showing it's a damn business. Of course, there is no shop like the show business. Great work from HBO, very memorable and a clock that always showed the true story of the late night wars.
