After a very long time, the Marathi cinema has brought some good films. This movie is one of the best Marathi movies ever made. It shows how an old grandfather tries to save the eye of his grandchildren. He tries everything possible to save the child's eye. The doctor and a relative try to help him with his attempt. <br /> <br /> The acting of the grandfather, the boy and the doctor is just great. They have shown a true picture of a typical marathi life. Every action has a meaning. I would recommend to watch this movie because at first I thought this movie would be documentary, but it was beyond my expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie will really touch your heart to come up with such services.
