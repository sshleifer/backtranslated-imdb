As a cameraman, I could not help admiring the great look of this image. The performances were excellent, as was the story. Just when I thought this movie was going to slow down, it did not. Heart-pounding excitement, good tempo through editing and a score that knows when to be quiet, all come together here under competent and capable guidance. The camera was always in the right place. I like this.
