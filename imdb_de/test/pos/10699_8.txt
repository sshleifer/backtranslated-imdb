This is a pretty stupid movie that may be the least erotic experience ever to hit the big screen (the heroine pours V-8 over herself and invites the hero to lick it - Yuck!). And yet it also shows the magnificent Lucinda Dickey in her by far the most erotic performance. Back in those days, women - even action heroines - with real muscle were a rarity, and I still remember my jaw dropping when Dickey took off her shirt and showed the most heavily built back and biceps I have Ever had ever seen. Dickey's beauty and vitality carry the film: she could have been a female Schwarzenegger if someone had the vision to promote her.
