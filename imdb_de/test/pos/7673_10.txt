I've probably seen it once, like most people my age (55) in the 60s. I understand the dissatisfaction of both families with the final product. But this is a great movie, it was a great opera. but as a film it is wonderful. This film should be released at least for videos, other generations can put emphasis on good music and storytelling. The cast consisted of some of the greatest black actors of all time, most of them have since died; only Sidney P. is still with us. Please do not wait until he's gone and the movie, like all the old movies, will be unusable if you lose time. Again, this is a great movie that you do not often see today, if at all.
