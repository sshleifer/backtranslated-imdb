This movie makes me laugh when I think about it. such a clever comedy! very precise and yet simple. The casting can not be better. All the actors are the best choice of roles, and they all play the best, and there's no stupid laugh or scream in the movie. Layers and the progress of the story work together perfectly and the rhythm flows smoothly. Best of all, the YMCA is hired by Village People. This underscores the meaning of the Native American's sentence, which was previously briefly addressed in the film, which is the smartest and funniest climax of many comedies. I give him ten extra many times when comedies are so underrated.
