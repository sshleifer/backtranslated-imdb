I remember that I did not see this movie the first time, but it's grown on me. I love the costumes and poses of the actors, the humor, the cinematography, the soundtrack. The scenes are very rich and move very fast. Every time I see it, I notice something new. Aaliyah as Akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it, but not enough. <br /> <br /> Also the lestat in this movie is different, it's not the same character. You can see that the character Armand got Lestat-like qualities because I assume Anne wanted it. But there is no reason to ruin this movie just because it does not look like books.
