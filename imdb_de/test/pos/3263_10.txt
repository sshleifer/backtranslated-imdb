If you like movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll love Two Hands. It has the same kind of black humor and will entertain you throughout the movie. Like Pulp Fiction, there are the crazy scenarios that the characters get into and how they handle it. Together with Gallipoli and Picnic at Hanging Rock this must be one of the best Australian movies I have ever seen. It also plays a young Heath Ledger before it got really big in the States. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly underrated movie that I think is just as good as Pulp Fiction and these greats. You have to see that!
