We will never see this movie in the near future, if at all. If somebody comes across it in a video store, just grab it in front of another, because I doubt it'll ever be published again. <br /> <br /> An incredible and timely film about the first attack on the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993, and how government agencies are tasked with identifying terrorists and preventing them from harming American citizens Adding American property fell completely on the job and unknowingly allowed it to happen. Bone cold as we all know that the terrorists arrested at the end of the film will not be the end of our nightmare that reappeared on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> The film turned everything upside down in 1992-93, which made the first tragedy in the WTC possible. However, it took us another eight years to realize that from this first WTC attack we should have learned to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second and most devastating attack on the World Trade Center. I found this film harder to see after the events of 9/11 than the video of the 9/11 attacks. All I can say about this movie is not to look at it alone. The end itself is so powerful and prophetic that it puts you in a state of shock when you know what we know today and may need someone to be with you without seeing the movie to call for medical help.
