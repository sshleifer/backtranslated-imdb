I've seen this movie many times. I read the book Englar Alheimsins, written by Einar Már Guðmundsson, who received the Scandinavian book prizes for the work. The movie does not start in the same place as the book. It happens in Reykjavík and the main character, Páll is young and has a good life with his girlfriend. But when she breaks into the relationship with him, he gets a headache that makes him angry and angry. And soon he has big mental problems and then the movie starts. Soon he will be called in the mental hospital in Iceland called "Kleppur" and there you will see some great characters like Viktor, who considers himself to be Hitler, and Óli, who thinks he writes all the "The Beatles" songs and gives them wisely lets transport. Ingvar E Sigurðusson, who plays the role of the main character Páll, is so good that he is breathless. Also the music in this movie is great from SIGURRÓS and only for the price of music should you watch the movie. Overall, a great movie that should be seen.
