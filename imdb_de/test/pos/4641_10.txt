Midnight Madness is a movie that is unfortunately underestimated and not appreciated. With a flood of classic "nervous" teen / college films this was forgotten. As a kid I would watch this movie over and over again, luckily I had it on video. This film shows a tamer, but most exciting side of the eighties. In the cynical society we live in today, drug abuse is the "coolest" thing. It's good to see an entertaining, innocent movie from time to time that's Midnight Madness ... if you can find it.
