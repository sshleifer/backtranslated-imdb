Impressive! Where should I start? <br /> <br /> This adaptation of Sarah Waters' third novel is one of my favorite movies of all time !!!!! <br /> <br /> I'm not too big fiction fiction (seriously, I NEVER read fiction), but the book is just as fantastic as the movie! Or should I say that the movie is as fabulous as the book ?! I love this story !!!!! Anyway, I postpone the three-hour film (2-part series on DVD, 3-part series on TV / book) for about a year and a half. It just did not look so interesting ... BOY I WAS SO WRONG! <br /> <br /> Immediately immersed in the rich and exciting action ... totally mesmerized! Just like the book, you can not stop looking / reading. It captures your attention for the entire 3 hours ... and when it ends, you do not want it. <br /> <br /> The story just flows so beautifully and you wonder where the time is going. <br /> <br /> The lesbian subplot was just icing on the cake! The parts that I love most are the subtle facial expressions and looks / eye contact between the two characters. They really feel their desire for each other and yet they can not act on it until they have to. <br /> <br /> Let me point out that the "lesbian theme" is an important part of the film, obviously the heart of the film is a real unexpected love story, but certainly not the whole movie is over. That's what makes this story so unique and fascinating to me. I have never read or heard of it. Sarah Waters is a pure genius! <br /> <br /> The turns that it takes can hang on the seat edge. Serious! My hands were held on my couch with every surprise twist, and I even screamed out loud several times ("OH MY GOD! NO WAY! THIS IS NOT FIT! Did I do it?") /> <br /> The only one Negatives that I have to say about this movie is that I wish they had added more from the book. But if you limit the customization, you can not add everything I like. How terrible is it ... I think I'm brutally selfish now ... forgive me. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes are a bit rushed. However, they mention all the important points in which, even if you only see the movie and decide not to read the book, you are very happy with the result. <br /> <br /> The actors are just great! BRILLIANT even! Sally Hawkins (Sue) and Elaine Cassidy (Maud) have such good chemistry on the screen that they spice up your TV. Simply electric! The emotions ... the despair ... the struggle that each of them feels is expressed effortlessly by these wonderfully talented actresses. Rupert Evans plays as good a bad guy as a gentleman. Every time he came to the screen, I cooked, but I loved it, because he's so damn cute and somehow still charming, even though you want to wrestle his neck. Imelda Staunton gives another fantastic performance as Mrs. Sucksby. She's such a warm-hearted actress that she can not help but love her ... even if the character she plays is not so appealing. Everyone else in the cast was perfect! They represented the characters really well and were exactly as I imagined them after reading the book. <br /> <br /> This is a must for every movie fan! Actually EVERYONE and EVERYONE should watch this movie AND read the book! You probably will not be disappointed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars from me! There are only four other films that I have rated the same. It is very rare for me to enjoy a movie so much that I give it 10/10. This is one of those movies. Fingersmith is a true masterpiece!
