The Ascent (1977) <br /> <br /> Larisa Shepitko is a name few know. Her brilliant career as a director lasted only a decade and ended abruptly with a tragic car accident. Despite her short career, however, she managed to make some of the best Soviet films of her time. Her last film, The Ascent, is widely considered one of the best Soviet films of the 1970s. Nevertheless, her work remained hidden in the following years, usually only in rare and bad copies on video. This has changed thanks to the people of Criterion. They have released two of Shepitko's best works through her Eclipse section - Wings and her penultimate masterpiece The Ascent. <br /> <br /> In the darkest days of World War II in snowy rural Russia, two partisans trudge across the country road in search of food after their party was attacked by Nazi patrols. They are originally only to go to a nearby farm, but when they arrive, they are destroyed by the Germans. Since they do not want to return empty-handed, they move on to enemy territory. Along the way, they must face not only enemy soldiers, but also the harsh conditions of the Russian planes, potential betrayals and their own souls. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into simplified action devices or destinations. It deals with difficult questions with painful reason. She never takes the easy way or gives us consoling answers. The second half of the film is full of moral dilemmas. Shepitko shows us the intimate horrors of war through the internal conflict between Russian fellow citizens - those who worked together and those who repulsed. While showing the collaborators as clear heels, she also shows why many turned to such tactics - survival. <br /> <br /> The film contains a series of religious references, especially about the Crucifixion. This is a spiritual journey into the hearts, minds, and minds of the two partisans and those they meet. Shepitko and her cameraman capture the journey in beautiful black and white photographs. The camera moves in long settings, similar to the camera work of another of the greatest Russian filmmaker, Andrei Tarkovsky. Shepitko, like many others, was clearly influenced by Tarkovsky's style, and the ascent takes some of his rhythmic notes from Ivan's Childhood. It's a stunning movie that captures the cold and scary atmosphere of occupied Russia. Shepitko's husband honored her great movie a decade later. Elem Klimov made his own war masterpiece with one of the greatest movies I've ever seen - Come and See. The story and themes of this movie were clearly influenced by The Ascent. Although this film is also quite dark, it received far more attention than Shepitko's films. However, this was a bridge to Shepitko and was one of the best ways to keep her work alive. The ascent is a really great movie and should rightly be considered one of the best films of the 70s. The breathtaking cinematography is inspiring. his mood is shockingly authentic; and his lessons are unforgettable. It is nothing short of a masterpiece in any definition of the word. How unfortunate that Shepitko's career was stopped shortly before the climax.
