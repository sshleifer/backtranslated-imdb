Stuey was a card that plays legendary. He was quoted in an interview with the words, "One day it's likely that someone is a better no-limit hold'em player than I. I doubt it, but it could happen I do not see anyone playing gin better could be like me. "There's a gin-rummy scene in this movie so amazing that you could have put it in" X-Men "as a showcase for the mutant power of a superhero. So incredible was this man. <br /> <br /> I have some minor issues with this movie. As dark as this movie was, Stuey's real life was darker. Poker pro Todd Brunson said: "During the last World Series of Poker, Bob Stupak, Mike Sexton and I had a drink and talked about Stu. Mike told us how he could barely talk, had not showered for weeks, and how his fingers were from burned black in a can. "michael imperioli was far too healthy in the film to be in the last years of his life. When Stuey won his last WSOP, he looked like a skeleton, but let's be honest, this production lacked both the time and the "deniro" to do that kind of transformation. My other problem was that I wish it would play more poker, with real hands and situations. Sure, it could have bored the average non-poker enthusiast, but it would have been nice for the hardcore. pity the movie lasted no longer than 6 hours. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie with 3 non-poker players and everyone enjoyed it very much. Just as you do not have to be a former member of the Colonial Army to enjoy Gibson's "Patriot," you do not have to be a poker player to see this gem. I can not wait for the DVD. (8 out of 10)
