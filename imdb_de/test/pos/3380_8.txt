I just saw this movie on its first night out of curiosity and pure nostalgia. I liked (not loved) "Mork & Mindy" as a kid, mainly because of Robin Williams crazy energy performance. This movie reminded me why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin definitely was. What brings me to this movie. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised and expected nothing more than a chronological retelling of the series (which, in a sense, was like that). But the real focus was of course on Robin. It was interesting to see how Robin's journey was from a stray street bird to a national star, and how such a drastic difference influenced him and his suffering wife. My hat is in front of Chris Diamantopoulos when he portrayed Mr. Williams with integrity, sensitivity, and heart; not just a sweet impression, even though it was dead. (In a disjointed note, I noticed that Robin's struggles were somewhat like Andy Kaufman, who was underrated by Network TV and creatively restrained, but that's the "taxi" behind the scenes.) <br /> <All in all This was a very funny movie in which I felt I had met a little more of the man behind the hurricane. The drama was solid of everything - never melodramatic, as I suspected - and the story went well. Especially good performances were made by those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi Robin haunts!). By no means a great masterpiece (I would have liked to have seen something more about Pam Dawber), but definitely worth seeing, especially for the fans of Robin Williams and "Mork & Mindy". Nanoo, Nanoo!
