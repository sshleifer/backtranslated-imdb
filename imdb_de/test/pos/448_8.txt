Anatole Litvak staged the 1959 film "The Journey" with Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Anne Jackson and Jason Robards. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and concerns a group of travelers who are having problems leaving Budapest due to political problems in this part of the world. They are taken by bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Major Surov (Brynner), confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards), posing as an American, but in reality a Hungarian freedom fighter whom the major believes has been smuggled out of Hungary. In fact, Lady Ashmore (Kerr) hides him. It becomes the center of the major's romantic attention. <br /> <br /> Very good movie that conveys the excitement and anger of the Cold War and all the performances are wonderful. Brynner is particularly suited as a passionate major who is not all bad, and Anne Jackson gives a realistic, powerful performance as a pregnant woman who does not want to give birth to her child in a communist country. <br /> <br /> Screenplay, good director, good cast - so there should be more films. Highly recommended.
