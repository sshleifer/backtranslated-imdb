SPOILER ALERT - AND I MEAN IT !! DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED THAT A GREAT PLOTELEMENT HAS ALLOWED !! <br /> <br /> Okay, first I have to say that I have a relatively high tolerance for depressive movies. I will watch or appreciate films about true horrors of life (like war and the Holocaust), or where death and sadness are important to the plot, BUT I hate movies like STEAL MAGNOLIAS and BEGRIFFE where the film is built around a manipulative death is a protagonist No matter how well this movie was made, he has a MAJOR strike against it because one of the main characters eventually dies of a disease (though they never say WHAT he had in the English subtitle version). <BR /> <br /> So you ask yourself, "If this blow-hard hates this kind of movie, why did he even look at it?" You have an excellent point to ask for that, though I hope I'm not really a hit! When I found it in our local library, I had no idea what it was about !!! The film was not specifically designed for export as the subtitles were in Korean, English and Japanese and the box was printed in Korean only. Well, I'm a fan of films from all countries (I've seen movies from probably at least 30-40 different countries) and I've tried. <br /> <br /> Well, aside from the compulsory death, I loved the movie and hated it the way it ended. I usually hate wondrous Hollywood endings, but I wanted to see the guy rescued by a new drug or experimental surgery. I was really annoyed that he had to die - especially as he was one of the nicest people I've seen in movies for a long time. His smile was contagious and I really wanted him to bring the girl in the end. Well, at least I can appreciate the message of the film you need to take advantage of the moment. Great acting, music etc., but not the most satisfying ending for me. This movie was good enough to encourage me to try more Korean cinema.
