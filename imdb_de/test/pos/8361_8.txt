Like many other episodes in the Twilight Zone, one of my favorite parts was the overt social comment Serling makes with the story. As with a recent episode "The Howling Man," I was reminded of my long-held suspicion that Jesus, for example, if he came to earth to bring his followers to heaven, would immediately be declared crazy and likely thrown into one Asylum. Our protagonist in this episode encounters a similar problem if she wants to convince the Americans of the 1860s that he is from the future and President Lincoln is to be murdered. The episode falsely claims that this means that some parts of the past can be changed while others can not, but it's still a fun time travel. <br /> <br /> Granted, we do not know if history could be changed by time travel, because time travel has never been done and unfortunately will not be. But it seems logical to me that if you could physically place yourself in a time of the past, you could physically prevent something from happening unless you were screaming like a madman about murder. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting things about time travel films and TV shows, in my opinion, is the method of time travel. There is really no method here, our main character is to talk about time travel in a posh gentlemen's club and then go out in the resolution between the early 1960s and the mid-1860s, but no matter. The twilight zone has not impressed me yet because of their complex sets or high production values. Russell Johnson plays the role of time traveler Peter Corrigan, and when he discovers that he has somehow been transported back. On the day Lincoln was murdered, he manages to jail, but fortunately for him, John Wilkes Booth was out for some reason at the police station and listened as the desperate Corrigan tried desperately to describe the murder that Booth planned for the night. <br /> <br /> Booth asks Corrigan for some psychiatric experiments, and the cop does not mind giving this man custody. He had a business card, how bad could he be? <br /> <br /> The show seems to suggest that you can change people's lives by changing events in the past through time travel and while I'm changing something I'm not ready to accept that time travel has such limitations It's still a funny episode that really makes you think. This is one of my favorite qualities of the good twilight zone shows ...
