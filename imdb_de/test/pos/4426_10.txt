I have just returned from this Oscar-winning doc, and I was deeply moved and interested in exploring the works of this colleague of whom I had never heard before. Of course, I am someone who is fascinated by beautiful architecture, so I realize that others do not care. <br /> <br /> We can only imagine if there were some visionaries in Philadelphia in the late '60s when Kahn's plans were possible, what a wonderful city center it would be. If you're wondering if you'll see more about the building in Bangladesh at the beginning of the film, be patient as it's the culmination of the movie in the end. <br /> <br /> His son's personal discoveries in making this film are very interesting, sometimes touching and sometimes even funny. There's one of the weirdest anti-visionary rants ever captured by a camera. <br /> <br /> To top off the good points of this document is a touching music score with outstanding, expressive string music. And expressiveness is an essential point in Kahn's architecture. The points made by other architects about the spiritual nature of matter, and how Kahn's buildings made it, combine the overall experience of this film.
