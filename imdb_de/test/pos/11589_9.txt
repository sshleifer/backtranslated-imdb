In Spain, former sailor Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has been paraplegic for twenty-eight years and is fighting in court for his right to practice euthanasia through an association defending freedom of choice and his friend Géne (Clara Segura). Ramón is introduced to the lawyer Julia (Belén Rueda), who has a degenerative deadly disease. and meets Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a lonely worker who has been abused by men. Their relationship changes the behavior and perspective of the life of Rosa and Juliet. <br /> <br /> The Chilean Alejandro Amenábar is in my opinion one of the best contemporary directors. His filmography published in Brazil consists of excellent and original films: "Abre Los Ojos", "Tesis", "The Others" and "Mar Adentro". Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain today. Her association created this sensitive drama on a very polemical theme, the right to commit euthanasia. This drama is never hackneyed or depressed as the script uses humor as a relief valve in dramatic situations. The performances of the cast are perfect, with characters having and defending different positions in relation to this unpleasant topic. The dialogues and lines are very solid and intelligent. In the IMDb plot description, I've found that this movie is based on the real story of Ramón Sampedro. Unfortunately, neither the movie nor the DVD provide this important information. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mar Adentro" ("Sea Inside")
