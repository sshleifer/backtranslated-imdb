Not only is it difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants the opposite: view them in the order of blue, white, and red, and consider them as one complete work. It is true that they are different stories with different themes: freedom, equality, fraternity, and each of them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and art. They are worth seeing independently, but I believe that they are best seen as a work. Together, I would rate the trilogy as 9; I put everyone in the top ten for the years 1993 and 1994. <br /> <br /> The color red is memorable in the third film as the background of a billboard advertisement, whose profiled model is the central of the film's three main characters. The other two characters make a double impression of varying recognition when they first come across the ad, which is vital to survive at a busy city intersection. This ad is not an integral part of the plot of this movie, but the image becomes conspicuous and is one of the reasons why I called Red an "insane" movie. This is the third of Kieslowski's three-color trilogy, based on the blue-and-white-red of the French flag and the three parts of her motto "Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood". The films focus primarily on these topics and stick to the basic levels of one, two or three main characters. With each film, however, the complexity of the plot becomes greater as the three principles shift from fundamentally personal (Liberty, Blue) to relational (equality), white) to social (brotherhood, red). Red is my favorite of these movies, and I give him a 9th. She's a great movie, but you should first see blue and white to get the full effect.
