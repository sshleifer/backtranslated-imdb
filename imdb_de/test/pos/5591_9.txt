This story of the problems caused by an over-possessive, overwhelming, dominant and unscrupulous mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two adult sons and their girls is a powerful tool for excellence by Irene Dunn (the new daughter, Law), Joel McCrea (number one son), Eric Linden (number two son), and Frances Dee (son of number two). Here is the show of pure tyranny of Mother's jealousy and obsession, running amok when four good people see their own lives damaged, their plans changed and their own identities in danger. Irene Dunn is outstanding in her role. The performance of Joel McCrea is open and clear, and Laura Hope Crews is a masterful mother. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this reviewer finds the performance of Frances Dee the best. She is the first figure in the story to show the strength of her inner feelings. Her portrayal in her hurtful scene with broken engagements is brutal and even raw. Dee pulls the viewer around and drives you into her pain without showing her face! <br /> <br /> Like Laura Hope Crews, Frances Dee has been overlooked for too long and is almost forgotten as the great actress she was. No actress who started filming after the Second World War had anything to say to Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> If you are fortunate enough to see The Silver Cord, which has never been released for television, you will find the "Old Fashioned Salon Drama" an outstanding movie that is 74 years after its release Shows very well in 1933 because he is filled with excellence.
