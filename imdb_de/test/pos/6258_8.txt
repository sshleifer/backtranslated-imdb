This little movie is reminiscent of a few other films, but maintains its own style and mood. "Troll" and "Do not be afraid of the dark" come to mind. The suspension builders were good and just crossed the line from G to PG. I especially liked the non-stereotyped decisions made by the parents; In other films, I was able to literally predict the dialogue, but the writing in this film made a better choice. If you want a movie that is not disgusting, but gives you some chill, this is a good choice.
