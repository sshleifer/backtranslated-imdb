A new and innovative show with a great cast that holds you to the edge of the seat. Lake Bell is wonderful ... its a shame that their other show "Miss Match" has been canceled. I'm just glad that she came back to "Surface". I can not wait to get "Surface" again. This show is really unique. With a sinister underwater world that resembles the Jurassic Park, you wonder at this show, what's next. Nim is adorable, even if he turns into something bigger and more evil. There are so many generic shows that seem to warm up the same old motifs. If something like "surface" comes, you just have to say "THANK YOU".
