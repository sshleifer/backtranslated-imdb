This movie has everything! It has a good plot, good acting, great scenery, adventure and some great gags! Chris Farley plays Tommy Callaghanhe, the mega-successful company Callaghan Auto Parts. The problem is that Tommy does not know anything about brake pads and needs the help of Callaghan auto parts operator Richard (David Spade). From the moment the two dorks hit the street, the movie is just so much fun. If you love slapstick with a great action, you'll love it, because the gags are getting denser and faster, and the movie will just make you laugh! It was so sad about Farley's premature death in 1997, but one of his genius's merits is "Tommy Boy." Get it, relax and enjoy this brilliant slapstick!
