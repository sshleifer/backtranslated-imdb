Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey), head of a seriously understaffed Insane Institute, takes a "progressive" approach to treating his patients and even allows his loons the freedom of the building, day and night; he pays the price for his forward-looking thinking when he rather fools to chop wood with an ax as a therapy for one of his patients and therefore confuses his neck with a trunk (tolerate him the right not to suggest basket weaving). <br /> <br /> Shortly after this tragic incident, nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to position herself as an assistant to the doctor, and discovers that the facility is now being run by the much stricter Doctor. Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick). Although Dr. Dr. Masters was unaware of the decision of her deceased predecessor to employ Ms. Beale and was not particularly anxious to recruit new employees, Dr. Masters to have the pretty nurse start her work. But after some heart-wrenching hospital experiences, Charlotte wonders if this is so. Perhaps it would have been better if she had been turned away. <br /> <br /> It does not take a genius to figure out what actually happens in the hospital. The "insane asylum seekers" is a premise that should be familiar to most seasoned horror fans, but SF Brownrigg's "Do not Look In The Basement" still proves to be an entertaining piece of drive-in fun thanks to its well-defined collection of idiots: lobotomised, lolling Sam (Bill McGhee); Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), who keeps mumbling phrases from the courtroom; old Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) reciting William Allingh's creepy poem The Fairies and warning Charlotte of the impending doom; Ginger Loon Danny (Jessie Kirby), who is pleased to annoy the other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr), who believes that her doll is a real baby; Army Nut Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and best of all, Allyson King (Betty Chandler), whose rejection by a number of men has left a craving for love (ie, she tries to jump any man approaching her). <br /> <br /> These compellingly crazy characters, a bit of gore and nudity, sensible instructions from Brownrigg (who also gave us the formidable White Maulhorror Scum of the Earth) and a solid twist from Playboy cover girl Holotik, will all be to success Otherwise, rather predictable, inexpensive exploitation in a very well observable psycho shocker.
