It's a good movie in Vienna about a taxi driver, Toni (Donald Buka), who steals the identity of a passenger when the passenger is shot while sitting in the back of the taxi. This gives him an identity because he is an illegal immigrant, but he has to play the role of the victim until he gets a ticket to the US with a ticket on behalf of the victim. Ms. Manelli (Joan Camden) bumps into him, but is accused by her husband Claude (Francis Lederer), a concert pianist, of having mental problems. This will leave Toni off the hook. Claude does not want to leave his wife, but she runs away from him. There are several changes of plot, and finally Toni and Ms. Manelli make it together - both try to flee their lives in Vienna. The final is exciting and exciting. Will they escape ..... ?? ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the picture quality is not fantastic and there is a line that runs in the middle of the picture for a while. The actors are all very good in their roles, especially Francis Lederer's portrait of Claude. Also important for the story are Heinth (Manfred Inger) as owner of the taxi company, Marie (Inge Konradi) as a friend of Toni and the inspector (Hermann Erhardt). <br /> <br /> It's a good movie.
