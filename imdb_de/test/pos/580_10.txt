This is a movie that will surely brighten your day. Kermit the Frog is just an ordinary frog in his swamp when a talent agent comes by and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs to see in the movie (lol). Along the way, Kermit meets Fozzie BÃ¤r, Miss Piggy, Gonzo and his chickens Camilla, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. But also behind Kermit is owner of a restaurant chain, Doc Hoppers French Fried Frog Legs. All in all, however, Kermit and the Muppets are coming to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This film is recommended for everyone, young and old. <br /> <br /> He has wonderful musical numbers like "The Rainbow Connection:" I'll return there someday "and" Movin 'Right Along. "The Muppets also use a lot of means of transport in this film Kermit rides a bicycle, Fozzie driving a Studebaker and another car, Gonzo flies with a bunch of helium balloons (which is one of my favorite moments, by the way;)), and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets finally travel the rest of the way through the Electric Mayhem bus (Dr. Teeth, Floyd Janice, Scooter, and Animal) meet them in the desert after Fozzie's car breaks down, and even some Sesame Street muppets make cameo appearances (ie, Big Bird walks down the street (on the way to NYC) The end is also a heartwarming moment, every single Muppet can be seen in the final scene with a recent "Rainbow Connection" release. <br /> <br /> But these poor muppets have worked so hard on her film set, that then everything collapses and the camera explodes in a huge spark ball. You might think that everything is ruined and destroyed. But the rainbow shines through the roof at the end, and it all sums up the magic of this movie, and you know everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10/10. Watch the video and you'll love the fun and sadness of this movie.
