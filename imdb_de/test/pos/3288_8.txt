Enthusiastic electronics fan Brian Foster (a sympathetic performance from "Land of the Lost" by Wesley Eure) creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (beautifully played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is on fire. A rival company hires a pair of incompetent criminals to obtain C.H.O.M.P.S. this task turns out to be easier than done. Director Don Chaffey tells the amiable, stupid story at a constant pace, maintaining a friendly dull and carefree tone, and staging the silly slapstick gags with considerable flair. In addition, the game has packed it with contagious talent: the adorable Valerie Bertinelli as Brian's sweet fiancee Casey Norton, Chuck McCann as klutzy Crook Brooks, Red Buttons as McCann's equally limping partner Bracken, Jim Backus as bad CEO Mr. Gibbs, Hermoine Baddeley Als nice old biddy Ms. Foster and the AIP exploitation of the 60s, the regular Larry Bishop is used as a smarmy, double suit by Ken Sharp. Best of all, the titular doggie is a cuddly joy: C.H.O.M.P.S. Jumps through fences, walls and windows with amazing agility, looks exceptionally powerful, runs faster than a deer and even performs some sophisticated martial arts moves. A subplot about a giant neighborhood dog named Monster provides a few extra belly laughs (monster is voiced by an unrooted man with a correspondingly deep, growing voice). The groovy animated opening sequence, Charles F. Wheeler's brilliant cinematography and Hoyt Curtin's funky, vibrant disco score are also solid. A sweet little kids movie.
