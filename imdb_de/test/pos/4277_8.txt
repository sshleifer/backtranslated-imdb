My husband and I saw last night ... It was wonderful ... Once he had been wrong to guess the exciting ending beforehand. It went very fast and the acting was great. I still love Tom Wilkinson. He has never made a bad movie. The above description of his play hits the nail on the head ... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque landscape is fantastic. We've just seen all the Prime Suspect series and I'm convinced that the British can captivate the audience. There is no doubt that I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a few hours of thorough conversation.
