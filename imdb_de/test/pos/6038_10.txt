This is another of my favorite Colombos. It has a top cast, including John Cassavetes, who was never prettier or sexier, Anjanette Comer, Myrna Loy and Blythe Danner. Now I've always wondered - was Gwenyth Paltrow born when this episode was filmed, or was Danner pregnant at the time? Thanks to IMDb, I have my answer - she was five months pregnant. Now I can feel really ancient. Cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to Danner was supposed to use her mother's (Loy) social connections. He has a mistress by the side, Anjanette Comer, a prominent pianist, but she announces that she wants more. She is tired of being behind the street. On the night of her concert, he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide. Columbo immediately picks up a few problems. One thing he says: "You have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money, a body and a career, where is the man?" It is wonderful to see Falk and the good friend Cassavetes together. There's a very funny episode at the vet with Columbo's Bassett. Everyone in the cast is great. <br /> <br /> This is one of the episodes that made Columbo the classic series they have become.
