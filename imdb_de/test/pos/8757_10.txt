I was really looking forward to the original six-hour mini-series, based on Steven Soderbergh's latest film, and now I'm happy to say that one is no better than the other. They are intelligent, engaging and extremely entertaining. The only real benefit the Miniserie has over the movie is that it's three and a half hours longer, so we get to know the characters in more detail. <br /> <br /> There is no wrong note In this production, it was definitely time for PBS to resubmit this miniseries sometime in 2001. You will not regret it.
