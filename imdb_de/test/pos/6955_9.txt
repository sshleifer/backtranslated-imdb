Jay Craven's criminally ignored film is a sober breath in the generally narcissistic and derivative world of independent film. First of all, photography is a pure aesthetic pleasure that captures the gloomy beauty of northern New England in late autumn (cameraman Paul Ryan has made the second part of the Malick Days of Heaven). Secondly, the performances are consistently outstanding - Rip Torn's Noel Lourdes is unbelievably charming and Tantoo Cardinal's Bangor is both sensitive and exuberant, not to mention a good minor cast. Overall, however, it is a tribute to the narrative power of the film that history maintains a strong and lively pace as it unfolds at its own time, and the film comes to a conclusion, natural and sincere but not expected seems to be. This is one of the rare cells of dignity in the independent film world, a film that explores a small piece of the interface between man and history.
