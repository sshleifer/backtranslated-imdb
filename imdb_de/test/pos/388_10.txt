Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers, and many of them have been hailed as some of the greatest films of all time. A film that gets lost under Vertigo and Psycho is this movie. Strangers on a train, the most compelling film Hitchcock has ever made. The story tells of Guy Haines, a tennis player and a man who will soon be married to the senator's daughter if he divorces his current wife. One day, on the way to his wife, he meets mentally unstable Bruno Anthony on a train and soon gets into a murder plan that he can neither stop nor stand still. and one that could ultimately cost him his life. <br /> <br /> The conversation between Bruno and Guy on the train is one of the most fascinating and thought provoking cinemas of all time. What if two people "exchanged" murders, freeing themselves from any suspicion of the crime and making their motive irrelevant? Could that really be the perfect murder? What makes this movie all the more frightening is that the events that Guy is led into can happen to any ordinary person in everyday life. Everyone has someone they would like to get rid of. What if you met a maniac on a train that kills you for murder and forces you to do it? The likelihood of this happening is unlikely, but it is the idea that anyone could be a murderer central to the strangers' message in one go. and in this situation everyone could. <br /> <br /> Is there an actor on earth who could have portrayed the character of Bruno Anthony better than Robert Walker? The man was just born for the role. He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and dominates every scene in which he finds himself, absolutely. The character of Bruno is a madman, but he is not a madman. He is a calculating, captivating person and Robert Walker makes the character believable. His appearance is extremely malicious and yet unobtrusive enough to keep the character firmly in the realm of reality. Unfortunately, Robert Walker only died one year after the release of Strangers in a Train, and I believe that this is a big loss to the cinema. No one in the cast shines as much as Walker, but worth mentioning is his co-star Farley Granger. Granger never really impresses, but his performance is good enough and he can stand up to Walker. Remarkable about his performance is also that he represents his character as a very normal person. and that's the way it should be. Ruth Roman is said to be Guy's wife. She's not really in the movie enough to make a lasting impression, but she makes the most of what she has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter Patricia takes over the final role of the four central roles as Barbara, the sister of Guy's fianc√©. She is appropriately nice in this role and tends to steal many of the scenes she is in. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is always sublime, and that's the way it is in this movie. There is an attitude in which the murder of the film is committed in the mirror of a pair of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant setting that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. Hitchcock's direction is whimsical and very much in the film noir style. The climax of the film is both spectacular and exciting, and I do not think anyone but Hitchcock could have achieved the effect shown in this film. It's really over the top and not visible from the rest of the movie. But it works. There is a reason that Hitchcock is often referred to as the greatest director of all time. The reason for this is that he not only uses the script to tell the story of the movie, but also the camera to do so. Strangers on a train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. His story is intriguing and thought-provoking and will thrill any cinema fan. A masterpiece.
