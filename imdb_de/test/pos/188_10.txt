I've tried to see the Oscar winning foreign films. I came across this jewel. It starts slowly when it has declared war. Basically an old-fashioned girl waiting for a boy to return from the war history, the performances, the cinematography make this much more. Why Tatyana Samojlova did not become an international star as a young woman afterwards is a mystery to me (though she continued to be successful in her own country). They take the journey with them: a young, defiant, impetuous young girl who, through the ravages of war, becomes a very sober, gloomy woman holding a glimmer of hope (her last scene is devastating). We love her as much as the camera. And the camera work! Was this the pioneer in manual camera work? This really adds an immediacy to the story. And the beauty of it (as if Tatyanas figure runs up the stairs and next to a picket fence). I am humble and thankful to see this movie.
