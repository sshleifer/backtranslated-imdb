An unfortunate reality of post-Soviet Russia was that human well-being has not changed significantly since the Soviet era. As we see in "Window to Paris," most people are still as depressed as ever, as they are encouraged to seek money. Then everything changes for the music teacher Nikolai Chizhov after he finds a window leading to Paris. Of course, he and his friends are quite surprised by what they find. This movie has one of the funniest discussions about Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf I've ever heard. So watch this movie. You will love it for sure. It's a kind of precursor to being "John Malkovich".
