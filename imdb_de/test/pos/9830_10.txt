Random Hearts is a very purposeful, well-rehearsed and perfectly cast actor for the lead roles. I found it so intense that you have to stop in almost every scene and wonder how Harrison and Kristin are together, how their characters deal with this terrible situation they are in. Very talented spectacle of both. A lot of people I think did not appreciate the movie as it was, did not understand the point or could not even figure out a situation like theirs. You have not seen the movie yet. <br /> <br /> I loved the end, which was a big surprise that connected the whole movie. It was a relief to see how these two good people in the end can become happier. <br /> <br />
