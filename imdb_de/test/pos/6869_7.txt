There is not much conspiracy in this film. There is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife will sue the hospital for negligence. Not much more than that, but .... IT DOES NOT! <br /> <br /> It does not matter because you have some real actors who bring your dialogging life to life, and because of the cast you have yourself hysterically funny scenes and even if you do not laugh, you have a smile in it Face. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays Charley, whose wife has recently passed away and is the object of several women's craving. He is happy to try everything on the menu that is available to him. Then he meets Anne Atkinson (Glenda Jackson), who is initially a patient in the hospital (her first joint scene is very funny), and then they meet in a discussion show on television, where they disagree on almost any topic are being discussed. <br /> <br /> Charley starts liking Anne, and vice versa, except that she is very much into monogamy about the men in her life (her husband was a cheater) and they decide to try it - two weeks loyalty. <br /> <br /> I will not give away anything else, but I would like to mention the chemistry that Matthau and Jackson have on screen. She's not usually the first person anyone would think of for a romantic middle-aged comedy, but her exposure to the comedy is very light and pleasant. She is accompanied by Matthau, who is as charming as ever, at every turn. He does not have to play Mr. Sensitive or Mr. Macho to get the girl, he just has to be himself. <br /> <br /> Art Carney is a pure uproar as a practically senile physician. The scene of the ashes of the baseball team owner buried on the home plate is invaluable. He also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. Richard does not have much to do in this movie, and most of the time he's just the direct man to Carney and Matthau; The role does not tax his considerable talents, but he had had a good time making this comedy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended ... 8/10 <br /> <br /> PS. For your information - Matthau presented Jackson with her first Academy Award for Best Actress, and Jackson presented Art Carney with Best Actor for his role in Harry & Tonto.
