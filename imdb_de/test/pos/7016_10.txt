I heard this movie from a friend for the first time. She loved it and always looked at it. When she told me about it and how old it was, I immediately decided that I would not like it. I was so wrong. Dirty Dancing was such a great movie! I love the music and dancing. I bought the soundtrack and the DVD immediately after watching. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray were brilliant. They captured the emotions and feelings of the characters so well. They were both such good dancers. After watching the movie, I wish I could dance like them, and hopefully soon I'll be dancing Ballroom and Latin. I've become a fan of this kind of dancing and am now excited about all the films and programs. Dirty Dancing showed my passion for dance and music. My favorite parts of the movie are when Baby walks into the staff of the wand and sees her dancing and of course the last scene where Baby and Johnny dance together in front of everyone. I think that everyone has to see Dirty Dancing once in their lives. If not, it is her loss !!
