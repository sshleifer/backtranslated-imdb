I looked at the original Outer Limits in real time when I first aired, and since then I have seen the entire original series repeatedly in repeats and on DVD. I find the new outer borders GOOD MORE than just a remake of old, retreaded episodes, as some of the youthful commentators have suggested. <br /> <br /> With only seven (7) years of programs compared to only two (2) In the years of the original series, the producers and authors certainly have a much longer-running and very well-produced (cable) TV series with considerable new ones Original stories and philosophical lines provided. Actions are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future. While most Hollywood producers and directors regard sci-fi as indistinguishable from horror and fantasy, this series returns the origins of science fiction in the logical, moral, and philosophical projections of current new technology into their potentially frightening short-term insights. This series does very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the "shoot-em-up" video game monster of the current generation. It has brains, history, a message and good conversation. It's an adult series with no unbearable teenage fantasy. Hooray! <br /> <br /> Well, if only we can get MGM to release the entire New Outer Limits series on DVD rather than just the six poor teaser discs, the first season is now only available.
