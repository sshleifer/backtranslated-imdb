Honestly, I first saw this movie because of the unsatisfactory sex scenes I've heard, but when I really looked at it, I realized that there are still good and decent movies. It's really one of the best developed movies I've ever seen. I am a teen bisexual, and the film talked to me about my predicaments - sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. - He gave me an idea of ​​how to deal with these issues with the help of my own self and other people who love me , I can handle who I am for. Cox has mastered the movie really well by spraying dozing heart-warming lines and a little sexuality in it. That made the movie more interesting. Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain, but I do not agree. Brokeback Mountain has more drama, while the Latter Days are well balanced.
