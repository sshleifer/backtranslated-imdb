I was one of the lucky people invited to watch this movie in New York. It's an enthralling story of how a group of extremely close friends dealt with the September 11th tragedy. This movie made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit can endure through love and friendship and create wonderful things from one of our dark days. The filmmakers have really captured the emotions of the people involved. It was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of many different people. I went out of the theater that day and wanted to call all my friends, just to say hello. I would recommend anyone to see this documentation. I would rate this movie A ++++++++++. See it if you have a chance.
