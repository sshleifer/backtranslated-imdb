I have always been a fan of this largely invisible Gershwin opera film since I last saw it in 1959. As many of you know, it was not available on video or DVD; In fact, the Gershwin family tried to destroy all existing prints. <br /> <br /> But for some reason - hopefully putting an end to the resistance, the Gershwin family recently approved the exhibition of a collector's print in the Museum of the Moving Picture in Astoria, Queens. <br/> <br /> Well, the widescreen Technicolor print was excellent! (Not perfect, but excellent.) The sound was excellent, in stereo quality in roadshow quality. The people who saw this in their original version would not have seen a better copy. (The program notes include the original Variety check, which warns people might disturb the steep $ 3.50 limited-release ticket price.) <br /> <br /> And as much as I loved it originally, PORGY AND BESS was better than I remembered. It's just wonderful. Sidney Poitier, like Porgy, was at the point where his career was burning and his charisma was shining through. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is spectacularly beautiful. Brock Peters as a crown is aggressive male. Pearl Bailey as Maria offers some weird moments, though her role is small. And Sammy Davis, Jr. steals every scene he's in as a Sporting Life; He's particularly intriguing in his two big numbers, "It's not necessarily like this" and "There's a boat that is Leavin 'Soon for New York." (The latter received applause in the show I saw.) <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS is fixed, but it does not matter when the set is as great as this one. The costumes are also excellent. <br /> <br /> Sidney and Dorothy's vocals are recorded, but they are extremely well recorded. The exquisite "Summertime" is sung by Clara, played by a young Diahann Carroll; her singing is also synchronized. (Actually, only Pearl and Sammy make their own voices.) <br /> <br /> The music is, of course, sublime, but what really impressed me this time was how much emotion Preminger pulled out of the story. People actually sniffed the audience several times - once when Bess sings the beautiful "I Loves You Porgy". I got a kick from the audience and laughed aloud at the lines in "It Is Not Need Not So". Could it be that they have never heard this song - or never really heard it? I believe the emotional impact of this film is largely due to Poiter and Dandridge's performances - they are rooted in their love to win. <br /> <br /> A small error with the 136-minute runtime - one or two slow spots and a stereotypical scene by Amos-n-Andy, in which Bess saw a Shyster lawyer divorce from Crown even though she is not even married to him. (I would have cut that.) And the beginning is a bit confusing - both title characters are awkwardly introduced - they are part of the movie before you realize who they are. <br /> <br /> And I prefer I do not think Preminger used a single close-up throughout the movie. It all seems to be shooting in 3/4, which in my opinion was his way of working with the widescreen. <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS has always been a cult movie for those of us who have seen it for those of us who loved the soundtrack and for some of us who have just heard of it. Let's hope they find a way to republish this and release it on DVD. It deserves the widest possible audience.
