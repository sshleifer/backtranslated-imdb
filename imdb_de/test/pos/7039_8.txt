I loved this show. I actually left the pub ten minutes before closing and ran down the street to catch it. I remember Daniel Peacock's sketch about Gandhi in the papers as a masterpiece. The scenery and lighting were out of this world and created an atmosphere in which you really lived. V unusual for a comedy. Unfortunately, I only met one other person (apart from the other) reviewer here), who knew that this program existed. In fact, I have to thank the IMDb for creating it and for showing me that I did not present the whole series in a drunken haze, which I seriously started to believe!
