(Note: I saw I SELL THE DEAD at the Glasgow International Film Festival on January 20, 2009.) I Sell the Dead is a deep-black horror comedy that plays in the late Middle Ages, and stars Dominic Monaghan (Lost, Lord of the Rings). Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Larry Fessenden (Session 9) and Angus Scrimm (Phantasm). <br /> <br /> The film opens with the grave robber Willie Grimes (Fessenden), who is still indignantly and relentlessly dragged to the guillotine and executed. His trainee and criminal Arthur Blake (Monaghan) is imprisoned in the tower, waiting for his turn when Father Duffy (Perlman), a whiskey-wavering priest with unhealthy interest in occultism, turns him off with a visit with the apparent intention of visiting Blake's last shoot Confession. However, it quickly becomes clear that Duffy's main interest lies in the more mundane side of Blake's achievements. Much of the action here is narrated in flashback form as Monaghan Duffy charts stories of his macabre career. <br /> <br /> Next, Grimes and Blake begin as the simple, knowing-cracking body-snatchers of the fearsome Dr. Quint (Scrimm), a callous, corrupt anatomist who uses blackmail as a lever for our two antiheroes and has a rather unhealthy taste at work. The two met for the first time with the undead when Quint sends them on a mission to a gloomy moonlight moor one evening to fetch a corpse that was mysteriously buried at a crossroads, apparently in accordance with ancient custom. But this corpse has something else. This was wrapped in garlic cloves ... and buried with a stake in the heart ... <br /> <br /> After a terrible encounter, they not only devise a plan to rid themselves of the intriguing doctor's machinations, but they reveal also a mysterious subculture of occultists who pay good money for corpses and even better money for FOODS of the undead. This leads our dauntless duo into the hidden underworld of ghoul hunt, where they not only face head-to-head with vampires, monsters, and zombies (and another paranormal entity for which I do not use the surprise). but also rival ghoul hunters in the form of Murphy clan with inbreeding and murder. <br /> <br /> I went to I Sell the Dead and expected a restrained, slightly distracting low-budget cooler. I was not prepared for the incredible imagination, the dizzying humor, the quality of acting, the great dialogue, the thick atmosphere and the sheer personality that makes I Sell the Dead a strong early contender for my horror movie of the year. Apart from a few rough edges, the production values ​​are really fantastic for such a low budget strip - it looks like it was made for around $ 20 million, and I was surprised when the director told the audience it was essential Half of it was done (although he was not ready to give exact figures as the film was still sold to dealers). The "look" and tone of the movie is a visual comic book somewhere between Tim Burton and Hammer Horror, with small, small creepshow artwork. The plot is wonderfully surreal, but the idea of ​​a hidden underworld that runs parallel to everyday life but the people can not or do not want to believe in is quite reasonable in the context of the film.>> <br /> Acting as you do it expect this cast is first class. The characters are surprisingly strong, especially Grimes and Blake, and all performers put their spiky lines in the cheek with just the right amount of dead tongue to make the dialogue funny and realistic. Angus Scrimm also offers a good performance in a somewhat short but memorable role as a gentle menacing violinist, Doctor Quinn. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - I loved it. It's been a long time since I was so entertained by a movie. I'm struggling to find something bad about it. Mark my words, this is one of those cult movies like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still discover and fall in love in 20, 30, 40 years.
