Three ten-year-old children, born at the same time during a solar eclipse, murder anyone who insults them by secretly killing them. <br /> <br /> While killer children's movies were not new at the time of this twisted 80s slasher, the theme of kids killer works well for this movie. Bloody Birthday delivers good cold and tension as he manages to be a competent killer thriller with strange qualities. It lies on a narrow line between cheesy and creepy, but remains entertaining with an interesting storyline. There are some strong murder scenes and a good nudity to call this a solid Slasher culprit. <br /> <br /> The cast is doing a good job. Young stars Elizabeth Hoy and K.C. Martel delivers some threatening gigs as rising stars Julie Brown do a striptease before a memorable murder scene. Veteran star Susan Strasberg is good as a teacher and Jose Ferrer has a cameo. Everything about this off-beat slasher entry is not bad, although admittedly it's not flawless, but it's worth looking at for genre fans. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
