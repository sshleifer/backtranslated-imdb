Too much added with too much away from a big western, McMurtry vs. the Texas Rangers. the Indians was written. This script only takes this away to fill this mini-series with many warm fuzzy relationships that were in truth secondary to the main story. It ends with an absolutely incredible and freestanding ending that is not written in the book, and lets you wonder how we should be transported to Lonesome Dove was excellent, but this miniseries should be faithful to a great book.
