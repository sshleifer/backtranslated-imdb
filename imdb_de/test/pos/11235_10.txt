It does not matter what this socially retarded person says above, this show is hilarious. It shows how many single men are in a bar atmosphere and also shows that women are not as gullible as men think they are. <br /> <br /> The competitive aspect of the How is really cool and original. It's not the standard reality show that we're all used to today. <br /> <br /> Give everyone a chance, we're just an episode, we finally have a Canadian program that's not absolute crap. As Canadians we usually get Bon Cop, Bad Cop or Corner Gas. People show that we are all not as prudish as the previous reviewer. <br /> <br /> Away to the comedy network that gives a new show a chance. The panel is funny and the participants are pretty good so far.
