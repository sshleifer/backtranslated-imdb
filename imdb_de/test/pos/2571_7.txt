In "Black Snake Moan," author and director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with the heavy symbolism that part of me felt like the movie was overbearing - a sultry southern parable with an oh-so-risky theme. The film also contains a heavy spiritual subtext, in which religion is drawn into the picture - this in turn is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film blunts more and more, until the whole production sounds like the artificial quality of a stage play (and I admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far in "Happy Ending"). Not to mention the archive footage of the musician Son House, who think about love and death (and of course the predictions for future events). Strangely, however, these flaws are also qualities of "Black Snake Moan", the story of the aging of Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently dumped by his wife (for his brother), who met his death Rae (Christina Ricci, who easily represents the hottest depiction of celluloid trailer dropping); He nurses the girl back to health and chains it to his cooler to overcome his demons and hopefully save his own fallen ego. While Ricci has to watch a decidedly hard-hitting sight as she falls out of her tight outfits, her performance is risky and mature - finding no sign of Wednesday's Addams, and she can easily compete with Jackson, who plays "The Blues." in his portrait of a faulty, God-fearing man. The scene in which Lazarus Rae sings a song in the midst of a thunderstorm / blackout is compelling, as is a scene in a bouncing blues club you wish you were there for. The attitude is strong, and there may be an argument that the literal symbolism (chain, cooler, strange, blurry man following Raes libido) is a conscious outgrowth of superstition and spirituality. And it is the conviction that this spirituality is played that gives "Black Snake Moan" a lot of power - the dedicated performances of Jackson and Ricci make this film a film that leads from ripping to awakening with seamless grace. While Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a conspiracy I could indulge in without, neither he nor the subjectivity of the sledgehammer can prevent this mesmerizing meditative film.
