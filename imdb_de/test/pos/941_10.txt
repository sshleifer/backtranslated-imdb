A fantastic movie with great Aussie talent. Director Mark Lamprell dealt with the possibly sobbing topic in a humorous and refreshing way. Definitely the highlight of the Brisbane International Film Festival 2000. Australian film veteran Sam Neill was, as always, fabulous in the role of Frank's university professor and New Talent's Matt Newton, who provided a performance where people would say, "Knowledge You, Bert Newton, Matt's father! " Get out of this movie !!!
