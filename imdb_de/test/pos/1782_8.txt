This is the episode most likely related to her partner law Thou Shalt Not Kill, as she directly raises the ever-controversial question, "Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing is wrong?" This issue is presented in two parts in the episode: The Murder, when the film shows the dichotomy between the idealistic, aspiring lawyer and the mugger who has gotten in his way, that his life is just a representation of what he is This should be the case, followed by the time after the trial and before the execution, when both must suffer from the deaths they feel responsible for and therefore share. <br /> <br /> One of the great things about the way they occur The episode work is both in the small and in the big way, in which the story is fully developed, so we both the Understand motivations as well as the story of the characters with whom we can spend just less than an hour. Despite all his criminal intentions and ridicule, the killer is still very sympathetic and turns the most important part of his actions around the story of a random death. His way of killing is more of a desire to control death than any desire to actually destroy it. Similarly, the lawyer's idealistic naivety shows that one is unwilling to allow death in a world where he can not control it. Your meeting is indeed important. They both have to give in without spreading them. By the way, it's interesting how much this episode affects the reputation of Rouge, Kieslowski's later graduation of the Trois Colors trilogy. One of Kieslowski's greatest influences seems to be the idea of ​​justice, and considering that the Decalogue is a meditation on something that represents divine justice, this seems to be almost the most self-assured. - PolarisDiB
