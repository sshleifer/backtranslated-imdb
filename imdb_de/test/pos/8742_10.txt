With a sentence of moral ambiguity. There are good and bad guys in the Soderbergh remake. The character of Benicio del Toro is clearly the good, morally clean and incorruptible. His counterpart in the BBC original, Fazal, the farmer who became a dealer, is realistically flawed and conflicted because of his fate. The two relentless policemen differ similarly. In the American, they win our hearts. In the BBC original, they are overzealous and almost obsessed. <br /> <br /> The best moment for me in Soderbergh was when the student rhetorically asked the drug tsar: "What would you do if you were poor? Black and rich whites came to your neighborhood looking for drugs?" This point was hinted at throughout the BBC show and crystallized in Jack Lithgow's last speech. Both are excellent, but the BBC towers above the remake. My conclusion, after seeing both shows, is that traders are innocent farmers who only supply one demand, and it is the demand that causes so much suffering.
