I just got home from the radio. I have not seen such an inspiring story in a long time. My children are 8 and 5 years old and I would like to take them with them so that they can "feel" the message - they should try to find the best in people and love them for what they are and not because of their differences. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris each earn an Oscar for this film. I do not know why we can not have more films of this kind than the garbage that is served daily in cinemas.
