Serious. If this had been the first Shack movie, it would have been funny, stupid, and stupidly passable. Light satire comments on the class system would make this a pleasant nightly rent. <br /> <br /> However, everyone wants to compare it to the first movie, and maybe that's not fair. The first film is a cult classic; what could it track? Nothing. Take this second movie as a loner, and he certainly has his moments. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason is amusing and does his best to give Rodney wannabe imitations. Is he as good as Rodney? Are his lines so good? But he is funny. The rest of the cast is decent, but not outstanding. They will recognize faces among the performers and wonder how they got to where they are today. <br /> <br /> The movie is predictable, but are not the most in this genre? Again, it's not the best comedy you'll see, but if you enjoy the Cannonball Run type, you'll enjoy it.
