I was a bit wary of this movie. I've always been a bit weird with Claymation movies. I've always enjoyed decent animated films, but Tonmation has always been different from me. But that surprised me. Wallace and Gromit are extremely lovely characters and it's a great story with jokes for all ages. There are the stupid jerks / fart jokes for the kids and the subtle, but over the head of little kids, jokes for us older people. Very well-groomed Claymation and while the story had holes, she kept my interest from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It is so rare that pure and genuine humor is found these days. Wallace and Gromit do their normal thing eradicating HUMAN beetles that are ruining people's vegetable culture. But this time they are fighting a kind of crazy giant rabbit that can not even control their humanly built traps. Great laugh and have fun for one and a half hours. If you have not exposed Wallace and Gromit, I highly recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I think he's 7 and not above is that he's still a family movie and has no kids. I enjoyed it, but if I had seen it with a few little carpet rats and my wife, it would be at least a 9 in any case! Try it!
