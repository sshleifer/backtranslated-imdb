Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan are both outstanding in Johnny Tos's tense thriller, which shames most Western efforts. Think of it as the "heat" in Hong Kong, only better! Everything about the movie screams class; From the performances to the soundtrack, from cinematography to script. The tone remains consistently serious, but the film has a nice line in terms of humor, friendship and romance. Sure, it will be a bit absurd later, but it would be a hard-hearted viewer who found nothing to love in this movie. Thankfully, Hollywood has not (yet) made a classic and ruined. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
