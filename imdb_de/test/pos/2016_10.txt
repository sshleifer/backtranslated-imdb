I loved this movie. It is a very simple act and, to my understanding, it is based on a true story. Growing up with Hard Rock / Hair Metal in the 80's may have something to do with my love for this movie, but apart from the music, it's a really funny movie. Try it, you'll like it, unless you're the toughest critic and just like movies with "Citizen Kane" caliber.
