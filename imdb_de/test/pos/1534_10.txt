Even the trailer to this movie makes me cry, as if I had seen this movie for the first time. Not for people who are easily upset by intensive material! The most beautiful performances of Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe without a doubt. This horrible story of a society that has the power to kidnap and torture its citizens for whatever reason, whether they are anarchists or the author of children's books, will cool you to the bone. I saw it when it came out in 1991, and I remember every frame. It still scares me today. Now it happens. <br /> <br /> Apparently, IMDb needs ten lines to meet its criteria for a film review. IMDb wants to get a grip! Some of us are a bit more precise in writing opinions.
