An example of brilliant filmmaking. The epic story of three great stages of a boy's life told with eloquence and raw fearlessness. Rarely does a film come out that makes me say aloud during most of the contemplation, "This is a really good movie ...." over and over again. That's what happened when I saw this movie. I really do not understand how someone might not like it. I was in those moments when I cried and laughed and could not control how I felt about the scene. The spectacle is outstanding. Eric Mabius: Why is not he on movie screens everywhere? He was really extraordinary. His seemingly effortless on-screen attempt profoundly influenced me. I thank him. In my opinion, Eric Schaeffer is one of the best filmmakers, and I hope that he will continue to face the challenges he faces as he tries to give us art in the face of cruel commercial filmmaking
