I have to say that this must be the best documentary I've ever seen in my life. I first tell the movie to my friends and did not get a chance to look at it. From that point on, I spent my free time finding the movie. I never found it, but on my birthday, my friend, who knew I could find the film the hardest, got it as a gift. Sean Penn tells the documentation very well. I loved it, as the story of each Z-boy and the story of Dogtown told. I have been to Venice and surroundings many times and never knew what had happened until I saw the documentary. I did not get a chance to see the actual movie, and I've heard that it does not look anything like the documentation. I do not know if I really want to see the movie, but who knows.
