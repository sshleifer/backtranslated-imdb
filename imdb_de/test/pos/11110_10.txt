I think the fame was the best movie I've ever seen. In a way, it was funny and dramatic, but that's what makes a movie. It does have a few loose ends, actually a lot, but I still think it's a great movie. Some of the fun things happen during the audition at the beginning of the movie. I think it's funny when the girl tries O.J. Simpson in "The Towering Inferno" and Raul / Ralph go to every art department and say his father was great at everyone. He says his dad danced with the Rockets and left Ralph's quilted shoes. The rockets are, as far as I know, made of women. And the quilted shoes were just ordinary shoes with bottle caps on the bottom. Also the guy who read the lines of Julia in Romeo and Juliet was funny. One thing that interests me about the movie is the music. I've never heard anything like that !!! My favorite song is "I Sing the Body Electric" and my second song is the title song "Fame". Irene Cara has a great voice and is a great actress. I like the way the film has focused on many ethnic groups. It turned out that there are all sorts of people in today's "La Guardia School of the Performing Arts". This film showed the victories and examinations of many young artists, including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary and Liza. They all had a hard time, but they did it their way. This movie could have been added about 30-45 minutes before graduation, but it's still my favorite movie, no matter what!
