I was impressed with the story. It had the "typical" predatory gay man and the "typical" Mormon missionary. But they also had friends and family members who balanced their lives well. There are a number of characters, some nice and some not so nice, each with their own personal nuances. And most of them reminded me of people in my own life. The story begins with several humorous moments and slowly develops into a heartwarming relationship film. The story goes on without obvious changes of action and never speaks down on you. It makes you think for a while while you wait to see what happens. Even when I thought I could predict something, I was surprised how it actually came about. <br /> <br /> Not many films knowingly bring me over real gay dialogues and bring me a tear when I feel the pain of the characters I've watched the movie on DVD and could not bring myself to stop seeing until it is over. (Usually I see a movie in pieces for several days.) It's nice to see a movie with gay characters that is uplifting but not preaching. I highly recommend this movie! And not just for gay viewers. The relationships transcend sexuality.
