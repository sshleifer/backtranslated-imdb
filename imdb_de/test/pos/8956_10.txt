I first saw this movie in 1994 in the Istanbul Film Festival. It was so good that I took some friends with me and saw them again that same week. The characters are played very well and the humor here and there is amazing. It is certainly a very powerful gay movie. For some scenes, you may feel that you are seeing a succession of friends with far more complex lines. I guess I'll put it in my VCR and watch it again tonight ...
