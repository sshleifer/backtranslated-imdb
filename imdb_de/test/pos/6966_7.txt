Since this movie was on IMDB Bottom 20, I just had to borrow it. <br /> <br /> SUPRISE! SURPRISE! I have not regretted this movie at all. I really enjoyed it. In this film, there is a layer of the camp that shames cult classics of the 80s. Is that stupid? yes, but Jim Wynorski proves stupid is not necessarily bad. <br /> <br /> Rent it for a laugh that seems unintentional but is supposed to be funny. Wynorski is a genius. I hope he leads the next Ninja Turtles movie
