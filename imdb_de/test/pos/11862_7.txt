One Night at McCool's is one of those films that start with a terrible promise, but when the movie goes on, it becomes stupid and loses its way a lot. Liv Tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to find her own way by showing off her body to every man she meets. They all fall under their spell. There are a few funny moments, but they get less and less, the less the movie becomes a comedy farce. Michael Douglas, who plays the assassin, is as good as Liv Tyler, even if she looks like she has gained some weight since the Armaggedon. That's fine, but it's only possible for the scene where Liv Tyler washes her car. You'll know what I mean when you see it's a fur! Look !!!!! 7 out of 10 (even).
