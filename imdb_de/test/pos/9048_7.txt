Okay, I'll just admit that Loony Tunes' Inki cartoons are pretty offensive and I can understand why Warner Brothers took them out of the market. Today, the big-lipped and very stereotypical Inki is politically incorrect. The cartoons, however, were well done, and it's a shame that they will not be released with an explanatory prologue (such as that of Leonard Maltin, whom they recently recorded on politically incorrect Donald Duck cartoons on DVD). In other words, casting the cartoons means forgetting our story. There are also Inki, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons - especially on the internet. <br /> <br /> This Inki cartoon has our little hero on the hunt. First, he chases a cute little caterpillar, but later accidentally encounters a lion - a lion more than happy to make Inki dine. Despite all this, a funny Minah keeps appearing ... and finally you will realize why this bird is so important to the story. <br /> <br /> Cute, well done and smart. I like the Inki cartoons. In addition, I am pleased to be able to show them to extremely thin-skinned liberal friends, just to see attacks of apoplectis or even heart attacks. Have fun, people!
