People seem to be expecting Citizen Kane here! The Planet is a B-Monster movie and as such it is fun and different enough to be enjoyed. The director clearly has something to offer - with some actors, he is not so sure. How for the effects? Â£ 8000 is not much effect budget. I would recommend this tour to a sci-fi-head or anyone who does not take monster movies too seriously. If so? Instead, look at 3colours blue. I found in a review that Alien was demolished. As if Alien would not tear things down. The best thing about the movie? The director. The worst thing about the movie? The occupation. Maybe it's time for the director of Glasgow to move to London and find talent. Well done in the meantime. At least you're trying to do something.
