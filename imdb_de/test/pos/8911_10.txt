First of all, the alien rescues both a small black boy and a Mexican, regardless of what the IMDb plot summary suggests. This movie is the fulfillment of the purest male fanties, the interracial rapeseed. The main character in this film is a George Michaelesque dope who does not understand the original human needs such as drug abuse and murder. Every time he uses force to solve a problem, he has an inner conflict that physically impedes him. What a place. My favorite scene is definitely when he writes a letter to the gang members stating that they need the 500 dollars they receive from the reading center to protect them. At the meeting, he is surrounded by countless Chicano gangsters, but he keeps a cool head. In slow motion he strikes the wooden post of a stop sign that shatters when touched. Then, still in slow motion, the leader shows the gang and says, "Nooooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" Follow the gang members. Cool, right? The beauty of this film is reflected in these simple solutions to social issues such as prostitution and gang violence.
