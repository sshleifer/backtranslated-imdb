It's been years since I've had the privilege of watching this movie on TV. I just wish I could contact someone to see it again. I married a man with three children and two had fetal alcohol syndrome. I did not know that, but when I saw this movie, I learned more about their problems and learned more about how I love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My stepson is now 35 and thanks to the Lord he has blossomed wonderfully, but still has many aftereffects, as if he was born of an alcoholic mother. We talk to rehabilitation patients with alcohol and drug addiction every month, and this sharing has really brought about tremendous changes in their behavior, trying to start a new life that is not dependent on drugs and alcohol. Please let me know how to get a copy of the VHS or DVD of this movie or when the movie will be shown on TV again. If you were not in those shoes, you probably never understand its value. Many many thanks.
