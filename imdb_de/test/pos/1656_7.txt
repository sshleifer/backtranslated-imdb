"Rififi" is a terrific raiding film from which more cover films have since been made. Jules Dassin had a sense of the seedy underworld these thieves live in - you will not find the Hollywood glamor of "Ocean's Eleven" here.

They rob to survive, to pay for their children's education and to prove to themselves and others that they can offer something to the world. The much-praised Heistszene is a nail biter, which is turned in virtual silence. I felt that the conspiracy took a little longer than it was needed, but the speedy race to bring the child to his mother finishing the movie is classic. -This movie is very dark. But it is also very good. <br /> <br /> Note: A-
