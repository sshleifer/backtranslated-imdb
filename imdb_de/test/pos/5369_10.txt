I was ten or eleven years old when this movie came out, and he has stayed with me for 35 years. When the film came out, all theaters in the St. Louis area distributed a pack of flower seeds as the "bait" that had the name of the movie, etc. on the front. On the back of the pack it read in so many words ... plant these seeds at midnight. When a white flower grows, you are saved ..... but when a red flower grows you are doomed !!! Suffice to say that for an eleven-year-old child, I did not plant the seeds for fear of what might appear. Here's the spoiler: When the movie starts, you see a small toy tank moving in the dirt. On a small street, a family leaves the city, and suddenly the camera turns back to the tank and she is in full size. It rolls over the car, and you see bloody limbs coming out of the rubble, and just as suddenly the tank is small again. <br /> <br /> The reason why this movie got stuck with me for so long was because I had an exact toy tank like the one in the movie !!!! Unfortunately, I do not know what happened to him, but I've kept a careful eye on this thing ever since. <br /> <br /> Turn off the lights, put in the DVD, make a sandwich and watch this movie. It is very good!!!
