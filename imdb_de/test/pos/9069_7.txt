Peter Lorre is the owner of the title place one of his worst performances. The plot has a new government agent who gets Peter Lorre's character on track. When the G-Man's contact was killed by one of Lorre's agents, the G-Man is jailed for murder, though everyone knows there is more in the story. Lorre has released the man in his care and taken to his island, where he mined diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he does not talk, and a fight of the will is set in motion. <br /> <br /> This is a good, solid little thriller that does not make much sense sense plot wise, but nonetheless, the movie keeps your interest. I had hung up the movie last night to use it as something to move to. Instead, I found the story so thrilling that I had enough 70 minutes. Lorre is the reason why you fall into this matter. His right behavior is nervous. He does very little, but from his orders and the way everyone reacts to him (see how they light his cigarettes), it's clear he's a bad guy.
