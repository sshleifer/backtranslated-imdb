Based on the best-selling novel "The Dismissal," The Missing Star, the latest film by Italian director Gianni Amelio is the story of the growing friendship between an older Italian maintenance worker and a young interpreter whom he hires in Shanghai. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is the maintenance manager of a decommissioned steel plant in Italy and the sale of the blast furnace to China. When Vincenzo (Sergio Castellitto) states that a control unit in the oven is defective and potentially dangerous, he travels to China to find the steelwork where the part was sold to prevent a fatal accident. <br /> <br /> The movie is not about using a familiar clich√©, of course, and on this journey we can get a fascinating view of China, with all its immense beauty and complexity, with the help of Luca Bigazzi's outstanding film art enjoy. The film takes us to Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongquing, Baotou and a trip along the Yangstze River, which shows us coastal areas planned to be overpassed by the Three Gorges Dam by 1.2 million people. The journey puts travelers in touch with poverty, overcrowded housing and children who have to take care of themselves. The film revolves around the relationship between Vincenzo and translator Liu Hua (Tai Ling), who first meets Italy, where his impatience with her translations at a dinner meeting causes her to lose her job. When he locates her in Shanghai, she works in a library and resists Vincenzo's approach. His offer to help him on his travels to China was nothing more than a well-paid job, she reluctantly agreed to accompany him. Their relationship, however, grows with the transition from city to city, and their interpretive abilities are often proven to help the confused Vincenzo, who has no mobile phone. <br /> <br /> As they slowly open up, they reveal the vulnerability of the other, and the film delves into their past and present lives and how they came to their current situation. We meet Liu's son (Lin Wang) in her grandmother's house. In China's one-child policy, he is one of the unwanted children who have been "hidden" since the boy's father left the family. Although the meeting between Vincenzo and the boy is casual, their relationship becomes central to the making of the story. Castellitto is a great actor (although in this role you're looking for a younger Enrico Lo Verso). However, he is emotionally distanced throughout the movie, his expression rarely changes from a distant Hangdog expression. Although Tai Ling gives the role a lot of presence, her relationship with the much older Vincenzo never seemed real to me and the end seemed to exist only in a reality known as film. Although Amelio is one of my favorite directors and follows the brilliant Keys to the House, Missing Star is a disappointment.
