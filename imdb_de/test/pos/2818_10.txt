I love to see a female protagonist. Her name was Rose. Rose asked many interesting questions on her way to fulfillment. Is it possible to achieve peace and inner fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach that? Can one be a memory victim that can lead to others becoming victims? Is someone responsible for being a product of his environment? How can one control or control one's environment? How is a "typical" person the same or different from Rose? Would the result or the story change if it came from another country like France or Italy? I loved the fact that this movie provoked all these questions in me while he entertained, encouraged and advised me to finish! Every time I saw it, I learned more about the film and myself.
