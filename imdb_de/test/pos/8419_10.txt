Shwaas is great! Considering that the producers had a thrifty budget, they did an excellent job. It is a must. The little child has done an excellent job and many emotions flow through his eyes. Grandfather is at his best. The photography is outstanding. Technically correct and very creative. It helps to add many emotions to the mainstream content. The movie will keep you fascinated and do not be surprised if you are shaken up after the movie and the story lingers in your mind for a few days. > Enjoy it and do not miss it again
