OK, well, no one who's wise would shoot a movie called "The Man with the Braying Brain" and expect it to get serious. This is an outrageous B-movie, and that means a really hokey storyline, strange characters, clich√©s, exaggerated action, and oh-so cheesy insoles. For the odd part of the population (including me) who gets a kick out of such things, this is a gem. <br /> <br /> Trading is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in his character. Bruce Campbell delivers a spirited, compelling performance. His physical comedy abilities are really impressive in this movie and listen to the "Evil Dead" movies.
