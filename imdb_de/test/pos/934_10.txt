This movie is not only the last piece of the Three Colors trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best films of the 90s. There is hardly another film that is so clever and therefore demands humanity and respect for every human being. <br /> <br /> Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Although she has a boyfriend, she seems to be quite lonely. One night she has an accident and injured a dog that leads her to his owner, a retired Jugde (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who is cynical and spies on the phone calls of his neighbors. Disgusted by him, she can not get away and they meet again. Two lonely souls meet and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other. <br /> <br /> The story itself is too complex to be completely narrated. There is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and the true love of Valentine, and there is more to their relationship than just friendship. The actors are wonderful, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant develop a deep and authentic friendship. <br /> <br /> The themes are endless, brotherhood, not only in contact with each other, but also in terms of the right to privacy. Worryingly, we seem to lose this right more and more, making films like this even more important than they would have been in 1994. <br /> <br /> Red is one of the strongest colors that stand for inner turmoil. Love, anger and passion. Used here as another protagonist, it gives the film an unparalleled depth. A masterpiece!
