Although not quite as good as A Murder is, which was not only delightful, but almost surpassed the book, this is an excellent adaptation. And you know, it's a huge improvement over the Geraldine McEwan version. Now, I'm not proud to say bad things about Geraldine McEwan's adjustments, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started off well, but were ruined by either a bad script, a confusing ending or both. The Geraldine McEwan version suffered at a slower pace and both of the above problems. I would consider the second worst of the ITV adjustments, worst of all the Sittaford Mystery, which itself became boring and confusing. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a tremendous improvement, not only does it respect the book despite some freedoms, but it pretty much eliminates the problems that the ITV version had. Although Lionel's character is rather irritating and looks more like the way he was written than the way he behaved, and with one or two slow steps, this is a solid adaptation to a decent book , It is beautifully filmed, with beautiful photographs and details from the time, and the music is always excellent. The performances are wonderful this time and make the most of a well-done script overall. Joan Hickson shines as always as Miss Marple and solid turns of Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is outstanding in a daunting and moving performance as Clothilde. Overall, worth seeing and better than the current version in pretty much all departments. 9/10 Bethany Cox
