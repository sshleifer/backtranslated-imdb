This is an excellent movie, but Momento (Nolan's other big budget movie) is much better. I would recommend people to visit Momento and then, if they like it, to watch this movie. The film is shot in black and white, which annoyed me at first, but once you understand the movie, black and white is the best way to see the movie. It is extremely poignant and reasonably easy to understand, even though the way it is done is extremely clever. I think elements of the plot are a bit crazy, but the movie is definitely worth a second sight. The film has a clever plot, clever twists and turns, very good acting and the budget of the film. I have to say that it is quite amazing.
