Most of the people who participate in this film will have no idea of ​​Arthur Miller's great novel, which forms the basis for it. It is a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and changes people's lives. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Lawrence Newman is an ordinary man. The glasses his boss gives make him change everything he worked for, and his whole world gradually collapses around him. There could not have been an actor better able to bring this intelligent performance to the screen than William H. Macy. He is not only a talented stage and film actor, but projects honesty for every character he plays. He is an everyday person trapped in his own insecurities. His fear increases when he takes a stand and leaves his job. Suddenly, he has to deal with the problems he was trying to avoid in Brooklyn in the 1940s. Is he a Jew, right? The cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film, staged confidently by Neil Slavin, kept reminding me of some of Edward Hopper's images, especially of a sequence at the beginning of the film, when Newman left a building and the night he left and his wife were shot are pursued with long black shadows behind the couple, the confrontation with the thugs threatening and anticipated. Laura Dern, David Paymer and, above all, Meat Loaf, who gives the neighbor next door incredible depth, are excellent, but they are all pale compared to the stellar phrase of William H. Macy (H must stand for HONEST ..) If you can I would sincerely recommend this book because no one has written truer and more convincingly than Arthur Miller.
