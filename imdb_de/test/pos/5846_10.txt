Okay, I've read most of the reviews on this movie, as well as comments from visitors to this site, and feel that most people who have written reviews really do not like the movie. That's why I write now - I represent the minority because I did it. I admit I saw the movie because I'm very impressed with Ryan Gosling's compelling skills, and the projects he's been involved with lately have been no less than incredible. He is an amazing actor. Besides, I wanted to see this movie because it seemed fascinating ... why? Because it's a whodunit where you know "whodunit" from the beginning, and that's unusual. <br /> <br /> Two young teenage boys strive to commit the "perfect crime" because they believe in twisted behavior A philosophy that is truly free only by committing crimes - the uninhibited - and us should guiltlessly remember the will. The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex, pointing to homosexuality and brilliantly portrayed by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Gosling was the manipulating, commanding Smooth Talker, and Pitt was the extremely smart, socially awkward outsider. Enter the character of Sandra Bullock that most people did not appreciate. I think when people see that she was the executive producer, they automatically take over any role the actor plays in it, an act of self-glorification. I did not see this as a case. Without "Cassie's" personal story about the ex-husband who almost killed her and who, not surprisingly, had similar qualities to Richard Hayward, she would never have pursued her instincts about Justin and Richard. The case was apparently airtight to Ray, the unsuspecting schoolmaster and boyfriend. Even if the boys are questioned towards the end of the film, neither Bullock nor her partner have much solid evidence, except that they lied, that they knew each other, and that Justin let himself be seen. Therein lay the genius of the film, because the philosophy the boys tried to prove by killing turned guiltless action from will into "true freedom," ultimately worked against Justin, who eventually had a conscience (and in the end he left a part his conscience on the side of the dead bodies). Without this crucial piece of evidence, they almost had a "murder of numbers". And for readers who puzzled over the title as much as me, I've looked into it and found that something "by numbers" (such as a painting) provides careful and critical planning and accuracy. There is also a song by Sting called "Murder By Numbers", but that's not the point. :) <br /> <br /> Many readers questioned the need for the relationship between Cassie and her partner, but I think it should really show how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her story. Whether they like it or not, their story plays an important role in this film, because without it, they would probably never have followed their instincts over Justin and Richard. Yes, it was a bit of the clich√©d women who were despised, a woman who plays Vendetta in every facet of her life plan, but I think without the depth of Cassie's character you have just another movie about juvenile murderers, and they have it maybe get away with it too. There is no movie. <br /> <br /> And for the reader who said that the teenagers obviously did not commit a perfect crime because the police were there from the beginning, I can remind you that the reason was deliberately placed and complete trackable shoe prints. The boys wanted to be involved - it was a game. They were so confident that they had done the perfect crime, that they wanted to see the difficulty the investigators would have to find out what they thought was the truth. What they did not expect was that Cassie Mayweather had an unstable case working on her side. A bit unbelievable? Could be. However, many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts. This is a FILM! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the cinemas about three times and each time it gave me a little more information, and I liked it a bit more. The more I saw it, the more I became intrigued and shocked by the psychological depth of Richard Hayward - there are people who really like that. My main complaint about the movie is that they should have justigned Justin and Richard's interactions a bit more centrally (because, let's face it, there's the intrigue throughout the movie) and my main props are characterization - each character was very different and interesting in its own way. It was very well played, although I would have given Ben Chaplin's character a bit more depth (he's a good actor) and maybe downsized the character of Bullock a bit. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should stick to it. Note that a Hitchcock-type thriller that makes you start with "whodunit" is a great challenge for the writers, catching the audience's attention until the end of the day To end. I think they did quite well, using a few small changes of action, slow revelation of different character dynamics and lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. I think if we remove our innate cynicism and try to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are, we may be able to look beyond apparent plot holes and see the real texture and quality of this movie, if only in the characters were brilliantly portrayed , Especially Richard Hayward. Not that I'm bent over. :)
