I saw the movie last night without knowing anything about it (nothing else seemed interesting and I had a Buffalo connection to this movie - UB grad). It was a very nice movie. Liked the pace (it starts after a slow start) and the story. Well written plot and good character development and relationships. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to see movies with interesting stories. Later I talked about this film with a few beers - most discussions take no longer than a few minutes.
