I rented the movie and I liked it so much that I bought it. Elijah Wood (Mikey) and Joseph Mazello (Bobby) are outstanding as the two guys. Her new stepfather abuses Bobby physically. The abuse is for the most part implied, is not seen and aroused a great passion in me to help abused children. The film has a magical quality as the boys' imagination helps them deal with the abuse. You must try to understand the story from the perspective of a child. I'm still thinking about the end. I have watched the movie 3 or 4 times and every time I think about possible new meanings. I do not know exactly what Richard Donner thought, but this is a great movie! Joseph Mazello and Elijah Wood let your kids hug.
