The Centurions are one of the best cartoons of all time and must be shown on television and on DVD so that younger generations can enjoy such a good show that is far better than the trash they have produced in the past 14 years. I have an online petition located at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html and originally tried to get this show five days a week. Now she's trying to put this show on DVD. The TV station he was focusing on has bad publicity. We all have to convince the people who own this show to release them on DVD so that they can be seen by future generations. Since Hasbro Toys also owns the toy line of this show, we may want to try to convince them to make a live action movie out of it, just as they did with Transformers and sometime this year, G.I.Joe. We need good cartoons like these to come back and be enjoyed by the younger generations. Please sign this petition so we can one day have DVDs of the guys known for "Power Extreme!" To call.
