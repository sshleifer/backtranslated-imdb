"I know that I'm human, and if you were all those things, you would attack me right now, so some of you are still human, this thing does not want to show itself, it wants to hide in a mimic: you will fight if need be, but outdoors she is vulnerable, if she takes over, she has no more enemies, no one can kill her, and then she's won. "<br /> <br /> John Carpenters" The Thing "is one of the most entertaining horror movies ever made? Fast, clever and exciting from start to finish. So all the films of the genre should be made. <br /> <br /> The film, which took place in Antarctica in 1982, focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We are not given an introduction to their mission, but come into existence when a pair of crazy Norwegians show up in their base camp and chase a refugee dog. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way to the colony, and then things start to go crazy. <br /> <br /> It soon becomes clear that the "dog" is actually a form change foreign body that manifests itself in the physical form of its victims? In other words, it begins to eat the Americans and imitate them so well that the remaining people can not tell the difference between their friends and their enemies. The group of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), are starting to fight for their own survival, with joke instead of muscle. If the thing is actually among them, how should they reveal it? How many things are there? How can the thing be killed? (Or can it even be destroyed?) <br /> <br /> The creature's origins in the movie are easy to explain: Thirty thousand years ago, a spaceship crashed to the ground and was frozen in Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape and was discovered in the ice by the Norwegians, who unknowingly released him from his natural prison. The movie "The Thing" is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien" (1979) .Many comparisons have been made: the protagonists are stranded in a lonely area, pursued by a rarely seen opponent who manages to kill them one by one Thing "however, for all practical purposes" came first. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" By John W. Campbell, Jr. (under the pseudonym Don A. Stuart) The film was originally adapted by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby as a feature film production in 1951. The result was "The Thing From Another World", an undeniable classic, but to be fair, it had little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake will be more fair to him <br /> <br /> The idea that the thing can adjust the physicality of a person makes this movie essentially great and is the most important link to the short story In 1951, the special effects were just too sc Hard to rationalize the morphogenetic organism, but thirty-one years brought many advances in SFX. <br /> <br /> The Creature Effects artist, Rob Bottin, creates great opportunities to reverse what's possible. They have become a cheesy Gore festival, creating a frightening (and realistic) chaos of blood and blood Fear is. Although the thing never really takes on any specific shape, it is constantly seen in a morphing state, and the effects are simply outstanding. Twenty-two years later, they still pack a punch. <br /> <br /> The music of Ennio Morricone (currently nominated for a Razzie Award) is a bit too electronic and too slim, but still powerful when used properly. <Br /> <br /> The fact that his cast consists exclusively of men and the fact that his end is one of the most thoughtful and untypical conclusions of all time: "The Thing"? by any standards? is unconventional Hollywood at its best. It's no surprise that "The Thing" performed poorly at the time of release in theaters and "E.T." ?? released in the same year and with a much kinder alien? was by far the largest picture of the two (by far). <br /> <br /> In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every respect. The history of Spielberg is outdated and was re-released during the 20th anniversary. By contrast, "The Thing" has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics? It's one of the most famous, unidentified movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Carpenter is known for having a very uneven career? from his amazing "Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the great "Halloween" (1978) to the disappointing and stupid "Escape from L.A." (1996) "The Thing" remains his best film. Although his reputation over the years has never been honorable enough to find a spot on most "big movie" lists, "The Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films. at closer inspection ?? masterfully crafted. It is a bold and ingenious thrill that is both unique and chilled. a real relief for movie lovers who are fed up with the same old horror gossipers. At least this is really unpredictable.
