This short film will focus on a topic known as sociological shock. The film presents the situation of an average Romanian in democratic Romania, who finds out that life and problems do not differ from the communist period, and if you want something, you have to bribe yourself to get it, our protagonist is after He is about 50 years old and has to get a similar job, but the only available job is inferior. He is forced to take it because there is a lack of money. <br /> <br /> My opinion is that you have to live in Romania so that this movie can be as real and tragic as it seems.
