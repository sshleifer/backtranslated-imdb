AristoCats is such a terrific Disney classic that I loved so much as a kid. I still can not resist seeing it, it's just a wonderful and charming movie with great animations and beautiful songs. I really miss the animated films like AristoCats, they had perfect voices and the hand-drawn animation that makes them perfect for the family. AristoCats is also very funny and smart, the story was just wonderful. This film is simply irresistible, I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats learning to play the piano, lol, it was just so cute playing the piano and painting. Douchess and her kittens are very spoiled in their large mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats her like her children. But when the lady feels it is time for her will, she leaves everything to the cats, not her butler. The butler gets angry and takes the kittens out to the street and stops them in the middle of nowhere. Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a slick street cat named Thomas O'Malley they return home to their lady, but learn the coolness of a skate cat. <br /> <br /> The AristoCats are just a perfect Disney movie, which in my opinion looks a bit over the top. I would highly recommend this movie to children or families. The songs and the story are simply memorable. I will always join in for the best song of the movie "Everybody wants to be a cat", a great tune. I also love the dogs that guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned. They were just so cute. This is a terrific movie, please look at it, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
