I really enjoyed this movie and I'm not a classical music fan. The story of the tough street kid, who discovered classical music and changed its ways, was great to watch, without being sentimental or unbelievable, even though I had some details scratching my head (Frankie and his dog can live in the basement of the school The students or teachers who discovered him, where he ate, what did he eat with his dog, the owner of the school did not think it was important to inform the police about finding a missing boy but let him live indefinitely in the basement? :-)). But we can let slip such unrealistic details and just enjoy the touching, funny and (for me anyway) exciting story and wonderfully talented kids. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene where the mothers stand shoulder to shoulder on the steps prohibiting the police from entering the school: I doubt they would get away with it today. And I liked the nice gesture that Frankie had stolen when he turned the tables (though that never really went anywhere), and Frankie's friends helped him out in the end. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie for everyone!
