A really great, touching movie. Female melodrama at its finest, with a lot of comedy: great dialogues, characters and writing. Any woman can relate to the story because she's a classic: you're in love with Mr. Right, but he's not interested in you until a guy who seems completely wrong comes and falls in love. Of course, it's not that simple. The characters are real and all performances are perfect. The film is also funny, every scene spits the company. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a well-written script with humor and melodrama. They can relate to any character and the plot is moved in unexpected directions. A great, underrated movie.
