Then I returned from Morocco, where my father was attached to the German Embassy when the film was released in Europe; took all my girlfriends to see it, showed them the beauty of the land in which Jimi had played - and stayed -; where the hippies stopped after they left Ibiza and before they came to Goa. Sean Combs recently celebrated in a restaurant in Marrakech, the Djema el Fna was much wilder then today; The Stones had gone there earlier, Brian took in Tangier; It's memories and family entertainment, and I'm glad my son will get to know the north of Africa when he sees this movie. Candice Bergen looks gorgeous and oo7 / Connery is really funny; and Teddy Roosevelt as being played by Brian Keith quite impressive.
