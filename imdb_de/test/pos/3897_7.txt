As in "Columbo" we see that the casualties occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigator, Adam Arkin, is even fiddling, not unlike "Columbo." It's William H. Macy, as the movie critic suggests, who wears the movie. By constantly turning and twisting, the action sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his "perfect crime". William H. Macy fans will enjoy "A Slight Case Of Murder" as well as those who like crime abilities with all sorts of delicious options. Add a well timed comedy, and this is very similar to a beautiful episode of Columbo. Highly recommended. - MERK
