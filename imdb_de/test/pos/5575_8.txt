I remember ignoring the TV show when she debuted for the first time because of her "looks" with the Jim Hensen-Muppets. Recently, a friend had me borrow his Farscape DVDs, and I'm just starting to realize what a terrible mistake that was. <br /> <br /> Like any TV series, there are also episodes that shine and others that do not. I drive with adrenaline and emotional rush during the big episodes and suffer from the lackluster. However, I endure regardless of the core story that connects all the episodes together. What I'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other. I want to warn you, it is absolutely irresistible to look at. I can not recall any other television series (Babylon 5, Buffy, Angel, etc.) that intelligently and intelligently brought a (sometimes) heartbreaking and thrilling ride. In the fourth season, it finally got tight and I'm shocked at the decision to break off the series. I'm looking forward to the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible gem.
