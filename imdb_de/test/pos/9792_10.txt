I always felt that I was a child I loved this movie. I have always been a fan of Joseph Mazzello. The kid had pure talent in this movie and in Jurassic Park. I was looking for DVD or VHS to buy at a store near me. I can not find it, I find it on DVD! good movie anyway. If anyone knows where I can find this, please contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net. Can anyone really explain what happened to Bobby? Was she real or was he a forger and was he an imaginary friend and his escape? lol I am unaware. My favorite part was definitely where the monster juice was made, and it was spilled all over the kitchen. It's funny, but also a sad part, because of what happened out of the mess with Bobby because he played his part pretty well. I think the mother was a great actress. I think her name is Lorraine Bracco or such a name ... well, please contact me. <br /> <br /> wrp24
