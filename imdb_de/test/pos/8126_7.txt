This movie was a pleasant surprise because I did not expect much. I did not know that some of the actors have become bigger stars in the big pixels. While I move on to the Matrix, this is not a plus in my book (I hated it), but I'm sure it's a career boost for Hugo. James Purefoy is great in this and Jennifer Ehle cute and wonderful. It sometimes seemed like a Carnaby street that raged 30 years later, but I enjoyed the thrift store that Janis Joplin's clothes had blended with modern ways of thinking about sexuality and gender inequality. The real estate agent, who has an erotic relationship with his offers, is a lot of fun. The group sessions of the Iron John Mens are a bit dated, but I still loved them. It's a social satire-sex comedy that reminds me best of the old "Carry On" movies. The British know how to make sex comedy, and it's an old tradition, unlike the United States, which is too prude to really understand that sex is funny.
