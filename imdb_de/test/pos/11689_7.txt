Impressive. At first I thought, who writes these things! How hard is this choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth, respectability and security, as opposed to a husband who only offers you oppression, abuse, humiliation and poverty. However, our decisions are not always as clear as one would think. In fact, the rich gentleman was anything a woman could aspire to, and yet ... her husband's pull, her sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming. What to do what to do ?? As a viewer, you were as confused and misguided as she was. What I really did on this side was my admiration for the voice of Engish, I thought, though it's actually the voice of an Irish singer in the film. When I look, I find that he is Glen Hansard, of whom I had never heard anything before. What a find. I am so grateful. Wow, what a voice! What a day! Thank you BIFF!
