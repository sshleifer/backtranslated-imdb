After two short scenes, which at first do not seem to be related to the rest of the movie, we see a dark-haired, obviously rich beauty in the back of a sedan. Your driver stops at a strange spot on Mulholland Drive, a winding, heavily wooded, two-lane road full of villas overlooking Los Angeles. Just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turns to kill her, two drag racing cars crash into the sedan from the opposite direction. Only the dark-haired woman survives. She works her way down the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in an apartment for a holiday home. Shortly thereafter, Betty (Naomi Watts), the niece of the vacation woman, appears in the apartment and meets the dark-haired woman, who now has amnesia. The main part of the first part of the movie consists of Betty and the dark-haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why they tried to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. This is riddled with strangely surreal threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional trips to a land full of convicts and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> The above may sound a bit complicated and incoherent, but that's not half of it. The film is structured in such a way that the meaning is always interpretable. It is generally guaranteed that you will not understand this movie and you will not have much self-confidence when you come to your own interpretation the first time. Even if you have a lot of experience with like-minded films - like Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003), and The Butterfly Effect (2004) - you may not understand it second consideration either. The studio was aware that director David Lynch had "10 notes on unlocking this thriller" written, and they placed it on the back of the chapter entry on the DVD. Since Lynch has a certain disposition, these hints are almost as cryptic as the movie itself. It does not help to find out in the beginning that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a long time to figure out which parts are "real", and in some sections there is a complex nesting of flashbacks, with only contextual evidence that they are flashbacks. <br /> <br /> But is the movie worth seeing, or an attempt to find out? Of course that depends on your taste. At the surface level, if you are a fan of surrealism, the movie is certainly attractive, though it may seem a bit slow and overly disconnected to some viewers. These qualities and many other surrealistic aspects of the film are typical of Lynch. An important moment in Lynchian is that the old couple smiles bizarrely at the beginning, as if they are alien pod people trying to sit down at the front. If you are familiar with this style and you like it, you will find much to love here, even though Mulholland Drive is in many ways quite understated for Lynch. It's also worth noting that Mulholland Drive has a pretty hot lesbian scene for viewers who are mainly interested in it or who enjoy it as much as other aspects. It is not in vain, although I have no problems with the gratuity, but is an important pivot in the film. <br /> <br /> Like all Lynch films, it's easy to convince yourself of its unique approach to every aspect of the movie's art and attention to detail. Any serious film student (including "Armchair Students" / "Cinephiles") should study Mulholland Drive. many will love it. Lynch leaves nothing unmanipulated. He has brilliant color schemes (such as the abundance of reds and pinks) with significant symbolism. He unusually uses sound, such as the ringing phone that goes into the subsequent score (when Betty arrives at the airport for the first time). He instructs his actors to present their productions in a variety of bizarre ways, such as in his characteristic breaks. He lets his strange and surprising sense of humor pass through, such as the name "Winkie's" and the sign "Hot Dogs - made for Pinks", which gives an indication of some color symbols. <br /> <br /> Lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important, subtle clues throughout the film to unlock the meaning. It's interesting to note that Lynch even seems to demand that DVD programming be unusual. The DVD contains no chapters. You must either watch the movie in real time, or fast forward or rewind to return to specific points. <br /> <br /> If Surrealism and the veiled meaning of the movie are attractive to you, or if you're just excited about "puzzles," then consider Mulholland Drive for that. There is an accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad, general level. I'm not going to go into the standard interpretation here - it's worth investigating, but only after you've seen the movie a few times and come to your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs were written about the film and interpretations; There are even websites dedicated to the topic. <br /> <br /> For my money, although I love Lynch in general and find many things attractive through Mulholland Drive, it's not quite a 10 for me, at least not yet (I feel like my score is going to be later) For me, however, the twist aspect of the film is much better in other works like The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect, and Mulholland Drive is more attractive to me because of its surrealistic surfaces, but the plot does not do it so well Like many other Lynch films, <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Mulholland Drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd if you are serious about the movie and do not mind thinking about what you are seeing (as if these two are not necessarily coincide), you should not miss this.
