We're taken to a grocery store where Nick looks at coins in his hand and finds out if he can drink the special one, a 20-ounce cup of 20 cents coffee, which comes with a free pastry. He chooses the larger size, which of course is more expensive and does not qualify him for the cake. He tries to argue with the Indian employee at the law firm that maintains her. With her that is a fundamental question. Well, Nick gets irritated that he does not find his own way and continues to kill her. <br /> <br /> The tone of the story is set from the beginning. The people we meet are not nice people. There is Nick, his girlfriend Dallas and her partner Billy Hill. They are drug dealers. Nick decides to visit Casey, his friend and former criminal, in Houston. He wants to make another transaction and then go to Paris with the proceeds from the sales of his drugs. What he does not realize is that Casey has gone straight. He is an architect, married to Christine and wants to adopt a baby. Casey does not appreciate his former boyfriend bringing drugs into the house. He decides to get rid of the stuff by flushing it in the kitchen drain. The untimely arrival of Ice, a pizza guy, surprised Casey. This man was sent to kill him, but before that Casey brings out some weeds that he can share with Ice, who has a knack for knocking. <br /> <br /> At this point, the man is Dr. Jarvis arrives from the adoption agency. Casey's application shows a two-year gap that he can not justify. Jarvis doubts the future father. At this time, Dallas makes an entrance. She is a woman who asks questions, for example, if she wants to know if Jarvis likes to enjoy porn. Jarvis, who is agitated, goes terribly away. Dallas has decided to seduce Casey at any cost. There is a surprise when Billy Hill enters the picture and does not like what he sees and shoots Dallas. Billy Hill has also said goodbye to Casey but is overwhelmed. Casey gets Kasarov's visit, who wants to get his money from Nick; in his absence he takes it from Casey. Kasarov gives a deadline and Casey decides to outwit all those bad lives. He lets all parties come home at a given hour and the various factions will take care of themselves. In the end, Casey has a better plan that includes Christine for a stay in Paris. <br /> <br /> Since we had never heard of "Thursday", we were drawn in because of the talent. Skip Woods straightened his own material. This seems to be a movie with good intentions. Sometimes the film remembers other people of the same genre, not a sin or a form, which seems to be the main subject of the negative comments left here on the IMDb site. For starters, "Thursday" features a witty Skip Woods who has written other films, especially "Swordfish". The script is divided into chapters with suggestive titles that relate to the action. Denis Lenoir does wonders in interior photography. <br /> <br /> Thomas Jane makes a great contribution to the film with his Casey. Although hard to imagine, he has defeated the odds and made something of himself. This actor, who recently starred in the television series Hung, is one of the actors we never tire of. A dark-haired Aaron Eckhart is a welcome addition to any movie. He is a greasy criminal who shows no redeeming qualities or something close to remorse, and does not hesitate to include his former friend in his system. James LeGros has nothing to do. The same goes for Paulina Porizkova, a beautiful creature that is just a distraction, or a copycat to add a sexy angle. We enjoyed Glenn Plummer, who appears as Ice. He makes a nasty audition on the phone. Michael Jeter and Mickey Rourke also appear.
