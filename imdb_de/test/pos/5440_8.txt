The film is more of a model of corruption throughout the American system. The correlations of those who choose, who are irrelevant, show themselves so much in the machines that end the end of the vote of a comedian to the OV. Politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been laughing around the world for years. Bushism has become a way of life for Americans and will be the only one left after leaving office. Oddly enough, the only person of honesty is someone who has not even been elected to the position and ends up telling the truth. The story is very subtle and when you laugh, nothing happens. Leaves a lot to think about. Overall, I liked it.
