This film really proves that the world is too often an unfair place, especially the world of movies. "The Assignment" received little attention at its release and was not surprisingly flattened at the box office, but if history is written, this film will most likely receive a lost praise. <br /> I am surrounded by friends who know what is good for me. As a movie fan like me to be a friend, I recommended "The Assignment," a movie I had not even heard of. I decided to find out what Leonard Maltin gave him, and unsurprisingly, he gave it ** 1/2. Knowing that this is the same note, he gave classics like Alien, The Usual Suspects, and The Matrix (I do not fuck you). Without hesitation, I went out and bought it on DVD. That was about 3 years ago and the movie is still one of my proudest belongings in my DVD collection, despite a cover design that reflects a low budget stinker with Casper Van Dien directed to deliver some really intense moments They will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the movie and, moreover, it will provide a sometimes brilliant story that you know is pervaded with unexpected twists and turns. It's Aidan Quinn in one of his best performances and is supported by Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, both of whom are in great shape. <br /> <br /> Something like 40 out of 42 user comments like this movie Most of them do not seem to praise enough. So, what are you waiting for? If you think of yourself as a fan of action thrillers, you should have bought, rented, and seen it yesterday.
