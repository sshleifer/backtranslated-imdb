I caught this movie in one of the movie channels recently and I have not laughed so much for a long time. This movie was so funny that I bought the very next day. I love this kind of comedy. It just seemed as real as the actors here react to the different situations. I was Rollin. I had never heard of it and just started seeing "Seeing Other People" for the title. The title made me try it, and I'm glad I did it. I laughed so much that it hurt. Now it is part of my collection. I definitely recommend it to those who like a smart kind of comedy. I'll watch that over and over again.
