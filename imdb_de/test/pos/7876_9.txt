My second favorite movie from 1970 (after Five Easy Pieces) was totally rejected by many idiots and called a garbage basket, which lured the audience. Peter Boyle, a well-known Liberal, is unbelievable like the hard-nosed work star who has some problems with the younger generation. He is a scary guy, but has a great imagination and is very funny. I was a teenage liberal when this was released, but as horrible as Joe appeared to me, he also beat me up! Susan Sarandon is perfect in her first role and a jumbled rock-rich fox. The dinner scene in Queens is hilarious and enlightening for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This was NOT a movie for exploitation and the screenplay (which was nominated for an Oscar) should have won this year. The director just did not waste enough money to make it credible in Hollywood. No matter how and when you are persecuted politically, you like someone in this movie. A clear 9 out of 10 points. It's on DVD and video. Listen!
