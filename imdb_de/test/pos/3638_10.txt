Final Solution is a powerful Christian film that shows the hatred of black and white that existed in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate has been developed and maintained from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man is a plague. He was brought up to be like that. Then he meets a man who is on the other side of his faith, Pastor Lekota. will he change? The film is a powerful film that shows the perceptions that the different races had for each other. He shows these perceptions pretty much. The film shows the world of the effects of apartheid on the psyche of blacks and whites. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie everyone should see.
