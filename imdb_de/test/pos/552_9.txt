As a freshman at college, this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mother. Of course, my situation does not match the situation of Natalie Portman and Surandon. But my mother and I grew up with the typical mother and daughter fights. There is always the mother who tells you what to do or not the kind of mother you want to be. I closed my eyes at the end of this film. Surandon's reaction to her mile-long East Coast daughter reminded me of how I felt when I came to New York from a small West Coast town. <br /> <br /> The film is intended for women who have children who are now all grown up. It is very touching, the movie has moved me. Every feeling of the characters in this movie was absolutely real, you did not get any wrong sentimentality. At the screening of this movie, I sat alone in the credits and wished my mother would sit next to me so I could hug her and thank her for everything. This movie is of course a bit crazy, but everything is really meaningful. It's about what a mother can learn from her child; and what a child learns from his mother. 8.10
