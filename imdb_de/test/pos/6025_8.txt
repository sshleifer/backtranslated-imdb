The storyline starts out interesting, but in the end, too many die in too short a time and make the thriller-mystery aspect of the story a carnage. <br /> <br /> The only real highlights were Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who were once again their excellent selves. Nice try with an inappropriate last third, but good finish.
