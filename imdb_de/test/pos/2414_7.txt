<br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the first time shortly after being shown on video in 1995. I immediately turned him down and said Julie was not Daniel, never really gave him a chance and said he was terrible /> <br /> But here it is 5 years later, it's Disney and I'll watch it again on. And I think it's not as bad as I did. Miyagi is still Miyagi, as cool as ever, the score is still enjoyable as always. And Swank's character is not so bad, her acting is pretty good in terms of the script. It far exceeds the third rate. So my original rating of 4 was raised to 7.
