It is an interesting fact that metaphysics of Plato and Aristotle, formal logic and abstract ontology, are formed over these sciences that most people are not interested in. But then, about a thousand years after Aristotle, the computer began to rip up human thinking and thinking. People who refused to reflect questions of otherness as biological, physical, and chemical suddenly felt paralyzed because they had to deal with them Consequences that would bring these computers "overnight" could not cope. Fassbinder's "Welt Am Draht" together with Tarkovsky's "Solaris" and Godard's "Alphaville" is probably the first film that took the philosophical questions of emerging computer science as the basis of a story told in a movie. The confusing questions about identities and realities are skillfully incorporated into various interwoven criminal stories that the public really wants to follow, because it is interested in solving the cases. Fassbinder was a master who sold highly abstracted content to his audience by embedding theoretical knowledge in practical, appetizing forms. The basic problem to be understood is that an identity defines a reality, but on the other hand, a reality also requires identity in order to be perceived. The idea of ​​a person with multiple identities is known to us only from the point of view of psychiatry. Logically, the only reason we have only one identity is the fact that our logic has only two values ​​(right and wrong). Now take a logic with just one more value, d. H. With three: Then, as you can easily see, you already have three identities. What happens now, if Dr. Stiller, let's say, killed? Then it is quite possible that only one of three identities will be abolished and the other two will remain and be able to save the individual from death. Another question is whether a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once. However, the idea of ​​displaying such identities in an upward or downward direction, as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel, is misleading, since identities and thus realities are arranged not in a hierarchy but in a structure Heterarchic way. Strictly speaking, there is no "artificial identity" since each identity is defined by two objects that share all their characteristics. Therefore, the idea of ​​assuming that each individual has only one identity is nothing but a consequence of the ancient bivalent logic (a second identity would mean that a person coexists and does not exist). But now look around and see that the same object (which by definition is self-identical) is perceived by each subject in its own way. So, if every subject sees an object differently, why should it not be possible for the individual to open the boundaries of his bivalent individuality corset so that different persons can exchange their different individualities? Fassbinder would pick up on this theme in his masterpiece "Despair: A Journey into the Light" five years later.
