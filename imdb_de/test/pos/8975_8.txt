Aaron Sorking raises the same questions as Shakespeare. How could they possibly know so much about the inner life of palace life? Here, as in the west wing, Sorkin opens surprising doors that are hardly shocking, but seem to confirm our worst fears. Everything is so incidental and so directly responsible for so many people. A swollen Tom Hanks tells us, in one way or another, that things can be manipulated with half-naked intentions, but without weighing the consequences, and Julia Roberts in a blond southern hairstyle reminds us of the powers that are on the sidelines. The topic is serious, but the treatment is light, intelligent, but easy. Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he's in as an invisible middleman, just like Charles Laughton in every movie he's in. The dialogue is fast but not fast enough not to catch up and to discover that this is not a movie ordinary comedy. The seemingly casual pace full of wit and provocation gives the collection of Mike Nichol another mark of honor.
