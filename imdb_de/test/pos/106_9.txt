FIRE is not just an illustration of a lesbian love story, but also a comic satire of Indian middle-class culture (?). I think that's a quality that is little appreciated in the film. These two genres (ie deep meaningful alternative love story and comic satire) usually mingle like oil and water, but Mehta (somehow) manages to balance to near perfection. Behavior of the servant Jatin, the treatment of the family with him, the constant inescapable presence of the bedridden grandmother, Ashok's obsession with the teachings of a swami: I come from a culture very similar to Indian. They cried to be alerted and ridiculed. In developing her main theme, Mehta succeeds in skilfully achieving this secondary theme. In fact, much of the humor in the film, which provides substantial relief from the heavy issues of taboo-lesbian love and gender issues, stems from this seemingly everyday satire. The film flows from comic to serious with great subtlety. <br /> <br /> All in all, brilliant use of symbolic devices (Radha compared to Sita the Legend and comes out of the fire unharmed and therefore pure, the lifelong desire of the young Radha to finally see the ocean when he has freedom obtained). Kudos to Shabana Azmi (Radha), the light crew and Deepa Mehta; Their very un-Hollywood-like (and not Bollywood-like!) Talents made this movie something special. A criticism: The first scenes seemed to me to be rather incoherent, because they did not flow very well into each other. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 9 out of 10. No less for a movie with scenes that come to my mind.
