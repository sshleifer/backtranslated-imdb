I loved this movie !!! It was so easy to become part of the characters' lives and really feel the emotion they went through. <br /> <br /> A movie full of laughter, sarcasm, shocks and annoyance, really a fantastic romantic drama! /> <br /> The only part I did not enjoy was the peculiarities. The commentary behind the scenes was a little outlandish. Since I had watched the movie before the extras, I prefer to think of the actors rather than the characters (stupid I know), but the actors' personality is very different from the characters they play. But it's still an absolutely fantastic, spectacular, brilliant movie. I recommend to anyone who watched this movie and thought, hmmmmmmm, should I buy it? Answer must be a definite yes!
