This film has it all: fully developed characters, a realistic representation of Washington's work, bathed in warmth and humor that is unique. Muting network messages is even more of an issue now than in 1987. Remember, this was a cable in front of the cable! So satisfying that complex people strive to achieve complex goals - and all of this goes with lightning speed. Such a realistic representation of friendships that tend to romance. See if you can recognize John Cusack as an angry messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hackes from the Broadcast News? If you are from DC, you agree that you agree with Holly Hunter's instructions for taxi drivers!
