One of the best sitcoms on Indian television with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar. Great acting, good speed and a very amusing script made this series an unforgettable experience. The fun-filled opening assembly (sung by none other than the inimitable Kishore Kumar) gave a very accurate picture of what to expect. I borrowed it from my local video library for years after Doordarshan stopped broadcasting it. I wish Indian television would use shows like these, rather than asinine saas-bahu soaps and reality television, which is all the best for these days. Anyone who has found a really good comedy should get this series. You can also enjoy a few Pakistani sitcoms, such as Up and Down and aik aur aik, which are certainly comparable to the best in India.
