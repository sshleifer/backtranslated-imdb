Alexander Nevsky is a series of outstanding sequences of cinematic opera that shift from pastoral to lament and end in a triumphant cantata. The story takes place in 1242. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) defeats the Crusaders in a battle on the ice of Lake Peipus. The film is a great historical pageant, the director Sergei Eisenstein shows inventive and visual highlights and highlights in an excellent fight sequence, in which music is used instead of natural sounds. Some films have scenes that were heavily influenced by the Battle of Lake Peipus, including Doctor Zhivago (1965), Mulan (1998) and King Arthur (2004). Alexander Nevsky was not brought into circulation because of changing political winds and then anchored as perhaps the most influential Soviet historical film.
