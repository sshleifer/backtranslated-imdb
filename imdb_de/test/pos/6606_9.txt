A dozen bored surfers, mostly kids in Venice, California, are not only reinventing the skateboard, but are also turning a once-forgotten 1950s suburban home into an action sports revolution showing life in the rather run-down "Locals Only" beach communities around 1974, which consisted mainly of surfing in the early morning dikes and loitering. The Zephyr Team (or Z-Boys as they are called) spends a summer fighting boredom by building their own boards with the help of a local who owns a surf shop. After participating in skateboarding competitions in SoCal, they turn everything into their own scene. One that highlights a generation of skateboarders from greats like Tony Hawk, Shaun White, and the creators of X-Games. Dogtown puts the chronological perspective into skateboarding and the up-from-the-bootstrap story you never knew she had. <br /> <br /> by Andy Frye at MySportsComplex.blogspot.com
