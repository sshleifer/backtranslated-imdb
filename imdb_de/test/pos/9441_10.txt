Oooooh man, I was glad I did not miss that. I wanted to post this review because this episode does in particular what a particular new movie did not do. It's a true tribute to the game DOOM. The plot is different, yes, and the characters are obviously set in a completely different universe (obviously the doctor who introduces the universe), but the feel, tempo, references, and location are perfect. And for all the original Doom fans who pay attention to the door opening and closing effect, it was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Please all doctors, and Doom fans alike, take a look at this. It is a gem!
