When Pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, his probation officer found him for a job in a large city bank. When some of the crime underworld learn of his position from his past, they plan to take advantage of it and rob the bank. Pinky is appalled at first because he really wants to go straight, but when a turn of fate happens, Pinky begins to think that one should not look a gift horse in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Also known as The Mayfair Bank Caper (among others!), this is a very enjoyable piece that characterizes the 70s.
