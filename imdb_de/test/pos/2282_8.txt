A selfish major league baseball player must continue his career in Japan, competing with a foreign culture, a seemingly humorless manager, an attractive Japanese woman, and his own professional and social insecurity. There is a certain subtle charm that flows through Tom Selleck's performances. There is humor, sometimes gently understated, as in this film, sometimes slapstick as in "folks!", But it always seems to be a higher goal. Throw a self-doubting individual who struggles to solve his personal difficulties, "doing the right thing," and get a movie that is both funny and thought-provoking. The cast blends like a championship team, and even if neither cast nor film is honored for their efforts, they will make the audience feel good (and maybe that will be the best results). They want to watch this movie more than once, and every time Mr. Baseball suggests a homerun.
