WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT (2005) **** (cast: Peter Salis, Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter) <br /> <br /> Fantastic Sound Pieces: Wallace & Gromit Save the Day! Crackin 'Good Entertainment! <br /> <br /> Nick Park, the creator of the animated team of Wallace & Gromit, is a genius. His tedious art in the form of Plasitcine Claymation is a unique process that literally takes thousands of hours (it takes about 8 hours of workdays to give a movie 3 minutes of action, this foray for feature filming took 5 years!) Lovable master and faithful dog team is taking shape and is finally on the big screen in the duo's first feature film, and it's crisp (to pronounce a sentence from Wallace's usual answer to the best!) <br /> <br Park, co-starring Steve Box and with Mark Burton and Bob Baker, is sending the horror genre in this hilarious and dashing action comedy with the geeky resourceful Wallace (voiced by British veteran Thespian Salis) and being dumber, but more loyal (and keen-thinking) Mutts Gromit (all wrinkled eyebrows and mouthlessness) have developed a service to their community: pest control (" Anti-pesto ") for the upcoming Giant Vegetable Festival has the whole city in the mo For everything that is vegetative, a giant and the biggest Pesk are annoying rabbits eating the crunchy goods. Wallace's ingenuity has created a vacuum tank that's fast, efficient and above all harmless for the cute vermin that plagues the estate of Lady Campanula Tottington (voiced by Bonham Carter), making a quick break to the first lady of stop-motion animation, what was her previous turn in "Corpse Bride" a few weeks ago), which hosts the competition and is a love interest for the nerdy Wallace. <br /> <br /> The only fly-in-the-ointment is vainglorious, bombastic loud mouth and jerk Victor Quartermaine (voiced by Fiennes, his first attempt in the animated arts, as Patrick Stewart with stormy echoes and hilarious results a toupeeder macho idiot who plans to marry Lady Tottington for her while he is a major competitor to W & G's humane attempts by resorting to his trusted weapons and nasty bulldog. <br /> <br /> To hurt the injury, the duo faces a terrible emergency in the form of a giant rabbit (the titular monster is a nice nod to the bot h universal and hammer horror films) that terrorize the village and devour every veggie in sight. The two are committed to capturing and disposing of the creature, but there's more to it than the eye sees as things progress. <br /> <br /> Relentlessly funny and with such amazing elastic and kinetic energies for its wonderful clay counterparts, Park and Box has created a truly magical and extremely entertaining movie with so amazingly detailed production design for its little world that it is more than one Screening can take to absorb how much effort was used in their blood, sweat and tears for this instant classic kids of all ages. <br /> <br /> Wallace, the cheese-eating bald-headed inventor, could easily be the British cousin of Homer Simpson, with his plump body and constant knack for being wrong in trying to do the right thing; His heart is in the right place, but his head is in the clouds. His sweet love for Lady Tottington (who resembles a pre-plastic surgery Carol Burnett), who is a head taller than our hero, may perhaps remind her of her first unfulfilled love with a smile of awkward confession. His Rube Goldberg-like gift for simplifying ease is an inspired madness that fans of the earlier short films "The Wrong Trousers", "A Close Shave" and "A Grand Day Out" can remember. <br /> <br /> But in my opinion it's the wise, quiet and boring gromit whose poached, slow-burning, disbelieving little-eyed eggs turn out to be one of the best animated characters ever to perform such an amazing one Arsenal of despair and mouthlessness were created expressions and subtle nuances that would kill most live action actors to convey dismay, concern, grief, genuine surprise and relief. His last pursuit? a signature of the immensely popular cartoon team? is brilliant and fast improvised, especially his literal dog fight with the equally soundless bulldog with perseverance, wit and a wisdom fueled by Chuck Jones, which would make Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger pale with envy. Wallace and Gromit The best of Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello and every other classic comedy team that comes to mind; We hope their lifespan stays on screen for as long as their predecessors. The wait is very curious.
