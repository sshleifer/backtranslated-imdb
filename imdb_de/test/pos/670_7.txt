Ida Lupino is trapped in her own house by the crazy Robert Ryan in "Beware, My Lovely," a 1952 movie by RKO. Lupino and Ryan shot three films together and worked well as a team. Both were professional professionals and strong performers. In this movie, based on a Broadway play called "The Man," Lupino is a WWI widow who leases a room in her home. She is very active and popular in her community and although her husband has been dead for two years, she is not ready to move on. The man who rents her room goes on vacation, and Lupino hires Robert Ryan, who helps her with cleaning in the house. He is friendly enough to start, but later terrorizes her, locks her up in the house, and does not allow her to answer the phone or the door as he becomes more violent and no longer deals with reality. A character played by Ryan becomes at the beginning of the film, which runs away when he discovers a body in another house where he works. It is not clear whether he is the murderer or not, since he is surprised to see the body. He could be a split personality, because when his personality becomes ugly to Lupino, he does not seem to remember his activities when he comes out. He does not know that he has the keys to Lupino's house in his pocket, and he does not know why he has tickets for a party he bought from young children who came to the door. <br /> <br /> "Careful" My Lovely "is a very exciting movie, and the two main roles are terrific performances, the tension building up to a very high level and ending as you would expect.
