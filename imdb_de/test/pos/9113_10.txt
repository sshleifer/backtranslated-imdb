Tenacious D: In The Pick of Destiny, the fictional story tells the story of Tenacious D and their quest for the Pick of Destiny, a guitar pick with supernatural powers made by Satan himself (played by Dave Grohl). JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), who are united by fate, must travel to the Rock N 'Roll Museum and steal the Pick of Destiny to become the largest band in the world. The movie is hilarious and delivers uninterrupted laughs. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work together perfectly and have been true friends and colleagues for over 20 years. The film is partly a musical. All (or most) of the music was written and performed by The D. All songs are new material and many of them are classic. The soundtrack is definitely worth a look. This movie is especially prized by Tenacious D fans, but if you're not a fan of The D, I still think you'll enjoy the movie. If you are a fan of the D, you must watch this movie. Acting is not as bad as you might think, and the laughter and rudeness never stop coming. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to rock his socks and laugh as hard as they have long laughed. Look for Cameos by Dave Grohl, Ronnie James Dio, Meatloaf, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly and Neil Hamburger. Stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits.
