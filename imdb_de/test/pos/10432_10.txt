This is absolutely the best movie I have ever seen. At the age of 12, I got up late and came across the movie. It was on the US channel Gilbert Godfrey's Up All Night. I will never forget. At the time my friends and I were really struggling with various, sometimes sexual issues. You know, 12 is a very rough and funny age. It seems you are stuck between a little girl and a young lady. This movie helped a lot to answer many questions. I now have a daughter who is 12 years old. I've been looking for this movie for a few years. If it ever comes out on DVD, I would be the first to buy it. I would recommend each parent to watch this with their child when they reach this very rough and difficult age.
