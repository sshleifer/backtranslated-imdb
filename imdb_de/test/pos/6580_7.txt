The problem I have as a Finn is that most of the actors in this film are in every Finnish film. I have the feeling that Finland only has five actors. I think if you are not from Finland, you really like this movie as a refreshing novelty. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a terrible chain of events that has hit some people pretty hard. Alcoholism, cold climate and darkness may be clich√©s, but they are still very real in today's Finnish society. In Finland, many people suffer from depression, especially in winter. The sound of the film is very melancholy. I enjoyed it and Louhime's direction was again very solid. I liked this movie very much, only the negative is that you see the same faces that you have seen over and over again.
