Maybe my rating should have been 9, but the movie left me completely stunned at the first sight, and my last consideration confirmed my original belief. Stylish, yes, every scene has far-reaching views, grandiose angles with a perfect sound side that accompanies them. Make great spectacles especially by Toni Servillo, collect her with one of the most beautiful and charming women in Olivia Magnani and a beautiful action, and you will see this little masterpiece again and again. <br /> <br /> Paulo Sorrento's next film "L'Amico De Famiglia" competing in this year's Cannes Festival. is eagerly awaited.
