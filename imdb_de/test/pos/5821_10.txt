Oz is by far the best show TV has ever seen. Better than the sopranos, yes, ER, yes, CSI, absolutely. Uncompromising, bold and completely disturbing and yet deeply moving. Oz brought us past a picture of the prison that someone on TV had ever summoned. Tom Fontana has done a great job. No topic is taboo. Rape, drugs, murder. Oz is proof of how good television can be. It follows characters with different backgrounds and different races, but always comes back to your everyman Tobias Beecher, who is in jail for vehicle murder. We see what we do not want to see, pain, death, chaos. Oz will bother you, make you falter, make you look away, but most of all, it will make you think. Seeing Oz means seeing a really great TV production
