A fantastic series, one of my few favorites (Miami Vice and Tour of Duty are the other two, and this series is very close). <br /> <br /> These guys do not wear stocking tights - they dress like lumberjacks. Everything in this series breathes a semblance of realism, artistic license or not. <br /> <br /> It draws a picture of a Europe that is little outside paganism, as most of the villagers still have their local deities. and there are Satans who worship nuns, and magicians, witches, and wizards who cast spells. <br /> <br /> But what comes to the fore is that it's a set of times. Instead of the version of the fifties, which was a lawsuit against the central government and the persecutions in the McCarthy era, this series is thoroughly grounded in the '80s: Thatcher is tribulation and has a strong inclination to environmentalists. Robin's protector is a nature worshiper named Hern The Hunter, who often wears the head of a deer and (like this Robin) is a personification of The Green Man, an alternate version of Osiris (the Egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection). It's interesting to note that Robin In The Hood is not a person in this series, but a concept: if the old one is killed, a new one is telepathically summoned by Hern - the person can die, but Robin In The Hood will live forever , hence the concept of resurrection). <br /> <br /> The music and score are really great and performed by the Irish formation Clannad. Looking at it, I could not help thinking about how authentically medieval Anglo-Saxon folk music would have been. :-) <br /> <br /> All this is beautifully filmed in the lush forests of Wales that fit The New Forrest. <br /> <br /> The only downside is in the first episodes of both In one series, the actors have to overcome their own skepticism and convince themselves that this is really a serious job. Then they come in and the show is great! Michael Praed as first Robin (the second is played by Sean Connerys son Jason), Judi Trott makes a pretty and fragile redheaded Marion, Phil Rose as obese and genuinely kind brother Tuck, Ray Winstone as the fugitive and lovable Scarlet, Clive Mantle as the Huge shepherd Little John, Peter Llewellyn Williams as a friend and classmate of Little John, and Mark Ryan as ex-Hashashin / Assassin Nazir - all with great accomplishments. Also awesome are the permanent bad guys, Nicholas Grace as a confused, disarming sheriff of Nottingham, and his aristocratic, clumsy buddy (and Robin's half-brother, as it turns out) Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne. Really cool is the fashion designer Richard O'Brien, as the evil Lord Owen of Clun (Olliver Cotton), the magician Gulnar (he appears at the end of the first series and later in the second). <br /> <br /> The Tithe Barn of Bradford on Avon lined up for the Sheriff's Castle. (See bradfordonavon.co.uk under "Attractions.") <br /> <br /> If you're into mythology, the Middle Ages, and romance, you should not waste time Xena or Hercules - that's it the real thing, so go out and have a look! <br /> <br /> Alex
