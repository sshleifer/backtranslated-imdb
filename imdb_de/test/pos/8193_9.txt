The Kaiser and the assassin (with English subtitles) are 161 minutes long, but time is packed with a story that barely fits them. Golden palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of Chinese landscapes make up a true story of the unifying King of China (about 300 BC). A complicated storyline with countless twists and turns is played by the cast with outstanding portrayals. The simple desire of King Qin for a unified empire for his people is fulfilled, but not without treachery, conspiracies and counteractions and oh yes corpses. Many bodies. This epic story about China's beginnings is a great way for western visitors to see little-known Asian history. Emperor Qin's legacy includes thousands of life-size terracotta figures that are still being excavated today. As a historical person, this film makes it clear that Emperor Qin was to be seen along with George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar, to name but a few of the greatest conquerors / statesmen in the world. I highly recommend seeing the Kaiser and the assassin, especially on the big screen.
