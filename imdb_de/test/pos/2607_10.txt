During the War of Independence GENERAL SPANKY mobilized his forces to defend native women and children against a Yankee invasion. In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his beloved OUR GANG children to branch out into occasional feature films. With the great success of Shirley Temple in two 1935 Civil War films (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was natural for Roach to look in the same direction for his walk. Although GENERAL SPANKY received a rather elaborate production and was sold by MGM, this was neither a critical success nor a box office success. The small GANGsters would henceforth limit themselves to short topics. <br /> <br /> Although he won the title and title role, George 'Spanky' McFarland will be competing in the first half of the movie by Billie 'Buckwheat' Thomas. Here were two of the best young actors ever to appear in American films. With all the experience of old, experienced professionals, these two Gamin could steal scenes and hearts with equal courage. A constant joy, without a false touch between them, they constitute the main reason for watching the film today. <br /> <br /> Phillips Holmes gives a quiet, gentlemanly performance as Spanky's adult protector. Almost forgotten, Holmes was a good actor who died far too early in the Second World War. Awesome Ralph Morgan is particularly good as sympathetic union general - his scenes with Spanky are quite amusing. Other OUR GANGERS appear at the center of the film, especially Carl? Alfalfa 'Switzer; he can fidget? Just before the battle, mother. Even the pretty Rosina Lawrence (the schoolmaster of GANG) appears to play Holmes' lover. Irving Pichel is particularly slimy when a cowardly Cardsharp became the vengeful Yankee captain. Bumbling Willie Best & Louise Louise Beavers play the slaves of Miss Lawrence. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the film contains racism, not unusual for Hollywood at the time - but in the original series of OUR almost completely lacking gang shorts. <br /> <br /> 19th Century music fans will enjoy paying attention to the soundtrack, a long succession of old sounds.
