I avoided this movie as a boy because I thought it was boring, no fights or shootings, cops, robbers, cowboys or Indians. It was definitely not a cool movie. So I only saw TRC in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful and intriguing movies I have ever seen. All performers deliver the characterizations perfectly and every emotion is drawn from the viewer scene by scene. Filming and directing are deceptively simple, but feel so natural and pull me completely into the story. My two favorite scenes are Bobbie's birthday party and the scene on the station platform just before the end, which has been perfected and edited. The quality and expression of Jenny Agutter's voice as she calls, "Daddy! My father!' unscrewing emotions from the viewer. Tears grow in my eyes as I think about it. <br /> <br /> This adaptation is not just a movie, but a precious piece of art and a perfect example of what all filmmakers should be striving to create an emotional experience.
