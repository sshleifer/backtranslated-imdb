I have to grow old because I was hooked on this movie right from the start. I'm watching HBO again right now. It's a very simple movie about two people who fall in love after they find out that their spouses had an affair. The plot is very thin, but the actors have behaved very well in this movie. In the mix of Kristen Scott Thomas, who runs for Congress, and Harrison Ford, an Inner Policeman, these two meet under unfortunate circumstances and fall in love. I love the soundtrack. Fits perfectly. One thing I can not understand, this movie had a budget of $ 68 million. Was it spent? The plane crash or Harrison Ford's salary?
