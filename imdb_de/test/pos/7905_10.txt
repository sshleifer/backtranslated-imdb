The commentator in front of me stated that this film is the worst that was ever imposed on him as a child. I have to say that I loved this movie when he was little and I still love him today. The film has the best theme of all-family togetherness. Given the length of time the movie was released, I thought the movie was well played. I just wish I could find a copy of it somewhere !! Of all the movies of the 1980s that I saw as a kid, this was one of my favorites. I know, I probably saw it at least once a week with my brother and mother. I would definitely recommend it to anyone I know or do not know. So if you find a copy of it, I suggest you look at it! It is wonderful and heartwarming.
