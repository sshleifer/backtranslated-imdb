Who does not love the Muppets ?! It is impossible to observe without a warm, blurred feeling inside. I think the important thing is that this movie seemed to capture very successfully what makes the Muppets so special. I can not really remember the details of the plot, but the different moments and characters in the movie that I like to remember. In fact, there was a rather nostalgic atmosphere throughout the movie, but without being self-confident in any way. Refreshing for someone who may be over-hung with meticulous details and techniques; The "magic" surpasses all the other stuff. In fact, the films are made of it. <br /> <br /> How does the movie manage these things? Hmmm, nice question! Am I stuffed? Just take a look. I really feel that it is very easy. The filmmakers believe in their material and do not take it too seriously. I probably would not say that the movie has a lot of really inspired moments, but it does have a certain amount of life (which strangely lacks many "real people" movies). A shell You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. They also have a certain innocence that makes them all the more endearing. <br /> <br /> In general, I have the impression that the people who made the film were not afraid to try what was right for them, time that feels rather loose. A bit like a really accessible and pleasant extended jazz session. A lot of talent, little predictability and many warm personalities come through. Of course the cameos were a few nice surprises. Maybe I do not feel like saying a lot about it because I was half asleep when I saw it (and / or when I write this review). Anyway, I repeat myself halfway, but I liked the family feeling the movie had. Full of love, you could say. Again, a sense of nostalgia comes to my mind that not many films achieve so effectively or effortlessly. <br /> <br /> To repeat myself, one of the movie's best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about luck as (as) a butterfly, The Muppet Movie succeeds, in part, in much success by not trying to do so. The same is true for beauty that is best undetected or untouched or casual or anything like that. If that sounds saff, I think it was pretty funny too. <br /> <br /> So, all in all, this movie was very funny, touching and hard to smile. It also offers tons of great music! Highly recommended for all people, both young and young at heart.
