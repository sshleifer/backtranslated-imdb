Carla Gugino literally melts the screen in this crime capsule. Her sex appeal, rich features and sexy southern accent make this movie more than goodbye. But the movie has so many "other" things that make it almost a modern classic. Simon Baker performance for one thing. Truly a great actor. Til Schweiger is so perfectly cast that I wonder why he is not a big crossover star. Gil Bellows completes this crew and literally steals this show. Other gugino cleavage is certainly the best performance in the movie. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are so incredibly brilliant ... I can not even describe it. Great chemistry. <br /> <br /> The music is so versatile that it plays a role in itself. Wonderful to look at. <br /> <br /> People may say it's influenced by Tarantino ... I disagree. It is clearly unique and smart for itself. Sebastian Gutierrez has done a wonderful job guiding this tightly woven film and undermining many of the scenes that made me romp. The end is completely scary and you never see it coming. All in all a nice movie, which for me is the definition of what a good movie should be.
