Documentary films always raise the question of realism. How much of the film is real and how much is manipulated by the filmmaker? In LITTLE DIETER'S NEEDS TO FLY, Herzog is too busy telling the story of a man who tells his own story to even address the question of realism and formalism. Herzog's role as a storyteller is obvious from the start. Fortunately, he is a storyteller. LITTLE DIETER is the most beautiful and engaging documentary I have ever seen. Dieter's story is captivating, and Herzog's efforts to review Dieter Dieter Stein's staging as he's filmed are very effective. The story that Dieter tells is real, but Duke is omnipresent and wrestles with absurdist commentary on realism. This film is a must for all students of the documentary and / or Werner Herzog.
