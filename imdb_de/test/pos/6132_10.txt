I saw this movie "miniseries" on television in 1989 and it was an amazing movie. I would like to find a copy of it to watch over and over again. It's been fifteen years since I saw it, and it's still in my head. <br /> <br /> It attracts you from the beginning. The characters and the plot hold you tight. The end was great. The feeling and anger the son showed when he found out the truth about his father are unforgettable. The tension, as it turns out and how he will face his father, is very intense. <br /> <br /> If you get a copy of this movie, you will enjoy watching it. <br /> <br /> Then send me an e-mail and tell me where to get a copy.
