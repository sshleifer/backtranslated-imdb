This series has much to offer with beautiful shots of the most impressive underwater world on this planet. If you are five years in the making, you would hardly expect that you expected less. I had the impression that some scenes from the first episode were repeated in the latter, which is of course only a small criticism. David Attenborough is great as a narrator, and comments are informative, leaving enough room for imagination and distance, giving viewers plenty of time to think about the stunning images. If you have the opportunity, do not look at a translated version of this series. <br /> <br /> An absolute must for anyone interested in the finer points of our blue continents and the best documentation on the subject I've ever seen.
