Although this was a low budget movie and clearly last minute, it has a certain charm that is difficult to pinpoint. I tend to think that it is screenwriter Grant Morris (see Dead Dog) who, despite the distorted plot, injected a fantastic piece of humor that is painfully lacking in many of today's box office hits. Definitely a must for a Sunday afternoon salmon fest. As a true single girl and very skeptical, this film did not particularly inspire me, but aroused a small flame of hope for a love life. Not my love life, but also the slightly crazy neighbor who lets her hamster sleep with him. She can find someone.
