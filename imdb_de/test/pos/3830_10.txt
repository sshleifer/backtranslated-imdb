I did not know how much of this episode was taken over by The Enemy Below until I finally saw the movie (since then it's my favorite war movie). It also removed some elements of Run Silent Run Deep. There is nothing wrong with stealing ideas as long as you do something cool with them. And Boy has done something cool with Roddenberry and his company. <br /> <br /> The story begins when the Romulans violate a 100 year old contract and cross the neutral zone, destroying a number of Federation outposts along the zone, allegedly for their superior weapons and invisibility images (and their view after) to test the balance of power between the Romulans and the Federation, as a prelude to a comprehensive invasion. Kirk has to decide whether it's worth risking a war to stop the Romulan ship, or whether in fact the greater risk is to let the invaders go after the destruction of 4 military outposts. Kirk cleverly chooses the latter. <br /> <br /> This is our first look at an enemy of the Federation, the Romulans, a warlike, but in their own honorable, race, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. Unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romulans did not give up their feelings and violent and imperialistic ways, even if they were technologically advanced. <br /> <br /> This is for Mr. Stiles, the ship's navigator and boss of this episode, not Belang's antagonist aboard the company (the Romulan commander has his own problems with a gung-ho junior officer). All that matters to him is that he hates Romulans and Spock looks like one .. until the end when Spock saves his life (of course). This is in sharp contrast to Captain Kirk and the Romulan commander, none of whom in any way has a personal distrust of the other. Both men just do their duty. In fact, there is mutual respect. This is the first Trek episode that deals directly with prejudice, and it does so skillfully (unlike Season 3's not so subtle "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"). <br /> <br /> Like the enemy down We have a classic chess game between two skippers who are actually very similar. You can see right away that these two captains are good ... very good. If you would go to battle, you want one of these men as your leader. Both are honorable and decent men who are duty bound. Although the Romulan Commander is committed to his homeworld, he still desires destruction before he can return home instead of starting another interstellar war. Still, he still does everything he can to get home, the way Kirk does his best to stop him. <br /> <br /> This, in my opinion, is one of the top five of Trek. It has it all: lots of action, excitement, great dialogue, good acting (I still say the Romulan commander was Mark Lenard's best trek role), and he manages to give his social commentary without being overly preachy. Too bad that Roddenberry has forgotten the last part at TNG. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this episode and then check out The Enemy Below.
