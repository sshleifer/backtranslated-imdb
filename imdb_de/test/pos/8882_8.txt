This movie is basically a parody of Hitchcock's strangers on a train, which in my opinion were overrated anyway. Danny Devito wants to see Strangers and then thinks Billy Crystal wants them to swap murders. Both Devito and Crystal are great, as is Devito's mother. This is Devito's directorial debut and it's better than the war of roses.
