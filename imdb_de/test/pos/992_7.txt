It's all about love in the Second World War, but we must remember that at this particular stage of his life, it's also a biography for Dylan Thomas and his fellow man. <br /> <br /> The timing of the movie is just great. It really begins what I think was the spirit in these times; Smile and hope you will not be bombarded. For some it may be boring, but the film has a particularly dangerous advantage. <br /> <br /> At one point my heart was racing towards the end as the movie reached its climax. It really does offer some poignant moments that are cleverly handled by the four main characters. Cillian Murphy is in good shape here, as is Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and it makes an interesting clock. The relationship between Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley's characters is wonderful and we owe acting (and watch out for a Cameo of Suggs of 'Madness'). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a rather slow movie. Together with the fact that it only takes two hours, it is quite a stroke to come to a conclusion. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully designed moments that were undoubtedly helped by the great number of well-known British names behind the scenes. But sometimes it booms too much. Nevertheless, a rewarding watch. 10.7
