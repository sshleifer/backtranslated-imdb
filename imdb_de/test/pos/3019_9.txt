*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Do you think there's a part of you deep inside of you in thought, with things that other people should not see during a session, when I'm inside, I can see those things. "<br /> <br /> --Catherine Deane <br /> And We also. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, "The Cell," is a love / hate movie - either you love it or you hate it. I can understand the reasons why some people do not like this production. With a story that combines disquieting serial killers with mind-minding, "The Cell" is too much for some viewers. Others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think this is one of the most gripping movies of the year. Mark Protosevich makes his screen debut as a feature film and creates an imaginative world full of colorful images and provocative characters. The filmmakers use every shot. Protosevich had ideas for "The Cell" in 1993, when he decided to combine two of his main interests: mind-probing and serial killers. He was reportedly influenced by directors like Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. You would probably be proud of such a fantasy. <br /> <br /> The film combines two important narratives, one about scientific research into the human mind and the other about a psychopath who murders young women for his own sexual pleasure. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a children's therapist, is part of a neurological study at the Campbell Center, a research clinic. Because of her empathetic personality, scientists chose Deane to enter the mind of a catatonic Preteen, hoping to awaken his brain to wake up. <br /> <br /> A sick, denied serial killer roams the streets. In an abandoned farmhouse, Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) imprisons innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes from the FBI every time they approach, until now. A violent attack makes him comatose. The FBI catches his forever unconscious body. Unfortunately, he has already prepared the cell with his latest victim. In forty hours, the cell fills with water, and Stargher is the only man who knows the location of his victim. The FBI brings this situation to the Campbell Center, where Catherine Stargher comes to mind. Hoping to discover the location of his youngest victim before the cell fills with water, the woman is sent to a watery grave. The science fiction parts of the story are based on both real science and theoretical fiction of the neurological mapping and synaptic transfer system. It takes a long time for the premise to develop, but it's well worth the wait. It is far-fetched, but that does not matter. The movie makes us believe. Even if you do not expose the unbelief, the visual allure provides an engaging backdrop to enjoy. <br /> <br /> According to the production footage of the movie, Mark Protosevich was thrilled to have collaborated with the director named Tarsem. They both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail, his stunning artistic direction and his sophisticated ability to tell a story. "When I wrote 'The Cell'," explains Protosevich, "I surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of the painter's paintings or photographs while working, so I think visually, and Tarsem is a highly visual director of a similar framework of visual references For a very smooth cooperation. "<br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio provides the film with a backbone, and no actor could have achieved his character better. He delivers a mysterious, disturbing and appealing performance. "I think that my character is in a sense trapped in itself," reflects D'Onofrio. He also researched the psychology of serial killers to bring him under the surface of the figure. His detailed preparation for the performance pays off. <br /> <br /> While actor, writer and director do wonders with their material, the real honor is the talent behind the scenes of the film. Photography director Paul Laufer, production designer Tom Foden, costume designer April Napier, special effects coordinator Clay Pinney and visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug. They bring the world of "The Cell" to life. It is an extraordinary world that deserves several visits. Some movies you are watching, others you are experiencing. "The Cell" falls into the later category. <br /> <br />
