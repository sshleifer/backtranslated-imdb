Mention Bollywood to anyone who is a bit familiar with the genre, and the normally-conjured images are of cheesy, over-the-box-themed top numbers that make Vegas appear as a bastion of conservatism. This perception is not supported by the touch of condescension that pervades most films that have turned to Bollywood from an outsider's point of view. Willard Carroll's romantic comedy Marigold, however, takes a different direction. It's not a look-through look at those stupid people and their unsuspecting antics, but a sincere appreciation of Bollywood for its vitality, lack of irony, and self-confidence. It is obvious that the director has enormous affection and respect for Bollywood, while at the same time being confused by his kitschy aspects. And if you're familiar with Bollywood, you can see what he's doing here to make a real mix of Bollywood and Hollywood film conventions. From one of the opening shots, a flashback of the Salman character as a child by the sea, dealing with his grandmother (played by Helen! - how many Salman films begin with the same premise?) In conversation with the retrospective sequence that goes into the camera In a film shot by Marigold and Prem, anyone who has seen enough Bollywood films recognizes these hints. The story itself contains proven conventions from both Hollywood and Bollywood. The fish from the water meets the duty of the family - at the expense of personal fulfillment. The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot line of the funnier construction of the first half, which has given way to a more dramatic dissolution of the second page. However, the film's sensibility is ultimately that of Hollywood with its unobtrusive, dry sense of humor and the story of a woman who has learned to believe in herself, to affirm herself. <br /> <br /> You could not have a movie that was inspired by Bollywood when there were no musical numbers and this movie at seven does not disappoint. Unlike Bollywood, however, the songs do not jump out of nowhere and transport their characters to a European venue or Goan beach. They exist as musical numbers that are part of the movie being filmed. They recall how musical numbers were established in Busby Berkeley films as part of a stage show. Or they come from a situation in which music already has a reason to be there? a sexy nightclub scene where Prem Marigold teaches dancing, or a beach scene where musicians perform (including a cameo of the playback singer Shaan). All reflect the emotional state of the protagonists in the film at this point. Often the music takes a traditional song from one genre and gives the other something. In one of the highlights of the film, where Marigold gets her rights, the piastation of the song is quite typical of its genre. The female star sings and dances among a number of women? but in this case it's the blonde Ali Larter, who looks like a totally natural Bollywood movie star, emotionally and lip-synching to the Hindi texts without subtitles. <br /> <br /> Bollywood is synonymous with opulence, and Marigold blends beautifully with some of the best talent working in Bollywood today. The cameraman is Anil Mehta, who was also a cameraman for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and production designer Nitin Desai, both of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. You can really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam in this movie? In fact, the illuminated floor in one of the numbers originally came from Dholi Taro Dhol, who happens to have an embedded marigold pattern. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, Carroll seems to have a penchant for proving acting skills by Playing by Heart ?? one of the first films for Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe. And in this movie he meets again with Ali Larter. One of the main reasons why the movie works is Larter. She makes a bitchy, unappetizing character likeable and credible in her subsequent transformation, and she's smart, witty and sexy because she's smart and funny. She and Salman share excellent chemistry, and that's one of the movie's biggest strengths. Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming and is filtered through his iconic role as Prem. This is an old school premier, but expect a quiet, muted Salman - those who are used to him may be disappointed? or relieved! It is a sincere and sensitive performance of him, which was only affected by bad expressions of his English lines. <br /> <br /> With a refreshing lack of cynicism and a blatant embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter to Bollywood and Hollywood films of yore
