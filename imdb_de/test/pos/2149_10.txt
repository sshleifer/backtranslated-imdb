I saw this movie on the 23rd of August in Santa Monica and it stayed with me. I would like to thank the filmmakers for their in-depth understanding of Harry's puzzling, eccentric life. And also to show the defects and mistakes of Nilsson, the man. Thank you for showing the good and the bad, the ups and downs, and uncovering the amazing BBC material. The movie is also a great showcase for a lot of Nilsson's music, which is really well placed throughout the movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries, especially if you're into Harry Nilsson or the music scene of the early '70s. A reviewer on the Is not It Cool website wrote that this was the best movie they saw at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and I believe it. The film is informative, funny, sad, touching and full of great music. It succeeds on all levels. Really good.
