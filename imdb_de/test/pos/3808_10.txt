This is an entertaining surreal road movie. It was written by Joseph Minion, who also wrote After Hours, Martin Scorsese's outstanding surreal movie. The film features the adventures of a ten-year-old boy named Gus driving a red Ford Mustang through fictitious states named Tristana (a tribute to Luis Bu√±uel's movie, perhaps?), Essex & South Lyndon, looking for eight elusive Motorama Playing cards from various gas stations of the Chimera Company. The movie feels surreal, as many things are unusual, like the money, for example, that looks like blank paper with numbers on the numbers. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters are uncomfortable for Gus's outing. They tattoo him, beat him, but that does not stop the boy from his relentless search. Some weird actors like David Lynch, the established Jack Nance, Meat Loaf & Flea also perform. Jack Nance plays a motel owner who, when he meets Gus for the first time, tells him, "If you see squirrels, give them to me." This is a movie in which a man and his wife leave their small children because the husband owes $ 100; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking roughly. If you're a fan of Twin Peaks and surreal movies, you'll like it. A strange little gem from a movie.
