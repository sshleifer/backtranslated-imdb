The young, ambitious nurse Mrs. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to a madhouse in the middle of nowhere. Over the course of 3 days she encounters strange events, even a patient in her bedroom watching her, but she still remains. The mental patients are all a bit shaken up (especially by the judge), but my favorite was the old crazy Biddy (Rhea MacAdams). The plot is okay at best and the acting is surprisingly good, but after a while it gets a bit much. Nevertheless it is funny, quirky, strange and original. <br /> <br /> Note: The thing in the basement is hardly terrible, so the title is a little bit of bananas.
