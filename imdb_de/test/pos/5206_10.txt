Simply the best and most realistic film about World War II that I have ever seen. Not only because the German soldiers talk about German and Russian soldiers (not English in German or Russian), also because of the realistic equipment in which the film was filmed. The spectacle is outstanding. No feeling of Hollywood at all, not even a love story ... Stalingrad was supposed to be one of the most terrible battles of the war, and in this context there is no room for feelings or romantic scenes. What you get is a movie that will make you enjoyable and has one of the best unfortunate ends a movie could have.
