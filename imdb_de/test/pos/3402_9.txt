I saw this series on television in 1990 and was absolutely thrilled (I was 9 years old). I bought the first DVD box about six months ago and the second one a few days ago (thanks to my dear husband). Geez ... It was hard to let me sleep with all the thoughts in my head ... what would happen to Madeline and George, etc. Slave problems and civil war have always fascinated me (a 25-year-old Finn) slaves in the Read the family of Edward Ball for those who want to take a look into the past and try to understand what really happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I want to see heaven and hell after so many people said it was not so good.
