For any old-time fanatic, this 3-hour adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel is a real treat. She cinematically nods to Baz Luhrman's kinetic style as well as to all the primary and right historical pieces that are present on the BBC (where you've probably almost seen it already) <br /> <br /> any prominent member of this cast). It's pretty rugged and outperforms the top in the spots, but that's exactly what the novel was about. The cast <br /> <br /> is appealing and perfect in the cases of Anna Chancellor and Hugh <br /> Bonneville. In the case of Rachel Sterling, as our heroine <br /> <br / Nan, you just have to overlook the fact that she's way too pretty to ever be confused with a boy and walk with him. It's a fantasy, after all. <br /> <br /> Some fans of the novel may be exposed by the various changes in <br /> <br /> (especially those of Jodhi Mays figure Florence), but <br /> <br /> All changes are working focus on the wellbeing of this television game and provide high-quality entertainment value.
