It was a funny movie to watch. Although the likelihood of this happening in your street is low, there are still many recognizable situations where a bell will ring. The simplicity of the movie and the humor work. I have to admit that you do not have to see it in a theater; That's very good on a small TV. Tip: see it with some close friends.
