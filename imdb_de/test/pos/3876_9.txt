The A-Team repeats itself on Dutch television every day (RTL7, about 1800 hours) and I'm still watching it! I do not like the A-Team ... I absolutely love them !! It's just great to see Justin following the former members of the A team. Awakens memories of the old times, when I was young and sweet. I would have given you a 10 for an excellent, but Justin looks as if he would pursue the former A-Team members all alone. Of course that's the only bad thing about this documentary. Too bad that Justin is not looking for Melinda Culea ("Amy A. Allen"). But it's great to see Mr. T. back in action. Too bad for him, in the end he does not appear at the party. But this party is too short to laugh again and see everyone in action again.
