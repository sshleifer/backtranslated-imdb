"If I die someone will bury me and if not, what's the difference, who's going to do it, huh?" The philosophy of life (or its lack) is summed up once and for all in this less than classic, yet entertaining, spin-off of Sergio Leone's "Dollar's Trilogy." In the opening scene, three apparently evil armed men ride into a western city, and with menacing eyes scare all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes. The attentive observer will find that each of these three characters bears a striking resemblance to figures from Leone's For A Few Dollars More. There's a man in Eastwood's poncho, one in Lee Van Cleef's black suit and one who looks like Gian Marie Volonte's Indio. But this movie is not about these guys. No sooner did they ride into town when gunned down by someone even cooler than they are, a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the stranger. <br /> <br /> No. This is a completely different story. In an obvious copy of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and Ugly, three armed men fight for a hidden treasure again. Again there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandits. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed like a priest. He is the reward for the bandit Monetero (Gilbert Roland). When Monetero's gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins, the stranger is distracted from his normal mode of operation. <br /> <br /> To round out the trio, stands the corrupt bank director of Edd Byrne, Clayton. He also wants the money for himself. But after the money is hidden, the only man who knows where it is is shot dead. Now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion showing a family crest. The game is also to find the treasure before someone else does. And every weapon can play. <br /> <br /> With numerous shootouts, fistfights and crossovers, the action brings these three to the ultimate showdown rip-off, a three-way draw for the hidden treasure, including The Good, the Bad and the Ugly - but with one Turn. <br /> <br /> Of course this movie is not as good as Leone's movies, but in the end there is damnation, is not it? This movie is fun - 60s nihilism, western spaghetti style. There are no rules, no lasting loyalty and no right or wrong - just the treasure and whatever is needed to sustain it. And although the movie is not a classic, the end is certainly the case. Hey, maybe we can all get by for a hundred thousand pieces. <br /> <br /> If you like spaghetti westerns, have a look. It's fast, angry and worth a look. My name is Evren Buyruk from Crestline, California
