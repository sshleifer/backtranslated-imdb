An astronaut gets lost in space and finds himself on board a living spaceship, accompanied by a group of aliens, in an unknown area. This incredible plotted and enjoyable TV installation is a positive birth fantasy. The individual characters who have come into conflict at the beginning of the series must learn to get along and eventually become a powerful group. Most of the action takes place in the womb of Moia, the living spaceship (who even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). While science fiction stories are usually interested in negative birth fantasies (for example, the 'alien' films, especially the fourth part 'resurrection'), this is a surprise. Also gratifying is the lack of a military hierarchy aboard the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human (and foreign) body. One of the female characters, who is actually a plant, experiences "photogas-gases" when exposed to sunlight. The crew even has to go to the bathroom. Would not that be impossible in "Star Trek"?
