I once commented on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to tell a few things about the film when I saw it for the first time on a large balcony in a great theater. The movie was a lot of fun in the theater and my first ever Chucky movie ever made in a theater. This was a special moment for me because I really appreciate Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with BIG COOLNESS !!! And the blood was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid is nailed by the truck was unbelievably happy! That was a great gore scene !!!!! And the end was so bizarre and shocking that it made me my pants. The idea of ​​having the seed of Chucky was very, very bizarre and shocking! When I left the theater, I was simply thrilled and could not believe it was real. For some reason, the bizarre and different qualities of this Child's Play episode have called me Jason Goes To Hell of Child's Play series. It had only this extremely shocking, bizarre and other quality that reminded me of Jason Goes To Hell. A sure ***** from *****. So I set the series: 1,4,2,3. I loved it, but not as much as Tom Holland's original Child's Play classic. I can not wait for Seed of Chucky! Bring it on!
