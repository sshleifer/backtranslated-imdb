"Robin Hood: Men in Tights" has received no respect. It was funny! Cary Elwes was an excellent Prince of Thieves, and David Chappelle, Amy Yasbeck, Patrick Stewart, Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield as Blink have all done a good job. I'll never understand the hostility to "Robin Hood: Men in Tights," but I know a great comedy when I see one. <br /> <br /> "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" gets **** out ****.
