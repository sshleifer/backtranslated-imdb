The 1980s are widely regarded as the decade horror decided to have fun. Sometimes there were certain minds behind them (for example, "Evil Dead II," "Night of the Creeps," and "Return of the Living Dead"), and then there were those films that were mindless but had a very low rental charm perfect for a night with beer and friends. In movies like Pieces and Blood Diner, in the 80s and 90s, rental shelves piled up that offer little intelligence or craftsmanship, but offer plenty of mute entertainment. Kevin Tenny's movie "Night of the Demons" (1988) is part of those traditionally stupid, badly-performing and non-original bones in the body, but damn if you do not have a good time. <br /> <br /> The plot is so simple that it had to come only from the 80s: a group of stupid teenagers, played by a group of actors between the mid and late 20's, decides to attend a party at Hull Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (Scream Queen Legend Linnea Quigley.) Now, Angela and Co. decide to throw a s√©ance. This turns out to be Will Arnette's figure "Arrested Development", which Gob would call "Huge Mistake" because a demonic force soon owns Angela and also gets to the others. <br /> <br /> Take "The Evil Dead," "Your Nightmare on Elm Street," and your average stupid, dead teen movie, throw it in a blender and get "Night of the Demons." The movie is anything but original and really not a good movie. The whole thing is extremely distracted, the spectacle is terrible, the jokes often fall off, the characters annoy (especially the character of Stooge) and the action holes are numerous. That's out of the way, it's still a lot of fun. So why? <br /> <br /> Well, on the one hand, the make-up and gore effects are first-rate, with some really memorable moments (especially a nasty and slightly weird bit with a tube of lipstick) that really stand out. It rarely, if ever, takes itself too seriously, but with the exception of some terrible puns, it plays directly and never wasting audience time with winking self-confidence. In addition, there is a certain energy and enthusiasm throughout the company that makes it almost impossible to resist. Yes, it's nothing special, but it knows, and it could not be proud of that. It's a goofy party horror movie, and he never pretends to be anything more. <br /> <br /> It's not a classic, but "Night of the Demons" is a good example of horror junk food. It may not be too memorable or original, but sometimes you do not want a fancy beer. Sometimes you want a Budweiser.
