The Railway Children, at least this 1970s movie version, written and directed by Lionel Jeffries, the longtime British actor, is an indescribable ... classic. It tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm; the sentimentality is subdued; includes the evocation of childhood adventures; and Jeffries brings wisdom and style to his production. <br /> <br /> The Waterbury family lives an idyllic life in Edwardian London. The father is wealthy, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are good-natured and loving, their home is warm and cozy. During the Christmas holidays, one night two men appear at the door, talking softly to their father and then taking him with them. The lives of Ms. Waterbury (Dinah Sheridan) and Bobbie, 14 (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 (Sally Thomsett) and young Peter (Gary Warren) have changed in no time. Only her steadfastness and her good spirit will endure her. Mrs. Waterbury, now vacillating in poverty, takes her children to a stale old brick house in the countryside near a railway line, not far from a small village with a train station. The children discover the track and regularly sit on a small hill to wave to the passengers as the train passes by. One day, an old gentleman, who goes to his shop in the city, looks up from his newspaper and waves back. It will not be long before he plays an important role in the story. <br /> <br /> Over time, Mrs. Waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to her children. She starts writing stories to make money. She teaches them their lessons and gives them a home of warmth and security. However, the story is about these three children, especially Bobbie. At 14, she is old enough to share her mother's concerns, but young enough to enjoy the adventures of her sister and brother. They find a poor man at the station who can not speak English. They discover that he is a Russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are. They insist that he has to come home with them, and their mother takes him away. Soon the children wrote a big sign to the old gentlemen in the train asking for their help. They help a young man who participates in an obstacle course and breaks a leg in the train tunnel. Soon he is home and recovering. They decide to organize a birthday party for the stationmaster, a man with few friends and several children, who is stubborn because of his dignity. It does not take long for the children to help them recognize the difference between friendship and charity. In other words, the three children encounter all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures and can help to make sure that all problems end happily. <br /> <br /> But what about your own problems? Bobbie finally learns from her mother that her father was taken away for being charged with treason, giving the Russian state secrets. Will Bobbie find a way to help? Is the old man more than just an old man in a passing train? Will her father's case be reopened? Will there be a happy ending? <br /> <br /> Jenny Agutter was almost 18 years old when she filmed her role. She plays the 14-year-old Bobbie with great naturalness and charm. As important as the other players are, especially Dinah Sheridan as mother, Agutter is at the heart of the story. For me it's the talent of Jenny Agutter and the style and restraint of Lionel Jeffries that make this movie so memorable. The problems of history come without serious doubts, but that they are solved. And Jeffries not only gives us a professionally adapted and directorial film, he also adds touches that are barely perceived, but that enchant us. This can only span a split second of a still image when two people are talking; or a slow close-up of a small, yellow wildflower in the grass in front of Bobbie's house, then a slow retreat of a yellow oil lamp turned up inside; or the realization that a delightful interior shot or a view of the green landscape or a view of the train station from a hill is possible ... all of a sudden, you suddenly remember those charming Edwardian drawings that were drawn by hand. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this gentle story can not keep up with children perfecting their Nintendo Monster skills to perfection these days. I'm almost confident that most of her parents, especially those weaned from Batman and Leone, would never attract attention. Nevertheless, it is a perfectly composed film and should not be forgotten. Apart from that, the story retold 19 years later as a television program. This time, Jenny Agutter played the mother.
