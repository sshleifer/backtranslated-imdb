This is a well made action movie. There are many fight scenes, the acting is convincing (for this genre) and RS1 is awesome. I do not know why people feel compelled to discard RS1, I thought its effects were very good and its design looked great. The plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie. <br /> <br /> After saying that, I have to tell you that Richard Sun is one of the worst actors from Hong Kong I have ever seen. At least RS1 had the right idea to kill him. Well, for anyone who considered Sam Lee (Alien) to be a bad actor ... he should not be taken seriously! I just had the pleasure to see Gen-X Cops (Prequel) and Sam Lee, who played the same character the same way NOT JUDGE THAT IS A THINKER OF THINKING MAN! It is not recommended to REQUIRE THOUGHTS! Just to be enjoyed, that's all. I hope they will make you one again soon.
