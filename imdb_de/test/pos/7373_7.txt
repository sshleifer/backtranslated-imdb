I decided to look at FearNet for free on FearNet because I had decided that nothing else would look good. And it turned out to be a good little horror surprise! The film serves as an anthology of four urban legends narrated from the perspective of four teenagers whose cars collapse in the middle of nowhere. After they have decided to build a campfire in the forest, they tell their scary stories and the movie transitions to the events in the stories. <br /> <br /> The honeymoon - a newlywed couple traveling in a motorhome across the country Las Vegas is terrified when they park in a wooded area by evil creatures chasing at full moon. (I'm not going to ruin that for you!) The Hook - Amy Smart and James Marsden (probably the most famous characters in the movie next to the beautiful Christine Taylor) play the young couple facing the maniac who has a catch for a hand in this most recognizable short. <br /> <br /> People can also lick - this is probably the scariest and darkest of the stories. A young girl is chatting with another girl on the internet, but it turns out that she is actually a man obsessed with her. He breaks into the house when she is alone. That was really annoying. <br /> <br /> The Locket- This is also a great story with Glen Quinn and Jacinda Barrett playing a motorcyclist and a beautiful dumb girl terrified by ghosts from an earlier century in a mysterious farmhouse. That was good, but it was the weakest of the posts. <br /> <br /> The group around the campfire is slowly developing their own horrible experiences in their segments between stories, and the end of this movie is amazing and really great! All in all, this is not crispy scary, but it's certainly a big guilty pleasure that horror fans would be equally worth!
