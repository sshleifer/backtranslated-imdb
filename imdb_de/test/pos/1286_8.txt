Excellent movie. No unnecessary gimmicks as in most Hollywood movies. Everything supported the tension of the plot. B & W gave him a simple, unfussy feeling. In short, it was in its simplicity of cinematography and occupation of very special importance. <br /> <br /> The following is an interesting contrast to Memento. Characters both in manipulation and in filtering extensively. In this sense, both reminded me a bit of "In the Company of Men", also highly recommended. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a little easier to follow as the b / w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction, as well as in color. I do not think this applies to the following where scenes were randomly shown. If you have the choice between VCR and DVD, I would highly recommend the DVD, because here you have the opportunity to watch the film a second time in chronological order, not only in the submitted by Nolan encrypted (albeit inconspicuous) order. It also makes it easier to assemble the second viewing order for yourself if you want. <br /> <br /> As another viewer noticed, one of the best things about this movie and memento is that none of the performers was famous. They were characters, not well-known actors, who brought personas developed in other films. <br /> <br /> Given some similarities in action, I wonder if Memento is a kind of remake of Follow, but a goal to reach a larger audience, as Edward Burns has done, is The One in the form of - and with almost the same cast as - The Brothers McMullan.
