After the Second World War, the crime in the city of Phenix in Alabama, which was funded by the money of an army base on the other bank of the river in Georgia, got worse. Gambling, prostitution, loans and such like helped an organized crime apparatus in the city. Soon it was too bad and violent to even tolerate. This movie is based on the true story of this fight. <br /> <br /> By the standards of the fifties, he was shockingly clear. Although it is on a small budget, this small budget helped with the realism that location surveys require. A very dark movie. Richard Kiley was wonderful as always, and John McIntire is persistent. Why this good movie is not shown on video is a real puzzle!
