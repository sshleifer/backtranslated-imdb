Do not expect anything deep and meaningful. Most fight scenes are pretty decent. The two main women are pretty adorable, but their lack of HK action background shows up sometimes. In the end, maybe something is missing, but I enjoyed it anyway. The cheesy humor is unlikely to appeal to anyone who has not seen a lot of HK movies, but once you get that sort of thing and have a few hours to fill something insignificant, you could do a lot worse. (OK, but you could do better, but .......) <br /> <br /> Certainly equivalent to most Hollywood blockbuster action drivels. <br /> <br /> 7/10
