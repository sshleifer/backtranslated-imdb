I've always wanted to see this movie, and the first three quarters showed that I had not waited in vain. But what happened in the end? Do not get me wrong, I liked the movie. It definitely turned me into a nostalgia for the realistic, unique NYC of the 80s, which we lost thanks to Giuliani. But it lacks half an hour!
