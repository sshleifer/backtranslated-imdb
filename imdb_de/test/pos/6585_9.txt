This is another of those rare movies that makes you feel thankful for introducing him instead of the usual Hollywood trip. It's really a roller coaster ride because we're tracking the impact of a fake 500-euro mark on a lot of people. You're always asking "what if", but it's certainly a butterfly effect captured in the movie. They will laugh, cry and bite their lip. I loved every minute of it! Many thanks to SBS Australia for showing films that are really entertaining and even worth reading the subtitles. The only downside in my mind is that I will not book a vacation in Frozen Land - they all seem to be much too depressed. Either way, look at it - it's worth every second.
