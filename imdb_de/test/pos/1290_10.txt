Christopher Nolan's first feature inspired critics who saw him at the first show. Recorded with a micro budget of $ 6,000, this is a student movie with real class. The film is shot in black and white and shows people you think are Nolan's friends appearing in the movie. That does not mean that they are bad actors because they are pretty good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw in other projects, but unfortunately they have not done so since this was done 6 years ago. <br /> <br /> Nolan's thriller, like Memento, does not play chronologically, he shifts the scenes a lot like Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It's a great shooting thriller, but it does make it even more interesting, because it shifts the chronological order of the movie. I thought the last ten minutes were especially good when everything became clear. <br /> <br /> This is so good for a movie with such a low budget and no identifiable names. It's superior to most Hollywood studios, and Nolan, after three films (this is the superior memento and the not-so-good-yet-still-excellent insomnia), has proved to be the most exciting talent of recent times. I can not wait to wait for Batman. <br /> <br /> This movie is short and sweet and definitely a great watch. It's very professional and the twists are fantastic and totally surprising. I also found that the result of David Julyan was also excellent, very atmospheric and cool. He composed Nolan's other films. All in all, I would recommend, I intend to get all the movies from Nolan. This is a jewel on a low budget. ***** <br /> <br />
