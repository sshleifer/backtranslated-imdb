This was the most memorable film ever to punish! It refused to seem one-sided, and the emotions that were felt throughout the story are as real as possible. This movie had one of the most 'humane' (and I use that term in a good way) compassionate religious characters that ever existed! This movie has led me to find and read the book (which is rare for me). Sister Helen had a more spiritual tone than a religious one (which is rare). And it introduced both sides so that the people on both sides who saw the movie did not feel that a point was being missed. And we have the director to thank for that. This is not a movie for entertainment. But it's a movie that conveys a message that goes deep inside. I can not imagine another movie.
