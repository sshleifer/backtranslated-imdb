My partner and I had never heard of this movie and decided to choose the movie from a list of movies via cable without knowing anything about it. When it opened and revealed the cast, we thought, how bad can it be? - Kathy Bates, Jonathan Pryce, Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Dan Akroyd and more. As the story unfolded, we tickled more and more with our selection, and the movie soon made us laugh out loud. This is not a "great" movie, but it is one of those rare films that has such a great combination of memorable characters, through "Truth is Stranger than Fiction" - surreal events that I could not help but love. I had no problem lifting my disbelief about some of the weirdest story elements, because the filmmakers' intentions are so warm-hearted, yet they manage to delight everyone involved. As others have said on IMDb, this is a comfort movie, and I would not be surprised if it became a cult classic.
