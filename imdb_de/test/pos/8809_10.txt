If you were "there" and "done that", you will absolutely love this movie. I mean, and by "there" I mean underground clubs and house parties, which are much rarer in that people are just drunk than people who are very attentive to seclusion, speed or LSD. <br /> <br /> By "this" I mean to dance and sweat like crazy for eight hours or so without even having a brake, and then followed a path to long morning without sleep and almost I wanted to die from a week's wait until the next weekend to do it all over again. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is one of my absolute favorites, I can certainly understand why some people or even most people would not even like it.
