I love this movie because every single element is nothing short of excellent. I will quickly praise a few of them. Peter O'Toole gives us one of his great accomplishments as he becomes the final Mr. Chips. Petula Clark has a beautiful voice and is perfect as Katharine. The director was able to bring history to the screen in new ways. Combine this with fantastic and creative cinematography, editing, writing, etc., and you have a film that shows the good quality of its production. I can not praise the well planned camera work enough, it moves us back and forth, zooms in and out, gives us the best views and lets the filming locations become part of the scene. Petula Clark's last song, "YOU AND I," is just three beautifully composed long-takes, and in this 2-second era, I can appreciate the extra care all involved gave to make those long scenes perfect. The music is great and the songs move the story as they should. Leslie Bricusse is one of my favorite composers. Listen to these songs, how could nobody like them? This is a very romantic story between two people approaching middle age who find each other, get the most out of themselves, and it lasts until the end of their lives. Excellent production values, drama, camera work and music make this film worth seeing.
