Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa was actually stolen once and was missed for almost two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's "La Gioconda" (better known as Mona Lisa) was taken out of the Louvre by a thief (and former employee of the Louvre) who allegedly wanted to return the world's most famous work of art to his native Italy. Due to his actions after the theft, it seems more likely that he wanted to sell the painting for his personal benefit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.) The Mona Lisa was quietly returned to the Louvre on the last day of 1913, and remained there except for occasional loans. When "Arsène Lupine" was published in 1932 (twenty years after the theft), most moviegoers would have recalled the crime of 1911, and their knowledge would have given this film some credibility. "Arsène Lupine" is quite pleasing, with the usual high production standards of MGM and the usual nimble direction of Jack Conway. This movie is not lacking in pleasure; What he lacks is plausibility. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is the master criminal of the title: he specializes in committing "impossible" crimes, which he makes even harder by the previous announcement ... but of course He always commits the crime and deceives the gendarmes. Tully Marshall has a good scene as one of Barrymore's victims. Lupine prefers elaborate paneling that allows Barrymore (an American A-Grade A ham) to indulge his own penchant for joking. John's older brother Lionel Barrymore is Guerchard, the Javert-style Surete detective who was sworn to catch Lupine. Karen Morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was full of populist political activities. On screen, she was most impressive in working-class roles that matched her own political beliefs (such as her good performance in "Our Daily Bread"). In "Arséne Lupine", Morley's naturally dark hair is bleached in a gruesome blond tone, and she's all in classy outfits that make her look rather uncomfortable than sexy. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS COMING. Finally, Lupine decides to steal the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. He cuts the picture out of the frame, rolls up the canvas and smuggles it into a flower basket. We see John Barrymore happen to be swinging a tightly rolled piece of cloth that is supposed to be the largest piece of art in human history. I had to laugh at the mistake made by the filmmakers. In real life (but not in this movie) da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa on a poplar plank, so a thief would have difficulty winding it up! <br /> <br /> Finally, Guerchard catches Lupine and brings him to Le Calaboose. The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in the police car is pure joy, as their sincere affection flows into the dialogue of their characters. I would not have believed this scene with two other actors plausible. I can only imagine that only the Barrymore brothers play these roles. Well, maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid, but just not. <br /> <br /> Do not look for a good plot here, but "Arsène Lupine" is a wonderful example of old-style filming. I will rate this movie with 8 out of 10 points.
