The art of the absurd lives and lives in the current Danish cinema! Well, at least it is in this movie. Nobody in this movie is amused. They are either angry or shocked, and if they are not, they will be soon! It's a story of clashes, murder, embarrassment, dignity and, ultimately, love and salvation. The hideous, awkward humoristic style is idiomatic and will not please everyone, but I personally found it just the right intriguing mix of bizarre and absurd. They take pity on the characters from afar, even if they do not like them at close range. But their story is so tragic that you find it easy to forgive and be happy for them, even if they get away with murder. This is definitely the best Danish movie of the last years in my opinion. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
