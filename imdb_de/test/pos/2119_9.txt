Not all films are Oscar-worthy, but let's be honest, sometimes these types of films are more fun and leave a longer lasting impression. This left me smiling and happy and I could not wait to hug my own son. Anyone with a pet (no matter what type) knows what it feels like to lose one. I think most people would identify with Buddy, who would almost lose his best friend he raised from birth. Bruce Willis was great when the tycoon became a nice guy and convinced Joey Lauren Adams as a good mother. The little boy who played buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend Edgar played great supporting roles. I really liked the movie and the whole family could enjoy it. Many Thanks!
