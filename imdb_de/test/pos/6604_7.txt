Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about the Zephyr skateboarding team and their influence on skateboarding. It also focuses on the history of the skateboard. Directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr team, was written by Stacy Peralta and another team member, Craig Stecyk. The documentary plays the members of the Zephyr team and is narrated by Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> The documentary talks about the beginning of the skateboard and how it developed out of surfing. It discusses the popularity of skateboarding in the late '60s and' 70s, its decline in the '80s and its' rebirth 'in the' 90s. Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica, California. The Zephyr Team originated from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which produced the first modern skateboards. The documentary mainly consists of the original Zephyr teammates talking about the past of the Zephyr team, the competitions won and their popularity and reputation. It focuses on three specific team members. Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams, three skateboarding virtuosos, and probably the best three members of the team. The interviews in the documentary were usually voices about archive material from Dogtown in the late '60s and' 70s. Very rarely do you actually see the people being interviewed, but when you do, they are displayed in black and white while the archive footage was colored. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary is the past (ie The Glory Days of the Zephyr Team) and not the present. The documentary is very fast, as clips of impressive skateboarding about upbeat music of the era (such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and David Bowie) are often seen and the interviews are rather quick and to the point. Since I did not know anything about skateboarding (d. H. did not even know how to drive directly over the ground), I was very surprised that I found this documentary so interesting. The reason is that this doco was more about the Zephyr team than the actual skateboarding sport. While I could not deal with skateboarding, I could relate to the guys in the team. Since it was created by real team members, there is more depth and authenticity. <br /> <br /> All in all, I have to say that this is one of the best documentary films I have ever seen. It gave me a whole new insight, not just into the Zephyr team, but into skateboarding as a whole. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how much more interesting it must be. Seven and a half out of ten stars.
