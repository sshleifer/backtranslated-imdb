Seven Ups was compared to Bullitt for the chase scene, but does not get close to Bullitt. Bullitt has a beginning building Builds builds. As McQueen leaves the run-down hotel, gets into his Mustang, parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now demolished) and notices the Charger sitting nearby, you know you'll see something spectacular. From this moment on, when McQueen launches the car, the best chase sequence ever filmed begins. Add to that a terrific Lalo Schriffin, if I remember the right soundtrack. This will take a long time before you actually hear the first tire squeal. The shot of McQueen's Mustang, which suddenly appears in Bill Hickman's rearview mirror, is unmatched for visual impact. Hickman's surprising look and double take enhance the effect. Then, of course, San Francisco is unsurpassed for hiring cars that drive up and down hills and around bends. Bullitt, shot in the '60s when the cars were still "hot" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger), made for a better set of wheels than two boring, smog-laden Pontiacs in the 1970s Seven Ups. Bill Hickman was the bad guy's driver in both films. I saw him sit at the univeral lot in an insider movie preview when I was film reviewing a newspaper. They tried to do it with the tracking scene in Seven Ups. Seven heights had a few "jumps" over small hills (yawn), but of course they were not hills of San Francisco. The Seven Ups chase, where they actually go fast, is longer than the fast sequence in Bullitt. But the scene of a single shotgun that blows off the hood of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the pinnacle of absurdity. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except that it was filmed in New York.
