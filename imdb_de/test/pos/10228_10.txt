I'd like to see a connection between NightBreed, The Fury, and the X-Men series, in a way that the second series of Outer Limit would tie up certain stories and storylines retrospectively, to create a story arc, though never was intended. I would also like to know if any further information - anecdotal or otherwise - exists about the relationship and / or collaboration between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg. I just can not believe that David Cronenberg appeared as an actor in a Clive Barker movie. Is there any additional information on this topic? It's been 17 years since the movie was released, and I was hoping that there would be a sequel now. Does anyone out there know if there are any plans that have never been successful, or if there really are plans for a sequel?
