This film is exceptional in that Marlene & Raymond present outstanding performances. The acting in this film is the biggest strength of the production, but the script, the direction and the editing deserve applause. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exists between the two stars. If you like Marlene and Raymond, you'll love this movie ... (a classic that compares to Casablanca.) <br /> <br />
