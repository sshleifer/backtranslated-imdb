As a former TV editor, I can say that this is as authentic as it gets. It even led to the producer of Letterman (who was thought to be the source) (ultimately) resigning in real life. Letterman was outraged (OK, one of the things is that he hurls softballs onto his compound with a tire swing; total fabrication), but the main information is hilarious, from the stupid prayer war for Letterman, after he had decided to leave NBC to Leno's problems with an agent who was not ready for big time, but whom he let run out of his famous loyalty (almost to a catastrophic outcome). If any of you kids do not understand the idea why Letterman is jealous to this day, check out this book.
