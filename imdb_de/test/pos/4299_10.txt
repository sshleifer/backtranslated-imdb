Nigel Balchin's fairytale novel "A Path through the Forest" was adapted by Julian Fellowes, who also directs this "terribly British" series in a tensionless room. It's a film based on the cast that depicts the different benign / vicious characters, and here's what Fellowes' decisions are all about. The story has a linear line that's easy to follow, but the beauty of the movie is the metamorphosis of every player as a single incident triggers a minefield of disasters. James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) is a successful obsessed London attorney, married to Anne (Emily Watson), who needs more in her life: the childless couple lives in the countryside in a beautiful estate, supported by his longtime "cleaning lady" Maggie ( Linda Bassett). They visit social tours and meet, among others, William Bule (Rupert Everett), the passively lazy, wealthy neighbor. Anne decides that they should entertain her neighbors, and against the James James protest, Anne plans to do so: James arranges "not to visit for business." An accident occurs on the night of the party when Maggie's husband is accidentally killed by someone in a Range Rover (she watched). When James comes home, he sees a scratch on Williams Range Rover and suspects that William is the culprit. Anne advises James not to go with the information to the police - "What can do good except ruin Bill's life as a celebrity and father and son of an important scion?" From this first "lie" spreads the virus: James confronts Bill, who persuades James to go to the police. Anne admits that she drove Bill 's Rover and is responsible for it. James persuades Anne to stay calm because he would ruin his reputation by admitting to Anne that she has an affair with Bill, and the three agree that because of their big lie they will stick together for the good of the public true. Eventually, Anne succumbs to the blame that she did not tell her beloved Maggie that she is the person in charge, and Maggie, who herself has been guilty of an earlier theft, whose life was saved by Anne's grace to hire her anyway, is the agent who pulls the story to its surprising conclusion. Lies bear witness to lies, witness lies, and so on. <br /> <br /> The main effect of these intrigues is the way in which isolated tragedy affects each of the involved characters. Each one changes dramatically. Tome Wilkinson shows the best performance of a career filled with brilliant performances: he can say more with his attitude and facial expression than with any actor in front of today's audience. Likewise, the talented Emily Watson adds another good role to her repertoire, as does the surprisingly grubby Rupert Everett, who, while still a rich British "gentleman," gives a man both mentally and ultimately needy. And the ever-fine Linda Bassett takes on a small role, making her with finesse a quiet center of the chaotic web of lies. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of Tony Pierce-Roberts and the score of Stanislas Syrewicz add immensely to the different atmospheres of the story. This is an ensemble at its finest, which means that the director (Julian Fellowes) has the piece well under control. The interplay of these fine people makes the dubious story work very well.
