Before I saw this TV movie, I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. After seeing it, I realized how sad the life of Lucille Ball really was. It also had great moments, but I did not know how sad it was. This movie was very good and told the story of the beloved Lucille Ball very well. I highly recommend it.
