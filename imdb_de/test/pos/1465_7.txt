The soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant in parts. You have to watch it because of its strong characterization and the risks involved in conspiring over two individuals who hurt each other in love. You need to get to know the story through various reviews, so let's talk about what's brilliant about this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the two protagonists are such real and fascinating personalities. The first is a woman who has retired from a four-year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone approaching her. The second is a man who has always wanted to be a woman whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance. You hate the former and your heart is bleeding for the latter. <br /> <br /> The second thing in this movie is the whole concept of loving one, who you are, regardless of gender. Would you still love your partner if he / she changed his / her gender? The film explores this idea and is a beautiful one. <br /> <br /> But there is a point where the movie fails. I wish the relationship between the protagonists had developed better. What they feel as love comes only at the end. But look at it and post your thoughts here .......
