This was a movie that I thought in the end, "Well, that was a pleasant 2 hours!" I hate to spend about $ 20 (without babysitting $$) for my husband and myself to feel it was "OK". I think I like Will Smith as a comedian rather than an action hero. He was well-placed in it. His character was very sympathetic, as was Kevin James. <br /> <br /> There were several laughing loud scenes. It's also a romantic movie, so, guys, if you want to impress the lady in your life, take her with you. Women will love it as much as any chick movie, but I would not categorize this as one. There is a lot of guy humor for men to enjoy. I think that's one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie. It has romance and slapstick. Normally I do not like slapstick so much, but it was not exaggerated and I can not imagine any scenes that did not make you laugh. <br /> <br /> I can definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband said to me after it was over was "I want to see it again!"
