This performance leaves nothing to be desired. We saw it in Offenbach and it is breathtaking. We only got the cheap tickets in the back, but still had a look at everything that happened. If you ever have a chance to see it live, then GO! It's worth the trip and if I were you, I would wait a good half hour after the show to cool off. The performances are breathtaking and around the tent there are colorfully dressed performers who distract, help, smile and bring the whole tent to life. The music - live music !! - is as good as the CD version: perfect! I later bought a DVD, but the filmed show had less colorful costumes. It's the atmosphere in the tent that sweeps you off your feet. A great trip for young and old and also a great movie
