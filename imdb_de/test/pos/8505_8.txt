I saw it for the first time when it was shown for the first time, so I'm not too objective. I was really scared, partly because it was so late in the night, but partly because of all this feeling from a videotaped tense story (the same thing that helped Dark Shadows itself). And the casting was right. I hardly know Shane Briant of anything else, so maybe it's not right to call him "well-staffed," but to me he's Dorian Gray. And as far as the other male actors are concerned, Nigel Davenport (who has such good characters going beyond life was as well suited as Sir Henry). And John Karlen, a kind of Dan Curtis "repertorist" at the time, because of Dark Shadows. As a poster emphasizes, this version quite subtly manages to involve the involvement of men. The scene in which Dorian recites a list of male names to John Karl's character to blackmail him and the expression on Karl's face were very successful. (If this scene was done now, it would probably be TOO OBVIOUS and be poor by comparison.) I saw it when "Dorian Gray" was hardly a name for me, let alone more than the famous version of 1945 (which too) Pretty famous), that's THE version for me.
