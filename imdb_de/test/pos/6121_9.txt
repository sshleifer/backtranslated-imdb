More entertaining than all gay orgies in "300" together. More heartbreaking than a Shakespearean tragedy. Poetier than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. Plus the biggest garbage ever made. <br /> <br /> A black comedy that explores the limits of the human senses. John Waters' cult film "Pink Flamingos" is a story about the conflict between two families ending in humiliation, death and, of course, the consumption of dog droppings (yes, by the way, that's not the humiliating part). No, no, this is not about the impossible love, there are no Romeos or Juliet in those 90 minutes. This movie is about the fight for prestige, if you could call it that. The fight for the title - Filthiest person alive. <br /> <br /> On one side we have Divine (played by the Cross-Dressing Waters members ... um ... Divine) a caring daughter, a good mother, cannibals, murderer, pervert and current owner of the said title. She loves her son cracker a bit too much. Cracker himself has a sexual attraction for chickens and young women, who sometimes mix them into triplets. Family Friend and Faithful Accomplice Cotton enjoys her satisfaction when watching crackers during some of his ... acts involving the aforementioned attractions. Not least, Divine's mother and grandmother Crackers, Edie. A 400-hundred-woman who sleeps, eats and basically lives in a cradle. She is addicted to eggs and loves the Eiermann (the man who brings the eggs ... lol). The four of them live peacefully in a caravan outside the city until they arrive a destination for the marbles. Exhibitionists, manipulators, cheaters, actually very angry people. Their main source of income is the kidnapping and impregnation of young women. For the impregnation part, they use their trustworthy and faithful cross-dressing butler to provide the seed. Then they sold the born child to the highest bidder. <br /> <br /> It was the Marbles' envy of Divine and her title that will lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. An epic struggle of dirt, perversion and violence. <br /> <br /> "Pink Flamingos" is an unsurpassed masterpiece in the trash movie genre. John Waters' film is full of oddities and strange acts and is loathed and hated by traditionalists, critics, and the average moviegoer. For the few who are not scratched by these generalizations, the flamingos are an unforgettable experience. Funny and sick, violent and poetic. It is really an exercise with a bad taste
