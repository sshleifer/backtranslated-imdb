The Mario series is back and, in my opinion, better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative mario so far; Even more than Super Mario 64. The controls are great; some of the best for the wii. nice graphic design. The levels are very big and the good old bosses are back. There is a lot to explore in this game; definitely a high replay value. I have only 2 complaints: 1: The story is a bit too similar to Mario 64. and 2: The difficulty is not very high; although it requires some patience. Mario fans: the game you've been waiting for. Casual Players: This game is more than worth the purchase. 9.8 out of 10.
