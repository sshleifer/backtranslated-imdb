The man with the golden arm, Otto Premingers controversial panorama drama, takes place in rhythmic, lashing arrangements between the descriptions of his living and architectural inhabitants. The opening of the film, a close-up of a bar where Frankie peeks through the window, already tells us about the celebrity who will grasp the protagonist's subjective experience. Drawn in the direction of ever-diminishing spaces, the film closes as the local gangster's long-drawn-out poker game locks in before daylight and locks in as Sinatra's Frankie Machine locked himself in a room in the acclaimed scene of his shattering fight for his Habit to overcome. The visual intercourse in "The Man With The Golden Arm" shapes the shapes and faces of his jazzy townhouse, characterizing twisted psychological circumstances and creating an overwhelming environment, as maintained by the recurrent tracking shots in close-ups of Frankie's eyes. <br /> The grace of this fiery drama, which already stands out in the exciting opening opening, shows the command over the perceptible world that allows studio production. The wonderfully rundown urban sets define an independent place with no beginning or end, an indeterminate state that in reality is hardly permanent, as long as this run of skids seems before being gentrified or leveled. The flair of certain performances, in particular Robert Strauss' as wonderfully named underworld game boss Schwiefka and Arnold Stang as Frankie's reliable four-eyed pet dog, is pleasingly becoming a fiery surreal game. The premonition of drug addiction, Sinatra's powerhouse performance, Elmer Bernstein's infectious, powerful jazz score, and Saul Bass's famous, influential, and controversial opening sequence focused on the animated paper cut of a heroin addicted arm, made for The Man with the Golden Arm in his time pushes to the bottom of realism in the still restrained Hollywood. It is impressionistic and subjective, as I say, but its purpose, its power and its spirit are much closer to home. <br /> <br /> What appeals to me most in this movie is its aspect as a gangster movie. It has the illicit card games, short draws, the fights, the cannons, the double crosses, the characters on the Lam, a femme fatale, a stunningly sexy minor, the shady nightclubs and the urban scenery surrounding for entertainment. Really, it's the perfect environment and the genre in which to tell this story, a criminal neighborhood where it's just too pleasant to escape by a bottle or two or three or four, or drugs, a temporary dose actually works it is only to keep a person in hiding from any enlightenment and all the clear scenarios the world could offer.
