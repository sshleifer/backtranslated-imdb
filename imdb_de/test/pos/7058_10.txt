Yes, it feels and plays mostly as an "after school special", for a slightly more adult audience, alright, maybe a youthful audience. But in Bill Murray (who already shows a dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent), add a nice minor cast and an unexpected sweetness about growing up and remembering those great or not so great days in the summer camp, and you get a heartwarming, funny, sleepy. <br /> <br /> It gets a bit too smarmy for itself, but that's one of its charms. When you hear the title "Meatballs" and see the poster, you expect a juvenile sex hype, but what you get is a sentimental, but sometimes sexy, retrospective look at those formative years in the summer camp. The sentimentality and memories of simpler times remind me of "A Christmas Story," which I love too. The memories of the summer camp have never been so clear. The only movie I've ever seen is "Indian Summer," which I almost like "Meatballs," and also stars Matt Craven. Let's hope he finishes the trilogy. Maybe he could come back for "Return of the Meatballs" and bring some dignity to the franchise (Meatballs 2 to 4 are not similar to the original classic). <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" is easily on my top 10 guilt feelings of all time (not really guilty either). It's a wonderful little movie that always makes me smile.
