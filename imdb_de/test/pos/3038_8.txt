This movie is a piece of the time it was made ..... Realistic. In the late '60s and early' 70s, films were not covered in sweets. The producers did not try to create a happy ending that did not exist. The lack of a happy ending would cause a stir in the audience, which hopefully would spur them on to action. At least it seemed then. In today's movie world, this movie probably would not be made. This end would definitely not exist, but realistic. The sad fact is that the film is a situation that could not be improved if the relationship between the traditional white thinking of the South and the progressive movements of that time was improved.
