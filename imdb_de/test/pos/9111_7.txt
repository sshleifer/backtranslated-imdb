When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Gass were making a movie about their band, I freaked out! I love their music and I hoped that this movie would be really funny! Now that I've seen it, I can not really say that those hopes were not satisfied, but I think I expected more. The movie is full of Tenacious D's great music and I really loved to hear it all. There are many great jokes and I love the story, at least the first one. I do not like how the movie ends. The end is very abrupt and in my opinion they could have prolonged that a bit. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's a good movie to watch! Anyone who likes rock music should see it! It will make you laugh well!
