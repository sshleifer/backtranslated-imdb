Probably the best series of all time (so far no argument) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov and the beautiful Dale Arden traveling with a rocket ship in another universe to save the planet. In fascinating, spectacular and action-packed chapters, Flash and his friends, along with new friends such as Prince Barin, Prince Thun and the impressive King Vultan, pool their resources to fight against the evils and armies of merciless Ming by Mongo and his daughter Priness's jealous betrayal Aura (now she is a car!). This series is not just a cut across most series in terms of plot, drama and budget - it's far ahead in these areas. It was produced by Universal Studios and has many previous sets, such as The Bride of Frankenstein's The Laboratory and The Opera House of The Phantom of the Opera, to name but a few. The production values ​​in all areas are, in my humble opinion, high for 1936. The costumes that many of these strange men and women wear are truly creative and first-rate. We get hawks, hawks, lions, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids and tigrons (oh my!) And many other fantastic things. Are all credible and first class special effects? Under no circumstance. But for 1936, most are very impressive. The score is great and the beginnings of the chapters are well written, long enough to revive the viewer's memories of the previous chapter, and have been expertly rated. Director Frederick Stephani does a great job putting everything together beautifully and creating a worthy film for Alex Raymond's Phenom comic strip. After all, the drama in this series is pretty good. Too often, series either do not have names without talent that surround one or two former talents - almost everyone has something here. Do not get me wrong, it's not a Shakespeare troupe in any way, but as a flash, Buster Crabbe does a crafty, sympathetic job. He is supported by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson and the rest of the cast in general, with two outstanding performers. But before I get to the two, let me add, as another reviewer noted that it must have been amazing that this series comes through the Hayes Office. On Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson, I see more flesh than decades later in movies. The shorts by Crabbe (and unfortunately for all of us who wear Professor Zarkov ((Frank Shannon)) are about as figure-hugging as shorts the boys can wear, the girls carry drifts all the time and are absolutely gorgeous talent, but they Lawson is also very sultry and sensual and beautiful, but for me, the two actors who make the show are Charles Middleton as Ming: offensive, sardonic, merciless and fun Middleton is a class playing "Tiny" Lipson King Vultan: impetuous, intoxicating, hilarious - a symbol of pure joie de vivre and every essence of hedonism Lipson steals every scene he's in Gordon is the penultimate series, space opera and the basis for a lot of science fiction.
