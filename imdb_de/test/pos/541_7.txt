I was impressed with this movie because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the role of a fugitive, irrational and possessive mother who constantly gives her daughter the message that they need to stick together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is doubtful, but she has no choice at first - her attachment to her mother is pathologically strong. <br /> <br /> Over time, the girl sees that the mother is flying in imaginary ways and she does not have feet on the floor. She sees that her mother is looking head over heels for a handsome, seductive guy who loves her and leaves her. She sees that the mother does not understand. So how can she look for instructions from her mother? <br /> <br /> The mother instructs the girl to a drama try-out and sees that the daughter plays the role of the mother so that she presents a terribly painful mirror to the flying nightmare. This leads to a period of depression and the girl is appalled by the impact on the mother and is apologetic, but the lesson prevails. <br /> <br /> There is character growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim to the daughter and finally gets persuaded to let the girl go. It is a touching scene and a valuable lesson that parents, even if they are emotionally dependent, have to let the child go and become their own person.
