Joe is the movie about the dark side of 1960s power in America, and Susan Sarandon had beautiful breasts. This movie scared me so much when I saw him in the theater that I never liked Peter Boyle to Young Frankenstein, and he was still very suspicious after the comedy. Looking back on today's experience, this film seems to be up to date, direct, and up to half the approval of the electorate of John McCain's Joe The Plumber and their fear of electing a black man as US President in the coming weeks. A black Prez would be considered a sweet revenge of the "Nigger", but he would fire many minds, if not the streets, this time by Joe enthusiasts. The spirit of Joe in the movie is revived in the campaign of Joe The Plumber! Still, I love being American and fearing both, and knowing that they exemplify what, ironically, Gregory Peck said, our civilized law is also, "A living, breathing reality!" God, help us.
