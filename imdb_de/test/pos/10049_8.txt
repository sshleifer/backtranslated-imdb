This is a wonderful movie movie - he gets 8 out of 10 points. As a filmed piece of accurate story ... you want to be more loving, but it's a 5 out of 10 points. And I think I am indeed very benevolent. <br /> <br /> How was he - this man of horse and saber who was the youngest "young" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and with his whole order dying ended military victory of the North American Indian tribes? Disagreement, militant, stocky, bloody, ambitious, smart, too smart, Indian, Indian (?) And national hero. His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and put him in a position equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, Grant / Lee and Sherman / Jackson. Only with increasing awareness of the mistakes of his career - the overly ambitious hot spur - his reputation decreased. To this day, George Armstrong Custer is the best-remembered figure in the military annals of our history when he lost his last battle (I can not really imagine a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, who is forced to join his men Bataan to stay on death march - Wainwright survived the march and World War II. <br /> <br /> Custer has appeared in more movies than far better generals due to the Western adventures and the Little Big Horn - pity the details of the real career Never before were they treated as lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn in this film, but the legend was still strong in 1941. Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently featured in another film report that survived George's life until 1933. Therefore her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later. "Custer became stubborn as ours he considered, but brave knight, and as the shadow of the Second World War drew nearer, we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would have fully understood and approved this. <br /> <br /> We have the impression that he is a hot spur, but he was patriotic. Although Custer was almost ousted from West Point by successes (which was true), Custer was a member of the 1861 class, and it would have been stupid to pick such a fighter this year. You see, most of West Point's so-called military talent (by Robert E. Lee) was in the south and joined the Confederation. The Union needed every "point" man from the north they could find. <br /> <br /> Custer's civil war career was to be further investigated - he was attached to the staff of Chief of Staff George B. McClellan and awarded even in the peninsula campaign and other wars on the Eastern Front. But he was a cavalryman-and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the final stages of the war. In the Battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the Confederacy threat in the Shenandoah Valley, it served in particular with slash and distinctiveness. It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederation and rose to a position like Custer - fatally injured - Custer sat with Ramseur during the last night of the last day). <br /> After the war things fell apart. He wanted to make his Brevet - Major Generalship - permanent (it was not a battlefield action). They had only one lieutenant colonel to take him to the shrunken army on the border. He tried to play politics by making the mistake of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and found that most Northerners hated Johnson as an inappropriate idiot. He had supposedly admired the Indians (he was certainly eloquent by them and the West), but in 1868 he caused a real massacre of Indian women and children, which ended with a court-martial. Later, in the 1870s, he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (who went to Secretary of War William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts at a profit. It ruined Belknap and left a black eye at the Grant Administration. He brought him to the kennel with Grant and Sherman (the former commander of Belknap), and Sheridan could barely save his career. Then he was sent to the last Big Horn Campaign. And immortality has arrived. <br /> <br /> This career is worth a real movie, but would it be too critical? Should we keep a man of the 1850s - 1876 at the 2007 standard? Would we like that to be done to us in a hundred years? Surely it could happen, but I'm not sure we would like it. <br /> <br /> Custer (1941 style) fits Flynn like a glove, coming closest to a "dance" performance in every way his most important films. His graduation film with Olivia De Haviland is underlined by the fate of the character of the hero with a melancholy. In support of actors such as Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn, they were very good friends, enemies or even treacherous villains (Kennedy). As an entertaining piece of myth, it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero, that's not what it should be.
