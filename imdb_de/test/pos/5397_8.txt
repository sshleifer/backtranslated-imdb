Enjoyed this movie, which revolves exclusively around an average family, it seems. Ben Travis (Jeff Daniels) plays the role of a father who is only interested in a son who can swim excellently and win many trophies. He hates it very much and even his father. Ben has very little to say to his other son Tim (Emile Hirsh) and even to his daughter Penny (Michelle Williams), who is fortunate enough to be in college. Mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) tries to keep the family together, and she too is completely ignored by her husband. There is a very tragic event in the family that changes the personality of everyone. Young and old start taking drugs at parties, smoking and drinking constantly. There is even a homosexual scene and at the same time there is even room for comedy and of course there is a very dark secret that Sandy Travis finally tells her son Tim.
