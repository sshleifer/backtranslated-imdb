Sometimes, but very rarely, a movie tells a story so well that it becomes almost difficult. This movie tells several stories at the same time so well that it was the first time I could not see a movie to the end. It was too real ... and the characters SO SO STRONG that watching became a personal battle. To see how these three men and their families deal with their hardships, especially one that has often hit me too hard. Now I've seen several times without interruption in its entirety, and I realize what I've always suspected. This movie is a masterpiece. The writing, the acting, the merging of several stories, without being a bit choppy, everything about this film is extraordinary. Seven Oscars? No wonder, it must have earned them.
