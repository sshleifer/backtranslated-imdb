After a group of young friends on the drive off the beaten track had problems with the car, they accept an offer from the lone local Mr Slausen (Chuck Connors), owner of a nearby museum full of historic wax figures. Having arrived at the spooky street attraction, the friends are pursued by a masked lunatic who can bring to life the museum's dummies by the power of the Spirit. The villain of Tourist Trap is a demented cross between The Texas Chain Saw Massacer's Leatherface and Anthony, the scary kid from the classic Twilight Zone episode "It's a Good Life," while the plot is a mix of elements from the aforementioned TCM, Hitchcock's Psycho and House of Wax is. However, the atmosphere and execution of Tourist Trap is so absurd that in this respect it is virtually impossible to compare it to other earlier films. Director David Schmoeller is always inventive and unpredictable His own screenplay gives the film a nightmarish quality and a brilliant performance on the left side of Connors, an incredibly scary score by Pino Donaggio, a collection of truly disturbing mannequins with detachable pines and the presence of super sexy Tanya Roberts Tourist Trap spends the movie in (and off) tiny denim hot pants and a figure-hugging tube tube. This is an absolutely unforgettable and ultimately unique horror experience worthy of its cult events.
