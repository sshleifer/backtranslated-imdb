Well, I think I wanted a movie that really grabbed me from the start. This movie was not. It trotted along at a fairly slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but it was not something I was terribly interested in. There is a fascinating and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes are dominated by the main character's wanderings, of which I did not know much and did not really understand then. He usually walks alone, he does not meet anyone; I can imagine that the director has tried to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world or something that is all good, but I still wish he had reduced it from 40 to 15 minutes because it became incredibly boring can <br /> <br /> But after those 40 minutes, things become very interesting. I think I will not really say more because I do not want to spoil anything. So, if you've seen the first 15 to 30 minutes of this movie and think about turning it off (like I was) then just stick to it - it gets a lot better. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting thing about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue at all. So I really had to think about what happened, how characters felt and what their motivations were, why the things in this post were so -apocalyptic world that gives history a lot of room to interpret the audience. And it's amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors are not exactly telling what's going on.
