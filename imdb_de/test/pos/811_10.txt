I saw this movie for the first time in the early 90s and immediately fell in love with it. Richard Adams and his wife Paula made the movie "Saturday the 14th" in 1981 before shooting this movie in 1983. I think they work pretty well together. This movie made me laugh several times. It also has a young Molly Ringwald, who later in the late 1980s would make films like "Pretty in Pink" and "16 Candles". It's fun to see them younger. I do not think any average movie fan ever heard this movie. However, when I saw him for the first time, I was glad that I did that. I've given this movie 10 out of 10 stars, as I believe it is a funny movie that the whole family can enjoy. Unfortunately, I would say that it is not available on DVD. So I bought a VHS copy on ebay. So if you are interested, you will probably find a movie there $ 20- $ 30-dollar range, but I have a target of $ 12 dollars. I wish they would eventually release this on DVD.
