The Buddy Holly Story opens in 1956 in Lubbock, Texas, with a yellow neon moon on the roof of a runway. When the credits begin, the camera moves from the moon to the parking lot, into the runway, past the concessions, and over the ice rink to a small bandstand where a small band performs their soundcheck. It's a tracking shot that Welles and Scorcese would appreciate. It cuts off Buddy Holly's brutal face, which looks down in tense concentration as he grabs the headphones and talks to a man who puts this band on the radio. <br /> <br /> A young Gary Busey plays Buddy Holly and his performance is the key. He must somehow show the passion that Holly had for his music for the movie to work. This is a rock'n'roll story with no coke lines dulled with heroin and a fifth of whiskey. This is not about a man with several women, who can choose between sexsexzandierten, bruteless, listless tragedies. This is a movie about a nice Texan boy who respected his parents, went to church and had the same girlfriend for five years and fell in love with rock and roll. Busey finds this spark and lights it, his passion is clear and contagious. He really plays guitar in the movie and sings, which is not drowned out in Holly's recordings. Busey was a young man in Hollywood in the 1970s, an arduous actor and also a troublesome rock musician. That's why he does a great job because although he's not Buddy Holly, he's in a similar situation. <br /> <br /> His first song is the old classic by Les Paul "Mockingbird Hill", and he has the country to go with it. Next, a kid calls for some Bop and his two bandmates (in reality, the Crickets were 3 guys, but down-sizing works well for the limited narrative of the movie), and he whines her to Rocking with Ollie Vee. The kids love it and the parents hate it. The DJ on the Rolling Track picks it up and is later released in New York, without Buddy Holly even knowing he was ever recorded. This leads to the funniest scene in a movie full of humorous moments. A steamed disc jockey from Buffalo calls Buddy at home. The DJ has been playing "That's the day" for 12 hours and is on 24. The police are knocking on the barricaded door of the station. Holly is confused, but when the dust settles, he's pretty excited. He tells the boys and their rise begins. Dan Stroud as drummer and Charles Martin Smith as bassist complete the band well and have good chemistry with each other. There are problems, but not exaggerated drama, that can be found in most rock biopics (all?). The movie does not manipulate you either. Her emotions are rising, but they are not being manipulated. When the crickets in Harlem enter the Apollo stage, the first white group ever to play there, then they're torn into an electric-charged performance of "Oh Boy" and win the audience over, my rock-and-roll loving ass smothered and cried. Next, Busey and the guys "It's so Easy" are more funky and soulful than I thought possible. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has even a passing knowledge of Buddy Holly's story knows where this movie will end. Holly died too young in a plane crash with Richie Valens and the Big Bopper. We as viewers know that, but the film was so well written, directed and lovingly done that we forget it almost immediately. The movie is not about his death, it's about his life and his place in rock'n'roll history. The film ends with his last appearance and it takes a good fifteen minutes for Busey to defeat the mind of Buddy Holly. I was happy to hear that he finished it on "Not Fade Away," my favorite of his songs. The film freezes before the end with the information about the plane crash, but I barely noticed. I was still thinking about how good the last song was.
