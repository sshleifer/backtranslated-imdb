We saw La Spettatrice at the Chicago International Film Festival last night and were both immensely touched. This is a compelling story of loneliness and lack of connection, where the desire for intimacy collides with our fear of learning too much about ourselves. The three main roles (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all outstanding and the dynamic between them is very surprising. <br /> <br /> After all the films depreciating older women, it's great to see Flavia (a law professor at a university in Rome) presented in a beautiful, sensual, seductive and powerful way. We firmly believe that when a younger woman enters the mix, the older woman becomes jealous of the younger woman, the husband leaves the older woman for the younger woman, etc. In this film, however, the emotional truth is much more complex , Highly recommended.
