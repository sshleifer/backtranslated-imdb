While I read all the complaints about this movie before I saw it, I was still interested in the preview. I do not know if that was because I was expecting a bomb or something, but I really liked the movie. I was not scared at all until the second half of the movie, but even then it was not that bad at all. I think most of the scenes and false positives were realistic, if a bit too coincidental, but it was necessary to push history forward. I think that the house and the surrounding area are the perfect setting for this kind of movie, it's gorgeous and huge, but then the same features that are attractive are scary. I also think that the light arrangement worked very well, because not only did they enroll at the entrance, but there was no way to keep them running, so the house was dark outside the small section where Jill was remained. Speaking of Jill, I thought her role was pretty good, at first it was not that credible, but after a few phone calls that was fine. In fact, the scenes in which she is afraid are perfectly realized. And finally someone made the fire poker right. I can not tell you how many times I hear a fire sound in my house, and it was a nice touch for her to do the same thing, even if she forgets it idiotically when she needs it most. /> <br /> In terms of storylines, the film is not perfect, but almost every hole can be explained, and part of the puzzle is how it came in. Exactly how long did he watch her? How did he come out to kill her friend? and when exactly did the gardener die? Overall, I liked it and was surprised how fast it went. It kept my attention and I wanted to see how it ended, though the ending was very short and left a bad taste in the mouth. My only complaint, aside from the end, was the lack of character development. You could have spent ten minutes with her and her friends or something to make us feel more bad about her situation, give us an idea of ​​her personality, and predict how she will handle the situation (for example, the scene, Considering whether she should return for the children, it looks like there's a lack of a scene at the beginning in which she talks about caring about herself or something.
