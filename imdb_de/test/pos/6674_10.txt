I thought that this movie was greatly underestimated. The subject seems a bit strange, and I was scared off at first, but when I saw the movie, it did not seem weird at all. I was intrigued by the variety of possibilities that history offered, and I could not wait to see how it would end. Once it was over ... I thought about it for a long time. I was satisfied with everything about K-Pax, from acting and the story to the scientific elements and psychological issues to the very end. It's not a particularly happy or happy movie, even if you occasionally giggle, but I found it particularly entertaining and thought-provoking. I own it now and will see it often.
