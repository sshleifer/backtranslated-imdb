I'll bet I watch this movie four or five times a year and I'll do it more often now that the Hollyweird moguls have thought fit to bring it to DVD because it's a classic with a big "C "! This movie is timeless! How can people today pay $ 10 to see the JUNK coming from Hollyweird with films like THE Egyptian; THE TEN COMMANDMENTS; BEN HUR; CAPTAIN NEWMAN MD on tape; DVD; and cable film channels; I could go on forever, but this movie is so great, and for a relative unknown, Edmund Purdom wears the movie like Atlas does the world. The story is wonderful, the acting is first class and the graphics in the end are so powerful that you sit in your seat for a few minutes and just try to dissolve the words in them! Really a knockout of a movie. I would give this one 15 stars if they would let me! They do not do it that way anymore, but they should !!!!!
