With all the shoot-ups, blood horror movies that have come to us lately "Saw, Hostal, Saw 2, The Hills have eyes" Yes, they have their place, do not get me wrong! I recently saw with my buddy "When a stranger calls"! Why? Because it's a remake of the 1979 classic that was excellent at the time and afraid you know what's coming from everyone! I did not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! It was a movie of mood, atmosphere, excitement! Because people remember what you can not see, what you think you see, what you do not hear, or what you think you hear, it's far scarier than what you do! If you love movies with mood, horror, tension and atmosphere !! You will love it! It brought it back to the roots of the original Halloween. Thumbs up, a solid 8.5 out of 10. Remember, folks, it's done well! not perfect! It's scary, not bloody, it's scary, not bloody! It was nice to see a movie coming for so long. Our minds have been conditioned and distorted by the sheen and shock of modern horror movies. We forget what is really scary.
