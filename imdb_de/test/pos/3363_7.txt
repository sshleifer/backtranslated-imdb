Overall, the Dad Army movie is very funny, though the humor is not quite as catchy and sparkling as in the TV and radio series. So, where does that leave us, the spectators? If you've never seen Father's Army, the movie is a great way to catch up and convince yourself of the crazy world of Walmington o / S. The downside is that you may not be able to "understand" it because, as I said, the humor in the movie is a bit too hard. <br /> <br /> For Dads Army fans, the movie does not hold anything new in the story is more or less a cutup of the TV series, but it's a unique chance to see your favorites in "High Def" compared with the shitty quality of BBC video footage. <br /> <br /> The film also offers what must be the lame holdup sequence in the history of the universe. However, I can not decide if that is positive or negative.
