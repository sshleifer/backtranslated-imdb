I just wanted to say that I see National Velvet on TV. It is now February 2006, and I have checked dates, etc. It was surprising that it was made in 1944 and Rooney was 24 years old, while Liz Taylor was only 12 years old. She is a savvy English actress. <br /> <br /> To correct some American contributors, there are no Irish villages in England. Ireland is a completely different country and has nothing at all to do with the English countryside. The scenes shown are allegedly taken on the south coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (County Sussex). Unfortunately, there is no such scene. As in many other places, roads and buildings were built on the hills and beaches. <br /> <br /> So, all Americans, never mistake Ireland for England! We make a big exception. Like confusing Texas with Coney Island.
