As I read through the comments, I was surprised to find a movie that said that this film was "not very profound." I do not have to agree - this has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent. They were repeatedly praised in the reviews. But I also praise the heart of the film. It resonates with deep meaning and feeling - it is a story of salvation. These are two very different and very flawed characters, depressed by life but too strong to lie down and die. It's about a man who sees a girl in a higher value than in himself. It strongly reminded me of the book "Salvation of Love" by Francine Rivers, which has a similar history of salvation. Yes, the images and motifs are messy and sometimes shocking, but if you look closely, you can easily see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the truest things in life are not pretty, but they are real.
