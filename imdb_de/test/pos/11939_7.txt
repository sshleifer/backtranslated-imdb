- Best of all, when the boring gangster (Nicholas Turturro) calls out to the runaways (Matthew Modine), "Shane, come back, Shane!" and when the older wise guy asks him, "What are you doing?" he simply repeats "enjoy my time!" Actually, I like right now! <br /> <br /> - The scariest part: I was wondering all the time where I saw the girl. from where ? from where ? Until I found out the credits. OH MY GOD! She is (Elizabeth Berkley) .. From the fiasco of the showgirls! But I just could not recognize her with her clothes! To tell the truth, I felt a brief tremor. She is really cute and nice, but maybe Hollywood had no mercy at all! <br /> <br /> - The Sexy Bit: When (Berkley) says, "Do you mean the stuff that gives you a boner?". <br /> <br /> - The most boring: After a day and a night in the back of the car, the back-up helper is still alive and well !! ??, the Mexican smuggler also took 3 bullets (on the same car!) and he is not dead !! ?? <br /> <br /> - The ugliest thing: All murdered humans as well as the numerous (F) strains are too boring! <br /> <br /> - The most beautiful: The crazy clever script with all the funny characters and the turbulent situations, the acting also looked very sweet (Paul Rodriguez), who stole the show (because he had the best. ) Dialogue too!). <br /> <br /> - The Most Disappointing: Though the direction did not allude to the humor of the story, it did not simultaneously give it a unique touch, an incomparable signature, some kind of madness mirth, just like in the story itself. But maybe the low production has done it wrong! And of course the slightly tasteless music, which could also be so because of the cheap production! <br /> <br /> - The most confusing part: (Matthew Modine) is a talented man, but what exactly did he do to get out of Hollywood's list of stars "A" ?! What could be the thing he did (or did not do!) To end up in a joke like (The Shipment)? !! <br /> <br /> - The most absent scene: Where did the Mexican smuggler (Jose) go last ?! I thought that in the end we'll see him again and smuggle again as the surviving little criminal who could, in a quick gimmick like this, realize the perpetual disorder of such a world. <br /> <br /> - Most of the question I had after the end: When will we see (The Shipment - 2)? Because I'm so curious to see this fine, little comic atmosphere again! <br /> <br /> These were my own answers.
