Although I agree that this film has no real substance and should not be taken seriously, it was primarily aimed at fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey) once again takes to the streets (after he was no less murdered by the policewoman) and moves into the apartment of his friend (who guesses you), who was killed by a street gangs, which looks like Beruit). It's weird that people who work with Bronson have a habit of being killed. Bronson systematically kills them one after another, as people in the neighborhood are used against him. There are some dynamics between Bronson and Fraker that lead the street gang. It can be said that both enjoy their work. At some point in the movie, after quarreling in the city jail, Fraker says, "I'm going to kill a little old lady just for you, catch it in the news at 6:00." The "giggler," a thief who laughs as he commits his crime, likes to watch as well. The film was shot in 1985, and most people could probably identify with the stereotypical urban gangs that are occupied in the film. It's nice to see Bronson (Paul Kersey) clear the streets of these thugs. Look out for the appearance of the Wildey Magnum, a serious piece of hardware that Bronson uses. I also really liked the soundtrack for this movie.
