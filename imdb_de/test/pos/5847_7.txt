I liked this movie. Unlike other thrillers, you get to know the killers very well. They also get to know the two detectives who hunt them. The killers are two high school kids. They are very intelligent and want to prove that they are smarter than the police, so they plan the "perfect crime". We all know that this crime will not be perfect. What we do not know is whether they get caught or are just one of them or not at all. In a way, I somehow hoped that both of them would get away, though I do not know if that was the intent of the film. <br /> <br /> The story is told in a nice way. They start to get to know the people involved. The character of Sandra Bullock is sympathetic, but has her own secret that works against her. Ben Chaplin is pretty good, because Sam and the two kids are great. The scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable as you think. For a nice evening with a movie 'Murder by Numbers' is a good one.
