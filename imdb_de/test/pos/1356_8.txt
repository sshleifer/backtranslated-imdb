This movie was a wonderful game, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in unusual places and a tremendous energy. The famous film director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through the film are entangled in a fascinating way when he is almost outmaneuvered by a prince who has never heard of him. There are wonderfully rich images and paths that have been suggested but not followed (what exactly happens to the gloomy woman of the tourist pedestrian wedding director?). The end is all the better when you're messy. Realism and logic are not what you should look for here. If we want to give our weddings and our imaginative life to the film directors, we should prepare for a wild ride, this film seems to suggest.
