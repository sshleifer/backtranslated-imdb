If you want to have a great time, this is the movie you want to watch. <br /> <br /> Take the premise - There is this college, the people with minimum qualifications from BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA, MBA, MCA, BE, M.Tech and BCA. So you have to consider the time, so it's obvious that all students are 40 years old. The school also allows students a "heavier" dispensation and has a course of P.Hd in weight loss and the only student who has missed this course is Manisha Koirala. Only she was a snake in the past life. Still not convinced? OK read on. <br /> <br /> Here is a scene. Akshay Kumar, a student, is being chased by Arman and he takes out a bazooka and shoots him! Then throws grenades. Then one of the shells hits Akshay. But do not die and keep fighting. Arman the Serpent plunges a half-foot dagger into Akshay and stomps on it, but Akshay is still there. Then Akshay gets into a jet ski and follows Arman. They fight and Arman stifles Akshay underwater and finally Akshay is dead. So we think once Arman is out of the picture, Akshay floats to Raj Babbar, director of this college + Boxing Refree + Parapsychology, professor + mumbling priest. <br /> <br /> But I repeat no one takes the cake but some Mr. Nigam. You see to learn more. :-)
