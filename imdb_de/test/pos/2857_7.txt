When Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly observes her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitters Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her wounded sense of reality completely immerses herself in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of utter denial and deception, Betty physically and mentally escapes her unsatisfied small-town life to search for "Dr. David Ravell" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and affectionate hero of "A Reason to Love" soap opera in a hospital and Los Angeles produced. Immune to reality, Betty arrives at L.A. and becomes "Nurse Betty" as she tries to enter the hospital world of her dream lover. In the meantime, Charlie and Wesley annoy Betty. She is convinced that she is a dangerous witness and also knows how she deals with Del. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty creates comedy and suspense by contrasting the extreme innocence and optimism of her protagonist with the apparent hypocrisy and violence that surrounds her. By clearly defining the difficult life of the protagonist, Sister Betty justifies her character's tendency to turn away from reality. Thus, Sister Betty not only comments on the popularity of the soap opera within the film, but also the widespread dependence on television and its celebrities. In addition, Sister Betty benefits from the effective manipulation of her protagonist's mental state, especially in the scenes where she does not intervene between "Dr. David Ravell," the character, and George McCord, the actor who plays him, can differentiate. Betty's inability to recognize George as an actor leads to strange misunderstandings that emphasize the extent of her delusional state. Despite these successes, Sister Betty suffers from the disquieting characterizations through which the narrative develops. For example, while Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a weird couple, the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance that the viewer may have initially experienced. Although the first scenes describe Del as a vile man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his killers surpass all the humiliation and violence he inflicted on his wife Betty. Towards the End of the Film Charlie makes awkward transformations as he develops an obsession for Betty; an obsession that leads to noble feelings of love and ultimately destroys him. Since the roles of the characters as victims are not consistent, the victimization processes of the story therefore appear random and insignificant. All in all, Nurse weakens Betty's vagueness rather than creating her characters and pollutes her plot. <br /> <br />
