This is a small, well-functioning little gem. Alice, a small Massachusetts town that is tired of her livelihood, sets off to escape her mother, who freaks out burgers and her own job as a check-out in a supermarket. She's on her way to Florida and her wealthy high school boyfriend studying in Miami. After her car collapses suspiciously on the passage and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple who also happens to travel to Florida and it turns out to be a prostitute and her pimp. Slowly, Alice is lured into truck stop prostitution as the RV strolls the passage in the general direction of Florida. Intermittent flashbacks tell us more about Alice and her desire to leave little Milford. We also see the couple in a new light and their lives, and the decisions that the couple and Alice make are all fairly believable. An excellent, well-made movie that you think about when it's over.
