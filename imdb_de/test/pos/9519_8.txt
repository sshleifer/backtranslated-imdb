Wow ... it's been a long time since I saw such a funny movie like this one !!!!! I've never been a big fan of French movies, but since I fell in love with the beauty and acting skills of Catherine Deneuve, I've decided to see all of her films ... but I do not think that's one would be as fantastic as it turned out. Fortunately, I bought it, although I had some doubts! This is really a "feel-good movie" with class and quality. There are some great social themes and moral dramas that are very close to today's modern way of life and are presented beautifully and realistically. I also really liked the dance scene in the men's room! My favorite, however, is the rather timid attempt of Catherine Deneuve to sing ... she does it the way she is, with a lot of grace and modesty at the same time ... very tempting! Furthermore, I would also like to express my respect and admiration for Line Renaud, who played a fantastic role (I did not even know she acted ... I only knew her for her music). So do not wait any longer and watch the movie ... you will be surprised in many ways.
