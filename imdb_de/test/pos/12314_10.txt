It's not often that the last movie by a great director becomes a moving, brilliantly performed and filmed masterpiece. The cast is as good as the camera work. What starts as a happy gathering of a group of well-educated citizens of the early 20th century, Dublin becomes a dark, philosophical tale of all our fear of death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past. Thank you, Mr Huston, for this last great movie!
