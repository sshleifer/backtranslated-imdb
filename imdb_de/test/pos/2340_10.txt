Seriously captivating, intelligent and thought provoking drama at its best. Captivating, moody and captivating. Every home should have a copy! Do not take my word for it yourself. One Life Stand lets you think about your own lifestyle and how to treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive acting make the cinema one of the best experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a joy and adds a touch of truth and realism to this deep and pithy film. This is a movie that cares and has an honesty that has been second to none in recent years. No chases, but a movie full of humor and emotions. I saw this movie for the first time at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000 and am now looking forward to owning a copy on DVD.
