I can not understand for all my life why the rating here for this movie is so low. This was one of the most beautiful movies I have seen this year. It really hit a chord with me. I had been expecting this movie for several months and figured it was impossible to live up to the expectations I had of him. Of course, it has not only met my expectations, but far exceeded. Jordana Brewster and Cameron Diaz were excellent in every way. Her acting is by far great. They were both in their element and completely natural for the roles. The locations were absolutely great. Each shot was recorded perfectly and matched the mood and atmosphere perfectly. I found this film very touching and took it to heart. I would even think that this could be one of my favorites. At least I could certainly see it again and again. <br /> <br /> I swear I could not find a mistake in this movie. It's hard to say that about any movie. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is touching, meaningful and says a lot about human nature and the family. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 points Well done by all.
