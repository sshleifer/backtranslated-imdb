A terrific comedy drama about the forces of friendship. Although it's a remake of a 1939 movie of the same name, it's likely to be compared to Sex And The City. I would not totally compare it. The story begins with Mary (Meg Ryan), who seems to struggle for life, that most women would envy, she is happily married, has a good daughter, great friends and a great home. But Mary's perfect life is not what it seems when she discovers her husband is cheating on her with Crystal (Eve Mendes) from Zach. Mary is confused and does not know what to do. But her four good friends, Sylvia (Annette Bening), Edie (Debra Messing) and Alex (Jada Pickett Smith) try to be there for her in every way. I really do not want to give anymore. But I found that pleasant and I am a man. Meg Ryan is great, it's nice to see her back on the screen after a series of flops. And the rest of the cast is great too, including Eve Mendes as Crystal. Just a fun carefree comedy.
