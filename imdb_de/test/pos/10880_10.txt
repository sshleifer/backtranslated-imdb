This is my favorite Nintendo 64 platform game. I've played a lot of different first person shooters, and I've never really liked any of them very much, but this game has a certain something I can not go into. Maybe it's the extraordinary detail that has been added to the game. Maybe it's the flowing movement of the characters. Maybe it's the gadgets and weapons. Maybe it's the adorable character of James Bond. Whatever it is, this game never seems to get old no matter how many times I played it.
