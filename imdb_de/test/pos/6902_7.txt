This movie was fun when all over the board. <br /> <br /> It essentially follows the comedic romp of two 19th century grave robbers in England moving from conventional body robbery to vampires, zombies and dead Roswell aliens (I have no idea what the Roswell alien there and not the producers either, I think.) <br /> <br /> But was that funny? You Bet Even Ron Perlman, who is often the kiss of Direct to DVD Death, was pretty good as a priest who turns out to be the ringleader of a rival gang of body snatchers. <br /> <br /> A real pleasure to watch this funny little movie and a good example of what you can do if you have no bigger egos on both sides of the camera.
