This film has not been fresh to movie lovers, and that's a shame. The witty adaptation of the script should Oscar nominations for the great screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond adaptation and Ingrid Bergman's flawless performance. It was an honor for Goldie Hawn at such a young age to work with Bergman, who looked more than a decade younger than 54 - fifty-four! When she's on the screen, it sparkles positively. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that seems dated at first sight, but it actually made me want to be in the Swingin Sixties. Hawn's fashion is as sticky as Bergman's chic. (That's a small mistake - is not her character a little too special for a girl still living with her sister, but would we have Ingrid in other ways?) Nightclub called The Slipped Disc? <br /> <br /> The best compliments I can give for this film are that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade I never saw and that I wanted more. Speaking of wish, I wonder what happened to the sexy supporting actor Rick Lenz? (He's similar to Griffin Dunne in this movie.) This was his movie debut, and I do not see any more leading roles in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn, she has done so much, since then it's easy not to be impressed, but I can not imagine another actor in the role. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is based on a play, The conduction may seem a little stage, but it did not stop my enjoyment at all. I am amazed at how funny it still is after more than 35 years. As this movie is a bygone time, it has wrongly slipped out of the consciousness of movie fans. It is more linked to the era movies that came before than to the following ones. But do not let that stop you from enjoying the pleasures it has to offer. Note: A
