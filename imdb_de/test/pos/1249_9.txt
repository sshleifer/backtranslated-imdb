Imagine, you have the opportunity to see each other again as a child. Now think about what would happen if you had a chance to talk to your younger self or even change him / her. Would you try to influence or change your younger self's beliefs about your future experiences? Or maybe the encounter would change the perception of your life and your reality? <br /> <br /> Walt Disney's The Kid attempts to solve this complex thought by putting the "older" Bruce Willis on a collision course with the "younger" Spenser Breslin (from Santa Claus and the cat in the hat) The result is a sometimes funny, sometimes touching encounter that makes you think about your own past, present and future, and I truly believe that it's never too late to change course.
