I thought the movie was pretty good! Okay, maybe he had some scenes that might make people think of other horror movies, but I've seen a lot more pathetic films that got much higher ratings! Many movies are being rebuilt into a more modern version today and there's nothing wrong with that; it keeps the story alive. I do not think this movie was pathetic at all, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a big fan of Chad Michael Murray, but because I enjoyed it. I've been at the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends, and I really enjoyed it, and we talked it all the way home! I would tell my other friends to watch this movie. I'm not saying that it's the best movie ever to hit the box office, but it's a lot better than some people describe it. Everyone has their own opinion. So if you really want to know if it's good or bad you should look at it and then decide.
