Have seen the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good news for kids. A bit predictable. The book was better, gave more details about the game, told more about the environment, and how the kids revealed the plot. I think that Hiassens distorted humor in the book seems better than in the movie, but there were also many funny moments in the film. For children under 6, it is probably a little too slow. Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as a science teacher. And those little owls were adorable. I wonder how they managed to film them. The movie showed a lot of Florida at its best and made it very appealing. Imagine that or has the author Carl Hiassen made a brief appearance?
