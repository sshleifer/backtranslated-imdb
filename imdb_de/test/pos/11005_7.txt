I think Gerard's comments on the document hit the nail on the head. Interesting movie, but very long. It's definitely the opposite of the new school of eye-catching, sexy Moore-style doctors. There is no narrator, no facts or side information, and no other gimmicks. What you see is what you get - a glimpse into the disappearing world of salt men of Tibet. As a great doc fan, I was surprised how much I lost attention with this film due to the length and the lack of dialogue. In the end, though, I would recommend it if the topic sounds interesting to you. It is beautifully filmed, informative and provides a valuable (and closing) window into the way of life of the Tibetan saltmars (and women :) - all important features of a good document. But get a big pot of coffee, it will help.
