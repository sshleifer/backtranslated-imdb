I do not know exactly when the TV stations preferred to have handsome men as reporters instead of reporters - regardless of the men's IQs - but it was clearly a problem when "Broadcast News" came out and the movie does a really good one Job, if I look at it. The film depicts a love triangle between handsome young airman reporter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), intelligent but edgy reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter). The best line in the movie is probably when Tom says something, "I do not understand anything I'm reporting." And in the era of FOX News and such things, such a movie becomes even more important. <br /> <br /> All in all, a movie that I can recommend. With Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and Jack Nicholson in a supporting role as a presenter.
