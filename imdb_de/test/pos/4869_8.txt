This cartoon documenting the second encounter between Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner is definitely better than their first meeting in Fast and Furry-ous (1949). If you measure it by its aesthetic value, then this cartoon would not be among the top 5 or 6 of the year 1952. Regardless, this is a very funny short. Coyote (Carnivorous Vulgaris) chases the Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the road and gets completely tired. The ingenious scientific "Latin" names of the characters are very original and have been previously imitated in other, unrelated cartoons. The coyote breaks down and brings a wonderful expression of - I do not know - boredom. Such jonesesque expressions make this cartoon more than laughable in seven minutes. Then he has an idea and another ridiculous expression is borne. The slapstick jokes are all hilarious and mask the fact that it really is evil to inflict such pain on a poor, helpless GENIUS coyote. Everyone knows, but who cares? <br /> <br /> The old rocket gag is also present. Coyote clings to a rocket, which should be enough power to catch up with Roadrunner and grab him. Instead, the rocket shoots up and becomes a fireworks display in the distance: Eat with Joe. This classic gag comes from this cartoon. Although it's obvious, it still makes people laugh. <br /> <br /> The highlight is really the hunt through the Mineshaft. The two are wearing helmet lights, and we see the tunnel through which the two go, with only the lights visible. Here the comedy reaches a climax. A remarkable sequence, maybe even the best sequence at the beginning of the Roadrunner. The final touch comes from Michael Maltese's writing, when Coyote's light goes out and he unknowingly ignites a match in a room full of explosives. The surface is to see where a bunch of cactus jumps and the letters "YIPE!" after the explosion. Those little things make you laugh for only seven minutes, and once it starts, the fun is over. The rocket skates are another great idea, as well as the free drinking of water and anvil on the rope (a sequence that appears in Space Jam [1996]). Giving away the results would be pointless. The free drink turns out to be problematic for Wile E at the end of the penultimate sequence: the rocket skates. <br /> <br /> This classic cartoon is littered with fine animations except for the characters. Although they are very well animated, the two characters are very primitive. which could be an understatement. Although it may seem strange at first glance, the humor of the following sequences lets you forget. <br /> <br /> If you like Vintage Jones, you should pay attention to this. If you LOVE Roadrunner, you will get this on video. Excellent entertainment (rating: 8/10).
