Intense domestic confrontation with the landlord (Lupino, awarded as always), threatened by a psychotic housewife migrants (Ryan). The 2 masters of the genre are intoxicating, erotically best when they agree with wit, emotions and will in a bizarre hostage situation right after the Saturday Evening Post. Richly colored black and white photography with an unusual number of close up shots. The young girl who teases Ryan has really good instructions here. Unlikely, but satisfying suburban melodrama.
