Four stories about drug trafficking in Europe will be intertwined in the course of this 6-part miniseries. In Germany, a businessman is arrested for drug trafficking and his wife tries to save her family by continuing her husband's illegal trafficking. Meanwhile, the British Home Secretary is traveling to Pakistan to negotiate an aid package that he hopes will stop the drug flow from that country. While doing so, however, his own daughter succumbs to heroin addiction and tears apart her family. This is the mini-series on which the American movie and miniseries were based. The original is far superior to its two offspring. The poverty and despair of the Third World is very well represented. It is crass, uncompromising and brutal.
