While I have a strong feeling that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie, this movie is pretty good. I liked the music and the dancing and the ending, how Gene got the girl. My favorite part is undoubtedly Gene's dance with his alter ego. I love watching two of Gene Kelly's for a prize. It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. It's a movie that I think everyone should see at least once in a lifetime. So you have not seen it yet and you still see it today! I'm sure everyone out there has a Gene Kelly friend who has this movie in his collection. So pop over to her house, popcorn and enjoy!
