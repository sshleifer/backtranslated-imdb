After seeing "La Pianiste" a few years ago, I told myself that I would never see it again, as powerful and disturbing as it was. Time passed, but I could not get the movie and its main character Erika Kahut out of my head. The story of a respected piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory, cool and accumulated on the surface, an expert on classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing that the demons of fear, self-hatred and self-destruction are strong enough to ruin them more than a visit. I read the book "The Piano Teacher" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel laureate of literature on which the film is based. After reading it, I saw it again. For the second time, all the puzzle pieces came to the right places. Not infrequently, an excellent, shattering book with a brilliance such as "Le Pianiste" is transmitted to the screen. Three actors gave excellent performances. Franz Schubert's piano music, "soaked in morbid humanity", is another brilliant star of the film. <br /> <br /> I have only one problem with Hanekes vision. There is a scene in the movie in which Haneke changed Erika's character to the novel. In the book she was furthest from Walter, the young student of the Conservatory, who was attracted to her, in a letter. Once he understood what he was dealing with and how much he was repelled, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika of the book would never pursue Walter to face him. She kept everything in her - she did not like to play, she was not a hunter - she loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. It tried to make Erika sympathetic (and of course Huppert was heartbreaking), but it needed the mystery that surrounded her - Jelinek did not write that scene, she sounded and sounded wrong in an otherwise brilliant movie.
