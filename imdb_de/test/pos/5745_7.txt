When I saw this movie, I did not expect much. I was very surprised. Although the writing was unpolished, as some dialogues seemed lengthy and thoughtful, the script had brilliant moments. (My favorite line, "Life is like a rich meringue, one-and I'm diabetic, so I can not enjoy it ...".) The plot was new and refreshing unlike some of the newer "main" "horror", to which most of us (unfortunately) got used to. I think some of the scenes could have been longer (and maybe shorter). The superfluous use of blood was combative, but in the end it seemed to make sense ... Ah, the end. The end would have been a bit better if they had explained what happened. (I do not want to spoil it.) Maybe it also contributed to the movie, "It's only for an hour, how good could it be?" Answer: Very good.
