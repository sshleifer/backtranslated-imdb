After reading the other commentary on this great TV drama, I felt compelled to balance things a bit. If you want you to have murders, signature and serial numbers, and your bulls are British and call a lot, and if the thriller is bloody and has a religious bias, then this is true for every button. Not quite enough to bring the screaming to the sophisticated heights of Sweeney, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is a great cop on the edge, and the guest stars, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik, are well-placed. Recommended. (In response to the previous comments, though I agree that "Red" would not normally run away from a hit and run), he had just seen his brother arrested for murder, and I'm pretty sure he would Boys do not move.)
