This movie is a masterpiece, to put it simply. Especially the double exposure of the cameraman Julius Jaenzon. It is also skilfully made with the standards we are used to today for seventy-eight years. The director Viktor Sjöström also plays the main character David Holm. On the night of New Year's Eve, he is killed in a fight, and according to legend, the first to die in the new year will have to work as a soul collector in the form of a transparent mind. Every year a new Soul Collector is appointed. <br /> <br /> The scene where alcoholic david holm gets up in the graveyard from his dead body (as if the soul is leaving his earthly body) (where the fight took place) is a real accolade for a movie-loving eye. Even if the present collector of souls arrives in his horse-drawn carriage, this is a beautiful but also uncanny scene. David Holm recognizes this Soul Collector as a drinking friend from previous lives. Now it is up to him to take power. Just like Scrooge in Dickens story "A Christmas tale" David is shown what his life and action has led to the people around him. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the danger of alcohol abuse. It is based on a book by Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf. Viktor Sjöström has still filmed some of her books, but this is the one with the best result, perhaps because this book is the most cinematic. <br /> <br />
