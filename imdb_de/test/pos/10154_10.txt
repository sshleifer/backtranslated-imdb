Alfred Hitchcock's remake of "The Man Who Knows Too Much" is usually not considered as good as the original, but for me it's one of the best movies ever. I prefer it to "Vertigo" and "Rear Window". <br /> <br /> "North By Northwest" is the story of an average man who is involuntarily thrown into the world of international intrigue. James Stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is considered an international spy. He will do everything possible to ensure that he gets his son back and protects his family. <br /> <br /> Although the original was good for its time, it is difficult to observe by today's standards. The remake has an excellent production quality, a loveable Doris Day and a really scary villain. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this because you want to see it again and again.
