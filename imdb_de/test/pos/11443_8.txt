Night Of The Demons is definitely one of the most kitschy 80s horror bands in the same direction as the brilliant Evil Dead and Demons films. This movie combines dirty, sexually active teens and demons into a damn funny movie. A welcome addition after the 80s were overrun by slasher flicks. It was nice to see something different. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenagers who all meet for a Halloween party in the fuselage. It used to be a funeral home hosted by Angela. After about 40 minutes of drinking and intercourse, this leads to a demon or demon coming out of the oven and owning every single teenager. Add some chic make-up effects, loads of gore, and cool-looking demons, and you've bought yourself a sweet 80-year cheese feast, one of the best movies with demons in the lists of many horror fans. <br /> First, I loved the setting for this movie. "Hull House" is really scary and scary and the perfect backdrop for a horror movie. And when the demons turn up, the action sets in and it's really going to be a night of horror and fear. This movie produced two sequels, the first one in 1994, which was okay, but nothing came of it and the third, Demon House, was absolutely gruesome. This is one of those horrors that has definitely proven to be longtime and for many years a true gem of mine. <br /> <br /> All in all a fun, cheesy streak with Demons, definitely worth it.
