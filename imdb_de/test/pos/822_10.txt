This film was made on a relatively small budget (10 to 20 million dollars?), Receiving almost no advertising from its distributors. I just knew it because I'm a longtime Jean-Claude Van Damme fan and always watch his latest films in the hope that they can at least be viewed and apart from some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command) they are. This film has a simple storyline to follow, and Van Damme delivers a good, humorous performance, but the movie owes its full success to the battle scenes involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins, and the last of them. The cut and the camera work of most movies is pretty awful, but Isaac Florentine can definitely film a good fight scene. I am also happy that Van Damme has behaved better lately (In Hell, Wake of Death, to the death), but with the good acting came less martial arts. In The Shepherd, Van Damme proves he still has it.
