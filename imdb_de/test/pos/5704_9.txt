The 70s opened the door to the largest and most diverse era of film in history. Some films have been great ("The Godfather", "The Conversation", "Mean Streets", Chinatown, "The French Connection", "Five Easy Pieces", "Jaws", "McCabe And Mrs. Miller"), others not so great ("The Getaway", "The Outfit", "Badge 373", "Joe", "The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three", "Brewster McCloud", "Castle Keep") and others were barely worth the price entry fee . <br /> <br /> However, compared to today's corporate Hollywood, each one was a breath of fresh air, where each movie gets a big weekend to make up for its costs, or straight to HBO and for rental <br /> <br /> What makes "Decade" so good is to relate the sudden and rare feeling of freedom to get paid and make a movie, maybe in person, maybe not, at some point with some extras, sometimes in the middle of a busy street, before the police show up: long before the corporate supervisors, suits, committees and lawyers te have ever been part of "The System". <br /> <br /> The comments are excellent. Especially Julie Chris Tie and Dennis Hopper. However, if you listen, you'll begin to see how many great directors (Coppola, Scorsese, Ron Howard, Dennis Hopper, Peter Bogdonovitch) were referred to as "Roger Corman Commandos." Long working hours with short pay. Make a movie in less than a month. Learn all the steps and tricks of the craft by doing it yourself. Introduce the product that was on time and submerged. <br /> <br /> See "Decade" for his message. And for a long and varied list of films filmed during these amazingly turbulent years. <br /> <br /> However, I would not complain if IFC decided to dedicate another documentary exclusively to the undervalued Grand Pioneer of the film Roger Corman.
