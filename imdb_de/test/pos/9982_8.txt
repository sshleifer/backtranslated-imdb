Both Disney and Bill Paxton have done a good job to convey a story that is actually based. You do not have to like the game of golf to appreciate the story of a man to overcome the odds. It could refer to any sport or just any other situation that involves competition, even though it happens to be golf related. The only problem I have with the story is that I would have liked to look deeper into the main characters, especially. Mr. Ouimet. Mr. Francis Ouimet is a typical young man of his time, at the turn of the century in America, where "class lines" are well demarcated and hurt anyone who tries to rise above his "class". I've done some historical research and my biggest question has actually been answered to my satisfaction. Although the circumstances are a bit different from those shown in the film, I got a sense of content. I really enjoyed this movie, I think you will too.
