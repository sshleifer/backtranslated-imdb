I saw this movie in the early 70's and was fascinated by Judy Geeson. For me, it was the secret nature of Rod Steiger's invincible obsession with the young and extremely sexy pickup that was played by Geeson Blooming. I was really disappointed to see that the original cut may have been lost and it can barely be released on DVD absorbed by the three main characteristics, and I would have loved to see it, if only for purely nostalgic reasons. <br /> <br /> About 35 years back in the past br /> A true classic.
