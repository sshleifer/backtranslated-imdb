As a Cephallonian I was happy when I saw the movie. I've heard the true story of my relatives who still live in Kefalonia, but watching the movie and reading the book filled in the sketchy parts of the story. It is true that the Italians would sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that so often shake the island. The earthquake in 1953 killed my great-grandfather, and both the book and the film show the feeling of the epoch with great compassion. If you have not seen the movie to look at it and read the book, this is not just a love story, and yes, there were many Italians who fell in love with Cephallonian women, in fact, boatloads of Cephallonian women were taken after Italy War is a true representation of history.
