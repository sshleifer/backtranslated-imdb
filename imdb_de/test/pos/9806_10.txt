I think this is a heartbreaking movie. Richard Donner (director of the top feature film "Superman") had done a great job directing this movie. Some of the segemets were good, and some were terrible because Bobby (Mazzello) was beaten by The King. > <br /> Elijah Wood played a good role in this movie. In this memorable scene, he dreamed that he took over the buffalo's advice regarding Bobby's abusing br /> <br /> I'm giving this movie *** of four years !!!
