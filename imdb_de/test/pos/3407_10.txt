A story about love and hate, tragedy and happiness and above all friendship, which is located in the very interesting time of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> Interested in the story, captivates you emotionally and makes you mesmerizing Feverishly waiting for the next episode. <br /> <br /> Also, the casting was excellent. Many superstars perform in short cameos, the lead roles are played by a large number of talented mimes - Kirstie Alley and Terri Garber should be mentioned here - this is just a great example of a television production as it should be. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the sheer loveliness of Wendy Kilbourne, who represents Constance :-)
