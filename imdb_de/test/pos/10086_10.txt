"Tale of Two Sisters" has to be one of the scariest movies I've seen lately. In the end, there is no real supernatural element, despite what you expect in the entire movie. The story is about two sisters who, after having returned to their father's house after a sort of absence (later known as a stay in a psychiatric ward), are struggling not only with seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar intercourse, but also with the younger the girl flogged when the mood hits her, and she cheerfully says that she has prepared a special dinner at another time, but some presence is not yet clear. Later it is revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister, who could not save her, and her stepmother, who was dizzy enough to let her die. Much of the peculiarities of the strange family is not revealed in the film, but it definitely leaves an eerie feeling and a tormenting touch of confusion. By no means a reflection of light; Look at this, if you really want to think about what you have seen. It's a fucking puzzler.
