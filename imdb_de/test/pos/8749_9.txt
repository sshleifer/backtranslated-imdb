Compared to the acclaimed Hollywood remake, this film is less conspicuous but gives a broader picture of the drug problem. The remake loses the most interesting of the three storylines, that of a farmer whose meager existence depends on drugs as an affordable crop and whose increased involvement in drug trafficking seeks to destroy himself and his family. Moreover, the story of the daughter's addiction is not only about withdrawal, but also about the high likelihood of relapse. This original mini-series uses the extra time to explore the issues in more detail and remains stronger on this controversial topic.
