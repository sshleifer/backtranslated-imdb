"The Gay Desperado" is wonderful throughout. The joke between Leo Carrillo and Harold Huber is as funny as anything you would hear in a movie today. Best line? "That would be my third choice!" "Diego" is obviously the archetype for Kevin Smith's "Silent Bob". Striking was Lucien N. Andoit's black and white camera (especially with the Banditos shadows). All I can say about Ida Lupino is "Thank goodness for DVD!" You can go straight to the scene where she tries on sombrero and serape and see her standing in front of her mirror over and over again. <br /> <br /> If I do not forget, that guy Nino Martini is also singing really purty.
