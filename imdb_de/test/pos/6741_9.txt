The spectator, who said he was disappointed, seems to miss the point here. This is an excellent film, excellent and realistic depictions of a middle-class Jewish family in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, which was created a long time ago. The nuances are perfect and I thought the casting of all was superior. I especially liked the acting of Judith Ivey - especially the speech she gave to her daughter when the daughter comes home late one night. This scene was worthy of Oscar. But really, everything was fine. I recommend this movie. It's a fun family movie and it's wonderful to see a beautiful middle class family living in Brooklyn so long ago. See it and you'll be glad you did. Has some very funny lines and the Eugene character is a real comedian - very funny.
