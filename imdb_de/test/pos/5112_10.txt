This is an excellent movie. There were several parts of the movie that I liked. This movie is very funny! Visit the Ernest Fun Club website at www.ernestfunclub.com. There are several films like the following: Ernest goes to camp, Ernest saves Christmas, Ernest goes to prison, Ernest goes to the army, Ernest goes to school, Ernest Rides Again Slam Dunk Ernest etc. I highly recommend this for family movies. All star Jim Varney will try again at www.ernestfunclub.com. Which is the best Ernest movie? In my opinion there are actually 2 Ernest Goes to Camp and Ernest Goes to Jail. If you've never seen Ernest P. Worrell, it's time to visit him. You find him pretty satisfying "No, what I mean"?
