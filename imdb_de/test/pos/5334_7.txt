The first full-length film featuring the Aardman characters Wallace and Gromit manages to incorporate elements of the previous half-hour television show. Wallace leads a company to catch rogue rabbits in a human way from people's vegetable gardens, and has the clever idea to try his invention on the hapless hare once they are caught. Of course, as in other films by Wallace and Gromit, things are not going as planned. <br /> <br /> Similar to A Close Shave there is a love interest for Wallace, in this case the village Lady Posh. and a big common villain with a bullish dog. Gromit is beautifully animated with a wide selection of expressions that make the character laugh. And of course, Peter Sallis again gives the voice of Wallace and fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> And as in A Grand Day Out, cheese has a very comedic effect as the movie moves on. <br /> <br /> Negative, this movie is a bit long. There are great effects and some pieces that make you stand up and watch, but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short topic, rather than bringing it to feature length.
