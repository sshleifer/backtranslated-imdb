K-Pax is a very fascinating film. Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) really an alien or is he a mentally ill person who just thinks he's an alien? This is the question that Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must answer before the self-declared deadline that Prot sets for his departure from Earth. <br /> <br /> As the film evolves and more evidence is revealed, both theories grow credible. His ability to map out of memory the area of ​​the galaxy where his home planet is located suggests a knowledge that no one could possess. However, the hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality change. The end seems to answer, but is ambiguous enough to ask you if you really know. Usually I do not like lady or tiger endings, but this one is tempting. I have my own theory that goes with all the clues, but I do not know that my theory is more correct than anyone else's. <br /> <br /> Director Iain Softley (`Wings of the Dove ') revolves around the story delicately, with great skill. This is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and producing outstanding acting performances by talented actors to dominate the story. This does not mean that the direction is technically bad, because it is excellent. Softley, however, remains unobtrusive and delivers a great performance through the use of subtlety, a pleasant change from today's avant-garde directors who visually grasp and shake the viewer as if shouting, "Look how brilliant I am!" Kevin Spacey once again delivers an outstanding performance as a prot. This is a part that is extremely tiring and Spacey needs to make the cool and logical prot a minute, and then switch gears to hypnotize his agonized alter ego magic. Spacey is so credible as an alien and a human that it makes the task of the viewer considerably more difficult. Jeff Bridges is also superb as a ruthless psychologist obsessed with learning the truth about Prot. I rated it 9/10. If you have to graduate at the end of a film, this movie will be very frustrating. However, if you like a fascinating mystery that will keep you thinking long after the credits have been won, you will not be disappointed.
