At first I was reserved because of the jacket art for the DVD. In fact, this was in line with friends of mine who had not rented it because of the art and the mental image, a film that had little or no interest for me (or my friends). But I hired it and saw it and was really surprised. <br /> <br /> I agree with another user's comments that this movie is not for everyone because of the blatant sexual implications (and seriously doubt whether they would understand it anyway). <br /> <br /> I like movies like these, where the personality of the character and who they really are, are defined in a no-nonsense principle, directly with No Teaser, to indicate that they turn out to be bad become. Acting done ... did it happen? Ricci and Jackson played so well that I was drawn into this movie without realizing that they were acting. The same goes for the story ... may seem a bit far-fetched, but it was done very, very well. It reminded me of another movie with Mel Gibson, Tim, in which each character had limitations, whether mental or cumbersome, so clearly defined I believe that everyone involved (from cinematographer to actors) is a perfect fit / Result should be noted. After seeing this movie, I had talked to a few friends who had seen the movie as negative as me. After hearing my comments, they rented and looked at him. They were also pretty surprised how good it was. It's too bad that the art on the jacket was made as it was, since it's a turn off. I can now see how the art works, but I had never heard of this movie before, and the art was my first impression ... art sold or destroyed DVD sales / rentals. These characters had these characters you were given more depth and good timing was given to give time to an audience like me to absorb the "feeling" for everyone. I felt like I could trust that the movie was going well, and he did. So, with the jacket art aside, I would recommend watching this movie.
