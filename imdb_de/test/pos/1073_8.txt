mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. In the world of wine, there is a big difference between the big and the small winery. It's not just about the size of your vineyard, it's about the amount of money and power you have. If you have enough money to put ads in the wine viewer and rent a so-called "wine except", it does not matter how big your winery is. Even in today's business world, wine has to be marketed frequently and adapted to people's tastes. Which means that wine is often filtered by its origin. mondovino shows the commercial side of the wine in the mega producer Robert mondavi and the wine expert Michael Rolland, which shapes the taste of today's critics such as Robert Parker, who is also in the film. Now these men are not evil or wrong, because they have done a lot for the wine. but they have power in a big way. As we all know, power is breaking. Mondovino also shows small winemakers like Aime Guilbert from Languedoc and Hubert de Montille from Volnay in Burgundy. These winemakers are not hungry winemakers, but they know, like all great winemakers, that it's about where the grapes come from. The best example of this is not the winemaker, but a Haitian who works for Neal Rosenthal, the wine importer. In the area where the grapes are grown, the terroir that matters is a leading hand that knows it makes an important, genuine wine.
