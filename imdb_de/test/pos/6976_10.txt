In some scenes of Rain People, the precursor of Francis Ford Coppola at its heyday in the 1970s, a situation similar to that of the Easy Rider of 1969, but not exactly in the same frame of reference, is apparent. Here we have a drama about the separation of people from society, alienated, in a sense, by the choices or limits imposed by one or another means. It is one of those rare original dramas in which some scenes stand alone as total knockouts. Even with such a low budget and a free attitude while filming the film, Coppola is able to capture everything that must be said through these clearly defined characters and the curved, unexpected degrees of one character versus the other helplessness of another or vice versa or both. And given that it's all about the remnants of suburban 1960s life, it has the escapism of the aforementioned movie, but a more concrete, almost timeless quality with the drama and underlying issues. If Bergman was a quasi-guerrilla filmmaker on the road to learning about the strange truths of outsiders in everyday life, that could be the case in a way. <br /> <br /> But along with all the direct and sometimes self-assured photography (though sometimes with more documentary approach, similar to their indeterminable characters), all the actors fit together. Shirley Knight, an actress whom I do not know so well, has a complex, diverging role as a pregnant woman, in a kind of existential mystery about what life has to offer. There are moments of awesome acting from her, and one of my favorites (though not my favorite) is when she calls her husband by phone for the first time. Such a tense scene at both ends, and in every little gesture and phrase of a word, so much is said about them with so little. It is extraordinary in a way that reflects others in Coppola's films. Then comes in the character of the "killer" by James Caan. Again, this is a dangerous character as it is a mixture of childish confusion and amusement with scarred memories. Remember Forrest Gump if he did not make the football and the joke. It's one of his best, because he's the minimalist - for a guy who usually plays tough guys in movies. Here is one who is also at the heart of Knight's story and character. In a supporting role, Robert Duvall is also very good as a policeman with a rough side and a rather checkered past. a sort of early pick of other broken characters he would play later in his career. <br /> <br /> So the characters and what Coppola risks when they feel uncomfortable are really the movie. Whatever this story is, it definitely will not be resolved in the usual way as you might think or expect. The last ten minutes are like Coppola's work, in which the specific tragedies on all sides are undermined by the emotional and psychological implications that affect the principles that affect the sublime and the sad. This is courageous in its time of what is being attempted to be represented in matter (in freedom as well as in errors and ambiguities). The style of the image adds a fragmented view, with fast flashbacks that are graphic and self-contained, as opposed to the longer shots in some key scenes. It's a road movie of its time, but it also has a lot more work than another filmmaker who had less chance of accepting the nature of these cast-off characters. One of the best films of 1969.
