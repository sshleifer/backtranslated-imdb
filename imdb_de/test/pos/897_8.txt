The main reason for trying it out is to see Laura Gemser in all her glory. <br /> <br /> Reason enough for me. <br /> <br /> She travels to Africa as the guest of another rich man that seems to be all about these movies. Huge villa near the jungle. Hunters stay at parties if they do not hunt zebras. And the said parties become drunken orgies. <br /> <br /> All the high society types in the Emanuelle films seem to be out of control. And Emanuelle runs most of them. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato has NOT directed. He simply demolished it and used the same casts. And has anyone noticed the "subliminal" sexual pictures at the gas station? And why did most men stay dressed during the sex scenes? <br /> <br /> Coherence? Hardly any. BUT GODDESS GEMSER IS BEAUTIFUL.
