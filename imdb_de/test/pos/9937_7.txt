Opera (the US title is Terror at the Opera) is a bit disappointing after a few other Dario films like Phenomena, Tenebre and Suspiria. (I still can not find Inferno anywhere.) It's one of those movies that has a great first half, but halfway it's as if someone has slowly let go of the script and the plot. Act includes a beautiful opera singer, who's from followed by a confused, obsessed fan. This killer begins to kill people around them in a very special way. He binds and gags her and sticks tiny sharp pins under her eyelids. If she tries to close her eyes she will drill her eyes out. This forces them to watch as the killer murders their acquaintances in a typically brutal and bloody Argento manner. Unfortunately, the movie gets sluggish and illogical in the middle of the movie. (This is especially directed at the murderer's motivation.) I still have not quite figured out why he is such a nut.) The end comes, above all in the worst sense of the left field. <br /> In the first hour this is one of Dario's best films, and the camera work is breathtaking. pity that it could not be held until the end. <br /> <br /> rating: 7
