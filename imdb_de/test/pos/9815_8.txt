This bittersweet piece of magical realism had replaced a busy production history (director / writer) at the box office, but it's a hell movie. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are brothers whose teens are fuzzy Mother (Lorraine Bracco) deals with a bad alcoholic (Adam Baldwin). While drinking, Baldwin abuses Mazzello physically and manipulates him to keep silent about his situation. But when Wood Cottons is in the middle of what's happening, the boys get their heads together and form a fantastic solution to Mazzello's devastating dilemma. <br /> <br /> I love movies that mix fantasy and dark reality. They are rarely financially successful ("Lawn Dogs" is a similar example), but they are usually original and fascinating. <br /> <br /> The drunken Baldwin is shot from a low perspective of the child, and his head is deliberately knocked off under the top of the frame. This device allows us to judge him purely according to his actions and as a fully physical animal. Both Wood and Mazzello are excellent, and they effortlessly pull us into their dark, frightening world. <br /> <br /> The "Radio Flyer" of the title is a small red car in which children dream to transport their belongings. <br /> <br /> Seriously interesting stuff.
