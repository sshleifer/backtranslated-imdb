Gary Cooper is a cool guy. I liked his easy going characters. As some others have commented, there are some curiosities in the script, such as an American Marshall, who got his job and can not even beat a barn with a gun. A rancher with about thirty hands, but he does not seem to prevent his cattle from running away. <br /> <br /> But there are plenty of quick considerations to shoot Cooper to entertain you br /> This movie was shot in 1950. People in their 20s and 30s are struggling to understand that these movies are not for entertaining Oscars but for entertainment. <br /> <br /> To expect Oscar material, this film is unfair. It's about the good finding a way to round out the bad guys. <br /> <br /> So rent, rent or buy this movie, put corn and enjoy the coop again.
