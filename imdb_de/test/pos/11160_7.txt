It's not hard to imagine what the main problem is for a scriptwriter who wants to have 18 equally well written characters with roughly the same screen time in a movie that lasts about 90 minutes. It's almost impossible not to fall back on stereotypes, and that's what director Ralf Westhoff does here as well. Very few characters can be recognized as persons that you and I know in real life. Many of them are labeled with only two or three attributes and remain vague. I am aware of that, but I still think that shopping is successful, that it does exactly what it wants. It's a movie with very well-written dialogues, extremely good acting and a movie that made me laugh a lot. I do not think this film wants to do a deep analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it wants to make moral comments on speed dating. It's a movie about something that exists and the people and their motivation to use it. Funny and entertaining
