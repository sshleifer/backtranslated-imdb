This film was a rebellion, he enjoys "Madonna - Truth Or Dare" in the right places. I love Madonna and I love Julie Brown. How could I ask for more ... Julie's parody of "Vogue" entitled "Vague" was hysterical .. "Kelly LeBrock thinks she's great, she's just cold boogers on a paper plate". "Brooke Shields, Dawber, Pam Personality of Spam" !! I could have died! And just wait until you see what she can do with a watermelon !!
