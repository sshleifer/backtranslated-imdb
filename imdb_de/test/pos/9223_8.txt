I first saw this movie when I was very young. I was born in 1985, so it was about the age when the 80's cartoons were big. My mother took it one day and thought I might like it. I had never heard of the Rainbow Bright TV show before I was introduced to the movie. When I saw it (on one of those old BETA tapes ...), I loved it. I became addicted to it. There are people who say it's bad writing and so on, but it's a children's movie, and such things are not that important to children. I loved the story and especially the songs and all the female characters. Of course I pretended to be her, and in the scene where Rainbow Krys met for the first time and they were rejected, they had to work with the opposite sex, and I was able to relate completely. History was the basic good against the evil that children enjoy, and there were enough happy moments to balance the scary ones. The world is a fantastic place that would inspire the imagination of every little child. I am very glad that I saw this movie when I was little. It made a great impression, and when you see it now, it brings back happy childhood memories. I would recommend any parent with young children to rent this movie. It will stimulate your imagination and provide a lot of entertainment. You are only a child once, so do not miss it!
