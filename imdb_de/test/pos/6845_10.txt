What is wrong with you people? John Dahl? Of "Rounders" and "Unforgettable"? TOO quirky? Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman for the fun of playing against type? And someone liked the Gingerbread Man? <br /> <br /> I rented it without knowing anything, and found it about as skilful as you can find a video. Never offensive, thoughtful, funny, scary. I clearly disagree with the naysayers. I found the story unremarkable, but the great cast, which most likely means the director was watching, put them in a super cool status. Good sound design too (much more appreciated in surround, but I did not boast). And yes, I'm a girl so maybe it has a slight female bias (the guys in the gang are worth it). All in all, a 9 and a warm RECOMMEND.
