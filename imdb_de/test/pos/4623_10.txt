First, I have to say that I really enjoy watching this movie. The way we follow the different people at the same time works perfectly and it is one of those films that really makes you think. <br /> <br /> spoiler !!!! <br /> <br /> The fact The girls who kill themselves is what they do not notice. This fact made me wonder, because that's why she does suicide in the movie audience and also the message that not many people would have come. Some people may start to talk about why no one did anything about it before they did, but no one noticed them, as no one who saw the movie knew ... that it would be them who Committed suicide .. did you? <br /> <br /> Greetings Jan
