Very entertaining western of the mid-1950s, which packs a whole lot in just 96 minutes of runtime. Most viewers will quickly be drawn into this story and will find the experience very enjoyable. More than just a B-Western, but not really an epic, the budget was modest and the cast affordable despite some big names. Glenn Ford was then the only raffle at the box office. Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck were at their primes and looking for work, Stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in "The Big Valley". Brian Keith and Dianne Foster were just beginning. Ford plays John Parrish, a small rancher who sells out when the sympathetic sheriff is assassinated by the dedicated rancher (Robinson). Parrish is a former Confederation officer who moved to the West for health reasons only. <br /> <br /> Robinson plays Lee Wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and wants to buy the rest to make a promise to his wife Martha (Stanwyck). Lee was crippled in a land war he had waged 12 years earlier. His brother Cole (Keith) came from Texas to help him reach the huge spread. Lee has been keeping an eye out for obvious links between Stanwyck and Keith, but the sensitive daughter Judith (Foster) is understandably upset about what's going on in her house. <br /> <br /> John Parrish has promised his fianc√©e Caroline (May Winn) that he will move to the East. Caroline, who follows Grace Kelly's "High Noon" character, breaks off the engagement at the first sign of anger and just disappears from the movie. This clears the way for a John and Judith romance. <br /> <br /> The violence starts early and continues throughout the film, with Parrish using military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination. He has a very original confrontation with the main shooter in the middle of the film. Ford plays one of his standard characters; the modest guy who disarms everyone in a selfish way, who is slowly insulted but brutal when he is finally provoked (much like his role in "The Sheepman"). <br /> <br /> Robinson is also superb as a man who preserves his personal integrity, even though he is physically just a shadow of his former self. And he gets enough lines and screen time to develop his character appropriately. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck has the most difficult role and she just is not convincing as a classic two-faced woman, a seemingly faithful woman who plans to replace her husband with his brother. This is partly because she does not have enough time to teach more than one side of the character. A talented actress could have done a much better job with these restrictions. <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is a pleasant surprise. She should remind viewers of Carroll Baker both physically and in acting style. Although she has to play Judith under the 1950 convention (she can be tough, but then break into hysterical arts after every major confrontation), Foster has a nice reach. It gives Parrish a growing appeal, but it does so subtly that the various clues only catch on after the fact. <br /> <br /> The real problem with "The Violent Men" is that it's both a western and a character study game. Because so much has to happen on the screen, much of the action is rushed and many of the characters are treated only fleetingly. This is neither a serious mistake nor a reason to avoid the movie, but it could have been a lot better with 20 minutes of running time or the absence of unnecessary characters like Caroline. <br /> <br /> What should I do? knows? I am only a child.
