Battleship Potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. The direction of <br /> <br /> Eisenstein is really a sight. The film tells a ship of sullen <br /> sailors who are tired of being abused by their superior officers. <br /> <br /> Finally, the sailors finally have enough of the ill-treatment and send the brothers /> officers to pack. At that time there was a shortage of footage in the Soviet Union. The government wanted to bring their message <br /> <br /> to the people, so they founded a National Film Company and one of the members was Sergei Eisenstein. The films were filmed at minuscule <br /> <br /> budgets, and the lack of footage forced ironstone to be cautious with the footage it picked up. In the end, Eisenstein had to reuse <br /> <br /> footage to create a feature-length image. <br /> <br /> The most famous of the action set pieces in this movie is the multiple /> <br /> talked about massacres on the stairs. This scene was forged in bananas <br /> <br /> and recently in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables. If you want to learn to film, I strongly advise you to watch the battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> It is one of the most important things. <br /> <br /> A +
