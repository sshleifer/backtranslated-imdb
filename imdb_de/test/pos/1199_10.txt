The anti-war musical "Hair" is my cult movie number one. I do not know how many times I've watched this movie in cinemas and on VHS or how many times I've heard the CD with the awesome soundtrack, and this masterpiece has finally been released on DVD in Brazil. <br /> The pacifist and touching story is still amazing, a hymn to freedom, friendship and choice, showing the resistance of a generation to the stupidity of war. I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70s and their dreams, since the present world is probably worse than in the 70s. I do not remember who won the Oscars in 1979, but Treat Williams and John Savage had at least earned a nomination for their great performances. Beverly D'Angelo is in the role of a hypocritical spoiled upper class teenager extremely great. I've probably seen "Hair" more than twelve times, and my eyes are getting wet as Berger sings to the plane, "That's me, that's me, that's me," and I'm starting to grapple in the graveyard with his tombstone cry. I believe that this is one of the most beautiful, saddest and most touching conclusions in cinematic history. Also my wife, my daughter and my son love this movie. Therefore, I can guarantee that "Hair" is timeless and recommended to any audience. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hair"
