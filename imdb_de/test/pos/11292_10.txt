The visual effectiveness of this film is second to none of what I've seen. And the work it takes to reach them must have been incredibly long and boring (you do not just have to put "Kodak Grainy Film" in your camera to get that look). Do not watch this movie entertainingly, watch it being visually stimulated, see it challenged, and provoke in your mind the movie and any other topic that comes to your mind. Religion will probably be a thought. <br /> <br />
