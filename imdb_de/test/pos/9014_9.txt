While I understand that this show is too weird to please everyone, I do not understand where these bad reviews come from, and I'm most surprised by the bad reviews they got from movie fans. I liked it and have been addicted to it since the first episode I saw. It is a bit confused that Kuzco was brought to school. And it seems to be high school rather than college. But I think he's only eighteen, right, so he's not too old to be educated? And did not the royals always have to get the best possible education? The "Kuzco has to graduate or he will not become Emperor" does not sound weird to me. I think his training was previously neglected, so he has to be educated now.
