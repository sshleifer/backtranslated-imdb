Has aged really well - today still exciting and exciting. Certainly one of Hitch's best films. Beautifully shot, with a great premise for suspense and sexiness, provided by the beautiful Ruth Roman. Because of the great premise, you feel that you have to watch it to the end. If you lose faith in Hitch and doubt its title as "Master of Suspense," I recommend this beautiful little movie as an antidote. 5 out of 5.
