This movie has everything. Great actors, good dialogue, drama, comedy and good writing and directing by Paul Thomas Anderson. I have seen this movie several times and enjoy it more and more each time. It does not get old, it is always entertaining and stimulating. Easily Burt Reynolds best role and he does a great job. John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle also give excellent comedic performances. There is no weak element in this movie.
