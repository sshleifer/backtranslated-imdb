Claire Booth Luces "The Women" shows relationships to men through a woman's point of view in a play (and in 1939 a film in which Joan Crawford plays a slut too: a character who might have been Amanda Farrow 20 years earlier) no matter plays male characters. Here we see the male characters and what a bunch they are. They use women as toys and throw them away, which makes women suffer. Ironically, the women in "The Women", perhaps because they are everything we see, are shown in a less favorable light, alternately stupid and scheming, with the only "nice" (Norma Shearer), the "claws" growing to the end , In "The Best of All," we see the men for the cadres they are while the women are largely innocent and vulnerable. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about women jumping from things. Diane Baker jumps from a car (in perhaps the most absurd scene in cinematic history, which is not in the book). Suzy Parker falls out of an emergency exit. The women in the film jump to the workplace and at the same time look for success and love. Women would leap into the future and leave that kind of soap opera in the next decade. But they would come back to it in the 80's and 90's through the novels of people like Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz (though their trashy works are not that good). <br /> <br /> Best of all, this movie is what it looks like. I love the shiny cinemascope movies of the 50s and 60s. They look so much better than the pixel-demanded home movies we've shot ever since, especially in the letterbox version we see on TV and on the DVD with the image so clear you could look inside. The view of the crowd of young beauties is memorable. This movie probably has more beautiful women than anyone else. It has a supermodel (Suzy Parker), a beauty queen, (Myrna Hansen, who was not Miss America in 1954, as Rona Jaffe says in the DVD commentary, but rather Miss USA in 1953, according to IMDb: but such a thing) and a Playboy playmate ( June Blair, January 1957). My voice goes to Suzy, one of the amazing beauties of all time. Their spectacle here is not as terrible as people pretend that people pretend they're acting like they're just looking at a supermodel (the first one really) and trying to act. No one seemed interested in how well she was doing. Her role, that of an apparently worldly woman who proves to be the most vulnerable, is the most complex group and she does it well. <br /> <br /> The most touching thing about the movie is now the age of female leads at the time. Hope Lange was 27 years old when she shot this in the spring of 1959. Diane Baker was 20. Suzy Parker was 26. Hope, who looked like Grace Kelly's heritage, never really made it big and eventually became Mrs. Muir on TV. According to the IMDb, she lived in a house with "boxes for coffee tables" because she spent her money on purposes she believed in before she died in 2003 at the age of 72. This movie seemed to her a distant and irrelevant memory until then. Baker, always a welcome face on 60's TV (especially with Richard Kimble) and still an actress and acting coach, was just 67 years old. Parker found "the best of everything" at Bradford Dillman for 40 years before he died at the age of 70 in the same year Lange did. But here they are young, beautiful and ambitious for success and love, just like their characters.
