See No Evil is the first movie from WWE movies. Yes, WWE, Word Wrestling Entertainment, Pro Wrestling. Of course it's a WWE movie in which a wrestler has to play a major role. The wrestler is Glenn Jacobs aka Kane. That's not really important, as if you did not know Kane or what WWE stood for. You would never know that it has something to do with the wild word of wrestling, because the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. See No Evil is a disgusting horror movie. There are some moments when some people might jump, but most of the time it just means: Hey, look how disgusting we are! Not that something is wrong with that. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) is a sort of Jason-type, his mother tortured him as a child with strict (understatement) Christian convictions and has distorted his thoughts. Now he is a big scary hacking machine. The movie plays 90% in an abandoned hotel where Jacob chases six teenagers (surprised?) And a handful of adults. I could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel, but anyway, who cares? Despite its lack of originality, See No Evil is well done for what it should be. Kane plays a great killer and does not need much makeup to be scary. An error in the movie is the most annoying way people survive. I'm really looking forward to being killed terribly, but unfortunately that does not happen. I wish the movie did not have the stigma of wrestling, although, as I said, the movie has nothing to do with wrestling, people are still closed enough not to want to see it, because, of course, if they do Wrestling are haters. On the other hand, the movie can also earn money because wrestling fans want to see it. Anyway, See No Evil has first-rate effects and little CGI, and like I said, it's pretty brutal, so when I say it's good stuff ... if you like it.
