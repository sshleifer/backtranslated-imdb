First, I have to say that I'm a big Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento fan. Although I have not necessarily seen all of her films, I've enjoyed almost everyone I've seen. I really like Giallos and I thought Argento was the master of the genre after watching movies like "Tenebre" and "Phenomena". But after seeing Fulci's "New York Ripper," I found that in addition to his graphic zombie films, he was able to do pretty good giallos and even surpass Argento, on a certain level. <br /> <br /> I love Fulci and yes, I love gore, but this movie, I think, has more developed plot and characters than its other films, but is not its best. What I do not like is that sometimes it can be confusing, especially at the end. And the fact that we go from one suspect to another and then another, until we suspect the lingering little girl for a moment, I think it goes too far. I know that Giallos should let you guess until the end, and the killer should be hard to find, but this movie plays a little too much with our minds. However, I liked the scene where the witch was killed. I think she is very well done and gave me the showers. Acting is pretty good too and the photography is great. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a bad movie, I think Lucio Fulci did better movies than this and I think his best movie is "The Beyond". , a very different film, but a more atmospheric and visual experience. <br /> <br /> I give "Do not torment a duckling" a 7 out of 10 points. <br /> <br />
