This is a funny and addictive movie. The topic of the atomic bombs that were created in Los Alamos, NM in the US and used in Japan during the second half of World War II is huge and, of course, extremely disturbing. The plot of the movie takes on many heavy topics and the actors have to carry a lot of the creative tension. I had never seen or been interested in the movie until I read the book Smoking in Bed: Conversations with Bruce Robinson. Robinson wrote the story and the script. I think the movie was better than I expected when I read Robinson's point of view in the talks, but I can see how he thought he was derailed. I think Paul Newman is pretty good, but basically kinda wrong. He is to Hollywood. At some point, a tall, mean-looking guy storms into Newman's office and has such a striking presence. Immediately I thought he should play the character that Newman plays. The other main role that the chief scientist plays is also pretty good, but somehow not brilliant enough to portray the tremendous fears associated with the piece - the immense responsibility for creating the ultimate machine of death and destruction. One of the more effective characters seems to be a composite personality, played by John Cusack. He's strangely affected, and in the end it's the character whose fate really comes home that made me think the fate of more than 200,000 Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
