In this film Peter Lorre plays an exceptionally nice guy who emigrates to America. Unfortunately, he is in a terrible fire shortly after his arrival and his face is terribly burned. Because he looks so terrible, nobody wants to hire him and out of desperation, he resorts to a criminal life to earn the money he needs to buy a mask to hide his ugliness. Where exactly the film runs from there, you just have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I have rated this movie at 8 because it is a good movie for the money that is spent on the movie, a lot of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting. The film could become a simple horror or crime film, but it goes far beyond offering some real surprises. In addition, the excellent performance of Lorre shows that he could do more than just supporting roles. This is a great movie and delivers more than most "A-pictures" of the day.
