This is a hilarious diamond in the rough. The drama and plot are not that impressive, but the lines just keep coming. This flickers very flickering, because at first glance it looks like a bad movie, but it's so crazy that you can not help but be amused. The spastic, lightning-fast dialogue and the quirky characters take it ... I really liked Sharon, the Canuck on Shrooms, right? The one who really stole the show was Richard's little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden). His loud moaning was kind of irritating. The whole movie rocked.
