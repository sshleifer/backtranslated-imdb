First and foremost, I'm from Munich, Germany, where this film plays and believe it or not, there are people like Erkan and Stefan, including the stupid dialect! I know their comedy show from the beginning and my main fear was that the movie is just a compilation of the jokes that are already known, but that's not it! The jokes are evolved through the story and make sense in their own special way. But if you absolutely do not like Erkan and Stefan, hands this movie. Everyone else - it's worth seeing!
