When I grew up at the time of this movie's release, he probably influenced my flat mind, but it's not a bad movie anyway. It's a film about a hostage-taking involving a pre-school that is inhabited, to some degree, by teenagers who do not seem to be in trouble. What is wrong with that? It does not have big special effects, but what? Who needs special effects? The decline of cinema began around the same time as special effects became popular. An accident? I do not think so. It transformed films with potentially good actions and emotions, turning them into a big, meaningless light show for innocent children and self-medics. You know, not all movies need special effects. About three-quarters of the movies on the IMDb Top 250 are without special effects, but almost all top-grossing films of all time have some special effects. Think about it: Star Wars, E.T., Ghostbusters, etc. All good movies, but the rest of the best-earning movies are usually cliched trips with non-sensual conspiracies and a lot of eye candy. Well, some movies do not need this garbage. <br /> <br /> Excuse me for relying on a tangent, which I usually do, but I'm just so fed up with this special-effect garbage. Back to the point: Toy Soldiers is just a great movie. I'll admit that some of the content is a bit hackneyed and subtle, but every movie makes a different movie. Think about Resovoir Dogs. Countless "appreciation pages" dictate the fact that the beloved Quentin Tarentino, whom I must admit has copied many, many, many films when producing his first major film Reservoir Dogs. Many say that the entire plot is almost scene by scene from Japanese and Chinese gangster films that Mr. Tarentino loved so much and probably still does. Sorry for the tangent. <br /> <br /> Toy Soldiers is fun. She has the whole insubordination of teenagers to unwanted relatives of the authorities, d. H. hostage takers. It's fun to see kids taking the helm when they're being held on something they do not want to do. Hell, youthful fear-inspired rebels were the main theme for a large majority of the 80's comedies. Plus, there's the excitement and the thrill as the characters use firearms and turn off the bad guys. There are also some emotional aspects of the movie. When one of the characters dies, the others have to cope and adapt. It is not a perfect show, but it surpasses most of the other tots. <br /> <br /> In short, Toy Soldiers is exciting, interesting and fun. How dare you judge this movie badly? Shame on you all! <br /> <br /> Personal Rating: 8/10
