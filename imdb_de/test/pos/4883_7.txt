OK, why complain about this movie? It is a fiction. Deal with it. If you want to see the biography, take a look at it. This is an original, fictionalized version of what happened in Wisconsin. People who are obsessed will complain about it like any other deviation of the facts. Sad but true. I think it was a great idea to make Kane Hodder the man after whom the movie was named. I thought it was not so good at first, I'll be honest. But that just made it more frightening. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein, or movies based on real events, I think this is a good movie. But if you're obsessed (like some other people), stay away from this movie and everyone else.
