Based on Mika Waltari's book, this second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich colors, beautiful music and panoramic spectacle. The plot is sometimes confused in contradictory formulations, but overall it has a strong social content: man is governed by his feelings and that every action has an equivalent consequence. But to really enjoy this movie, first watch the movie, then read the book. Although it is different, it does throw forth a lot of things that were not seen on screen, and it breathes into something more of the depth of sinuousness.
