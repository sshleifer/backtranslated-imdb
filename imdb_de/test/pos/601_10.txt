First, let me say that this movie is the greatest thing that has ever happened to humanity. It's the best of all the excellent Muppet movies and all the other movies out there! so BOO-YA for Jim Henson! <br /> <br /> This movie is the first of all Muppet films and the best. (boo ya) It's about a frog (Kermit) trying to make Hollywood. along with the great friends he meets along the way, come up with some of the greatest songs ever to become classics, including "the rainbow connection". <br /> <br /> The movie was the biggest ever! If you have not seen it yet, leave your computer and bring it to your nearest video store. (If you do not have the Muppet movie, I will sue you BIG TIME)
