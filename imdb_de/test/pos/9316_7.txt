Probably back to back with "Erotic Nights of Living Dead" made with the same cast and attitude, but certainly you do not have Laura Gemser. Very mocked by everything that I like. Sure, the storyline and the dialogue are Codswallop, but that's so wonderful in such a wonderful setting and I really like the hardcore. At the same time I find it naturalistic and exotic, and that does not just mean that there is a black girl and a few flabby penises! I find the numerous and varied sex scenes very believable, even if two are placed on the edge of the ocean on a tree trunk and the waves are constantly running around. The creature appears only half an hour before the end and is, as we have to say, a disappointment. In the rest of the time, however, he manages to kill all but two of the expedition, and in the case of the girls who have sex first (or at least in one case after!), This movie is not as slow as some say. In addition, there are some beautiful moments of sexploitation, not least the scientist and her urge for two "natives" and the glorious finale, when the two survivors scurrying in their boat, look at the island they are fleeing and there is still time for one last act of copulation.
