It's so nice to see Bruce Willis come down from his action throne and show us that he's really a talented actor. In this film he shines as a nearly 40-year-old image consultant who has completely lost contact with his inner child - until he meets him face to face. This is one of those rare films that do not speak to the audience and really do something for the WHOLE family. It's about taking care of each other, keeping a part of the child within, and realizing that you are not growing as you had imagined. Willis seems to have an impressive track record of working with children (witness of "The Sixth Sense" with Haley Joel Osment) and he has great chemistry with Spencer Breslin. There are some nice photos and music, and the ending is wonderful and uplifting. A great movie that you can see with EVERY member of your family.
