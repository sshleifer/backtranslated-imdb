I think I'm a fan of Road Runner. I do not care how predictable it is, I still laugh. Beep, Beep is mostly predictable, though it's pretty awesome at the same time. Of course the Road Runner is chased by the Coyote and of course the Coyote can not catch the Road Runner on every new attempt. The plans the Coyote makes are really funny. You'll see exactly where it's going to go wrong and you will not be disappointed. Well, once you are disappointed, what you think will not happen, but the joke is even more fun. <br /> <br /> If you like the Road Runner shorts, you will love them. The predictable gags work and the animation is great and sometimes quite original.
