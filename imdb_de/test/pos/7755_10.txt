I heard about the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya for the first time from an investigator on Youtube. He literally hit the show with a big, bad voice, condemning it and being confusing. Curiously, I decided to watch the show (after reading the sequence of episodes thanks to those who made the lists), and I found it absolutely awesome and enjoyable to see. Big, memorable characters that are full of life and are absolutely gracious and funny. a unique and unbelievable plot that makes sense now that I've seen the show; and two of the best anime moments in history, in my opinion. In addition, the start and finish motifs are great. <br /> <br /> The anime is based on a collection of successful manga novels and follows a simple storyline as soon as you understand it. While the focus of the show is on the main character Haruhi Suzumiya, the point of view comes from her friend Kyon. Kyon is a normal high school student who does not really believe in supernatural things (like Santa Claus, aliens, time travelers, ghosts, Esker), but he soon ends up with Haruhi, the strangest girl in the school, and would rather date an alien, because all men are worthless. She even joined every club in the school to find something interesting, but stopped as fast as she could. On "advice" from Kyon Haruhi decides to start her own club at Kyon. Haruhi joins the literary clubroom and forms the SOS brigade whose job it is to investigate supernatural cases (think of Scooby-Doo minus the dog, the Masked Man, and the Mystery Machine). <br /> Haruhi has three additional members. The first is Yuki Nagato, a type of bookworm that speaks very little and spends most of its time reading and sitting. The second is Mikuru Asahina, a shy girl who is forced into the club by Haruhi, who thinks he needs a cute mascot to do some things. She is often forced into costumes by Haruhi to promote her cuteness. The third is Itsuki Koizumi, a friendly and sociable transfer student who always smiles. While Haruhi thinks her group is filled with normal people, she could not be more wrong. While Kyon is as normal as you can get, the other three are rather unique - Yuki is an alien, Mikuru is a time traveler from the future and Itsuki is an Esper (a person who has ESP). All three have come to watch over Haruhi, who may only have the power of a god, and when she gets bored, she can discover her powers and create a new world, and Kyon is somehow involved. The show is worthwhile with great characters, Music and some funny and wonderful moments. However, there are some sexual cues for parents, including Mikuru's split, which is exposed or touched several times, and several curses. Apart from that, the show is one of the greats.
