SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> 15 PARK AVENUE: My modest attitude for this movie <br /> <br /> Well, for a moviegoer who has as strong a taste as my own, niche movies like the 15 Park should Avenue be tasty for my sensations. With that in mind and a slight sense of embarrassment that I had not seen the entire movie before, I saw this movie last Saturday. There are some initial similarities with other works such as the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch), from which this film borrowed at least three concepts: - a) That (at least some) truths are relative (b) The The first scene in which Shabana and Konkonam drive around in a car with their opening credits resembles the car journey Betty and Rita made on Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object under investigation is a place that is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film. C) The incident, which revolves around the crazy beggar, reminds again strongly of the whole "incident behind Winkies". includes a bum, but while this creepy creature is an embodiment of something and that the "something" as well as the character are seamlessly related to other works by Lynch (carefully note the ragged long hair), the effect of the beggar seems 15 PA to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message. The other films from which PA lends are also Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throwback to the truth against the perceived truthsposer presented at the end of Antonioni's masterpiece.) The professor and the schizophrenic angle naturally also bring "A Although this theme is High-Brow physics, and Shabana, who professes to do so, unintentionally ends up as a brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of Konkona's character through those same prophecies In one outstanding scene of the film, some of these elements juxtapose, cutting off the Shabana "real" world, where quantum physics and relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, with the artificial building of the Mithi faith world Differences are also equal to the sisters, both are unable to have lasting relationships n - one out of choice and the other from nature. Mithis pain of being rejected by Joydeep is in line with Shaban's inability to make a special connection with Kunal (Dhritiman) or Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm coming. Viewers generally tend to consider this film in one of two ways: - Hypothesis 1: "It was Shabana all the time" There is a certain part of the audience that thinks that. Not only is this explanation too farfetched, it's meant to have come up with so many other characters (ie, all the characters she visualized when visualizing Mithi along with her). <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 2: "There was a real Mithi and the end is a metaphor" This POV says that the essence of the film is summarized in a dialogue of the film when he responds to a statement by Joy (Rahul Bose) answers that Mithi is looking for something She will never find, his wife Laxmi (Shefali Shah) philosophizes that we are all actually looking for this illusory utopia, the end of the rainbow, in which the mirage of happiness and contentment lies seems. <br /> <br /> There are other smaller options that our expert audience did not like, such as: - Hypothesis 3: "Shabana and Konkona are same person's alter ego" Hypothesis 4: "Shabana is also an invention Mithis Fantasy "Hypothesis 5:" The Old One, Inclined, Maybe Crazy, Beggar Is the Real Protagonist of History "<br /> <br /> Are these hypotheses worth even testing? Well, your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> "Why 15 Park Avenue?" Contrary to the popular belief that she was thinking of Park Avenue in New York, I think she got the name from a popular bath soap brand. Remember that she called Jo Jo the "Prime Minister of Shikakai," which, as you may know, is a popular ingredient in making shampoos. The prefix "15" is used when Mithi was engaged to Joydeep on December 15th. After his walkout she remains forever in a time warp. The film has its share of flaws - the lack of use of a strong background score that can really enhance the narrative in films like this, some sloppy dialogues that can not be achieved through some forced dialogue delivery. Inconsistent performances (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent, though IMO) by some members of the cast, though many members of this ensemble cast were wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden uncertainty about her husband seems to be an unimaginable dimension of the conspiracy. I give 7/10 as it made me think, but no higher than that, because I can easily fathom the sources of inspiration and have previously experienced (and mostly enjoyed) thinking of similar thoughts. So the experience after 15 PA is a certain novelty. Where am I from? I gave "36 Chowringhee Lane" at 9.5 / 10 (although there are still rumors that a Satyajit Ray ghost had ordered it), 7.5 for "Parentiter Ek Din", 7 for "Mr. and Mrs. Iyer "and 5 for" Paroma ". On an existential level, I could not arouse my interest, not even a Truman show.
