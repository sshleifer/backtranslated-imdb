An introspective look at the relationship between Hawking and the space / time contingent. This film presents the laws of Galilee and Newton and their relation to Einstein's Theory of General Theory of Relativity. The film is methodically directed and reveals details of the man (Hawking) as well as his work (black holes). Interviews with his family are a bit too long, so unfortunately his theories and ideas are less developed. <br /> <br /> A Philip Glass soundtrack perfectly complements the movie. Only another man could compose such haunting instellar melodies (Jean Michel Jarre). Overall, I would highly recommend this film based on Hawking's 'Nuggets of Wisdom' and its proper explanation of an Event Horizon!
