I bought this video on VCR tape in a $ 50 goodwill store. I took with me some videos that I bought back to sell to others after I saw them as 50 cents for rent. This is the only one that will never return. It's an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. I do not know if I should call circus, dance or both. It's bigger than life itself. You'll only be able to do well for a few short years in your life. These are the performers for the cast members. If Gene Kelly and Burt Lancaster were still alive today and saw them live, they would be impressed. I would lend it to others to see, but I know if I do, I'll never get it back.
