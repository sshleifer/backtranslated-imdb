This is a brightly photographed and unusually well written western by veteran "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is the most important help in this regard. His strong storyline can be told in a few sentences. Cavalry officer Richard Lance, who is hardened by the bookstore, arrests a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fortress. He insists on bringing the man back for trial and sending it to Tucson; his commander sends another man to try to bring the prisoner to justice and the patrol is wiped out. This means that the leader has fled and Lance must now lead a second patrol - and he selects the men who can spare the fort most, a company with problems - to defend the robbed apron and command ahead of another save attack by stopping the bottleneck passport in this sector. The young Gregory Peck is quite strong as Lance. Others in the big cast of this movie, which really shows life at a cavalry outpost that looks like an army of heterogeneous and contentious guys, includes War Bond, who acts heavily as a drinking sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie as troublemakers, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney Jr. as psychological troublemakers and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as comrades with Nana Bryant as the colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton as a love interest passes in a difficult role; Michael Ansara is the captive warrior and Jeff Corey plays the scout of the fort. There are really two great scenes in this very well made western - the long section at the fortress before the last patrol is sent out, and this long patrol to the defunct Ft. Defiantly Even In this fortress Peck can make a grand speech in which, at the command of the men whom he has placed on command, he explains to them why he took them. by reading their shortcomings individually; Then they tell them why they believe he sent his best friend to die in his place, to take the Indian in instead of committing himself - and he proves to them that they call the rest of the film wrong by winning his lonely fight through intelligence and courage. The music of Franz Waxman is good, the production qualities admirable; the argument about what would happen if Lance takes the Warlord is true; Apart from this unsolvable error of the central character, this is a great Western. It has been a favorite of mine for fifty years.
