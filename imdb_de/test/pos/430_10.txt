To make it as easy as possible. This is a very good show. That's well written and has a fantastic cast. It is not filled with blood and guts. And center stage is a vicious policeman and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood friend, now a priest (George Dzunzda), and finally the person who happens to get his ass fucked by this episode. Is it likely that something like that will happen in your city? Is that still a good story? And it's nice to see a man portrayed as a good father despite his shortcomings. Look at more than one (2-3) and you will see why many of us are hanging out on this show. And thank David Morse for making this character so interesting. Another good job!
