Jack Webb's film "The D.I" emerged from the real investigation of the deaths of several apprentices in a swamp on the Parisian island in the 1950s. As always, Webb, as a patriot who he is, defended himself like all his shows. I felt this film was tough for 1957. I have served in the army and can understand the intensity of training on Parris Island (some of which are Death Camp Deaths), so this movie can never get close, as is the case with 'Full Metal Jacket'. I think this is a good movie that is more patriotic than it is. But think again of the time it was made (1957), and what was allowed and said in the film at that time. I always thought Jack Webb was clean and loyal. I know that many have criticized the film as one-sided and state propaganda. If you feel that way, check out R Lee Ermey's 'Full Metal Jacket'. I'm a Webb fan and enjoy the movie for its performance, not accuracy. As I said, Webb believed in this country and held institutions to high moral standards (LAPD-Dragnet, Adam 12, Emergency, etc.). Just sit back and enjoy this from a very strict moral time in this country. Do not be too valuable to Mr. Webb. Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas ..
