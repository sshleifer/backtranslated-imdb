I look at Lackawanna Blues every time it comes up. It brings back happy times. I grew up in a big city in the Midwest. It reminds me when I was a kid, though my situation was a little different, it feels the same way. I wonder if anything we'll ever know about families is lost. The big moms of day are under 55 years old. Will they know what it takes to inspire others. I hope I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to connect him with his past. The music was great in this movie. I really felt that this had gone to the theaters for which I had paid. When I saw the movie for the second time, I found out who this movie is about. He has done an excellent job writing and producing this film. I think, who should produce a film based on your life other than yourself? As soon as I can, I get a copy for my home application. I always enjoy black producers or directors. They make such a movie live in the right time. Thanks for such a great movie.
