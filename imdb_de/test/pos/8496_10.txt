This is one of the best movies I have seen in years. I brought myself to a new time and a new place. It was like I was with Ray through his many trials and triumphs. Jamie Foxx turned into Ray. During the movie he was Ray. Also Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were outstanding. The movie was well staffed and directed, the music was fantastic. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie four (4) times with different people and the last time was as enjoyable as the first time. I will buy the DVD as soon as it is released. This is a movie that is viewed over and over again over the years. <br /> <br /> Thank you for a great experience.
