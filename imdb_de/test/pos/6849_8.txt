And it did it in France! Why not in the rest of the world, as the studios keep throwing up some expensive post-Grisham trash (will anyone remember him as a fine writer and not the most betrayed author of this page by Stephen King?) Has it all. Okay, the situations are not always original, have smaller storylines and they tend to be smart for some (short) times, but they actually deliver and are obviously a piece of love. I would like to know what the budget was. AND. For once, this is not a cheap Tarantino copy! (Well, the movie Noir did not start with Tarantino, you know.) Will he be rescued from Europe like it was John Dahl's movies, so Mr. Guttierez can make such a movie? If you have ever read this, Mr Guttierez, thank you and see you
