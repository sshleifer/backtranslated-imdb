This movie is based on a true story. The author of the eponymous novel, Einar Már Guðmundsson, had a brother who became mentally ill. I found this film very moving and followed the main character's path down to see how he cope with the diagnosis after the diagnosis and how he makes friends in the mental hospital. Also in the manuscript there are some wonderfully funny incidents. The title does not reveal anything about the story. You have to see it to understand ... and listen to the music that turns your heart and soul as the movie moves on. A must for all.
