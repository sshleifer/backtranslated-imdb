Assy McGee is an out-of-control detective based on the countless examples of late 20th-century police drama. The twist here is that Assy is literally a wandering buttocks. <br /> <br /> The cheap, low facade of the show defies her cleverness and her hidden satire. That does not mean that Assy has no fart jokes, only that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to make consistent laughter, not groaning and rolling eyes. The title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever, subtle humor that is used everywhere. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city, which are set to a jazzy 70s police theme. A police cruiser can be seen in a photo, and the "camera" zooms in on the blank license plate holder, which is free. The senseless zoom-in makes the production of the typical police drama of the 70s and 80s full and, by the way, makes me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> All typical characters are included: the frustrated police chief who has no control Assy; the loyal, minority partner who acts as a foil to the ruthlessness of Assy; The regular police officers who abhor Assy's means ... are all billed and all are funny satires of the typical police drama. <br /> <br /> The voice acting, which is mainly done by Larry Murphy, is no less spectacular. Assy's voice - breathable and rugged with a bit of drunken veil - is so smart and unique that she ranks alongside all-time greats like Stewie Griffin (Family Guy) and Homer Simpson (Simpsons). Although the voice is indistinct, the diction is somehow clear and easy to understand. This is a nice change from other adult swim program tunes that often require subtitles to understand. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fantastic production and voice output, the script is also funny. Assy's no-nonsense directness drives the most humor, especially in his interactions with citizens outside the police. <br /> <br /> If you have access to Adult Swim comedy, Assy McGee is certainly worth the watch. Each episode expires in just 8-9 minutes, so you really have little to lose.
