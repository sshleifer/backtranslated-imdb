Recovery is a well-judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that does not sentimentalize the main characters. David Tennant and Sarah Parish bring to the fore the complex and contradictory emotions of a couple in love trying to deal with the personality changes that both must endure and also have to survive a tragic accident. As Alan brings Tennant both humor and dangerous lust, as an engineer recovering from a memory loss caused by a traffic accident. Alan is not portrayed simply as a victim, but as a human being whose emotions do the best to understand his new life. Sarah Parish's Tricia is not a stereotypical housewife who does everything she can to support her husband. She has a hard time falling in love with Alan because the man she once loved and loved is now a completely different person - a stranger to her. <br /> <br /> Contrary to some opinions, this makes - in my opinion - the perfect Sunday night view. Too often we are shown soft family dramas or detective series like heartbeat that rot and lazy the brain. Program commissioners seem to believe that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds turn on. A challenging and thought provoking drama like recovery would seriously change the situation.
