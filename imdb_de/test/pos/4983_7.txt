A western through and through. As the title character of Glenn Ford says, "No, I do not want to fight, but I'll do it if it forces me." This movie is about being smart and strong and fighting for the faith. Never stop with courage to strive for what you think is right. Great action and mostly fast. It's nice to see Brian Keith in that role and Edward G. Robinson as an older western man. Glenn Ford lives up to its Western image. A thoroughly entertaining film involves strategic non-military warfare. Of course it is violent, as the title says, but not too clearly as in the computer-generated epoch films. It's mostly about strong personality conflicts.
