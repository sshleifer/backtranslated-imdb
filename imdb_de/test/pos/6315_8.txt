The Consequences of Love: It's really something special about this movie, but it's very hard to put your finger on it. It's a love story, but not really one I've seen before. There are several love themes that go through the whole movie. A man loves a younger woman, a younger man loves his older brother. The mafias love money at any price. These are just a few that intertwine in a story that you guessed or do not know where and how it ends. The performers are all outstanding, from Sophia, the curious barmaid, to the direct face of Titta, the central character of the film. With the simple yet affective camera work, a constantly changing soundtrack bounced off, blending low-fi trip-hop with lush orchestral pieces. The style of the film changes wonderfully with different styles, without becoming confusing. Love has never looked so diverse and powerful as the stories we tell rumbles to different conclusions. The director has married old and new to a rich Italian classic.
