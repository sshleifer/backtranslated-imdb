Although I had hoped that I would like it a bit more, this was certainly an impressive movie. There was great performance on all leads, and the story, though I do not call it Chilling, was still effective and kept me interested. The best thing about this movie was the look of the picture, because it always looked cold and wet and seemed to fit in well with the movie. I also thought that the low budget suited this movie, because I do not think that a razor sharp picture and a clear tone in a movie would have been so grim. All in all, it was a bit below expectations, but I'm still very happy that I finally sat down to watch this movie.
