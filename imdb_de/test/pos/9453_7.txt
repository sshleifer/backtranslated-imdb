The movie was great and everything, but there were many mistakes in the "football" scenes. I wonder if any of the guys who worked on the movie ever saw a football match ..? At first, I do not understand how she wanted to try it for the boys team. In football, boys and girls can not play in the same team and these are the FIFA rules. And did not start with who, when they found out that she was actually a girl, they let her continue to play ... !! Second, players can not paint their faces with paint and play like that, FIFA does not rule mine anymore. <br /> <br /> and does not get me aiming for the way they scored goals. and all the players seemed as if they did not know Jack about football. <br /> <br /> and when the Duke trained Viola, they focused on the shooting, which had happened with passing and dribbling. or was her only problem shooting ?! and why the hell were all the posters on the wall in their room for players from Chelse ?! Do not you like other players from other teams? It was like this was the only team you know ...! But otherwise the movie was good and I enjoyed the rest, only the training and the scenes were unrealistic for me. You really should have consulted someone ...!
