Kannathil Muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and candid films I've seen in a long time. the story of an adoptive girl who learns the truth about her lineage on her 9th birthday. She sets out to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terrorist. The size of the film lies in its simplicity. Mani Ratnam generally tends to create unreal and pompous overflowering characters in this film, each person seems to be real and their interactions are touching and sincere. That's why this is considered one of his best films. <br /> <br /> The film is emotionally exhausting and simply teases the viewer's heart. Their relationship is the cornerstone of this film. There are some notable shortcomings, especially the scene in which Amudha learns that she is an adopted child and looks completely unreal. It is hard to believe that such sensitive parents break such news in the way they did. Another mistake is surprisingly the brilliant songs. they seem to be forced and able to stand out again without having to compete with the rest of the script. <br /> <br /> After these words, this is still one of the most poignant and beautiful films that have come from India for a long time. This beauty is not only in the script or in the characters, but also in the technical brilliance. The camera work of Ravi Chandrans is pure poetry. All the characters perform well and the realistic humor, especially in the Flashback scenes, is entertaining. <br /> <br /> a sincere 9 !!
