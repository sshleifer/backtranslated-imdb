What will Prospero be in the twentieth century, what is its life like? Why would a man have to live on an island with his daughter and girlfriend? Because it is too hard to live and love in "civilization" under good conditions. This man (John Cassavetes) is a broken-hearted giant who can handle the storm. He has the strength, the strength, but he is human. The deep love of life is the theme of this extraordinary film. The spectacle is incredible, all the geniuses of John Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands, Vittorio Gasman and of course Shakespeare and Paul Mazursky. Do not miss it, it will be a mistake. This movie is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. And I have seen many movies.
