I'm a Geena Davis fan for this movie. I always loved Samuel L. Jackson. And they are a great couple on the screen. I think "TLKG" is the best action movie I've ever seen. Forget about the twisted ends that the audience now expects, and the filmmakers try (mostly fail) to include them in their films (10/10)
