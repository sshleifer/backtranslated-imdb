I enjoyed the movie and the fact that it had a lot to do with sophisticated material. I saw the movie in a preview and it was not ruined by any stupid video boxes that spoiled the end. The performances were pretty good, especially Andrew McCarthy in a more mature role. I also enjoyed the look of the movie, which gave it a mysterious, forbidden air. I have also enjoyed some of the "twists" in the storyline and do not want to give too much away if the video boxes of other countries do not reveal everything! The script was a little over the top, but I appreciated the fact that the filmmakers were not afraid to challenge the audience with interesting and puzzling questions about the role of faith in our world. And although some would find the ending a bit too open, I appreciated that the movie refused to tie everything upright. That's not how life works.
