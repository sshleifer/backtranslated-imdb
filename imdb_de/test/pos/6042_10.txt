I have not seen this beautiful movie for 50 years, but I will comment anyway. <br /> <br /> While JACK WEBB's film was clearly meant to be a mere entertainment program, it was realistic to see Marine Basic Training at Parris Island as a hard character-it was said the military was worried that the movie was going to scare off recruiting. It did not work that way. The film showed that getting involved in the Marines was a bigger challenge than most young people ever realized, and (you know what?) Offering a big challenge was exactly what many men wanted. Personally, I knew many people who came to the Marines shortly after THE DI. The lines in recruitment centers were suddenly so long that the Marines had more recruits than they could handle. <br /> <br /> This is how it works. In America, there will always be a youth trying to make themselves the best - while the slackers and the born losers hobble into nowhere. <br /> <br /> What we DO NOT have in 2007 is films that inspire patriotism, all sorts of duty, positive values, and so on. What we have are films that inspire the airhead to be airheads, the beer drinkers to drink beer, other negative values. Exhibit # 1 shows that the airy teenage travesty and beer devouring SUPERBAD now ranks # 81 on the All Time Great Films list. Values? What do you mean, values?
