This movie is a great comedy drama. Christopher Walken is tremendous in his supporting role as a manager, and his commentary will make you laugh. Robin Williams plays a great role as "Jon Stewart" and will amuse you if you're a fan of Comedy Central. The show is good, because if the viewer has half a brain, he will see it as a very necessary subcultural attack on the policies of the current Republican government and as a critique of the American democratic process. Mention the means by which most politicians are elected , <br /> <br /> I was amused about the undergrounds and found the movie very fast and entertaining without doing the usual "Oh-brother" I agree, the movie is less funny than marketed, but without question better than 90% of the garbage in the theaters. Only my thoughts ... Don
