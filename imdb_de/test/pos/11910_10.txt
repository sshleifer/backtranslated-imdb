I do not understand how people might dislike this movie. They have Gossit Jr., the boy who played the main character in Stand By Me, Sean Astin and many other great actors. Lots of action and fun that you can not see in today's movies. It's a shame. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated movie that is among other great movies like Let's Get Harry. In the '80s and early' 90s, such great films were produced that are beyond the reach of today's standards. <br /> <br /> You tried to recreate this movie in Masterminds but it was a bit of a bad show. The only thing this movie had was Patrick Stewart, but that was obviously not enough.
