If you've ever been a fan of MTV's The State, you'll know these three guys. But even if you've just come across them via the internet like me, you'll soon appreciate their unique brand of comedy. <br /> <br /> From her stand-up comedy trio came "Stella", Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wain, who produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy for their shows and are now available Downloadable only from two websites they appear in pristine splendor on a DVD. Think of the comedy sketch show without censorship, and you'd be halfway there. On the other hand, if your comedy is rude, selfish and bordering on puerile (and I mean that in the most flattering way), this is the DVD for you! The two Michaels and David alone can not ignore you, they like it when they explain to them how they explain their actions, and with their own antics twitch ex-toys and pat each other on the back and hurl abuse. <br /> <br /> Fantastic. <br /> <br /> There must be something to tell Stella's charm that Julie Bowen and Paul like it Rudd is ready to rush into the action so fearlessly. And you should follow their good example, throw prejudices to the wind and prepare to laugh sick.
