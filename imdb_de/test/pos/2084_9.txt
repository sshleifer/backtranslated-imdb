Robert Florey and James Wong Howe made a frightening, expressionist look. Scenes are shot from unusual angles - especially scenes featuring figurative and literal lady killer Zachary Scott. His sociopathic demeanor predicts another great mid-budget movie, The Stepfather, for more than two decades. <br /> <br /> The overall cast is excellent, though (though it's not a mistake) it's hard to think of Joyce Compton as anyone except the singer in "The Awful Truth." Scott, Bennett, Emerson, DeCamp (especially though they play an older woman who looks great) - they could not have been beaten. <br /> <It's a risky trick to sift through the story of a scary women's shelter with women against the background of psychiatrists. Nothing stupid. Nice. Nothing cheesy. <br /> <br /> The resolution is unfortunately a bit rickety. Not Emerson meets with Bennett. That makes sense. But Scott is sent too fast. I think he's more of a Mr Ripley character who escaped everything - botulism, murder rap, jealous sisters - and disappeared into the big world outside of this story. That would not have hindered the essentially happy ending of the secretary and her boss, who finally met.
