Let's be honest. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly clich√©d because Korean love dramas and movies are used. First of all, there is a pair of long-lost siblings, one of whom falls in love with the other. Second, there is a not so popular girl and two beautiful, beloved boys who fall in love and fight for her. Third, one of the characters suffers from a tragic illness that eventually costs his life. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Without the right actors, this film would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. But because the actors fit perfectly with the roles, the film is captivating - I really could not stop watching. Despite his pretty face, Kang Dong Won does a great, heart-wrenching feat, not to mention Lee Chung Ah and Jo Han Sun and all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
