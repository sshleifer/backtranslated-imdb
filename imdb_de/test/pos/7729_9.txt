Excellent movie in many ways. Vicente Aranda has depicted the time (1830) with great care. The light, the places, the feelings are perfectly perceived from the beginning. Along with the movie "Mad Love" (Juana la Loca), a rather episodic, historical film, all these beautiful photographs / music / clothes package a very fluid script that reaches its peak in the only possible way. <br /> <br /> As far as the actors are concerned, Paz Vega stands out as Carmen: liars, seductive, aggressive, totally sexual, so beautiful Carmen. Sbaraglia convinces the audience a little less of his immediate, crazy love for Carmen, but he manages to convey the right tragic mood to the whole movie. I recommend it to everyone: the best Spanish movie of the year.
