One of our family favorites. If we need a laugh ... let's just insert this one and laugh and it's the first time we've seen it. This movie has good, clean family humor. Pauly Shore is brilliant! Crawl (Shore) is invited to spend the holidays with a conservative student, Becca, with no plans for Thanksgiving. Since Crawle is a big city boy, he has to adapt to life on the farm if he wants to fall in love with Becca. But Crawl is not the only one who learns new things. Crawl teaches Becca and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accept others. This is fun for spectators of all ages.
