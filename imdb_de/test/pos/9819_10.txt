This is one of the few films I've been recommended to be absolutely awesome, that's really it. If you give this movie a low grade, you've really missed the point. Fosca could be described as manipulative, but if it is really serious, she will get sick if the love she believes in is not answered. But what would you do if you were sure that the other person loves you and is "only" rejected by the fact that you are ugly. Would not you fight for it? At least I think it's better to fight for it, who die in bitterness. And it reminds me that as a man, at first sight, I fully react to the physical ugliness of Fosca and no longer look at the person who is or could be. This film confronts me with very serious questions about respect, trust, manipulation and so on. How do I do now if someone manipulates me or just tries everything to make contact? I think the most outstanding feature in this movie is that Ettore Scola made it absolutely believable that Giorgio falls in love with Fosca.
