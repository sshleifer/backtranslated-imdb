This movie is extremely funny - the character of Mama keeps me coming back to the movie! I can not get enough of her dry lines ... as if telling her son Owen to bury his friend in the backyard before he smells the place ... and her suspicion that Owen is trying to kill her unsalted nuts! It is strange! <br /> <br /> If you like movies like "National Lampoon's Vacation", "Uncle Buck" or "Airplanes", "Trains & Automobiles", it has a similar sense of humor. It's a great, healthy laugh ... a must!
