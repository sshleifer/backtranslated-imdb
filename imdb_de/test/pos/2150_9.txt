This hard-to-see little picture played at the 2007 Mods & Rockers festival. It's a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, with many famous faces sitting for interviews, rarely seen TV appearances, and backgrounds on Nilsson's work. There are even a few shots of "Son Of Dracula". This film is the final and fitting homage to one of the most beautiful voices, the smartest songwriter and the funniest man in pop music. It is a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and / or performed. His friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented hulk with an unconscious desire for self-destruction. As a bonus, you even get Eric Idle, who wrote the song for Nilsson's last album during the credits. It's funny, it's sad. It is not a general publication. If this picture plays somewhere near your place of residence, you will see it!
