Spoiler This review has been modified due to word limit. <br /> <br /> `The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) <br /> <br /> The sentence that is as famous as "Here you look, child" or "Are you talking to me?" or "May the power be with you" or "I'll be back" means something more than a few one-liners. When spoken, it remains in the air with meaning and meaning that does not go unnoticed. What drives some viewers crazy is that they will never find an answer to the horror if they do not look at the movie again and try to watch each picture closely. <br /> <br /> What exactly does this line of dialogue mean? The horror spoken of is the reality of the war. The reality that moral people are so easily corrupted that they turn their innate instincts and kill fellow human beings without guilt. When Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) faces the dying Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film: "The horror, the horror." is the realization of Willard's corruption. He killed a man in cold blood as part of his task mercilessly. This is not a typical end of Hollywood. In most cases, a character gains something, be it emotional, physical, mental, or all three. But Willard wins and loses at the same time. He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morality. And that's a shocking ending. <br /> <br /> 'Apocalypse Now' is Francis Ford Coppola's homage to the artistic side of filmmaking. This movie is completely different from "The Godfather". It is hallucinogenic, visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. At first it seems realistic, then it becomes strange, then symbolic and, in the end, original in its own unique perspective on the spiritual side of warfare. This is not a film about the Vietnam War, but a film about the war in us. <br /> <br /> At first it seems to be another war movie. Captain Willard (Sheen) is being tasked by an army lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American colonel named Kurtz (Brando) hiding somewhere in Vietnam with a bunch of soldiers more or less acting as his slaves. <br /> <br /> Willard carries out his mission "with extreme prejudices" and travels with four soldiers, including the captain of the ship, Chief (Albert Hall), Chef (Frederic Forest) and a very young man, on a boat `Larry 'Fishburne (who later appeared as Morpheus in' The Matrix '). <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" is in many ways a modern update to Homer's Odyssey. As our main character, Willard, continues on his journey, he encounters a number of original and strange characters, including Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange fetish to surf, and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper) whose livelier gestures and behaviors compare to those of the much smaller Jeremy Davies in The Million Dollar Hotel, one of the worst Movies I've ever seen. Davies could not connect to an audience. Hopper is doing. He is like the poetic mood between Willard and Kurtz; He is like an interpreter who goes back and forth and speaks in foreign languages. In this case, he translates Kurtz to Willard, though I'm not sure Kurtz needs a translation from Willard. Many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. "Apocalypse Now" has many. Kilgore, who came through a Vietnamese village that played Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries", is still one of the most famous scenes in film history. There is sharpness, a brutality, an ironic tone and also a feeling of playfulness. As Kilgore kneels on the beach and says, "I love the smell of napalm in the morning, it smells like victory", we all forgave a smile. <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you: "Apocalypse Now" is a weird film, it's not the easiest thing to analyze, and the end can frustrate some viewers if they do not understand Marlon Brando's important speeches. But what matters most is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche, and the horror is the realization of the war and its effects, not the war itself. Kurtz says, 'You have a right, But you have no right to judge me. "Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the public, and for many naive spectators he may seem like a crazy loon whose power has come to his head, but that's not it. What Francis Ford Coppola tries to convey Through the fight in Vietnam, Kurtz realized how great he was and how bad it was for others, and finally, walking through devastated villages, he realizes that we are the naive who live our lives in a fool's paradise. We are completely na√Øve of our surroundings and potential misfortunes until they are hit. Kurtz realizes how unhappy some Vietnamese are, how easily he can be hit by something. How easily could he end up like the people around him. And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who gave up their morals and left them at the door. Many people think the horror is one thing. It's two For Kurtz, horror is the reality of how naive he was, and the reality of the effects of war on people. And after Willard kills Kurtz and hears Kurtz's dying words, he realizes it too. He recognizes the effects of the war. When he sees so many soldiers without any sense of right and wrong, he realizes what war can bring about. And what has it done to him? The horror. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
