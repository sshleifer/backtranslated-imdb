"Five Fingers of Death" is a classic of Kung Fu cinema of the 70s. The movie that "broke out" HK cinema to the west is a must for any serious fan of the genre. It's also a damnably entertaining movie, with tough, uninterrupted action, solid and mostly believable fight choreography, and great 70s dubbing ("Oh, I understand ..." So you want it the hard way !!!! ") <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers" is an eye for an eye revenge ... and literally "eye for an eye"! It's great to see Lo Lieh portray a hero later in his career He played so many great bad guys - including Pai Mei in the classic FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUS, one of the characters Tarantino used when creating the Pai Mei by KILL BILL. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that I wish there was a better DVD - mine looks like it's a VHS broadcast, overall this is a great movie - don't miss it! <br /> <br /> Bart Blackstone Film Club - Hollywood, CA.
