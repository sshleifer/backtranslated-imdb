We are in a small town, a homely widow (Ida Lupino) hires a craftsman (Robert Ryan) to look after her house. She regrets it soon, as Ryan becomes unpredictable by the hour, and it seems she's harboring a dangerous schizophrenia, and now she can not escape her house. <br /> <br /> Mel Dinelli's story and play "The Man". The film is a one-set movie and a character carried by two characters. It offers two central performances and an interesting view of mental illness. One should not be fooled, however, that this is a violent and nerve-racking image, because it is not so. It's clear from the beginning that Ryan Howard Wilton is a dangerously troubled man, but this is another kind of "danger" movie. One who takes psychosis a different direction, making it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino are a great combination; same year. Since both actors are clearly comfortable, it produces a finely tuned character story, all of which refer to the boundaries of a house: re: prison. Ryan is especially strong when his character dives into madness and races out of the madness. Some scenes are powerful and sometimes cause fear and others deep sympathy. The direction of Harry Horner is certain (in truth, he does not have to do much else than join his actors), and George E. Diskant's cinematography contains some intelligent and influential visual touches. With a bauble that is an unforgettable experience. Careful, My Lovely has enough of it to make it a recommendation for Borderline fans and just follow Film Noir. For fans of Robert Ryan tho this is an indispensable consideration, oh yes, and much more. 10.7
