I've never seen John Leguizamo's Stand Up before I saw Freak, and after seeing him in the HBO comedy recently, he was better, more invigorating and with things I could not understand at the age of 14. Spike Lee has done a wonderful job keeping eye on Leguizamo's theater and the style of personal storytelling at eye level. Substance and style blend together, but unobtrusively. We get Leguizamo's talk about race and sex (things about sex are classic), but it's a lot about the family, and what's close to my heart concerns his dad. Even if the stories in some stories get dark, there is something new, crazy or random that Leguizamo brings out to laugh, and it usually does not work. If something falls (for me anyway), it could be his personality tactic here and there. But on the whole, it's a kind of fun material that's not intoxicating, but so faithful to itself that it stings. Find it if you can!
