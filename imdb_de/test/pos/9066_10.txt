I saw that at the Newport Beach Film Festival the other day. The movie is really extraordinary. The crowd I went with loved it. Funny, poignant and great. I'm fed up with the time-tested Hollywood romances, who can tell that? David Krumholtz (Max) is really amazing, as a sure and true lover of ultra-grapping Grace (Natasha Lyonne, who is also excellent). When Max falls in love with Grace, we believe it. Why? Love at first sight is crazy and we are dealing with two lost and maybe not so crazy souls. Also noteworthy are Giullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as the sexless / sexy neurotic, both "roommates" of Max and Grace, before embarking on the journey to Sheboygen, WI, and finding themselves. Do not miss this, it's something special! P.S. The soundtrack, led by Kevin Hearn (from Bare Naked Ladies), is also really cool.
