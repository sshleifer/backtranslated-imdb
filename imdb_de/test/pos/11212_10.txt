It took me about a year to write about this after this movie. Lord knows that I wanted that after I saw it, I knew that I had seen something I had not seen before, but I did not know exactly why. Well, after thinking about it for a while, I know it's these characters that I still can not think about. Removes narrated briefly and slowly the story of a relative (Yusuf), who from the landscapes to live briefly in the city with a wealthy photographer (Mahmut) to find a job. However, it becomes clear that according to Yusuf's hypothesis, the idea of ​​being a sailor and his job prospects weakening, he is really looking for something else, for a purpose in his life. Through this whole soul that we seek are guided by a seasonal environment that is exquisitely filmed. The context in which they occur makes the scenes in two specific scenes stronger when a girl who has been following Yusuf suddenly encounters her partner, and the look of Yusuf's face when he looks into a fish basket and the shot and the Light makes reflected his tortured face. This scene in itself must be one of the most filmed pieces in which I witness. I do not know how long. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mahmut also has his own demons, but in the end he has to face his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave the country, in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of a true heartache. What remains for the viewer is a lot of thinking and thinking about these 2 people, where everyone can see a piece of themselves. You should not be put off by the pace of this movie, it really is worth every breathtaking second. <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10.
