Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated the filmmakers over the years, and 2002 'Puckoon' is no exception. The 1924 staged novel deals with the division of Ireland, especially with its effects on a single community ("Puckoon" of the title). Half of the village is in Northern Ireland, the other half in the Republic, because of a colossal stumbling block. Locals go to the restrooms at the end of their garden to find a barbed wire fence blocking their way. Drinkers crowd like sardines in a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. A dead man must have a passport made out in his name before the villagers can reach the cemetery to bury him. <br/> <br/> 'Puckoon' is a kind of Irish 'Under Milk Wood' with weird characters and surreal events galore. The lead actor, Dan Milligan (renamed in the movie 'Madigan'), is played rude by Sean Hughes and has conversations with the narrator (Richard Attenborough). The film also stars Milo O'Shea, Rhys Jones, David Kelly (from 'Robin's Nest'), Freddie Jones, Joe McGann and Elliott Gould. For the 'Making of' Puckoon interviewed 'documentary, writer / director Terence Ryan expressed his undying admiration for the book. It will appear on the screen. But like the hapless movie from "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy," a good book does not necessarily make a good movie. The problem with 'Puckoon' is that, like Milligan's other books, they just do not work on the big screen. "Puckoon" is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot. <br /> <br /> The movie can not be compared to wrecks like "Sex Lives Of The Potato Men", "Fat Slags" and "Wiggle". Lesbian Vampire Killers, but it's not as good as it should have been. For the past half hour, the police, the British army, and some locals who've stashed explosives in a coffin have walked around a lot, and it's really boring to sit through. Ryan's decision to stick to the book is the main reason for the failure of his work as a film. <br /> <br /> The other problem is the total lack of charm. "Waking Ned" brought this up while the television series "Father Ted" was far more fun. Spike lived long enough to see the movie and seemed to enjoy it. His daughter Jane has a cameo appearance as Madigan's bride. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me, however, was the quote at the beginning: "I do not mind dying!" Spike said: "I just do not do anything." I want to be there when it happens! ".
