These are the types of films I loved and still love to grow up. Unlike big budget movies that have big storylines and never acknowledge them. This movie takes in everything and just makes something that you can sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> There used to be some film students who complained that it was not list material. but that is not the point. The point of this movie is that not every big CGI likes clich√©-filled movies. There are a lot of people who like movies that only serve to entertain you and not get as much money as they can. <br /> <br /> Besides, it's good to know that good old Bruce is not dead already
