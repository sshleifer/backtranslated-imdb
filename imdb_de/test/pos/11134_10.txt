Bobbie Phillips, a hard-working Hollywood actress who has garnered a large list of credits, shines in this third installment of the UPN and Village Roadshow's Chameleon series. In this episode, the sexual allusion was weakened, with Kam showing a caring maternal side towards a recently orphaned, ingenious teen. Bobbie delivers this role to the audience with great Ã©lan. The action and stunts were the best in the series.
