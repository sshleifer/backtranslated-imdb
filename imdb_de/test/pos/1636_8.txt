Yes, I know that my title is shit. I could not imagine another title. x] Ice is a brilliant episode of the first season. Very interesting idea and good acting. The whole worm-looking thing was really scary in my opinion. I have never been a fan of insects, so any insect episodes are scary to me. x] However, let's move on to the good and bad things of this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: The Parasite Case. Great! <br /> <br /> Scully finally trusts Mulder. Awww ... <33 <br /> It was a good idea to get another parasite in your ear. If someone told me they had to put it in my ear ... I think the whole cabin would be dead. <br /> <br /> The Bad: How did the dog live so long? > <br /> How did Huffman not get these black spots? Or maybe she did, but no one saw it ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Very good episode, especially for the first season. 8.10
