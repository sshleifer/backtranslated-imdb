This movie is a perfect action / drama and thriller image, every scene has sucked you. I saw this movie and was amazed at how many talented actors were in the film. Especially Damian Chapa was great. The story was made for these actors. The characters make the movie so realistic. This film gets from me quite simply an A-Plus. This movie is definitely compared to Scar, but has a deeper story. This movie not only gives you a good picture of the gangster life, but also the characters emotions, and in the end, you really feel for the main character. Watch this movie !!!!!!
