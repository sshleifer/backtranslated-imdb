For all the reviews I've read so far, one crucial point seems to be missed. Shakespeare wrote for the accent and pronunciation as well as for the Northerners in other plays. The Scottish accent changes the accentuation and rhythm of the language and profoundly influences what is said and the way it is taken. So listen again and pay attention to the difference. The game is well done, and the rhythm of the words is so much better than that provided by the people who use received, polite, well-understood English. I remember the time when a teacher at a school in Leicester, at the age of 14, unknowingly asked me to read a piece of Walter Scott written in the tone of the border. I come from the border and when I read it, how it should be read, it made the difference.
