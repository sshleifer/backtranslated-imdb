Since the war was not going well for the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the prisoners as shock troops. This is the story of such a battalion. There are little rogues, political prisoners, soldiers displaced from other units, gray-haired veterans of the White Army and some dangerous criminals. <br /> <br /> They are poorly equipped, untrained and thrown into battle, and face danger from the NKVD when they show signs of cowardice or failure. <br /> <br /> The special effects are rudimentary and many of the minor characters are one-dimensional, but the overall story is very human and intriguing. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing. To watch the show, you had to use the pause key and the explanations of a native speaker of the Russian Federation liberally.
