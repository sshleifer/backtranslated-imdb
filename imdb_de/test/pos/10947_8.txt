If you are interested in the Twins effect and are looking for a pure Hong Kong movie experience, you will be disappointed. This is not to say it's bad, but it's NOT a traditional Hong Kong action movie that runs in a similar way to Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. It is determined stupid and youthful. So if you want a serious piece of Hong Kong action, watch a John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping movie. This film has a lot of flak for its stupidity, and I thought, first, I would explain what you are getting into, as many purists are disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although purists and those who have a more forgiving taste, Twins Effect is a wonderfully stupid kung fu comedy. I liked it very much for different reasons. Last but not least, they are wonderful female characters, who in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double act inflame each other. I think this is the first movie of their kind they've ever been, but they bounce, kick and fly like seasoned pros. <br /> <br /> The obviously ridiculous plot is treated with great care and attention, and the film is written quite knowingly, which makes a large part of the movie laugh. The comedy is really the most prominent here, and it's a subtle, gentle comedy that relies on words like inanimate objects flying a la Stephen Chow. It must be said that the slapstick is also immensely fun. The sequence with the disco-dancing vampires is a total classic. <br /> <br /> The action is really a mix of two genres. It's between the "drama drama" wire and sword fight (which comes to an end) and the comedy fighting style of Jackie Chan, who comes out with a mix that is a bit distracted, but always exciting There are some really innovative encounters occasionally. <br /> <br /> It's all great and the movie is fun all the way. Nevertheless, there are some sticking points. For example, Twins Effect is in many ways much more westernized, as Kung Fu fans may be used to. The inevitable comparison with the Blade series is definitely a solid example, though Twin's effect is honestly much better than Blade has ever managed, especially for combat action. Personally, it was also a pity that the award-winning Anthony Wong (the hissable villain of John Woo's classic Hard Boiled) was so little used, but the younger crowd targeted for this probably will not notice, or know of Hard Boiled or his other films, so this is just a personal criticism. <br /> <br /> If you look at this with an open mind, you will probably enjoy it a lot, just like me, but you have to be aware that it's a movie COMEDY, no balls on the wall, Kung fu movie. Remember and you will be fine.
