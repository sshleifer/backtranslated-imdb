Black Scorpion is a funny movie about a groovy female superhero wearing leather tights and driving a car that transforms into her smartly armored Scorpion Mobile. She fights the evil Breathtaker and all this is an excellent recipe for a good time, IMHO. I loved the fact that she had to say "Yo" to get the car's computer to take orders! Breathtaker is so angry that he wants to give the whole city asthma! It's all so exaggerated and that's the beauty of it! The scene in which Black Scorpion "attacks" her partner steals the show. You will know it when you see it. This DVD also has a funny interview with Joan Severance. She is a doll. Black Scorpion is a funny DVD. Loved it!
