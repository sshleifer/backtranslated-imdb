It's really not hard to understand this movie! I have seen it without expectations and without knowing the story of the games. I was totally excited! <br /> <br /> Initially, I wondered how most characters have superpowers, but it's called "Final FANTASY ...". I also wondered about Cloud's past, but that was easy enough to check. However, these questions have not affected the enjoyment of the film in any way. Only the opposite; It shows that I thought long after the movie about the story. <br /> <br /> It's one of the most beautiful movies my eyes have ever seen. The music fully supports the movie. The characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> I want more!
