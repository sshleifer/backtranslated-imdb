This movie surprised me. I saw it for the first time more than 10 years ago, and it stays with me. It just got boring points, and I personally would have ended it differently - that did not discourage me from looking at it again and recommending it to others. The acting is _fantastic_. The actors and the director are doing a fantastic job with the script, and anyone who likes "other" films, who has the patience to sit and say, "What the hell is that?" a chance. If you just want Alan Rickman to be stupid or see things explode, this is not the movie for you.
