Peter O'Toole, one of our best actors, is great as a reserved schoolmaster dedicated to the education of boys. He meets a showgirl and falls in love. History is one of love and dedication. Petula Clark adds spirit and sensitivity and does not just mention a remarkable voice. You will enjoy this movie, even if the ending is not exactly happy. I enjoyed it.
