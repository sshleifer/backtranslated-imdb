It's by far the most definitive movie about the police I've seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it contains all the elements of an RGV movie. Great dialogues, dull treatment of the topic, brilliant directing and excellent performances (even for those who have little work in the film). The chemistry between Nana and the Don is amazing, even if they are professional rivals. And so the little events are like an insider that gives Imtiaz no information, even if he gets beat up in the locker, but only Nana when he's outside. The change in working conditions with the change of senior is treated wonderfully. In the first half you are completely engrossed and moving like a documentary in which Nana acts as a mentor to Jatin, explaining to him the intricacies and philosophy of the work. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the most brilliant movies about cops in India cinema. In no case to be missed.
