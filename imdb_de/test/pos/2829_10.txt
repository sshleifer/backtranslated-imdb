And that says a lot. Rent this if you want to be staggered by oddity and want to be blown away by one of the most bizarre screenplays, directing and casting in movie history. I am relocated. I can not believe that I saw it. Normally I'm a big Bernadette Peters fan - but that tested my determination. Read no reviews here. The best you know nothing about the plot. Just rent it. You will not believe what you see .......
