As I said in the title of this review, it hurts me to say so, but "Hitch" reaches the pinnacle of what Hollywood Romantic Comedies can ever aspire to. I'm a critic of both the genre and the namesake, as long as I can remember myself, but almost tragically: "Hitch" caused me to spend somewhere near two hours of my life with a ridiculous moment. Smile about mine Face paved. <br /> <br /> This film may be misogynistic and overbearing at times, but it has a certain humor about it, the subtlety of which can only be described as British. This is a wonderful attempt by Hollywood to do a film (or redesign it, as it may ...) that addresses all our desires for a romantic comedy that makes us both think and laugh at the same time. Reluctantly and evasively I give this film a 9 out of 10 points ... Something that you will hardly do in the near future for a romantic comedy, I hope at least.
