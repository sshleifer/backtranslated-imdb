I'm not sure what to make of this movie, especially after watching a great movie like La Notte. Unfortunately, I saw this in German at an Antonioni film festival in Frankfurt's Filmmuseum, so I could not hear Malkovich's great voice. He is supposed to put together four stories about couples in Italy. As good as an actor may be, Malkovich can not save the most ludicrous of the four stories depicted here: A woman walking by in a waterfront caf√© near her own shop, confused about how she killed her father nearby. Then they go home, have sex and he leaves. It seems Antonioni lost the fineness of previous movies (like The Passenger) when he was involved in sex and replaced him with blatant nudity. <br /> <br /> Despite the nonsensical plot, the film is subject to two things. Watchable: Eye and ear candies. The actors and actresses are all beautiful people, and the cinematography is wonderful - scenes in old Italian cities that contrast with a large apartment building overlooking a city (reminiscent of La Notte). <br /> <br /> The sweet tooth But that's what makes the movie really worth watching. U2 and Brian Eno collaborated on "Your Blue Room" and "Beach Sequence", which perfectly defines the mood in the film. The songs are available on "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1".
