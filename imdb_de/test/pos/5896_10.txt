One of the great things about the best years of our lives, which are quite firmly related to the period after the Second World War, but the topics it talks about are just as real today as they were on VE or VJ Day 1945. The problem How to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet. <br /> <br /> And although we do not learn much from history, we can be thankful that the United States of America once did learn what happened to the veterans after the last world war. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned casually. The best years of our lives may have been the biggest social law of the last century. So many veterans took advantage of it, as did the veterans Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell you see here. All three of these actors played archetypal veterans, characters in every corner of the US could identify with them. They all meet on an army transport plane that flies to the hometown of all, Boone City, Iowa. War is an excellent measure of class and differentiation. Bank clerk March, soda maker Andrews, and high school football star Russell would probably never meet in real life, even in a small town like Boone City. But they meet and war forge indestructible bonds that can never be broken. March is the oldest, a man with two children and the perfect wife of Hollywood, Myrna Loy. He settles first and best. He has some wonderful scenes, he gets drunk on his return and later drunk with a little alcohol in him. He tells the bank employee at a banquet without a doubt. <br /> <br /> I also love his scene where Another veteran returning wants to get a stock investor with a bank loan for his own piece of land. Look at the terms of March while listening to the man's money. You can feel him reading the soul of the man. That's what made him his second Oscar for Best Actor for this film. Harold Russell was a veteran veteran who lost both hands while serving in the Pacific. For his performance he received a special Oscar. For that reason, it was probably unfair to nominate him in the "Supporting Actor" category, where he also won. His performance, especially his scenes with Cathy O'Donnell as his lover, who loves him with or without his hands, goes beyond anything that could be described as acting. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three, an Army Air Corps bombardier. Maybe he should have stayed in the group. He also comes from the poorest environment of the group and was an officer and gentleman in this uniform. This uniform and these monthly checks have interested Virginia Mayo enough to marry him. The problem is that in their eyes as a civilian, he is much less. <br /> <br /> While Mayo plays with Steve Cochran, Andrews is fortunate that March Wraters daughter Teresa Wright is interested in him. They are the main story of the film, Andrew's adaptation to civilian life and adaptation to the fact that he married the wrong woman. Not all veteran problems were solved with GI Bill. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy receives little recognition for the best years of our lives. I suspect that's because her role as a woman was too much like the stereotypical roles of the woman she had patented at MGM. As the wife of March and Mother of Wright, she is really the glue that holds this family together. <br /> <br /> The best years of our lives were won for the best picture for Sam Goldwyn, the best director of William Wyler and a few others besides the two stellar Oscars that got it. It was a critical and popular success, possibly the best film Sam Goldwyn has ever produced. It is still a lovable and enduring classic and will be for centuries. It's almost three hours, but your interest will never stop. <br /> <br /> The best tribute this movie received came from Frank Capra, who this year won an Oscar in several categories. In his memoirs, he said that he was disappointed to be skunking at the Oscars this year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created a masterpiece he deserved, every award he could get for it The movie Capra hoped for was a wonderful life. The beat years of our lives can not get better praise than that.
