If you are looking for a not so serious mob movie where a woman plays the lead role, you are in the right place. Pfieffer has behaved much better. You can see that she has outgrown this picture. <br /> <br /> When I first picked up on this film, I expected Pfeiffer to be a bad miscast, but she plays her role as a mob woman. Not a bad performance from Baldwin. <br /> <br /> If you do not pay attention to your hair, you can enjoy this movie. But do not take it too seriously ...
