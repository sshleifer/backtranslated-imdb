I could not stop watching this movie, although it was long gone. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Hitchcock are well deserved - this thing really plays with you. It is a wonderful line between real, immediate tension and dark, distancing humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our mute eyewitness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific - and we're going to ride with her pretty much, taking turns identifying and feeling her fear, alternately watching in exciting excitement as she's in danger. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have taken great care to develop this. As early as the opening scenes, they challenge and challenge you to determine what is real and what fabrication is. Who should you trust and who is a monster? The plot turns and turns unpredictably. Suspense is created with a combination of carefully selected camera work, images and music - but most simply the characters' EYES, which sends raw fear straight into you. <br /> <br /> One warning: There is a frighteningly real gore and some nudity. The horror scenes are done in an emotional way that makes them far more sinister and disturbing than any teen slasher image. <br /> <br /> And it's NOT a teen slasher image. The characters are quirky and feel like real people, for one thing - a couple (including the heroine) that you might even find as appealing as me. It will not be a mistake to watch an adult movie. I mean, Alec Guinness is short in, and you know he did not need the work! <br /> <br /> Put this in the VCR when you can not sleep. , , and do not want it yet.
