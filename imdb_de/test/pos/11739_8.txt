On a second visit, this is still a wonderful romance, which in my opinion is much better than the movie she showed on my 2-DVD set, the Leo McCarey classic "An Affair To Remember." However, it seems to have been somewhat out of favor (just a rating of 6.6 here on IMDb and dismissed by many critics as "gooey slush"). How sad, because this is a smart romantic drama with very good work by the two leading roles Jennifer Jones and William Holden. If anything, the movie should be remembered for its beautiful color camera and memorable score. I do not really like Valentine's Day, but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again, and I'm glad of it. Although I still think that Holden's death is oversimplified and the final scenes are tense, this movie is very moving and I like it a lot.
