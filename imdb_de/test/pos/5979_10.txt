Shepitko is the wife of Russian filmmaker Elem Klimov, who staged the commercially-acclaimed 1984 COME AND SEE movie, which is widely regarded as one of the most realistic war films of all time, except for one known for its burning poetic intensity Complexity of this even larger Russian film, which examines not only the graphic outer horrors, but also really inspirational images that focus on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute madness that takes place in these people, whose end is simply awe Landing bullets fly and bodies die in a gun battle over the opening credits, during which the intensity of the film never diminishes throughout the duration, focusing on grim faces, worn out soldiers with almost nothing to eat, a frightened population under occupation, starving children with verses Mothered mothers, all in a vast landscape of endless white snow. Like CRANES ARE FLYING (1957), a Russian army is retreating here, a traumatic shock at the beginning of the war when it was almost eradicated. The Russian country was overrun by German Nazis who terrorized the citizens, stealing their food and forcibly turning them into the eyes and ears of their informants. The Russian soldiers remain protected by the forests, but have to send food expeditions to neighboring farms. This film shows two soldiers who are on an almost impossible mission from the beginning, as there is hardly anything to eat in the winter. One is healthy and fit, Vladimir Gostyukhin as Rybak, while the other, Boris Plotnikov as Sotnikov, is slowed down by a tuberculous sounding cough and finally by a bullet in his leg that nearly kills him, but his partner heroically rescues him. When they step through knee-deep snow drifts and crawl in some places with inadequate protection against the hard elements, like so many other Russian films, nature itself becomes their toughest opponent. <br /> <br /> spoiler !! Everything is reduced to a matter of survival. When they reach their destination, the farm was demolished and wrecked. They invaded the territory occupied by Germany, where the next farm is occupied by an older Soviet collaborator who fears the Nazi retaliation. The guerrillas consider him a coward, but move on, eventually being captured and taken to a Nazi camp in a nearby town, where they are held captive along with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polyakova) who helped them to hide. Anatoli Solonizyn, a valiant Tarkovsky supporter, appears as interrogator Portnov, a Russian teacher from a nearby academy who became a sympathizer of the Nazis. Russians who torture and execute other Russians are deeply rooted, and Solonitsyn is brilliant in the vile role for which he is perfectly suited. From what we can see, when Nazi officers chat jovially close to each other, even among this group he is an outsider, instead a kind of cruel, black disguised undertaker who regularly sends men to their graves. The audience is not prevented from witnessing torture against Sotnikov, who offers nothing but contempt, while Rybak speaks freely and hopes to save his life, but both are sentenced to death, although Rybak is offered a chance to the German Reich Servant to serve police officer. The mother, the older employee and a child are added to this group. They spend one last night living together, discussing together the merits of a soldier mission, as a patriot, mother, coward or co-worker. Everyone seems to be driven by a desperate need for survival, but Sotnikov selflessly sets an example and tries to confess his guilt to spare the others, the aptly chosen title reflecting his spiritual salvation The next morning, Portnov seems to be slightly amused. He mocks her about her sudden readiness to talk, but only spares Rybak, who changes sides to keep his life, rationalizing in his mind that if he lives, he has at least a chance to escape. But there is no escape from this torment. What happens is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace as we watch the treachery of the war without firing a single shot. Hanging execution becomes a public spectacle in which the villagers must witness at one point of a weapon. The tempo and shattering intensity of this film are relentless, as there is never a moment without the menacing threat shot by Vladimir Chukhnov (who died in the same car accident as Shepitko) with a perfectly composed landscape and many camera moves. It's up close with portraits, especially those of a wild boy, who in the end sees the convicted men making a surreal connection to the next generation without speaking any words, highlighted by the psychologically terrible music of Alfred Shnittke, which resembles the Transcendent, but angry disturbing monolith music from Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The sound design of this film is state-of-the-art and uniquely modern. The use of off-screen sound continues the raw nerves of every moment, dogs barking, blowing wind, shooting bullets, Nazis chattering in untranslated German, or laughing sadly at their helplessness, which only lifts the hideous tension to insane heights. In many ways, Dreyer resembles the Passion of Insanity (1928), the sheer madness is revealed here, the relentless realization that you have no choice and yet are forced to make one. The nightmarish inner thoughts at the end are wordlessly expressed, where the nobility of the dead speaks volumes, where the voices in the minds of the living echo like an explosion of infinite echoes, while only silence fills the fresh winter air with a sad reverence and a deep feeling of loss.
