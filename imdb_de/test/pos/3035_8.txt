I saw Conrack one night when I could not sleep, and I've never been so happy to have insomnia! This story of a young white teacher occupying a position as a teacher for poor black children on an island in the Carolinas is a great publicity for teaching and for helping each other. All that came in the 60s, you forget that The Peace Corps and many young people have chosen to improve the disadvantaged. Conrack, with his open-minded teaching style, is interested in these children as human beings and promotes honest interaction. This class scares people of power. The biggest part was that Jon Voight said they had a 20 year reunion and 18 of these children became teachers !! It is enough to make you believe that we as humans might have a chance to survive ourselves, maybe hopefully. Watch this movie.
