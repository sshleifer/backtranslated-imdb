I really enjoyed this movie. For one thing, it did not have the stupid special effects that big budget movies have. Acting was decent in this case, only you can tell right away that it's syncing, but once you've overcome that fact and the languages ​​of the DVD version can not change, that's cool. The line of action was very unique, you adopt a situation like a heat wave that is widespread all over the world, especially in Frankfurt, where I've been many times, and you make a garbage dump that often happens in this country, and you have a recipe for disaster. I loved the way hordes of rats went everywhere and the thought is that when you pick up the garbage, that's the last thing you want to do, you pick it up, the rats do not get what they want They basically follow the garbage collection, so it's good to ask if garbage workers are going on strike, who's picking up the garbage, private contractors, anyway the military wants to torture the city, oops wrong, then all rats have to take over the city, then throw a mayor you have a realistic movie and the female lead is also a pleasure to watch on the screen, a very decent movie that I thought he wanted more In this way, the Frankfurt presentations were made a little better, but for the average spectator, who was never in Frankfurt ... I was born in Germany and was often in Frankfurt No matter, but all in all a big thumbs up.
