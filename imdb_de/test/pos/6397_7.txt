This show was crap when it first appeared. The first actress to play the daughter did not fit, the writing was a hit or a miss, and Damon Wayan's CLEARLY was not averse to hosting such a Cornball family show. The chemistry between him and Tisha Cambell (they have long been friends, like all Wayans clans with Tisha's husband and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett). DID worked, so they have retooled the show. Once they returned, they transformed the daughter, made the son a lot more stupid (a la Eric from "Boy Meets World") and made the youngest daughter a genius ... (later they gave her a little genius boyfriend, to make a funny one Make guest appearances). During the show, though often rollercoasters from the top buffoon to the idiocy, the line goes so far that you can see it as a show, you can see Damon Wayans feels comfortable in his own skin on the set (especially since the Main authors, directors and advisors) were ALL members of the Wayans family) AND in his character. After all had been on the show for a while, they worked with everyone in the cast's strengths and could make a thoroughly funny show in the air. <br /> <br /> However, there are too many buffoons, too much exaggerated antics and often too much chaos in the life of the Kyle family. They made Junior TOO STUPID, they also made the eldest daughter from time to time an attractive, awkward idiot, and the youngest daughter was not even spared the writers. I feel they jumped the shark and signed the death penalty for shows when junior his girlfriend got pregnant, she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced (the character of father's father's wife makes me WIN, just to him think). The show was funny ... but it was a UPN show on ABC, if that makes sense to the reader. <br /> <br /> The repetitions are funny enough, but I'm relieved that it's over ... there was no more to it. If it's bad, it's really bad. Sometimes it's a bit of cornball, but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom for syndication in a large network. Who can say that for themselves now? (Considering the CW merger and the recent brownout in TV networks). On.
