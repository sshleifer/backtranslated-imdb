William H. Macy is great in this Alfred Hitchcock-like movie. Macy plays a lead role as a film critic who accidentally kills one of his girlfriends. The characters that follow are funny. James Cromwell does a great job as a private extortionist. As always, Macy is incredibly funny and delivers a phenomenal performance. Watch this movie whenever it's on t.v. and check your video stores, because this is one thing you do not want to miss.
