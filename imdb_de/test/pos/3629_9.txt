It's a great movie for the whole family. I do not think so many people have seen it because I ask them and they say they have never heard of it. Sophie Heyman is the sister-in-law of my aunt. My favorite scene is the whole movie, I can not even pick a favorite scene. My favorite character is Hubert, because he is a funny but clever dog. If someone has not seen it, he misses a big adventure. I just saw it, because my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy of her. If anyone reads this, I suggest buying the movie, and I guarantee that it will not be a bad decision. I have seen this movie about five times, and every time it gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people just give them a chance.
