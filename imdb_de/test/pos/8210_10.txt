Why all the negative reviews ??? You did not expect such a movie to be a masterpiece, did you? What we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me. No Oscar contender, just entertainment. You can really see how the movie has aged, especially with everything the internet has to offer today. I still remember when this was first released and the network was so new. Crazy and scary thoughts when I saw this for the first time; I was 15 and seriously believed anyone could capture your information on a computer and destroy you. But who should say that it can not happen? I'm not the guy who nods a movie to death and analyzes it until I'm blue in the face. That is not my style. Average acting, intrusive and again very entertaining. Sandra Bullock as Angela Bennett is so cute. This is my favorite movie with her in it, because she's like the computer genius, which I find very attractive. Of all the movies released in 1995, this would be my favorite, though I did not see it until 1996.
