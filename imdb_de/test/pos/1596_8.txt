The biggest tragedy faced by a man is that he has so often mastered the divine that he chose the banal. From this fact results such a great tragedy. Death in Venice is one of the few films with the patience and courage to face this fact. He confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in its two inevitable human forms of self-denial and decay. Undoubtedly, this is the biggest movie that has no noticeable impact on mainstream cinema. His simple, refined look, his echo, the mixture of disheveled languages ​​and extremely demanding topics are not duplicable: a coincidence of his peculiar staging as well as the vision of his director. The central performance, which was both rigid, aroused and vulnerable to expression and decadence, highlights Bogarde as the best British actor of his generation, which is certainly the most adventurous. Can cling to his sympathy as his desires overwhelm him and make him interesting, despite the endless close-ups and the Mahler playing over him. Not for a Friday night with your girlfriend, but definitely OK if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitation.
