This is not one of my favorite Hitchcock films, though I have to admit that it's still pretty good. One of the things I really liked was the presence of Jimmy Stewart (he always improves on the most mediocre material) and the incredibly scary-looking assassin (who looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin over him). Although it cost the studio a lot of money, I did not particularly care about Doris Day in the movie - she seemed to cry a lot and strapped on "Que Sera" like a full-back. Yes, I know that she should sing this way, but that hated me forever that song. Excuse me. <br /> <br /> The other complaint, though minor, was that I was "too polished" and "Hollywood Esque" because of the movie. The original version (also by Hitchcock) just seemed to be much more bitter and juicy - and this contributed to the fearsome ambience.
