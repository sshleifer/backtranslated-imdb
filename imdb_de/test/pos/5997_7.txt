This version of the Gulliver stories is definitely bizarre. The production adds a frame story (that's what makes it famous) of Gulliver's return to his wife and son. Incredibly overlapping at a glance and sometimes not always consistent, but the strange images and the many performers let you work on it. Mary Steenburgen does the best job of the cast. Danson seems a bit out of place with his American accent. The whole asylum system is often terribly disturbing, yet interesting, and keeps Gulliver's travels well together. Danson's character seems really crazy ... I think he should have been a bit more believable for everyone. Confusion also goes from the present to the past. Who believes the Yahoo's are the ugliest things that can ever be seen on a TV screen (or in a row)? Confusing, sometimes boring, but still highlighted by good acting, all in all wonderful visual effects and a few pleasing parts. NBC is the first of many event films by Robert Halmi, Senior. See for yourself how it looks to you, but I'll give it * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars).
