Hardware Wars is a witty, 12-minute short-film parody of the original Star Wars movie released in 1977, a few months after Star Wars. In this movie, household appliances are used as spaceships and Star Wars-like actors. In uncontrollable fits of laughter he rolls around on the floor. Awarded several times at film festivals, the film inspired Mel Brooks to write his Star Wars parody movie "Spaceballs." <br /> <br /> This is my favorite parody movie and I recommend it to anyone familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor. <br /> <br />
