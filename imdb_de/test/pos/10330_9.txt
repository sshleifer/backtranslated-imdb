I absolutely loved this show. I never understood why it was called Bug Juice. I must have been about 13 when it came out. I remember they were running on Channel 4 during the summer holidays, between repeats of Pugwalls Summer and Saved by the bell or something like that. I remember sitting there wishing I was in the summer camp - ha ha. All the kids looked like they had so much fun, it was about "figuring out who you are" and "growing up". First kisses and all that stuff. I remember, there was this really cute guy in there. I think he was the main reason why I got up this morning in the morning. You should have more youthful documentary soaps, I thought it was great!
