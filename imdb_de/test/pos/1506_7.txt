Fulci ... Does this guy bring one of the hottest and craziest movies ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also called Nightmare Concert, is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes, that's it, no matter what some people will say. There are some facts why this movie is one of Fulci's best movies. <br /> <br /> Fulci makes fun of himself and his films. The lead role in this movie is none other than Fulci himself, who ... plays the director for Horror Splatter Gore and thinks he's starting to go crazy. It's filled with black humor that works here unlike most modern horror movies. As a fulci strip, you have to know it's bloody. How much? Well, pretty good. I have always had a lot of fun in the movies and I never get enough of it, but Cat in the Brain quenched my thirst for Gore and believe me, it's hard to archive. Even the Braindead did not stop it. CITB is all about Gore. Almost every scene revolves around Fulci, who, after being hypnotized by evil psychiatrists, sees all sorts of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. Some scenes show him accidentally dropping the whiskey and instead he sees a lazy corpse on the ground, beginning to spit some mud out of her wounds. Forget the otherworld or zombie 2, this is the most beautiful fulci movie! Now I like how Fulci manages to apply all those comic parts in the Gorefest movie. He is such a brilliant director. From time to time, there are some funny moments and lines in which Fulci says, "Making Gore movies is a kind of disease." or many action holes. If you enjoy Fulci, you should check it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this and repeat "It's just a movie" ps. some of the gore-scenes in this film: fragmentation of the chainsaw (full), torn out of the tongue, eyeballs torn out, corpses occupied with corpses, zombies, decapitations many body parts and organs are roasted side by side, with a hammer smashed face ...
