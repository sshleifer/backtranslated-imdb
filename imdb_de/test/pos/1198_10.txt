When I was younger, I saw the end of HAIR on TV. I just watched the last 5 minutes of the movie. And I was really impressed. I got goose bumps and told myself that I did not see this movie. <br /> <br /> And I did that and I have to say this movie is amazing. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message ... The message of this film is one of the most important: "Make love, no war". This movie is a real masterpiece. It's my favorite movie now. <br /> <br /> The last song is one of the saddest and happiest I have ever heard. I could almost feel like I joined the crowd. I just have to say, "Let the sun shine, let the sun shine"
