I saw this movie at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Since working in the wine industry, I have been very excited about this documentary, and I have not been disappointed. The films are reported to have more than 500 hours of footage. The good news is that Nossiter will release not just a movie, but a ten-hour, ten-hour series of the film on DVD (ThinkFilm distributes it) until next Christmas. The bad news is that it is still a bit unwieldy animal. When it was shown in Cannes, it took almost three hours. For Toronto he cut about half an hour, but still 135 minutes. Well, that's good for me. I love wine and like to hear about the controversy that rages in my business. But not everyone wants so much. <br /> <br /> Nossiter flies around the globe, from Brazil to France to California to Italy to Argentina. He talks to winemakers and public relations and consultants and critics about the state of the wine world. The theme that emerges is that the globalization and the inappropriate influence of wine critic Robert Parker force wine to be sort of equal. Small local producers are either being bought up by larger conglomerates (both in the US and the US) or pushed by market forces to adapt their wines to Mr. Parker's palate, which gives the taste to most Americans (and the world) markets , <br /> <br /> It's a complicated subject, and I can understand why Nossiter wants his subjects talk. There are Robert Mondavi, patriarch of the wine industry in Napa, and his sons Tim and Michael, whose efforts to buy land in Languedoc were opposed by local vignerons and government officials. There is Aim√© Guibert, founder and winemaker of Daumas Gassac, iconoclastic opponent of Mondavi's plans and crusaders for wines that express local terror. There is Robert Parker himself, who expresses some discomfort about his influence while refusing to write any more about the wines he prefers. There is the "flying winegrower" Michel Rolland, adviser to dozens of wineries around the world, who advise them on how to make parker-friendly wines. There are many more fascinating characters in this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you're a wine lover, you'll want to search the ten-part series and the theatrical version of this movie. But even if you do not like wine, the film is an interesting glimpse into how the globalization forces are changing many of the oldest and most established traditions in the world. The impact on local cultures and economies can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> (8/10)
