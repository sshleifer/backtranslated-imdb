I saw this movie for the first time in the late 1960s and I try to watch it on TV every time, which unfortunately is not often the case. Now that I have TCM and FMC, I hope it runs at least once a year. Like Louis Gossett Jr. in an officer and gentleman, Jack Webb does an incredible job as a Parris Island drill sergeant with the classic recruits. And to have real glass heads in the cast has certainly also contributed to the realism of the film. It's a great movie with first-class acting and a great story. See it, if you have the chance - it's worth the time!
