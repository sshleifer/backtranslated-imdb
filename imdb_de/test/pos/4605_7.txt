When I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. and Boris Karloff in the cast I was expecting a typical "smart" horror movie of the 50s. The opening scene (a graveyard with a howling wolf in the background) seemed to confirm that. However, when I started to look at it, I discovered a skilful little puzzle about an Englishman (Richard Green) trying to figure out what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the Black Forest, and could possibly avenge the evil Count (Stephen McNally), who dominated the area. Chaney had a somewhat limited role as an unvoiced gargon (one that reminded me of the hunchbacks of Notre Dame), while Karloff served as dr. Meissen played a more important role. In fact, Meissen was one of the more interesting characters in the film, and it was difficult to know right up to the end whether he would establish himself as a good or a bad man! The castle was magnificent and even the limited representation of the Black Forest was real enough. Compared to other films I've seen anyway, that was certainly not cheap. The only disappointment, I thought, was Rita Corday's performance as a countess. She looked a bit dry and did not seem to put much passion into the role. Apart from that, I found that this movie drew my full attention, and there was enough excitement about how it would all turn out. It turns out to be worth the consideration. Definitely recommended, with a rating of 7/10.
