In this very idiosyncratic film, one question immediately arises: Who are the crazy people? The answer becomes less clear as the movie progresses. Renee Zellweger loses the whiney hint of her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly insanely effective as the shocked Betty. In fact, it's so effective that I almost wanted her to be a little bit crazier because her realized reality was so believable. <br /> <br /> This is the first time that Mrs. Zellweger wanted to carry a movie with her. She is more than up to the task. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock? although as bad as usual ?? is pretty restrained like Wesley. He can sublimate his manic energy and only emerge occasionally and whenever he needs it most. There are some interesting allusions: When you see Betty for the first time, is she almost dressed like Dorothy Gale the Wizard of Oz? Later in the film, she is compared to Dorothy when she says she has never been to Kansas before. At some point, the song for which Doris Day was best known was Que Que Sera Sera 'on the soundtrack, and later Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes her as having a whole Doris Day affair.' <br /> <br /> This is an extremely bizarre movie with good performances by everyone, including the minor cast. <br /> <br /> It has a surprising ending, which, as it sounds, is actually quite predictable. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie for no other reason just to listen to the master of the human voice: Morgan Freeman.
