HOUSE CALLS was a fun comedy from 1978 about a widowed doctor (Walter Matthau) who now wants to play in the field, but lets himself be drawn to a patient of his (Glenda Jackson) who refuses, just one more step in to be his bedpost. Matthau likes the woman, but does not really want to make the commitment she insists on, and he agrees to date her for only two weeks and then decide whether to commit or not; Other complications make it difficult for Matthau to make a decision after two weeks, even if he clearly loves the woman. Matthau and Jackson have surprisingly effective chemistry as a film pair, and are supported by Richard Benjamin, Candice Azzara, Dick O'Neill and, in particular, Art Carney as an incapacitated and senile chief of staff in the hospital where Matthau is employed. Matthau even has a short scene with his real son Charlie, who appears as the son of Jackson. This captivating comedy is still doing well after all these years. If you've never seen it, it's worth the rent.
