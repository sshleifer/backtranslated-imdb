I recently attended a birthday party with five other girls my age (eleven years). We all thought it was a harmless little movie like Jaws, who decided to rent it with Rat Race. (We looked at Rat Race after a stranger calls to ease our fear.) We hung up the film at 11:00 am and lay together in our sleeping bags, most of which hide behind duvet covers. I screamed five times, which is unusual for me because I get scared in movies but never was scared enough to really scream. <br /> <br /> We all were afraid to leave the bedroom because we all would get us the stalker (Jenkins.) as we called him for some reason). I played a mean trick; When everyone rat didze, when Rat Race was over, I hid under my sleeping bag and said quietly, softly, "HAVE YOU CHECKED THE CHILD?" They all screamed like nuts and were so scared. All in all, I would rate this movie with 9. The only thing I did not like was 1. There were too many false positives if Jill kept the stalker to himself and 2. The kids never woke up until the Jenkins abducted them and hid them in the closet. At that time, they cried like babies. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes thrillers. But one thing: I'm not trying to get you back at 9:00 PM1!
