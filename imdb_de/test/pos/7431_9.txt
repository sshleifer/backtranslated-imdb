This movie is based on the game series Final Fantasy. This is especially FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I loved the game and I was very happy to see it turned into a movie. I loved the CG, that was fantastic. Many great fight scenes, action and characters make the movie unforgettable. If you're a diehard fan of the game, you'll love this movie. Personally, I'm not a die-hard fan of the games, but I'm starting to become one. <br /> <br /> My favorite character from Final Fantasy VII next to Cloud would be Cid. I love Cid, I think he's cute. I was amazed at how real the CG images were, it was incredible, the game in 3D. I had a great time watching the movie and by the way I love the eons, especially Bahamut, it's great! Overall, I gave this movie a 9, because yes, I loved it. I thought it was a really good movie, and yes, it's on my list of films to get. The characters were awesome, loved the CG, the story was wonderful, with lots of action and fight scenes. All in all, it's the best movie I've ever seen, based on a video game.
