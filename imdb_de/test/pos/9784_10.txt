Critics say that this movie is one of the worst movies ever. Observers also claim the same thing. However, this coin has a different side. You are wrong, very wrong. It's the smartest movie I've seen in ages ... <br /> <br /> You'll see an unrealistic story from start to finish. A story that reflects the real world. This movie is like a mirror. They see themselves in a different way as people see you. To really understand the directors' point of view, you'll have to see it another time ... <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie ... Try to understand the story (and see the background). .. To the lyrics of music ... And smell the industrial complexes ... <br /> <br /> This film is unique. They will hate it (most people will do it) or you will love it (and fully understand it). Ernest Hemmingway once said: "The world is a beautiful place and worth fighting for." I agree with the second part.
