The main point of the film, IMO, is the fact that the whole life of Joanna was just a series of facades. The film opens as she secretly dies her gray roots and hides the used kit in an empty tissue box. Strange is that she hides that from her husband. If she has to hide worldly things from her loved one, one can bet that she is hiding bigger things from others who are involved in her life, police. When she returns, police and ambulances and people from her community are there to say, "What kind of person does a child meet, just let them lie there?" Respected in her community, she makes the decision not to say anything about what she has done. But she never knew how difficult it would be to maintain her facades ... <br /> <br /> Great movie - I've seen it many times!
