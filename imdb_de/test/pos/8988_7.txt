Young Warriors (1983) <br /> <br /> Even though this is a very flawed (and somewhat idiotic) movie, the way it constantly trumps expectations leaves the adventurous Sleaze fan handsome Meet yuppie student Kevin and his gang of lovable comrades. In a particularly timid teen sex comedy, we follow this series of idiots and their antics, including tying bricks to their genitals. The film changes abruptly as Kevin's high school sister is brutally raped and beaten into coma by a group of motorcyclists who apparently have nothing better to do. When she dies in the hospital, Kevin swears revenge, much to the chagrin of his detective. <br /> <br /> So far, we've gone from Porky's-lite through Last House On The Left to what seems to be a typical urban Vigilante revenge movie. Kevin and the gang of his gang, however, show a vague sympathy until they become insane maniacs. It is thanks to the film that he does not enchant the fascist anti-crime rhetoric that Kevin spits out again and again and at the same time makes it clear that he would feel the way he does. <br /> <br /> The mood goes from light-hearted to dirty and downbeat very fast, and in the end it's so over-the-top and exploitative that it will make you disbelieving. And that's the strength of this movie. You never know what to expect next. <br /> <br /> With over 100 minutes, this type of fare is a bit lengthy, but you will not get bored. Played poorly for the most part, with cutouts of cardboard for characters and some particularly ridiculous situations and rather stupid dialogues, this will not soon lead anyone to list of forgotten classics. I got a kick, and I'm sure anyone who reads this knows if he's expecting it.
