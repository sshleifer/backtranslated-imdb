This is by far one of the best films India has ever made. The following are the plus points of the movie. <br /> <br /> Wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the timing of the transitions is excellent. <br /> <br /> Even if the film shows the life of the police in Mumbai and their hardships, it never gets boring or sympathetic. <br /> <br /> A breathtaking spectacle of the main actress Nana Patekar. One can safely hope that he will be nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor Oscar. <br /> <br /> Controlled violence. The violence is controlled and the movie does not become a bloody mess. <br /> <br /> No stupid songs like in usual Indian films. <br /> <br />
