I still can not believe that computer graphics can create 3D images. The moment I heard it from my friends in a forum, I swear that I'm going to see it. <br /> <br /> I managed to see parts of it in a mall where they had many Adventskinder DVDs and showed them on some laptops for sale. Of course I was overjoyed, but it still was not enough. Then I went to YouTube.com to search for the movie. All I found was music videos. Until this fateful day ... I found it. I saw it in spite of all the distractions, because I knew I had to look, or I'm called the loser. <br /> <br /> Enough about me in the movie. As if Final Fantasy VII was not enough, they made a movie about it! My favorite part was the end of Sephiroth's life. The OmniSlash from Cloud could not be better. But I would not spoil the show completely. You have to see it for yourself !!! Get the DVD now!
