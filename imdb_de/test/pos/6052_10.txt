I have seen this movie and anyone who has ever been to the Marines or a branch of service can appreciate the accuracy of this film. It is a must for every collection. Jack Webb does an excellent job as a hard drill teacher. My dad was in the Marine Boot Camp at Camp Penelton and says that this movie is so accurate that he feels like he's back in basic training. There's a line in the movie where Jack Webb's character gets angry because he killed a sand flea. Now let me tell you that there are only sand fleas in the camp. I was there and can appreciate it. In fact, the output of the camp is Las Puljas, which means fleas in English. You have to watch the movie to understand what I'm saying. Anyone interested in World War II films will begin all battles here with the Sgt drill. A must for you collection
