So I turned on the TV today at 1pm on a Sunday, expecting to see crap and infomercials, and this great movie was just starting, did not know what it was, but drew me in almost immediately. The movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> There were a few things that did not make sense for one. I do not understand why the dead talked about things to free themselves from your bad situation. But then Jimmy does nothing but survive the basic things that everyone in his situation would do. In other words, it was not his initiative that brought him out of his bad situation, it was just luck; secondly, do not get that thing about the girl who killed the gangsters in the end, because the whole thing is partly from the Diebleuten was killed, the panda stole money, and then the other thief kills Panda in the end, so they steal his money twice and kill him how is that good
