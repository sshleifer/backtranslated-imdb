Square has really landed this. They did not try to please everyone, but focused exclusively on the fans of Final Fantasy 7. And boy, these fans will be happy when they see this movie! The story may not be as interesting or believable, but it blends seamlessly into the story of the game and has several honest God-funny moments !! A total surprise and a welcome too. <br /> <br /> There are many cameos and funny hints about the game. And most of all: The fight scenes rock so hard that they could cut diamonds! They really are the absolute Amenomeness and would have made the film worthwhile, even if everything else had gone badly. I mean, they are some of the best PERIODs ever created. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Bye. <br /> <br /> PS: I know that my review sounds like the desire of a teenage girl. It was exactly what I was up to.
