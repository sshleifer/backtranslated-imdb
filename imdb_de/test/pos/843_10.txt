I've been looking forward to the release of this DVD for some time (and their follow-up {Female Prisoner Scorpion: # 701's Grudge Song}). I really enjoyed the first two films of this series. Having just watched this movie, I have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. <br /> <br /> All three of these films were directed by Shunya Ito. The great thing about them is that although they all have the same main character (wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji), they are very different from each other. <br /> <br /> The first movie (Female Prisoner # 701: Scorpion) is more or less a typical Women In Prison movie. But the character of Scorpion is very fascinating - it is very reminiscent of the anti-heroes of many Western spaghetti. The director often used very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. <br /> <br /> The second film (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a real tour-de-force. Not so much a WIP movie as most of the movie has Scorpion and six other escaped inmates on the run. <br /> <br /> This movie (Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last one by Shunya Ito. This game is more a crime drama. Again our heroine is on the run. But this time she has managed to maintain a certain normality in her life (in relative terms anyway). She gets a job, she finds a place to live, she joins a friend. But of course, everything has to be solved someday. FPS: Beast Stable has a more straightforward story, told slower than its predecessors. But I found it captivating from start to finish. And do not worry: In this movie there is still much depravity! However, I think these movies outperform most commercials as the annoying elements are played in a firmer tone rather than being used exclusively for the in-your-face shock. Yes, there were definitely moments in this movie where I was writhing. But I did not feel that they affected the value of the story (maybe once or twice). One thing I really enjoyed about these films is the continuous build up of Scorpion's myth. With this entry the character development is used much more extensively than in the two previous ones. We'll see she's much more than just a vengeful, vengeful guy! <br /> <br /> As I mentioned in this review, a fourth movie followed. It also has Meiko Kaji as Scorpion, but had a different director. Without betraying anything, I would like to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends so that a sequel is completely superfluous. The fourth movie is still pretty good, but it seems to be a superfluous footnote to a stunning trilogy. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for extraordinary movies. FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed as a stand-alone piece (like the first two films), but I would also recommend watching the others first, if you have not already done so.
