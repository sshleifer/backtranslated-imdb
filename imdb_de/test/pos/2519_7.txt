As much as "The Beginning" showed that we still get "classic" X files, Drive showed that the X-Files would explore new areas. You start by giving Drive a unique teaser, with the news of the camera. It was an interesting transition from television to real events. I would have liked even better if they kept this news camera for the entire teaser and did not have to cut into the interior of the car. When I saw this episode live in 1998, I thought, "Am I on the right channel?" This first autopsy of Scully flooded me in big words that I do not understand. I think she has learned to ALWAYS wear a mask before doing an autopsy. Stupid Scully! What about lighting in the autopsy lab? It is as dark as a grave there! How should they see what they are doing there? Assistant director Kersh gets his first lines in this episode. I have lost no love for this man. He is the third recurrent character in a row you want to hate. The first two are Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender. I think the producers felt that Mulder, Scully and Skinner had too much love. So you had to add a few characters to give our favorite agent some grief and encourage our anger as fans. I love the quarantine suits worn by Scully and her team with the helmet's cool lightbulbs. Boy. At night it is very smoky or foggy in DRY Northern Nevada. Can we say the word "effect"? Drive is a cool episode, but if you look at Route 36 in my US atlas, Mulder would not have been able to maintain a speed of 70-100 MPH on that road. If he had been on the I-80, maybe on the highway. But on no federal highway with so many curves. All pictures in the car looked very authentic. Excellent work by Rob Bowman. It does not look like the old days of the obvious blue video or the passing scenery clip outside a car window on a stage. This was a funny episode, but some inaccuracies are preventing it from being a great episode. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, so hold on for a quick ride!
