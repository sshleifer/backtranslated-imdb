The promise that Martin Donovan played Jesus was honest enough to make me see the movie. Definitely worthwhile; smart and funny, without overdoing it. The worse filming was probably an appropriate effect, but was a bit too rough and the ending sounded more like a PBS program than Hartley. Still too many memorable lines and great moments to judge it hard.
