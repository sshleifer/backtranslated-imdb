When, oh, when will someone like Anchor Bay or Blue Underground publish this on widescreen DVD ??? Le Orme, whom I know only because of my rare / old video-collecting habit, is a film in my collection that I would not only sit in, but really enjoy watching. The fact that Klaus Kinski is great, but only in small parts of the film, means little to me. (Although some comments express disappointment at its fairly limited screen time.) I can not say that this is a good horror movie, a good mystery, a sci-fi epic, or anything like that. It is simply unclassifiable in terms of the "genre". It's more of a confusing, scary (though not particularly violent or bloody) dream filled with great pictures and secrets. It is based on visuals and emotions, similar to "Lisa and the Devil". Both films are beautiful in almost every way, but logically hard to describe; both occur in such a dreamlike atmosphere. Do not be put off by the summary of Force Video on the back. It's infinitely more complex and intriguing than that. Although the 1986 release of Force Video (the only one in the US I know) is trimmed to full screen, it's still great even in this format. Publishing a remaster and / or mailbox would make it great (hint, hint ... DVD company).
