I saw this movie as part of the Midnite Madness in Sitges. The plot, which was created in 18th-century England, encompasses the life of Arthur Blake from his first outing as a tomb robber until his last confession on the eve of his execution. The plot moves through a series of mishaps in which Arthur and his partner were confronted with various unappetizing characters and bizarre situations. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice about this film is how they managed to capture the look of the horror horrors of the Hammer period, with many mist-laden cemeteries, troubled taverns, and superb stage design / costume design. <br /> <br /> For a movie titled I Sell the Dead, I expected that the focus was mostly on horror? Do not get me wrong, there are some restless moments and Gore, but the tone is very funny, driven by the situations in which the characters bring themselves and their dialogue. The best comparison to the scenes between the two main characters (Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan) is the interaction between the characters featured in the classic English comedies Only Fools and Horses, Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise. <br /> <br /> The acting is strong and the casting of well-known faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm highlights the film of many others that can be seen in Sitges. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie offers something completely different from the current mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face.
