I read the book by Bill Carter, on which this film was based many years ago. The book is certainly stronger than the movie. It offers more details than a movie can offer. The end result was that I thought the film seemed a bit sketchy on a handful of objects. All in all, given the limitations of the medium, the film provides a wholly entertaining and informative account of the struggle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 1990s, as host of The Tonight Show after Johnny Carson's departure. <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly the services. I can not imagine a more difficult performance for an actor than playing a character that is still alive and well known and plays regularly on television. John Michael Higgins has taken the role of Letterman perfectly. Seeing him was really like seeing Letterman. Daniel Roebuck bravely tried to be Jay Leno, but somehow did not do it that well. His whole "look" looked spotty, and he just did not seem natural in the role. In a less central role, Rich Little did not surprisingly nail the voice of Carson, though the look was a bit worn. In the book, the most interesting of the central figures was probably Leno's agent Helen Kushnick. In the movie, Kathy Bates was perfect in the role, though she did not get completely out of control as Carter's portrayal of the woman in writing. In the end, this is a light and entertaining vision. The theme is not very important in the overall scheme, but it's fun to look behind the scenes of a memorable time in the entertainment industry. 10.7
