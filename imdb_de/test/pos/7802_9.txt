It's going to be 10 years since this movie was released ... it still makes me laugh ... If you like this movie, try the new Hera Pheri ... so funny. And my favorite piece of the movie must be when Salman realizes that he has no bullets in his gun while he has the upper hand and everyone is on gun ... and he actually says it out loud !!! You just want to beat him ... but you can only do that when you stop laughing !!!! Fantastic movie .... 10/10
