I was fortunate to see this sequel before the original, because I'm not sure I would have done anything if the reverse had been the case. I found "Mission Cléopâtre" better than its predecessor for a variety of reasons, but most importantly, it was almost word for word an adaptation of a book, not an amalgam like the first film. The physical similarity of some characters with their animated self was very funny, especially the villain (whose name escapes me, but he is the other architect). I do not know how this movie was played in English. My native language is French, so I did not have this problem ... I can imagine that some of the jokes were not so easy to translate. I've learned for years that watching a movie with subtitles is better than syncing. Maybe you do not understand what's being said, but you do not lose the rhythm, and I think that's important, too. I would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves "Astérix et Obélix".
