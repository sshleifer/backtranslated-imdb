I can not say that I liked it so much as "The Big Lebowski" or "Raising Arizona", and I felt a bit unhappy, but "O Brother" is an entertaining movie that has some good laughs and a taste of it The lively Coens deserve a twisted sense of creativity. The DVD edition contains the featurette, and I wanted to find out that the coens are pretty straightforward in their directing techniques. Of course this movie is not the best example (and I say that only in comparison) and it was not worthy of an Oscar (many consider it deprived), but maybe it depends on its appeal. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed the Coens' previous work, I have never been a Western fan or "The Dukes of Hazzard" or anything they show on TNN daily. I think that's why I was not thrilled to watch this movie and see that it's about southern peoples. I do not want to insult any of your people to anyone from the South who reads this! I'm sure you feel the same way when watching movies about urban areas like "A Bronx Tale". If you live your whole life in the city, it is difficult to get used to movies of this kind. But all apologies aside, I found the characters funny and whimsical. I think John Turturro has put the accent perfectly to the point, and finding the way he speaks in real life is unbelievable. Tim Blake Nelson was good too. Of course, George Clooney - who I suppose is not exactly the best choice for pretending to be a bit miscast after deciding to work with a dialogue coach and develop a New England accent for "The Perfect Storm" is, of course, a bit miscast and constantly struggling with the accent. His performance, however, was good. You can also see Coen regulars like Holly Hunter (in a short but sweet role) and John Goodman (also on the screen for a short while, but steals every minute of it). <br /> <br /> Although not usually dug the country music, I liked the title song "A Man of Constant Sorrow". The DVD also contains the music video for this song. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found the movie entertaining and original, but it does not have the quality the coens have shown in the past. It's a less effort, but a good one. I still suggest that you try it. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
