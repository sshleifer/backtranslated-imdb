I have to agree with the comments of the previous author on the outstanding achievements and the plot. I started watching this movie by mistake ... (click on channels on lazy Sunday afternoon to see if anything good is going on) ... and was mesmerized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Impressive! Good tear! Kudos to all (Martin Sheen has always admired), but was especially impressed by Emilio! Excellent work as an actor and director ... just great! Why have I never heard of this movie? I have to spread the news.
