It's interesting to see what people think about this movie because it's truly unique (though it carries some of the hallmarks of Clive Barker's writer). Although it may seem a bit cynical, the movie is simply intricate enough to distract those who need standard Hollywood plot hooks, and layers so you can be fed a normal monster strip if you expect to be fed many see monsters and a disconnected action. <br /> <br /> Those who need a linear, specific and unraveled line of action will hate this film because, as in the novella, the story is partly between the lines or in this case. partly off screen, in comments and imagination. <br /> <br /> Another possible hang up is the end of which I can say, without spoiling it, that it is not quite good and not very bad. In fact, it's not very defined at all, which I know has caused some people into angry tantrums, that they have not experienced what happened, but for me and many others, I'm sure, just adds another dimension of the story - the dimension of speculation and, moreover, the point that large disturbances tend to produce waves that extend very far. <br /> <br /> There is definitely morality, but something different than the standard Hollywood in-your-face-at-the-end of the movie art ad. To summarize this moral is easy, even if it is not so easy to portray. Prejudices and the human tendency to hate the difference. I love this movie, even though, as many reviewers have noted, the actors' expressions (except for David Cronenberg, who plays a role) look wonderful) are rather sticky. I am not sure if they are totally responsible for their shaky appearance and lack of depth, as these problems often occur when converting literature into screenplay. All in all, this is a great movie, provided you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie.
