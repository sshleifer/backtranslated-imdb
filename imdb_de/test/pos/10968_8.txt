I had never seen a movie by John Cassavetes until two years ago, when I saw THE KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE in a Berlin cinema for the first time, which I found interesting, diplomatic, but not so special, I wanted to see more of his work. Since then I have tried - with the focus trying - to observe his other work, especially SHADOWS. I have to admit, it took me a while to really enjoy the movie. At first, the unpolished, raw and improvised way Cassavetes was shot was a bit daunting, and I thought of the original - absolutely - but flawed and outdated experiment. But now, after the review, these little imperfections still make it look so fresh today. <br /> <br /> With a minimum budget of $ 40,000 and a crew of six painted, SHADOWS provides an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an African-American family in which two of the three siblings, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) are fair skinned and can pass white. Cassavetes demanded that the actors maintain their real name in order to reflect the actual conflicts within the group, but considered the film as having human problems, as opposed to racial ones. Cassavetes shot the film in ten minutes and shot the cut, a response to "seamless" Hollywood production values. Cassavetes main inspiration - at least in the cinematic style in which the film was filmed - were the Italian neo-realists, who also admired for Welles pioneering spirit. The use of amateurs and improvisations may resemble some Italian directors in neo-realism, but with his bebop score by Charles Mingus and Shafi Hadi, the film feels very different, very American, unlike anything that has been done before. <br /> <br /> The song with the feathered girls "I feel like a lollipop" (or something) feels like light years, old story. As old as it may seem, today it is still a delightful time capsule from the late fifties in New York. I think this is one of the first films that aspiring filmmakers know they could do an independent movie without Hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. Seymour Cassel, who has been involved in SHADOWS, claims that THE NAKED CITY (1948) by Jules Dassin was the first to inspire them all, but I think this has really opened the eyes of aspiring independent American filmmakers br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
