This movie bombarded here at the box office and voting, but I loved it. A measure of the value of a film is how much of it can be remembered after 25 years. I will not bore you with a list, but there are dozens of deeply funny scenes, as well as a good story and great cast. The incompetent robbers are a scream. See it and see if it ever comes to TCM.
