Trey's favorite from season one of Season 10 and also one of my personal favorites. Manbearpig carries out Al Gore's adventure against global warming, and before the movie, it was a similar adventure. Al Gore was trying to perceive the world about something that can change the earth, something really dangerous, this time about something that is half man, half bear and half pig, Al Gore had only one thing in mind: to know everyone from Manbearpig and to kill! Al Gore here is more than funny. Anyone who sees him is sorry for him and yes, he can be childish and make tantrums because nobody believes him, but he's just a shitty bastard. Basically, four children are trapped in a cave because of Al Gore, but he certainly does not have that in mind, there's no room for any other topic. Manbearpig employs Al Gore. These four kids are Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan, basically Stan felt sorry for AL Gore and the four guys were just playing in Al Gore's game, never showing that Gore could almost kill them while he tried Manbearpig (funny scene "They're just kids, damn Manbearpig"). On the one hand, in this part, we have all the stuff with the Rescue Team, which also deplores Al Gore, and, on the other hand, we have a small but hilarious Cartman episode, and there are no surprises about Cartman's attitude after he finds her Has a treasure in the cave, surely all the stuff with this treasure is fantastic and is great because you will see a sick cartman in both directions. He is really sick for the boys and really sick for us. And in the end Al Gore Manbearpig killed! This character is fantastic and I am cereal! Great fun in this episode, a very reunion. 10 out of 10
