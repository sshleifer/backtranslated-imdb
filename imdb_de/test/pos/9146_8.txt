If you love the vampire story and are a fan of gothic horror, check out Soul's Midnight. I did not know much about this movie before I saw it, and I did not expect much, but I found the movie funny and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Armand Assante as leader of the vampires Simon, Soul's separates himself from other low budget vampire flicks by pervading the mythology of St. George and the Dragon in a fun new way I have Feeling that if it was a bit more, then they really could have hit the thrill and effects home. <br /> <br /> If you're up for a night out and craving for a fun low-budget vampire movie then Soul's Midnight is a great choice.
