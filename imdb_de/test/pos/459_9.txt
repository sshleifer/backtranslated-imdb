"The Journey" is a romantic version of the Cold War. It is about an Englishwoman (Deborah Kerr), who during the Hungarian uprising in 1956 tried to get rid of her former love of smuggling a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards, Jr.) from Hungary through the Austrian border from Hungary. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bus is stopped by the Russians to conduct a security check. The Russian officer (Yul Brynner) is attracted by the Englishwoman (Deborah Kerr) and delays the journey. Of course, the Russian officer knows the truth about the Hungarian scientist who pretends to be a British citizen, but he decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the English woman to come to him. Of course it sounds absurd, but it's a funny movie. Despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr Brynner and Mrs Kerr, who seems inappropriate in the situation they are in, the film becomes exciting and interesting. Good action overrides some of the stupid dialogues. Perhaps some people involved in the Hungarian uprising would not appreciate this film; They would consider it fluff. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite role of Yul Brynner. He speaks with his own male voice and is very attractive, especially when he becomes vulnerable. This is Deborah Kerr's second time working with Yul Brynner since they made "The King and I" in 1956. They are a very attractive couple. Too bad they never worked again. This was the second sexy role that Ms. Kerr had taken since "From Here to Eternity". Despite the fact that Ms. Kerr wore heavy winter clothing throughout the film, she was very beautiful and sensual. <br /> <br /> The good minor cast was directed by Jason Robards Jr. in his first movie role. Some of the international cast were recognizable, such as Robert Morley from England. The rest of the actors, whom I have not seen before or since, was just great in the movie. In the background it was funny to see Senta Berger as one of the maids who spoke a few lines of Hungarian. A few years later, in 1966, she starred in a movie titled "Cast a Giant Shadow, starring Yul Brynner as the lead actress. She still works today.
