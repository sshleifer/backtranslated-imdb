Currently playing at the German Film Festival 2007 in Australia http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm. Thanks to Peanutqueen and especially to AriesGemini for their overview of the cast members in this ensemble cast. <br /> <br /> In Australia these films were subtitled in English. While French films here often receive a mainstream release, German films are still a commercial audience. But as with BMW and Mercedes, if the Germans understand it correctly, I really like their films. As with PQ, time was so fast here, with so many people laughing as each of the 9 men and 9 women moved 5 minutes down the speed dating line. <br /> <br /> While many films overlap one of which I could have seen much more. It had the kind of character and character development for a series. Over time, I'll read the AriesGemini100 Review again and watch the actors I like and their other works with the goal of keeping an eye on them. I agree ... most of these actors are going to do bigger and better things. Some very good character actors in this nice movie. I saw it as a mockumentary in the program. Mocking or otherwise it felt very real. And in its way quite romantic. <br /> <br /> Viva la Deutcsh!
