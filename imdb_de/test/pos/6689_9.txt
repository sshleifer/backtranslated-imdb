Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation, maybe the biggest. Combined with another amazing actor named Jeff Bridges, it can not be bad. And that's exactly what this movie is! "K-PAX" is one of the most pleasant surprises of recent years. At the beginning, the film has a brilliantly written story. It's part of what makes the movie so great. The other aspect that contributes to the size of the film is acting. The combination Spacey Bridges really works. <br /> <br /> This was the second time I've seen the movie, and I'm sure it will not be the last. "K-PAX" has everything. There are moments that are extremely funny, parts that are reminiscent of a true thriller, and others that recall a first-rate drama. I think this movie deserves a much higher rating and many more awards. Great movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10
