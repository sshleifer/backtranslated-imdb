Chen Kaige lost the pace. I envy Europeans and Americans who can see the movie without pursuing the dialogue with their ears because it is painful: slow, unnaturally heavy and overcautious. On the other hand, Westerners suffer from the poor quality of subtitle translation, which loses all subtleties and double meanings that make careful study of the movie so much fun.
