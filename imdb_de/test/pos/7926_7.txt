This was Eisenstein's first project in over ten years. The film takes place in the 13th century during a Russian invasion of the Germans (Teutonic Knights - I think). Published in 1938, this is a very casual parallel to Russia's early engagement in World War II and the rise of Germany in Eastern Europe. There are some incredible scenes, most notably the battle at the end of the film, and there's a shock when children are thrown into a fire pit, but it's not an easy watch. The film does not draw and is not as consistently brilliant as "Potemkin" or "Ivan the Terrible". Sometimes Eisenstein is better in clips. However, its brilliance is present and a must for Eisenstein fans and film historians. Russian propaganda at its finest.
