This is one of Cassavetes best performances. The entire cast is outstanding, as is Martin Ritt's unobtrusive, unobtrusive directing. The anger, anxiety and despair of urban struggles are magnificently narrated in ways that are neither intrusive nor patronizing. In a way, it's dated with its time, but in many ways it's wonderfully timeless.
