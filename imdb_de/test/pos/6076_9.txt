Was curious to know the name of the Tuscan village where was filmed in Italy. I know the name of the villa: Villa San Girolamo, however, wants to know the exact location in Tuscany. The cinematography is excellent and it would be wonderful to visit this area. I would also like to know where the shooting is in the desert. Travel extensively in Europe and Africa and be interested in visiting the areas where the book and the movie were covered. Please email me with information on the websites that may have one. We would be very thankful. And if anyone knows whether the villa in Tuscany is still habitable, that would be fantastic too. I am waiting for information and thank you in advance for your time.
