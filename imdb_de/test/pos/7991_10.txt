I remember BATMAN RETURNS when it came out in 1992, but I think that this is the best of all Batman movies (even about Christopher Nolan's 2005 terrific BATMAN BEGINNT and definitely the highly overrated 2008 THE DARK KNIGHT!). Originally, I remembered that the first BATMAN with Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love him). But I think this movie really hits the nail on the head. The four main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman and Max Shreck) are all alive and memorable. You can really see what Batman / Bruce Wayne is all about in Keaton's excellent character. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even the up and coming Bale, who was exceptional in BB and Keaton could have top honors if his character was not through Nolan's hackfilm production in TDK! It would have been destroyed. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito as The Penguin is disturbing, scary, funny and deadly. DeVito is great and does not need scenic chewing to deliver great performance like Nicholson's Joker. The viewer can actually sympathize with this distorted outcast and his attitude to integrate into a normal society. I've never really been a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer until this movie, but this is definitely my favorite show. Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle is stupid and strange at the beginning. When she turns into Catwoman, she is both sexy and weird, a deadly sexpot! I also feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger from BATMAN. They form a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, as always, Christopher Walken! <br /> <br /> BATMAN RETURNS, more than BATMAN, is more self-confident and focused. Film production is assured from beginning to end. The way Burton presents the heartbreaking background story of the penguin grabs you from the start. The first 5 minutes are among my favorite starts for any movie: Danny Elfman's music sets a menacing, unsuspecting tone that determines the rest of the movie. It's a modification of the original BATMAN and a great one! <br /> <br /> Then you flash Gotham 33 years to this day and we are introduced to the powerful businessman Shreck, who wants to build a new power plant in Gotham. In the same scene we meet Shreck's meek, oppressed secretary Selina Kyle. And not long after, the thrilling opening sequence of the film, in which Batman has to contend with The Penguin's Red Triangle Gang, is a fun, yet deadly band of outcasts and circus performers. Penguin sets in motion a plan to attack the Gotham Christmas party, kidnap Shreck in chaos, and force him to help reintroduce him into society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Shrecks criminal plans and so he "kills" them by expelling them from his skyscraper. Then she is revived by cats. <br /> <br /> sound tortuous? Yes, but Burton never claimed to present a realistic story. He has created a world in which the viewer can accept that such things can happen, a dark, noiric world, made up of abused, deformed outcasts, who only want acceptance and fit deep inside. Safe storytelling, if you ask me! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are rare but all thrilling, entertaining and crisp. They are not just there for the show, as some are in BATMAN. And everyone makes sense. The climate scene in which Penguin's "army" marches into the center of Gotham and Batman takes part in Penguin's hideout and Sidekick butler Alfred (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original!) Supporting Batman is concise, solid, heart-wrenching fun! br /> <br /> I also love the wintry environment of Christmastime, which contributes to the extremely dark, cold atmosphere of Burton's Batman world. I also love the way Burton slowly introduces Batman's "toys" without pushing them into our throats. Each "toy" is appropriate for the moment in the movie and we are forced to accept it for its purpose. And though dark, RETURNS is still a funny movie. DeVito's penguin has many funny lines. So also Walken's Shreck. The Batman-Catwoman exchange is extremely inspiring and full of humor! A great ensemble! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a tight-knit story about the dark forces that play Tim Burton's weird comic world.
