Meanwhile, the game is stale, right? The jokes were made. It's over. The creative genius that drove this game for the first two games finally disappeared. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> The game is still intact, the jokes are here, people. Sure, they're all reheated, but also Monkey Island 2. And also the 1. <br /> <br /> The difficulty is well placed, somewhere between the somewhat simple 1 and the ridiculously hard 2. The Ship Fighting Sub -Games is unsuitable in the tradition of sub-games. And this game has the best joke of the whole series. When asked for a membership card for an exclusive beach, always choose "You do not need to see my identification." It is worth the price of the game.
