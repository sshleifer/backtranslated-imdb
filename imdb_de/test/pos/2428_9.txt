I would not be so sure to accept the DNA tests as irrefutable evidence against Anna Anderson. First read the book by Peter Kurth on which this film is based. Anna Anderson knew things that only the true Grand Duchess Anastasia might have known (forensic evidence in favor of Anna). Compare the pictures of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Everyone can see that they are the same person. Third, visit the website of Peter Kurth (URL below), where you can read detailed information about the DNA tests. You will also learn why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same person. ") Even the relatives of Schanzkowska believed that their sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person, I will always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson are indeed the same same person; I will never let myself move to the opposite. <br /> <br /> www.peterkurth.com
