As a longtime fan of Studio Ghibli and especially Hayao Miyazaki movies, I went to the movie on the opening day. When I left the theater I had the strange feeling that something was missing, the "magical" feeling that I had experienced in all the Miyazaki movies before, but I could not say why it failed this time. After thinking about the other Ghibli movies, maybe I know the reason: This movie had most of the elements of a great Miyazaki anime: cute characters, wonderful key animations, a great soundtrack written by Joe Hisaishi, and the Warm story that tells you the feeling of seeing a high quality Japanese animated film. But there were two elements missing: a deep story and dramaturgy. The purpose of this film was evidently to entertain small children with a simple act, as in the case of "Totoro". Therefore, a complicated story as told in "Spirited Away" or "Princess Mononoke" is not really necessary, but on the other hand, this story was just too superficial. I could not connect with the main characters because there was no character development, dramatic scenes were limited and did not last very long. I really hate to award just 7 stars for a Miyazaki movie, as I would like to award all previous movies with 10 stars, but this time it was just not this wonderful "Ghibli experience".
