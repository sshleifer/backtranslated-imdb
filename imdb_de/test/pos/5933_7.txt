The Royal Rumble has traditionally been one of my favorite events and I've been a wrestling fan for a few years now. The other shows may have better matches, but I've always found that the real rumble match is full of excitement. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the winners of a match as I do not see it. It's fair to ruin the results of a review. However, I will comment on the quality of them. <br /> <br /> We have the standard 4 games and then the big rumble event. Two from Smackdown and two from Raw. Shawn Michaels and Edge open up for Raw. This is a good match between two talented guys. This is a game that I would recommend. It's hard to summarize without revealing the winner. <br /> <br /> Next we have the usual Undertaker against a big, bad monster, no matter who it is. Giant Gonzales, Yokozuna, Kamala ... this time it's Heidenreich. It is also a casket. Typical Undertaker fare. Watch out if you're a fan. I have to admit, I'm just for the entertainment factor. It can hardly be considered classic wrestling. <br /> <br /> The next two games are the title fights. For once, Smackdown manages to bring Raw to the stage. Their title match is quite exciting and enjoyable, but with an anti-climax and an end to the end. Raw's match is a pretty boring and boring affair, which is a shame as I'm a fan of both guys. <br /> <br /> Now for the main reason why I love the event, the Rumble. It's pretty good this year. At the event, we all had a pretty good idea of ​​who could win, and it's not a big surprise, but hey, it's very enjoyable. There are the usual different ways to turn people off. There are the pawns that can not make it to the ring, the participant who is ridiculous and we all want to see defeated, and someone is eliminated by a previously eliminated fighter. It has its usual ups and downs, and I loved the end, especially the entrance of Vince McMahon. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this show. Not the WWE in top shape, but still good. Add it to your collection.
