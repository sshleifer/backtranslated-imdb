I recently described Woody Allen's Manhattan as perfect, and she thought it would be a weird way to describe a movie ... I've just seen a handful of films that I would call perfect. Manhattan is one, McCabe & Ms. Miller by Robert Altman is different, and Once Upon a Time in the west by Sergio Leone is another film that I believe achieves perfection. There are a few others, but apart from the fact that I do not find any mistakes in the three points mentioned, I have to admit that all three directors have a taste. <br /> <br /> If there's a movie I could get behind the house and bet that anyone I show it would have found it off-the-shoulder. It's Shoulder Arms. <br /> <br /> City Lights, The Great Dictator, The Gold Rush and even the pawn shop are ten, but not only Chaplin is doing everything right in this movie, all he's done is weird and touching on one level, which can not be explained.
