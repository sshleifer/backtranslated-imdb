This wonderful roller coaster of a film always brings me beautiful ideas. It's about the complicated life of three very different people. Holly Hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer. Albert Brookes plays the inconspicuous but ingenious journalist. William Hurt is the sympathetic but dumb new kid on the block, newscaster. The classic triangle of threes appears with the astonishingly funny and self-deprecating Brookes, who falls in love with Hunter, but Hurt naturally feels drawn. <br /> <br /> This movie works on many levels. At least, it's a brilliant comedy in which the one-liners fly so thick and fast that each sight carries a new crop of those you missed last time. It is also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romanticism. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, the film examines the modern obsession with the physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over the mind as a valuable human attribute. This is represented by the uncompromising career success of the Hurt character as opposed to the relative decline of Brookes. Despite its fifteen years of existence, the film contains some initially relevant messages about the values ​​of modern news and the continued decline in journalistic standards. This film is a classic in every way and it is difficult to understand why it was so neglected
