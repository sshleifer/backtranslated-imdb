I am Egyptian. I have a green card. I live in the USA since 1991. I have a very common Arab name. I am married (non-American, but not Egyptian, non-Arab woman). I have children born in the USA. I did my doctorate in cell biology in the US and travel for conferences. I earn 6-digit income and own a house in Washington, DC. I pay my taxes and outside of 1 or 2 parking tickets I have not been flawed since my arrival in this country in 1991. I look more Egyptian than the Ibrahimi character, but my spoken English is as good as his. <br /> <A few months ago I returned from a conference / corporate business in Spain through Munich to Washington, DC (home). I was picked up by a German officer at Munich Airport as soon as I got off the plane from Madrid. He was waiting for me. He just started to question me until I simply told him: "I do not have a business in Germany, I just go through". He had let me go with the utmost disappointment. That was nothing compared to what happened in Washington at Dulles Airport (which was not nearly as bad as what Ibrahimi did in the movie). The customs officer asked me some questions about the duration and purpose of my trip. He then wrote a letter C on my customs declaration form and let me go. After picking up my checked bag, I was stopped at the last exit point (Some Homeland Security Mist). I sat there for 3 hours together with many different people of different nationalities. I was not told the reason for my detention. I was not allowed to use my phone or another phone. I was persistent when I was first asked for the reason or let me go, but decided to suck it and wait. I asked if I could call my wife to tell her that I was late but no. When I tried to use my phone, and as soon as my wife said hello, an officer tore the phone out and threatened to confiscate it. When I asked if I needed to call home because my family was waiting, they said, "Three hours is nothing, we'll be back after five hours." When I asked to use the bath, an officer accompanied me. The toilet was funny; I think it was a prison-style toilet that's made entirely of metal and has no toilet seat. Finally, they called my name, gave me my passport / green card and said you can leave. I asked what the problem was, they said "nothing" !! I know it was only 3 hours, but I was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and kids. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it was very well done. Unlike most films that are Arabs and use non-Arab actors who speak gibberish, this film was 100% accurate. I assume that the country is Morocco (North Africa).
