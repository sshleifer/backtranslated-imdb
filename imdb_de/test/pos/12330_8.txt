I can not describe the feeling when I got hold of this crappy VHS rental cassette 20 years ago. Somehow I got my dad to rent it for myself, and I saw it twice with my little brother. Yes, we have nightmares. This film was originally classified as a PG in the US, but was limited to 18 or 16 in many other countries, including Finland. The movie was meant for teens, but it must be the hottest movie ever rated PG. There is no bad language or nudity. Originally made in 1981, it remained on the shelves a few years before its release. <br /> <br /> This is an A-Class B movie, a real, well made 80's horror movie. A few college girls decide to spend a night in a mausoleum, unaware that a supernatural evil is waiting for them. It's campy, absolutely stupid, but they just can not do those movies anymore. There is definitely a certain feeling for this 80s horror genre. This is after all these years still very scary and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The effects are just quality by Ellis Burman Jr and Thomas R. Burman. The make-up effects play a big role in this movie, otherwise it would have been just a boring teen slasher. Comment track is interesting. <br /> <br /> (Actually, this version is not so special.) Below average transfer to DVD, some glitches and scratches here and there.) First it was released by the Blue Underground but unfortunately canceled so that Shriek Show it published without restoring the pressure. Too bad!) <br /> <br /> Great Date Movie! <br /> <br /> Recommended !!! <br /> <br /> Note! I gave only 8 out of 10 because of the "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 out of 10
