As a kid, I grew up with the chintzy 60's TV series (and no, I'm not that old? POW!). When director Tim Burton brought his novel vision to the screen, I just glanced at it and never resigned to favor his rates over the much-talked-about new additions ("Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight"). which does not really interest me. Even if they choose a much more grounded approach and want to explore the psyche of Bruce Wayne / Batman further? But honestly, I do not believe that there is so much that I can get involved with. I wanted crazy fun with a dark series, and in my eyes, Burton has produced this, and so I can watch her over and over again. <br /> <br /> After the audience was thrilled with the 'Batman' in 1989, Jack Nicholson, thanks to the gaudy Gothic Art Directorate and the non-captives, takes on the performance of the camped but psychotic Joker. Burton returned three years later for the follow-up and my favorite Batman films. "Batman returns". Stock, but well done. In what would live up to being even more expansive, louder, dreary and nihilistic and having two rogue enemies for the price of one. Enter the grotesque penguin (Danny DeVito is splendid on a branch) and the gorgeous Catwoman (a steamy Michelle Pfeiffer who fills the suit nicely) to spoil Gotham's party. Again Batman (an aptly brooding Michael Keaton is equally commendable and quite imposing in this bat suit) plays the second role opposite the bad guys, but I have always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman, which gave him a sinisterly gloomy mystique, but also a major psychological complexity that never forced the necessity to force food. And it was Bruce Wayne's turn as well. Burton's illustrative atmospheric direction begins with his slender Gothic style, which engraves a carnival comic world with a large selection of characters and vibrant costumes. The moody narrative (which is likely to be a bit too long) is rather symbolic in its progression, but shows its spontaneous, arresting and extravagant set pieces and sharply etched art movements covered with shady tones and gray / blue neon light, a wintry backdrop. The magnetically free-flowing camera work flies, and Danny Elfman's stately, spacious score balances the playfulness and gloomy touch with a very hypnotic train. The rest of the performances may be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken digs himself into a glassy, ​​glassy role of two-sided businessman Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back, but has little to do, as Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough are adorable as Alfred. Solid support includes Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens.
