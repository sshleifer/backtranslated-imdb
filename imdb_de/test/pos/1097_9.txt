Yes, maybe there are parts of this film that have to stop the faith a bit, but do not detract from the charm and wonder of the film. It was shown as part of our city's youth film festival and was the favorite of the Organizing Committee. Which is not surprising. The theme - to get together in a race, even though South Africa is highly topical after apartheid, and the treatment of the topic is inspiring. As mentioned in the previous commentary, the film has flaws, but the realism of the scenery and the way the director treats his subject contradicts these shortcomings. I saw that with my wife and we came back the same evening with the kids. A movie to watch, meditate, discuss and act.
