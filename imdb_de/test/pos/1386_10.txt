GZSZ is the longest running daily soap in Germany and it is cult! I started seeing it from day one and loved it from the start. Over the years, so much has changed that the old characters like Heiko, Elke, Tina, Saskia, etc. have remained, and new ones have appeared like Marie, Kai, Cora or John. I have to say that I liked GZSZ better in the years 1995-2000, because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters. My favorite character is Sonja Wiebe because she is the sharpest person ever on this soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show. Tina Bordihn was the first Sonja to be great, but when Tokessa became the new version of Sonja, the character got even better.
