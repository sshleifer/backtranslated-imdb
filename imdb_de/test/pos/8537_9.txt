Oh dear God. Of course, if you rent or buy this, you do not expect documentation on the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitat. They expect a visual feast of blood and blood and maybe even a scare or two. Well, for those who are as sick and twisted as I am, you will not find many fears, but you will urinate laughter very close to yourself. The keywords in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever. The first time I showed this to my friends and colleagues was over 3 years ago, but we are still laughing and using the slogans. It's as addictive and funny as Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive / Braindead. From the absolutely ridiculous dialogue of the opening scene to the best works of the Splatter and Gore department, to the miraculous abilities of filmmaker Ed, you will laugh and laugh again. As far as the visual feast of blood and blood is concerned, they understand it. And they are damn good at it ... "The neck bone is tied to the head bone ..." This movie has also made the best nightmare / hallucination / totally crazy scene I've ever seen. and that's not fun, but man is well done (and scary.) All in all, for anyone who does not mind a bunch of blood and a damn good time IF YOU WILL RECEIVE THIS FILM !!!! It's on Netflix, I know for sure.
