Kon Ichikawa had witnessed World War II and saw the impact this had on his people in Japan. But also the writer Shohei Ooka, whose book was the inspiration for Ichikawa's film Fires on the Plain. It's a movie about the men in this war or, more generally, wars in general who lose their humanity. The soldiers who trotted through these fields and the jungles of the Philip in this story are almost completely without hope, if not already. Stone's Platoon looks like a picnic: at least they had certain things, like the food. <br /> <br /> They have little or no reserves or supplies or ammunition, no support, no sense of anything going their way in this fight they were encountered in. They can not even get proper hospital treatment unless they can not walk at all or have lost limbs (for example, if you have TB, you're on the road). But through the prism of a soldier, a private Tamura, we get a full sense of the futility of war, both in his sombre scenes of nothingness, as well as boredom and decay, as well as the flashes of intense and brutal violence. > <br /> In the film Tamura wants to get only medical care. This is just starting, and his supervisor from his supervisor - he already has eyes that stare at him and have an expression that has been leached out by years of fighting - that he will die if he can not find a hospital. He really does not, but he ends up with some soldiers: First with a platoon that somehow works together, but is really led by a power-hungry brute who only wants Tamura's salt stock. and later with two other stray soldiers who are part of a group that had previously ambushed at night crossing a street. <br /> <br /> The story is not necessarily a straight line, but it does not have to be. Tamura's way in Fires on the Plain is told in vignettes, little stories, as when he encounters a seemingly deserted enemy village. Two of the residents come back for supplies, and Tamura sneaks up on them. It is a torturous scene, as we have not seen anything right * wrong * in Tamura, but he does it in this scene, not even so much out of evil, but out of fear and despair (this is without even) spoiled it, like he gets salt). Small scenes form so ingeniously and with devastation, as an easy task to find a pair of walk-in shoes that seemingly are not. Or when Tamura later discovers in the movie that his teeth are torn apart and fall out of lack of hygiene. So much for food, that's how it works. <br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that this is a movingly realized film by Ichikawa, filmed in a stark black-and-white view of the fields and forests, and the cinematography fills everything we see in black and white. black and white-hot white. Ichikawa also takes care to get everything authentic from his actors, not only emotionally, but with their own emaciated and desperate gaze. It's as if Ichikawa has to let them all survive, as do characters who survive in the wild. Incidentally, wild means cannibalism as well. The shock of it is twofold; For one thing, a soldier half-jokingly says that he ate other soldiers at Tamaura early on, asking if it was true, and only in response to saying one "not asking" word of caution and the second with the portrayal Cannibalism itself receives, from the crazy starving man on the hill who pulls guts out of his lap and says to our hero with a straight face, "You can eat me when I die." <br /> <br /> This makes things even more brutal when the director films the short action scenes. I think they are more brutal than "Private Ryan" in their portrayals of violence in battle, the slaughter that is completely random. One scene that I would point out, and that contains only one shot, which is terrible to see, is when we see from a high angle a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly, a rifle of gunfire, only four or five kills, but it just goes so fast, and the soldiers keep going on the same lane. This is not the only setting of terrible carnage being shown - if it has to be damned, but splashing on the screen like something totally macabre - but it brings the point completely. <br /> <br /> All the drama is amazing (especially Funakoshi, who seems to be most peaceful as well as appalled by what he mostly sees in the most subtle looks), all the essentials give the cruel experience something else It's all the ultimate question of an anti-war movie: how can or why people fight in such wars? It is almost too depressing to put into words, and so Ichikawa pushes our noses directly into the dirt and grime and blood and asks us to take it in ourselves. Maybe one day it will never happen again. Or you can hope for that at the end of such a gritty and great movie like this.
