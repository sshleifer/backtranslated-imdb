This is definitely the most thrilling X-Files episode of the first season. I think of this episode when I hear X-Files. The plot is simple but exciting. Our lead actor and a couple of scientists are investigating a Alskan outpost where the research team killed each other. It turns out that a small parasite that was dug out of the ice had infected the research team. The parasite binds to the brain causing paranoia and insanity. Soon no one can tell who they can trust or who is infected or not. <br /> <br /> This episode was a direct homage to John Carpenter's great horror movie "the THING". The Thing plays in the Antarctic and a team of scientists finds a destroyed outpost in which its inhabitants were killed or killed. An alien that had been buried in the ice for 10,000 years had been thawed. It has the ability to mimic any life form. Therefore, the main characters can not distinguish themselves from enemies. <br /> <br /> Believe me, THING is one of the most exciting and exciting horror movies you'll ever see. If you liked the episode ICE, I advise you to see it. Or if you have only seen the THING, I recommend you to see ICE. <br /> <br /> ICE is the best direct tribute / tribute to John Carpenter's The THING, which I've ever seen of the best X-Files episodes. I give a 10/10.
