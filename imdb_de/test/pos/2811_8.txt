Hmm, is it correct to compare the contribution of Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar Saved by The Bell? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is it right to rate this film as 10? Hahahahahaha ... that's funny. This movie was not so terrible, though; better than I expected. Made-for-TV movies are often similar. So many of them have the same feeling. This one had the same feeling, but it worked, although it was another tortured woman who was to get b * stard in the final story. Before we started, I had introduced myself to Mrs. Thiessen as a seductress of the fox type 90210, but here she was as innocent as Kelly Kapowski, which was refreshing. Eric Close surprised me by playing his role really well. With some decent writing, the director has gotten a pretty good, convincing performance from him, without even being cheesy at all. All in all, it was a bit more interesting, definitely better than most TV movies. My grade: B-
