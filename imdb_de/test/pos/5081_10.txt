I think that this was the most outstanding thriller I have seen in a long time. The research for the film was thorough, the writer Kelly Sane has left no loose ends. The cast was seasoned (fantastic performances around the clock). Omar Metwally was outstanding. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is poetic, the music enchanting and the overall effect very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Rendition enters an area that even the media fear. It really is a wake-up call for those involved in espionage and the legal network "War on Terror". <br /> <br /> A woman came out of the theater and asked me "is this really happening"? That speaks already of Gavin Hood's masterpiece.
