I watched Sleeper Cell with some hesitation that he was worried that the terrorists would be glorified. This mesmerizing series not only handled the topic responsibly, it created depth and substance for almost every character. Oded Fehr devours the screen in every scene he's in right now. ?? Although his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell, he still has a hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy did well, although in some scenes I wondered why he was not shot on the spot because of the look on his face. The pros of the series are the two main characters Fehr and Ealy, the well-written characters - all believable and tragic - and the disturbing themes that have been addressed in the story. After being married to a Muslim myself, the atmosphere was quite realistic. The downsides for me personally were that the female T & A were over the top. Most seemed to be free, as were some sex scenes. Still, it's a raw, gripping series that makes you think. Someone gives Fehr juicier roles like these and lets him run with it. He has an incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating from him.
