Acting director Bill Paxton continues his promising debut, the Gothic horror "Frailty," with this family-friendly sports drama about the 1913 US Open, in which a young American caddy emerges from his modest background to compete against his bristle idol Play what was dubbed as "The greatest game ever played." I'm not a fan of golf, and these crazy underdog sports movements are a dozen dozen (recently with "Miracle" and "Cinderella Man" having a big impact), but some of them were as thrilling as this movie. <Br /> <br /> The film opens with some creative opening speeches (imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening speeches of HBO's "Carnivale" and "Rome"), but it slowly goes through the first hour after the number. As soon as the action moves in the US, things are very well received. Paxton does a good job showing a knack for effective directing effects (I loved the rain-soaked montage of action on the second day of the open house) that further push the plot or give the process an unexpected psychological depth. The British Harry Vardon is followed by images of aristocrats in black suits and caps who destroyed his family home as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does well to visualize what is going on in the players' minds under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought to life alive here. The stage designer and costume department should also receive recognition for creating an appealing atmosphere at the beginning of the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> You know how this will end, not only because it's based on a true story, but also because movies in that genre keep following the same template, but Paxton shows an above-average show and shows maybe more talent behind the camera than he ever had before. Despite its formulaic nature, this is a beautiful and simple movie that needs to be rooted to find an audience.
