I had the pleasure to see this movie when I was 10 years old (he had an interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes in the art direction and costuming, but in all this is the best movie dated to the look of the 18th dynasty. <br /> <br /> The film only approaches Mika Walteri's "The Egyptian" in the plot, and a good portion of the text never made it to film because we have to take the run length into account. <br /> <br / > The musical score of B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful !!! Achievements as follows: The late Edmond Purdom did an outstanding job as an orphaned child who was adopted by parents in their child's final years, stating that he was responsible for is left, has the best education, and is a rather emotionally distant person given his upbringing and high intellect.Jean Simmons is fine as a modest tavern girl, honestly affectionate and sincere, Bella Darvi, people complained about her accent. she's a Babylonian, it's not so obvious in the movie why Sinhue is so obsessed with Nefer Nefer Nefer, her real name In the book, Sinhue enjoys her fleshly Fr FRUITS and revenge early in the plot, as he leaves Nefer Nefer Nefers stunned body among the workers of the "House of the Dead". Gene Tierney as Baketaten is awesome! When she tells Sinhue that he is Pharaoh, she looks as if she could devour him (in his weakness). She is intense, brilliant and cold. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding is heartbreakingly tragic in his mission to get everyone to know one God. I believe that we look at Ankhnaten through the lens of the Egyptologist A. Weigall. A look at the time when Ankhnaten's call was a sense of the Messiah. Has his monotheism influenced the Jewish people? Notice Psalm 104 and other pictures of Egyption in the Psalms? <br /> <br /> Mr. Peter Ustinov provided the alter ego to Sinhue. He is wise on the street and a survivor. Excellent acting as always. <br /> <br /> The mature man never thought much about his personal behavior. His Horemheb is an ambitious "super-patriot" in which Sinhue ultimately murders more than one person in his search for power (Walteri's book). <br /> <br /> I felt that the end of the Egyptian was confusing as Sinhu's personality changes too easily. He has a living son (Toth dies in the novel), he is given power by his half-sister Baketaten, he is world-famous and has international affairs under control. So he was enlightened? He could have modified the Amon Priesthood at his discretion. <br /> <br /> But NO! Sinhue gives up everything, including the future of his son, to become a ragged beggar preaching monotheistic love? <br /> <br /> This change was too immediate and the main mistake in the script! <br /> <br /> Again the look of the movie, color, most of the costumes (Nefer Nefer Nefer's golden dress was too over-the-top as she's richly dressed as the royal family) just re-film. <br /> <br /> PS I know that you know porbable that Horemheb Ankhnaten did not follow directly, but I could not resist expressing that fact.
