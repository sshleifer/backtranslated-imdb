I've just watched the last episode, # 32 (though there were only 30 episodes on the site) and I have to comment on the fact that this series was really good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes crime / poli stories, Highly recommend. Presumably, all 32 were factually based, with information at the end of each episode of the court judgments imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes. This was sometimes a grim, well traded, credible and daring, entertaining series. The fact that the powers in Denmark had decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable, as they did their job so well and at least in the series got "their husband" again and again! It's definitely 10/10 for me.
