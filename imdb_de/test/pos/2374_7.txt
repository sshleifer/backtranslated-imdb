In the final episode, Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi (cooler than ever in his reversible cloak!) Will battle each other for a final battle, this time in the future. The plot owes a lot to Blade Runner but was made in the cheap, frenetic, comical style of Takashi Miike. I felt that it was the weakest of the three DOA films, and although the end was still outrageous, he lacked the shock of the previous two. Compared to Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q, DOA: Final is nowhere near as extreme, but true to the other two films in the trilogy. Fans of the first two (and the fans of Miike) will benefit greatly as they combine all three films and provide a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists.
