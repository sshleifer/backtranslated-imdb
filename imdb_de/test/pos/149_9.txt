Chan-wook Park, you have to give it to the guy. In my eyes, he is not only a brilliant director, but also a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often offers something refreshing, but is ultimately satisfying. Thirst is essentially a vampire story that plays fast and loose with some of the "rules" of the subgenre. Kang-ho Song plays Father Sang-hyeon, a man who selflessly surrenders himself to a research program and selflessly intercepts the illness she seeks to heal, dies, and returns. All thanks to the blood with which he was transferred. He is the only one of five hundred who survives, and he becomes a celebrity for those who know him. All he wants is to return to normal. It is now normal to be able to overcome great distances without injury, to drink blood and to get hot under the collar when sunbeams hit his skin. It does not take long for him to live with a rather dysfunctional family unit that knew him in his childhood, and while hiding his new, curious lifestyle, he is drawn into a complex love triangle, darker thoughts becoming more acceptable and sliding down a slippery slope to lead him from person to animal to monster. <br /> <br /> Park's film, which mixes a number of genres, felt fresher and more original than Let The Right One In (to use an actual example) and I was really impressed with his approach Material that would have worn as well and stirred as any other vampire movie we've seen over the years. It's a mix of horror, melodrama, and comedy, while thinking about it, such as the strength of faith, the power over life and death, the downside of immortality, etc., and so on. <br /> <br /> Some people got over it Complaining that this is a genre blending approach weakens the movie, but I personally found that it was a vivacious, entertaining and ever entertaining film, featuring a great central performance by Song as a tortured priest and fantastic twists from a minor cast weak connections was supported. Many characters move through a range of emotions, and all do so with skill and credibility, especially the young woman (played by OK-vin Kim) who becomes the object of the priest's love, affection and affection. <br /> <br Fans of Asian cinema (and the park in particular) and fans of Poe's "The Tell-tale Heart" should bring this to the point. It's another classic movie about a man who seems to take in everything and always manages to play nothing less than solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> See this if you want: Cronos, Near Dark, Dellamorte.
