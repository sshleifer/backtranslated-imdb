This is the undervalued Kellie Martin's best role. Based on a true story, it tells the story of Fusia's attempt to rescue members of the Diamant family and other Jews whom she encounters over time. One of my favorite scenes of all time is a feat of the little sister of Fusia. All children should see that these scene role models are very rare. The movie is well written and played. I'm a movie lover and in this movie I rate 10 after imbd's rating system. It's in my top 25 films of all time and should be released on video. <br /> <br /> Mike Porter
