WORTH IT FOR: If not Mick Molloy's work, then Judith Lucy. She brings her usual classic style of unbridled sleaze into the role and steals the show in parts is Samuel L. Jackson, the other two are in this movie: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Altho Martin makes only a cameo, Molloy is not only stars, but has co-written this strip and co-produced. I've been a fan of them for years (apparently I was the only one who laughed in the first episode of the short-lived The Mick Molloy Show when I laughed on the set). I am glad to say that I was not disappointed. Since Mick works a lot on this thing, there are many of his usual trademarks. Phrases like "Blow it your ass" and "These bowls are a house" can be found everywhere, as well as lots of Winnie blues that are sucked out. It's also the kind of stupid, original story one would expect from someone like him. It's like one of those American American sports comedies where a prisoner or something like a baseball team is made. But instead of trying to make a boring American sport like baseball or gridiron interesting, this movie focuses on a sport normally left to the Gray Army: Lawn Bowls. The main difference between these and other sports comedies, however, is that this is very, very funny. What's even better is that the theme of this movie is also a young lout who joins an old people game. It's never an insult to the elderly, and it never gets a thrill or anything. It's just good, laughs at real 1972 prices. Mick is great in the first real acting role I've ever seen him in, as well as Judith Lucy and the rest of the cast, but then most of them had a lot of practice ... This is the best Australian comedy I've ever seen have. I have seen for a long time. Go and learn the joys of Lawn Bowls! <br /> <br /> It's a bit like: Major League? <br /> <br /> SCORE: 8/10
