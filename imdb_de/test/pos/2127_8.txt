I thought this movie was perfect for little girls. It was a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do whenever they wanted. Most little girls would like this story, though the thought of death is in it. Although no one dies, the king almost does, but the little girls would not understand, and so it turns out to be a perfect story. All events add up to a great plot, which can have meaning if you dig deep enough. This story is perfect for little girls, and since it's a Barbie movie, kids can enjoy it more, especially if they have their own Barbies. Everyone can enjoy it because it's so cute and understandable. Overall, I think this movie is a good movie for everyone, especially for little girls, and will make everyone smile at least once.
