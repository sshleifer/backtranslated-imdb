A great movie about triumph over all the naysayers who are trying to kill your mind and achieve the impossible. I'm not going to go into it, except to say that I like to think about this movie when I'm on something particularly discouraging, and realize that if Lindberg could do what he did, I'm up to the task can put in front of me. Definitely a "feel-good film". <br /> <br /> See it. You will not be disappointed.
