I just got it and it's a great movie !! I loved it! Although Jane Brighton's voice is so annoying at the beginning because of her braces, she does not open her damn mouth ... but you have to see it because it's a great movie !! the things he says here are so funny and extremely cute !! and I'm sure Aaron would probably say some of the things in real life, because I do not know, it just seems to be that way !! ha ha there's a part in the movie that's really funny ... it's just a little sister of jane that meets him ... but i can not tell you what happens because i'm sick and just see you let go !! I went to Aaron's concert and it was so much fun !! He smelled so good ha ha ... I still can not believe I met him !!! I have pictures if anyone wants to see them !! Steph
