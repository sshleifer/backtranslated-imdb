Since 'Midnight Cowboy' I've been watching films with Dustin Hoffman and have not been disappointed for the most part. Since 'Kramer vs Kramer' I'm looking for movies with Meryl Streep and for the most part was not disappointed. She did a great job, really one of her best in "Sophie's Decision", and I licked her in "Out of Africa". The fact that these two actors came together for "Kramer vs Kramer" more than 20 years ago was definitely a very good idea: The result is an outstanding character drama with a theme that is still very relevant in today's society. <br /> <br /> Everyone has a pretty bad time at divorce, even though the kids seem to be suffering the most ?????? .. Beautifully shown by Robert Benton in some original directors who present some memorable scenes: Even the passage takes character and should be in the cast! And as for the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), just great. How do you get an eight-year-old to act? Benton did it, and of course Hoffman seemed to have good electricity: the result is certainly captivating, endearing and convincing. Justin Henry's performance must be among the best 5 or 6 child benefits ever. The best, once again, was the naturalness, there was no exaggeration, so common these days. <br /> <br /> This movie was shown again on the small screen the other day, though I had it. In my video collection for years: It's still worth paying attention to. About 7Â½ out of 10.
