The fundamental housewife and perfect mother, Donna Reed (as Donna Stone), could do anything. Take care of your children or neighbors, take care of your hard-working, smoking pediatrician Alex, and have a stack of pancakes, three types of breakfast meat, and a large glass of milk and olli ready for all children in the morning before breakfast. <br /> <br /> Over the last fifty years, we have lost sight of the idealistic mother, who is at home with the family, at the kitchen table and prepared the dinner for a hard feast - working husband, when he was born Work comes home. <br /> <br /> I wish the show was available on DVD - I would stop my cable completely!
