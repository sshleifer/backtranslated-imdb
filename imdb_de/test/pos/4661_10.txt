You do not make movies anymore? although some say that's a good thing. Although this was one of the first of Disney's PG films, it has more of a feel for the G-movies her studio used in the 1970s (ie "Freaky Friday," "The Greatest Athlete" of the world) than the PG Films produced came out in the early '80s (ie, "Watcher in the Woods," "Tron," "Something bad, what happens"). Because of Disney's support, "Midnight Madness" obviously had a big budget. A huge cast and a lot of different locations show that. But Zaniness, a crazy scavenger hunt, and a spectacular visual style were not enough to keep the movie from a huge flop ... A box office error turned most of us to death Beginning of the movie about HBO ?? 80s, back when the same films were shown 29 times a week (oh, wait, they still do!). In essence, HBO has done for this film what CBS did for "The Wizard of Oz"? They created a tremendous cult audience for a sugar-sweet mega-flop ... <br /> <br /> The biggest problem that makes this movie a "bad" movie is that there are too many characters and only a few of them are meaty? Eddie Deezens "squad" does not even have names! The blue team, although it's the villains, is the loveliest and has the most work in their characters (except the girl who can not act and does not have enough to do). Harold, played to perfection by Stephen Furst, is truly the only one whose character is fully realized in the film. The other outstanding character is the crazy Melio, played by the director Andy Tennant. Although then-Dr. The Pepper spokesman David Naughton should be the star, his figure is often repulsive, especially when he plays against his brother Adam, Michael J. Fox. Although everyone has a favorite character, I do not think anyone who loves the movie could disagree that Furst and Fox are the only two characters you really know anything about. <br /> <br /> Despite the film's many shortcomings and bad actors (most of them have fallen from the ground after this movie) it still works because the actors seemed to enjoy themselves - and fun on set is just as fun on the screen , Come on, what a college jock does not dream of swimming around in a beer tub, and what a gentle girl does not dream of stealing the show at the local nightclub ... um ... I think it would be one today Rave. Campy, squeaky-clean fun for those who were young in the 70s and 80s, it's only fitting that this has finally gotten the massive video release it deserves. But where the hell is the widescreen DVD with the commentary, the trailer and the full version of the song being played in the disco?
