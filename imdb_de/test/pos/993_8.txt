I did not expect that to please me. In fact, I saw it because a friend knew that a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but was not credited. I knew Dylan Thomas and was really grateful for his poetry, but aware and rather disturbed by the man. I did not feel that I needed to see a second adaptation of his lame, bohemian life. and that was not it. it was critical and yet appreciative. it made me cry. Kiera Knightley was great, even with this slightly tense Welsh accent, and it's a sad story they tell. Dylan Thomas is not the hero, as sadly he was not his whole life and not the so-called "feisty woman" of the game. it is cillian the william of the movie. a man who leaves the woman he loves to wage a war they ignore. His challenge to deal with this indifference is what is really interesting for this film, and what a wonderful performance by this actor. I think this film is underestimated because it was so poorly marketed. Dylan Thomas fans will expect a little more from their faulty hero and get less, and so it was marketed. It is not a film about Dylan Thomas and it is much more interesting for him.
