Many people do not find Dan Aykroyd funny. This movie proves something else. Aykroyd is brilliant at delivering his one-liners in this comedy. The only big problem with that is that in the end it's wasting too much time jumping back and forth between Aykroyd's character and the doctor who is following him to prove he's a fraud. The doctor is crazy like the doctor Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) in "What about Bob?". The scenes in which the doctor desperately tries to return to Los Angeles are stupid, unbelievable and not funny. Apart from the fact that this aspect of the movie is really funny, especially the first half.
