I rate that pretty high, just for Sam Elliott. I could have done without the female nudity, but I would almost sit down through all the nonsense to see Sam stretch his things. He can make wonderful cynical jokes, many of whom agree with me, and it's a pleasure to see him in a role in which he can actually emancipate instead of just standing there with a scowl and, as it may, look masculine , My friend said that in some ways this movie resembles a movie in which Ed Harris (in the police sense of the word!) Had a Hispanic partner who was overzealous to prove himself. You can draw your own conclusions, but if you like Sam, you will like it. You could say I'm biased, but who is not? I would buy it on DVD right now!
