Every high word of praise fell far short of the height of this film. This movie is the true example of what a psychological horror movie should be like. <br /> <br /> The plot seems confusing at first glance, but will definitely explain a little bit what's going on and what you really want to watch for the second time. But after the second viewing, you will start putting the pieces together, and then you will know how amazing a movie can be. <br /> <br /> A tip for Slasher Flick fans will stay away from this movie. This is not your stupid ass-teen Slasher movie where you just turn off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big cocks and lots of blood. <br /> <br /> Increase the psychological horror factor of this movie and watch it all on its own with a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without your bad-tempered friends joking about one make a tense situation. And do not forget to turn off the light. <br /> <br /> My points on different aspects: - <br /> <br /> Direction = 9/10 Acting = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total = 9/10
