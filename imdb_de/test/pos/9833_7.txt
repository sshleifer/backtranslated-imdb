I admit that I have been a fan of Harrison Ford for many, many years, so I was not surprised that I enjoyed its performance here. But I also enjoyed the development of the plot and thought the casting was well done. I do not know if I "buy" Kristin Scott Thomas as a congresswoman, but she is a good actress and a beautiful woman. I became aware of her in the first Mission Impossible. Although her role was small, she stopped on the screen. <br /> <br /> Here they and Ford are playing people whose spouses are killed in a plane crash. They sit together and here the action begins. Apparently, Ford, a police officer in Wash D.C., discovered that his wife had an affair. He further discovers that the affair had taken place with the husband of a New England Congressian. The story takes on many subplots, while Ford and Thomas come together through revelations of their marriages, the detection of deception and the disappointment of pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is worth either renting or buying cables.
