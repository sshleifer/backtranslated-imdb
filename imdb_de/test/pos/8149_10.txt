With the exception of the main character, the acting did not convince me, but the story was pretty good: it's about a love affair between a gay partyboy and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. The film is very American and therefore has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance. But some storylines are hilarious: One of the main characters asks his gay colleague, "Do you believe in God?" And he answers: "You mean: unlike Madonna?" All in all, the movie is not one of my absolute favorites, but the script is really good and I really liked it. I think that this is an important message of our time. Since I rated films that I liked less with 9, this is clearly a 10 for me. Some people may find that exaggerated, but I think this movie deserves it.
