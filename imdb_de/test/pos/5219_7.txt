I do not like boxing, I do not understand the attraction. I liked this movie. Positive representations of Latinos without drugs, sex or street violence. The plot actually showed stable, loving families. The combat sequences are violent, as is boxing, but not as exaggerated as Rocky films. There is nothing wrong with trying familiar themes from a different angle and ethnicity. It is a good rent.
