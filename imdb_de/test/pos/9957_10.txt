There were at least half a dozen silent movie versions of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, and there were several television productions. But no one has ever come to make the piece a big budget. , , until now. Given the nature of the game's most memorable character, Shylock, the evil Jew, it's a good guess that the minor inconvenience that characterized Europe in the late 1930s and 1940s may have dampened the enthusiasm of filmmakers. Sure, the main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is to give Al Pacino the chance to scream, scream, ponder, mumble and torture - all of which he can do well. Like Richard III. Is the role of Shylock the dream of a scenery jester. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare anti-Semitic since he has never met a Jew. Jews were banned from England from 300 years before his time to a few decades after his death; and it is unlikely that he ever traveled abroad. In a sense, Jews might as well have been a mythological race to him. Although Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his game is certainly. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that probably suggests the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th century money lender with the unmistakable diction and cadence of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins by crawling over the wretched situation of the Jews and then discovers Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who is impatiently spitting on Shylock (Pacino), who really just stands around looking after his own business. Will buy it when it comes out on DVD! Sarge Booker
