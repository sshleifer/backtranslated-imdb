Plot coming soon - Duchess (voice of Eva Gabor) is the polished single mother of three little kittens. When her owner, the wealthy elderly woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out, she decides to write down her will, and all she has left is to her cats, who then go to her butler Edgar when the cats are over. Edgar overheard this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would have it all, and plans to destroy the Duchess and her kittens; He drops sleeping pills one night and leaves them in the French countryside. Duchess and her kittens became friends with a strained stray cat known as Thomas O'Malley (voice of Phil Harris, who did the voice of the great bear Balloo in the Jungle Book); After making a passport with Duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, O'Malley decides to take her home, with Duchess really falling in love with O'Malley as the usual equal replacement family develops , Chaos and chaos ensue, leading to a violent clash between O'Malley, his brother Cat from the Road, and Edgar. There are also appearances by British geese, South American dogs (what they did in France is anyone's guess), a mouse that sounds a lot like the rabbit of "Alice In Wonderland" (it was actually voiced by the same man who spoke has Winnie the Pooh) and a horse. <br /> <br /> Sometimes slow, but still enjoyable for Disney. With the memorable "Everybody Wants To Be A Cat" tune sung by the late Scatman Crothers (better known as fans of 1980 on Transformers). Of course, if this were done now, it would be a dark social commentary on class division, represented by the gap between well-bred and well-fed duchesses and street-born O'Malley.
