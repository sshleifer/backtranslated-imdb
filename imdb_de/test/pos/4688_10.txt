Hello, I have to say that you have received incorrect information about the series here. The main author was Richard Carpenter, he created the series. Later there were a few other authors, but few episodes. <br /> <br /> The first director to shoot most of the series (I think the full Series 1) was Ian Sharp, who created the distinctive look of Robin Sherwood. <br /> <br /> Clannad actually saw some of the material and they read the documents. I know for sure, because Richard Carpenter told it at a convention in the UK last year. <br /> <br /> I think that this is a masterpiece of television because it has great characters and performers, good costumes and a great story lines. For me still one of the best TV series of all time!
