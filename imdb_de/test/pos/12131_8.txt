I agree with Vince, this movie has paved the way for Goodfellas. The scene in which Pesci peanuted the pianist reminded me of his "How am I funny?" Routine in Goodfellas. This is a heavily underrated movie and deserves some attention. As with many other mob films, the theme is The Death Collector: Always respect the Don.
