I do not usually like romantic movies, but I love this movie very much. The story is really touching and the ending is very fitting. I feel like I'm interested in many characters in this movie. I feel, I can feel their feelings. While most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored, I feel full of it, from the scene where Capshaw walks along the beach with Scott to the final scene. I want to rate this movie 11 out of 10 because I want to give an extra point for the ending. The acting part is very strong. Kate Capshaw has a good opportunity to show her talent. While I'm not impressed with Scott in "Dead Man on Campus," this movie completely changes my point of view. He is so irresistibly charming here. Geraldine McEwan is as great as ever. <br /> <br /> This film may not be as good, complex, deep or credible as other films that deal with the same kind of relationship, such as 'L'. Ecole de la chair 'or' Post coitum, animal triste ', but' The Love Letter 'can still be proud of herself, as she rarely sheds any light on this type of relationship. And this difference makes this movie very enjoyable. Dreamworks is unambitious and relies on the big charms of the little stars, this time you really realize my dream.
