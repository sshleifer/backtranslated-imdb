I really love this movie. It has a very real feeling. I think it was never popular because of the theme, but because of the theme it makes the movie much more important. <br /> <br /> This is an "A" movie and I highly recommend it. If you liked the book or movie "1984" you probably will like this movie as well. <br /> <br /> This is tough, to say the least, including mental and physical torture, some pretty common. Not for the week in the heart or stomach. No gore, but his film can project the mental expectation so well that he does not need blood and courage. <br /> <br /> If you're not a realist or a pestimistic person, I do not think you'll enjoy it. It gives you an uncomfortable feeling about what people can do and the real possibility that our government (s) may not necessarily have our personal interest in their hearts.
