As a kid growing up in Phenix City, I recognize many of the locals in the movie. For me it's like traveling back in time to see "The Phenix City Story" again. In fact, my great-uncle is in one of the first scenes. Uncle Drew is the one in the Hawaiian jersey rolling out his chair to get a better look at the singer / stripper. <br /> <br /> If you were not there, as Mr. Page and I both, you may not understand the story that it tells. The New York critic calls John Patterson racist, most likely without ever having had a meeting with Mr. Patterson or his father. And what is it for you to bring Mr. Patterson's employment now? It has nothing to do with the movie you are supposed to review. How on earth can you sit back and judge either them or this movie, if you've probably gone no further than the South Bronx? It has been my experience that the people who do this simply try to be morally superior to the people portrayed in the film. In most accounts of the time, both Mr. Patterson's were basically good and decent men. Their families were respectable people, as were most of the people who lived in the city of Phenix. <br /> <br /> Why is it so difficult for those who live outside the South to believe that it is good and decent? People even in small cities in Alabama? And why do you assume that anyone who lives in a small southern town is a racist? My parents lived there and did not tolerate it in our household. Others have not tolerated it, but the myth that everyone in the South is racist lives on through the deliberate ignorance of others. <br /> <br /> The film itself is simple and direct. It's not the whole story - Hollywood added a sense of sensation when the movie was filmed. Parts of it were absolutely on schedule. Other parts of it bordered on fairy tales. And if that's the source someone decides on, like the people in the small cities of the South, they need to keep a grip and understand what most of us do - it's ONLY a movie.
