On New Year's Eve, the tubercular sister of Salvation Army Edit (Astrid Holm) asks her mother and colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sjöström) to visit her in her deathbed. In the meantime, drunkard David tells two other drunks in the graveyard of the legend of the Phantom Coach and his coachman: According to legend, the last sinner who dies at the turn of the new year becomes the Soul Collector, who collects souls from his trainer If David refuses to visit Edit, his friends have a quarrel with him, they fight and David dies. When the coachman arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges (Tore Svennberg), who died at the end of last year. George visits parts of David's disgusting life and shows in flashbacks how mean and selfish David was. <br /> <br /> "Körkarlen" is a stunning and stylish silent movie with great special effects (for a movie from 1921). The characters are very well developed; However, the story is outdated and there is a strange and inexplicable situation when Sister Edit tells that she loves David Holm. Why would an enlightened woman love such a vile man who wasted his life corrupting other people? Although religiously dated in these days, in the end there is a beautiful message of faith and salvation. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Carroca Fantasma" ("The Phantom Coach")
