This is a forgotten movie classic, and Harmony Karin has borrowed a ton for "Gummo". Gummo is good, River's Edge is much better. It's no secret that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor walking on earth. No, in fact he is a terrible actor. However, he was born for several roles: Ted Preston, Esquire by Bill and Ted, and his role in this film. He is perfect as a kind of good-natured but very apathetic and confused teenager. Then there is Crispin Glover. I think his performance in this film is the best in his career. He is as phenomenal as the parched Wackjob character. Then there is Dennis Hopper, who is perfect. This movie is just amazing, and if you have not seen it yet, you can still see it today. It is brilliant. One of the best depictions of modern America I've ever seen.
