First, this film is a piece of artistically very well realized reality. A kind of combination between "American Beauty" and "As good as it gets". And of course, something special to all Russian films (of course, the valuable, not dirty propaganda!): The problem of the loneliness of man ... Especially recommended for the people who really want to look beyond any bitter propaganda about communism (both positive) or negative propaganda!). A film about ordinary people, their problems, lack of satisfaction - especially for young people, afraid when the real and dirty face of society is touched ... and the fake "solutions": alcohol and violence ... and likely the only real solution: true love ... Of course, it is very well settled in "space" and "time" of "Russian perestroika", but it applies to the entire society (except a perfect, but not worry - not to find) that on our earth!). For the last time - definitely recommended ...
