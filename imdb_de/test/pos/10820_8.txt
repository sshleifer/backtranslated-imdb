I think the costumes were excellent and the hairdressers performed well too. It has the very authentic feel for this period. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it was computer magic or if it really was. Some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background. I was particularly impressed by the scene of this bridge. <br /> <br /> The main character the actress performed also showed a jittery, witty woman who knows how to make herself seduce men by whatever she wants. <br /> <br /> some of the scenes were hilarious. Although it took about two hours, it never got boring. a very good entertaining movie.
