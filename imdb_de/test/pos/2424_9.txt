This is another of Robert Altman's underrated films (let's face it, the only movie that really did not work was Ready to Wear), and Sandy Dennis gives a captivating performance. She is much better here than she was. "The from the Towners". I admit that the material is under the great director Altman and the extraordinary actress Dennis, but that's hardly relevant anyway. As long as she has allowed her to do her thing and do it well, every story will make a difference.
