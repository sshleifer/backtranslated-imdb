When I see a movie, I usually look for entertainment. But if I know what kind of genre it is, then I'll look for what it's supposed to do. For example, if it's a deep movie, I expect the movie to rip the thoughts in my skull and make me think. But who is the girl? is not a deep movie. But it's still entertaining. It's a kind of Campy movie you like to see. There is hardly a boring moment in the movie and there are many humorous parts. I saw it when I was younger. The cast is entertaining as always. I was a bit in love with Griffin Dunne, even though he was not a typical male heartbreaker at the time. Haviland Morris also plays a major role. And the Austrian actress Bibi Besch is also here! All in all, a pleasure!
