Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney) decided that the city is too busy and dangerous for their family. So they packed their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and their daughter (Tammy Lauren) and moved back to a lake like Rachel was living as a child. <br /> <br /> They say you can not go home, but this is an ideal rural home with a first taste of Mayberry. Later, the residence seems more like resembling people in liberation. Soon, bodies appear and all look suspicious, with the exception of some friendly faces. This does not prevent the family from walking around and turning in the woods. <br /> <br /> We find that they need to be extremely ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they get the ax as a Ceptapcepted antagonist. <br /> <br /> Can the ignored boy Stevie save his parents or will the pursuer put his foot in it? <br /> <br /> This movie is more than most parodies because it was played with straight faces. They could not have chosen better actors and Daryl Anderson was exceptionally scary. Another plus is that they let us know what happens before the characters find out, rather than pointing it out. Anyway, this movie made for the TV movie is good for a few laughs.
