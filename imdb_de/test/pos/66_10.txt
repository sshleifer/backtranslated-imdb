I first saw this movie when it came out, and also bought an LP recording of the soundtrack. I liked it so much that I saw it several times. I could not understand why it was a flop. Julie Andrews was lovely in this movie, her voice was in top shape and the costumes were beautiful! <br /> <br /> The film contains a bit of everything and although some of the scenes were a bit cumbersome, they were still fun. <br /> <br /> I recently found out that I could get a copy in DVD form and I ordered it ... I was disappointed that some songs and sequences in the movie are not included in the DVD version I ordered.
