I LOVE this movie ... one of my absolute favorites !!! This was the first big movie my mother had seen me at the age of 9. I highly recommend him to any African American. This story is about love, trust, challenges and the everyday life of a black family. All the actors worked well together. I wish it was on video, but so far it's not available, which I know. I captured and recorded it on TV a few years ago, so whenever I feel the urge to look at it ... I have it! The soundtrack is great too! Something you must have seen!
