Frank Oz's movie "In and Out" is a friendly and amusing and amusing film about a closed gay teacher broadcast by a former student on national television. He was disinfected and deodorized to address the larger and more profitable spectators patronizing "The Bird Cage." Although the audience was likely to be tolerant and liberal enough to see the movie, the film revolves around Howard Brackett by Kevin Kline, who is a heavy stereotype. The film claims that a tendency to dance to disco music, to rave about Barbra Streisand films and to dress well, indicates the sexual orientation of the person. Like "queer-eye," the film is currently taking a backhanded stance on men, stereotyping them as sloppy, muted, and devoid of taste and culture. OK, "In and Out" is just a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the humor of the film is in the middle of a somewhat miserable character. Howard is middle-aged, deep-seated or self-abnegated, and apparently has never had a sexual life. A three-year engagement with a teacher at the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets, long conversations and "Funny Lady". Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays Howard's intention, Emily Montgomery, and she steals the entire show. Most of the movie's funniest moments are with her, though Kline's attempts to resist dancing during an instructional book on macho behavior are funny. He is a talented physical performer, but the film only gives him a few moments to shine. Matt Dillon also excels when the student became an actor, and the clip from his Oscar-nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical. Despite the gay theme of the film, however, there is no boy-and-boy romance and only a kiss between men and men, and this smooch is about as erotic as that of Michael and Fredo Corleone in "Godfather II." <br /> <br /> Although well meant, "In and Out" fails because of the injustices and prejudices it illustrates. Howard, despite his outstanding achievements and testimony, has been dismissed from his teaching job, but little outrage is expressed. Most characters are more upset about the canceled wedding than about Howard's self-realization that happens overnight, and his abrupt and unfair dismissal. Not surprisingly, Howard's parents, lovingly portrayed by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, and his students are helping to support him. However, the sugar-sweet finale is as embarrassing for the audience as it is for Howard Brackett in the movie. The film would have been more refreshing if it had been about a gay man dressed like a slut, a foolhardy football fan, driving a station wagon, listening to country music and living on fast food. Despite some good performances and witty situations, "In and Out" perpetuates stereotypes, and whether they are positive or negative, stereotypes should be assigned to the rubbish bin of social history.
