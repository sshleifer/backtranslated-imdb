In print, this is one of the greatest short stories ever written. The father-son team brought this project together in a brilliant and poetic way. Unfortunately, it worked sadly for the first and last time. It is fitting that John Huston should end his career A high note, by bringing the work of one of his favorite authors on the screen, in the best by far Joyce adaptation. Huston made a career in which he adapted major literary works for the film, mostly quite successful. It is sad and somewhat confusing that Tony Huston started and completed his film career enough to adapt his father's latest project, earning a well-deserved Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> I once had the privilege of sitting in the company of the great screenwriter / playwright Horton Foote, who has called this film one of his favorites in recent years (at that time it was a relatively new one) Publication). A prolific scriptwriter himself (and a brilliant on-screen adapter of his own works, as well as great writers such as Faulkner, Steinbeck, and Harper Lee), he was obviously impressed with Tony Huston's first attempt and possibly equally confused by his lack of output ever since. If anyone has insights on this topic, I would like to know more.
