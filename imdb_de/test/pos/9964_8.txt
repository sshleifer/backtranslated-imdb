The Merchant of Venice 8/10 <br /> <br /> (This review requires basic knowledge of the story and can therefore be considered a spoiler for anyone unfamiliar with the plot.) <br /> <br / > As a movie version of the famous Shakespeare play, the Merchant of Venice does what few adjustments have done since Polanski's rather crappy Macbeth: he takes the ghost of the piece and brings it not just so well, but better than the piece alone Afford. Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson has argued that there are three options when customizing a book or game: Try to reproduce the original as perfectly as possible, use the original idea as inspiration, but take full advantage License for the movie change, or (which he apparently prefers), to stay in the movie as much as possible, but to make the changes necessary for the film while remaining true to the intention or spirit of the original /> <br / > In Macbeth, Polanski used the rain-soaked beaches and realistic rapes and murders to convey a bloody and terrible time the play was played, reminding of the awful context in which the characters get so sick. informed decisions. It differs from Branagh's Hamlet, which has reached new levels of faithful reproduction, but otherwise offered little new. On the other hand, perhaps Macbeth has allowed the public, fresh for Shakespeare, to appreciate some of the depth of the drama without extensive learning; Similarly, a better-known audience could find more depth than would be the case with stage performance without support. Such an interpretation plays a crucial role if the audience wants to engage not only intellectually but also emotionally with the points that Shakespeare wanted to do. Radford's adaptation of Merchant of Venice does just that. It requires crucial moral dilemmas that include religious bigotry or promises, and faithfully transmits them in the spirit of the original story with minimal confusion of the Bard's sacred bond. <br /> <br /> The first of these, religious bigotry, makes sense of Shylock's otherwise outlandish behavior. We see that the Jews of that time were banished to a walled ghetto that could only be brought out with an identified red cap. Since they are not allowed to own property, one of the few ways they can make a living is by lending money. This makes them useful for their Christian oppressors as well as the object of their denigration. The idea behind biblical prohibitions against usury (both old and new wills) is probably based on the fact that they do not make a profit by helping their friends. This is being augmented by the bigoted Christians to curse those who spit on them (we see that Shylock not only spits on it, but also Jewish fellow citizens who are thrown into the waterways for sport - in an atmosphere that is only threatening The timeliness of the film is curious, since the bigotry of right-wing Christianity (which is typified by Bush's following Americans) has closed in circles, as they are now the main proponents of Zionism and the Jewish political leaders are biting their Palestinians neighbors so very much, as Shylock tries to bite Antonio (as soon as he thinks the law gives him the power to do so). Psychology is self-evident - Repeat a dog and it becomes malignant. The circle continues slightly, as the victims of oppression themselves easily lose sense of moral values ​​and become oppressors. <br /> <br /> The stern hand with which the disguised Portia Antonio rescues has some merit in interpretation of the uncomplicated law that put the Venetians back in the game as well as a moral clue. Shylock may have "his pound of meat" according to his contract, but no blood. A simple analogy can be made in terms of war and terrorism - it is much easier to justify fighting among combatants or attacking offenders when soldiers or malefactors are the only victims - when it comes to massive collateral damage, as with innocent citizens women and children are killed by the hundreds. The arguments of the warmongers (whether these warmongers are now Israeli, Palestinian or American) are far less well supported by the population. <br /> <br /> There are long discussions about whether Shakespeare is anti-Semitic in this story. One wonders if he had to adjust the ending to a largely Christian audience that had little to do with Jewish people. Far from teaching him a greater good, the end enforces Christianity and humiliation against Shylock - a course that simply tends to perpetuate pent-up resentments. Both camps look just as bad - one just has more power than the other. The slight improvement in judgment simply gives the Christian judges a better image in public, or as Bassanio so keenly (observed in the selection of caskets and in solving the puzzles to win Portia's hand): <br /> <br /> In religion, what damn error, but somewhat sober forehead Will bless it and affirm it with a text that conceals the rudeness with beautiful ornament? There is no such simple vice, but assumes something virtuous in its outer parts. <br /> <br /> Of course, bigotry refers to organized religion (and not spirituality), especially if it's organized for political ends, but a slightly God-fearing normal God-fearing person who does not have the habit of splitting hair. Kindness, "mercy" ("chesed" in Judaism), which is so fundamental to true Christianity, is practiced to a wonderful degree in Judaism as well as in most creeds. The Jewish faith distinguishes between kindness and charity, ways to practice effectively, and ways to make it part of one's essence, rather than just an outward show. Both Shylock and Antonio are bigoted and use their respective beliefs to abuse those of a different faith. While Shakespeare may have pointed to the gap between the goodness prescribed by different religions and his absence in practice, the film version reduces the window of time for interpretations of anti-Semitism and brings out the psychological causes more. <br /> <br /> Adhering to promises (the men to their wives) is less well handled than the weird elements inherent in the cross-dressing subplots. Bassanio, even though his love for Antonio is strong (are there any gay elements?), Can not make solid moral judgments by showing his gratitude to the 'judge', and breaking his promise (for which Portia forgives him, a triumphant character for Representing Women Not only extremely intelligent and witty, but also truly compassionate and considerate to others as her bigoted male colleague, including her husband.) <br /> <br /> Some of the acting are a bit stilted and there are too many regional (English) accents, but overall the merchant of Venice delivers a fresh and rewarding reworking of Shakespeare. I enjoyed the acting and also sang the beautiful soundtrack of Hayley Westenra and others, the ballads of Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe. All in all, the Merchant of Venice is a notable achievement of the British (as far as one says that a film is of a particular nationality today) a cinematic tradition.
