I know the girl who did figure skating for the main girl. She was once with my brother and she was always very nice! I also live in Cranbrook B.C, about 15 minutes away from Fort Steele. Haha, when I was in elementary school, I was there for field trips. It was kind of weird to see it in the movie. I also had a chance when the movie was shot to be special because there was a casting call for her at the mall. Now I totally wish that I did it. This movie was so great that I bought it from Ebay. It never got out of here (which is kind of strange that it was partially filmed here), so I was excited when it came. I really liked the story and the Poler-Bear was kind of cute. But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away :)
