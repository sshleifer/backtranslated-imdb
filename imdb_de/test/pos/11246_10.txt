The fact that reviewers feel very negative about the show is a very interesting fact. If you do not like it so much, do not look at it. <br /> <br /> Certain reviewers claim that you need to be stupid, stupid or simply a simple old primitive to enjoy this show. Au contraire, my friends. I do not claim that all participants are smart. There are clever and stupid ones. However, I would argue that they are likely to have a higher average IQ than the average examiner on this site. That's right, I said it. There is much to say for the science of seducing girls. I'm sorry, but please pull all the sticks out of your asses and realize that you hate these guys for threatening you. <br /> <br /> Those who are not interested in the social sciences, and especially the science behind them, will definitely miss the boat. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear: the clubs are not the only places where girls can be hit. I personally believe that the worthwhile women do not even go to clubs so they do not fall prey to men like the men shown on the show. But what are men like these? Apart from those whose games stink, they are the epitome of men. These are men who meet women in the most difficult situations. These are men who take possession of their own sexuality. These men do not beg their friends to part with them, and these men do not say "OK" to the phrase, "Let's just be friends." <br /> <br /> Sound familiar ???? In fact, it's the types you're afraid of when you bring your longtime girlfriend to the club. We are all. These guys know what women like. (again only those who have "play") <br /> <br /> And even those who are bad ... they are worth a laugh! <br /> <br /> If you've gone to a club and actually interacted with the people around you, you should find this show entertaining. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm at a loss as to why there is so much hatred for this show. My best guess is that this aggravates the insecurity among men who have had bad experiences in clubs, or threatens men who believe that women are beautiful, selfless creatures who just want a nice guy who gets their attention. <br /> <br /> I personally love this show. It's pure entertainment and best of all it's REALLY. It is a very sensitive view of the latest in sexual psychology. Sex roles have never been so different before, and this show offers a very real view of this. <br /> <br /> I think it takes some intelligence to take a positive view of the show. <br /> <br /> This show addresses a specific target market, and if you are outside of it, you probably should not hire the show. We could say that about other shows, right? <br /> <br /> Growing up, <br /> <br /> ApolloHelios
