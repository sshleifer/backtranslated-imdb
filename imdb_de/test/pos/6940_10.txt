I saw this Docudrama for the first time in the UK in the 1980s, and I was intrigued and amazed how very good intentions can go so wrong. Earlier commentators (who are Australian) have explained the details of the evolving plot better than I ever could, but I'd like to comment on what lies behind the governing generals' British sovereignty power. All modern laws, as I understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root in order to exist in the first place and become law in the first place. If this is the case, and it is said that Conner / Khemlani's chaos may have been established (as many businessmen / Khemlani millionaires were probably served without complaint), the Labor government could have been a victim of "entrapment". that would certainly have had to be investigated by the Governor-General until or until he could see that the budget calculation was a real result of Whitman's nonsense, and NO extensive interventions sponsored by "person or person unknown"! In fact, if Kerr did not have to refer to the law because fiscal circumstances override everything, then "royal power" borders on stupidity. The consequences for any Commonwealth country are that "fiscal" rules literally apply, and that every person or organization has carte blanche to break any other rule, physical or mental, as long as they ultimately have control of the wallet!
