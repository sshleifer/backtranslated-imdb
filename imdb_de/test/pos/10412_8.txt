I think it's great how Chiller recorded this series and showed it to this generation. Filmmaking has come this far, especially with the special effects, and if you want to watch archived shows that you never knew existed, you will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now. MONSTERS is neither lame nor spectacular, but it's entertaining. It takes creativity for the types of storylines they have designed, and each generation seems to have their own horror series. This particular series was not as horrible as the Friday, the 13th, the series, and not so much for adults like the Freddy's Nightmares. This was something that a whole family could watch while getting a laugh and a scare. I am happy that the Chiller Channel shows it in his cast. I'm just catching up with the consequences that I missed when I was growing up.
