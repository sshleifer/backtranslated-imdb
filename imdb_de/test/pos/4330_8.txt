This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best. <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 reminds me with a new twist on "West Side Story". Even the final streak of "Gangs of New York" can not compete in Death Wish 3 with a New York district that is not plagued by two rival gangs, but by a big gang. A gang that is willing to kill a person with an ax to death when they enter their set. <br /> <br /> Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, gently plays in this action-packed movie is full of firing force. Like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III scores with its gentle, romantic and violent moments. Only the love scenes of James Bond would be much better. <br /> <br /> And in addition to his .38, Kersee plays with this new weapon called the Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of the Dirty Harry movies when Callahan used his .44 Magnum in Magnum Force, Sudden Impact, and Dirty Harry. The Wildey weapon has a big punch and if Kersey kills with it, he does not care if the weapon has a big kick. Well, that's something. Kersey would not use an anti-tank missile as a regular vigilance weapon ... that's way too military for him.
