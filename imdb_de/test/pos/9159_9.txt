NBC has released a lot of good products when this series came out, but none of it brought onlookers. At least in the opinion of their executives who have neglected due to low ratings good shows such as Star Trek & My World & Welcome To It. NBC advertisers got a bargain of NBC's ignorance. <br /> <br /> This show is characterized by the fact that James Garner was the only time to reach viewers. It's a glimpse of how this show had great support, from Stuart Margolin (later Angel in the Rockford Files) to Neva Patterson to Margot Kidder. <br /> <br /> She was in a Western town dating back to 1900. Garner played a sheriff who did not want to use force to fulfill his duties. It was a small town, but it was excellent. It was not long before Jim brought Rockford Garner back to life, but for my money this show was good enough, it was just not the time, the place or the opportunity. <br /> The show was so good that most people who worked on it got jobs at Rockford.
