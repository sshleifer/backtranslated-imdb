It's very difficult to find new information about JFK Jr., and this beautiful movie had very little of it, but it was a pleasure to see it. The casting was very good and the script was a bit documentary, but also good. My only complaint was that it was not long enough. Maybe a two-part movie would have told us more about his "pre-George days" and his relationships with his mother, sister, and other relatives. Part of the material in Richard Blow's book "American Son" would have greatly improved the film. WTBS should be welcomed for the production of such an entertaining movie.
