I enjoyed this series, but felt that the whole thing was let down by recording and mixing the sounds. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, they had to employ a lot of ADR where the actors stand replacing the original location sound by re-recording in a sound booth. <br /> <br /> The reasons for this are usually due to problems at the location or because someone has gambled away somewhere in the sound production chain. <br/> <br /> It would not be that bad if the ADR did well but sometimes it just distracts. Not only the ADR is the problem - the sound mix simply does not match the quality of the performance and the pictures. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what went wrong.
