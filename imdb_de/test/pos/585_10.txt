"Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side?" Kermit introduces this relatively simple double interrogative at the beginning of "The Muppet Movie" as he sings his signature song "The Rainbow Connection". Over time, the question and the movie only gain in depth. <br /> <br /> I refrain from reviewing this film as a children's comedy, but instead see it as a classic for each generation of love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that gains more and more warmth each year. <br /> <br /> As the milestones in my own life come my way, I hear more and more of the evocative burdens of this elemental destiny and realize that it can suit the soundtrack of everyone's life, because we all dream. And that's what this film is about. It's not just a bunch of dolls - it's a bunch of puppets that have the power to pursue their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> And while the humor and the joy of the film always feel good You are not a fair judge of the film. Only "The Rainbow Connection" and the strong emotions it will realize. And everything fits in: "Rainbow Connection" * is * the Muppet movie and vice versa. It is existentialism meets child entertainment - there is no easier way to describe it.
