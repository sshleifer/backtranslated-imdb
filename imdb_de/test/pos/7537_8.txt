About as funny as the British comedy of the 50s can be, THE BELLES OF ST TRINIAN'S have almost a gag per minute ... and a great time with 91 minutes. Other films that I recommend in equal measure are THE TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT and THE GREEN MAN. In fact, every film with Alistair Sim or Terry Thomas, George Cole, Richard Wattis or Joyce Grenfell or any combination is a pleasure. In ST TRINIAN'S, we get a double dose of Sims playing two roles, with that hilarious contempt he keeps running over his face. Joyce Grenfell as Ruby Gates (oh, that name!) Plays her "funny hockey sticks" as a constant incognito to hilarious perfection. The best laugh may come from George Cole as Flash Harry (who comes out of a bush when he's whistling) and various visits from Fritton (Sims) to explosions ("Oh, poor Betty!" "Just send a couple of bottles of it in my room. ") Every part of the movie is funny about the characters, their costumes, the antics and the scenery. There were sequels, but the top three are the best ones, including this, BLUE MURDER AT ST TRINIAN'S and later in the color THE GREAT ST TRINIAN'S TRAIN ROBBERY.
