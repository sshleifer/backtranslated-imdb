I looked at it because my friend said we could try it when my dad asked if we would see it. I did not want to, because it was such an old movie. How could that be good? I finally looked with this friend and my dad. My friend and I loved the movie. The songs are great, the actors were cool and we were totally crazy about it. I think that shows, even if it is from father's time, which does not mean that it can not be a good movie. I did not buy the movie that long after seeing it on TV, I used to dress and sing it a lot. I even saw it with my classmates at my birthday party. It's a nice, good and sometimes funny movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not try, you can not say it's bad. Even if you think no, I will not watch a movie from my dad's time. Try the first part of the movie. You can stop at any time if you do not like it. I really recommend it, it's great !!
