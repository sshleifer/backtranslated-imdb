I think the title of the film describes it well. If you are looking for a documentary about Louis Kahn and his work, you have to look elsewhere. although some of it is covered in this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course I eat pretty much everything I get, and I do not know much of the family history that revolves around this case. So I believed what I was told about Nathaniel and his father, etc. <br /> <br /> For this movie, I thought he was pretty good. a little slow and at times eye-catching, i wish nathaniel would have focused more on his father's work than on his family drama (although much of the story was interesting, louis was a bit playful) <br /> this is really a journey through somebody's life, and I was glad to join in the experience. A learning experience for me and so it seems for the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> oh, and the footage of Kahn's works is * stunning *
