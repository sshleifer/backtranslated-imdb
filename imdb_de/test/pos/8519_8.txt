Irwin Kershner's 1965 Never Say Never Again, a remake of the James Bond movie "Thunderball" (1965), does not surpass Terence Young's original, but this film, not by Harry Saltzman & Albert R. Broccoli, is good It's worth it if you call yourself a 007 lover. Despite the lack of smart devices and the lack of a lively musical score, "Never Say Never Again" is considered an above-average, exciting doomsday thriller with first-class performances by a proven cast, including Sean Connery, Kim Basinger and Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max von Sydow, Barbara Carrera, Edward Fox, Bernie Casey, Alec McCowen and Rowan Atkinson. The movie is full of surprises from the reviving title credits sequence during its overall thrilling but long 134 minutes. In contrast to the franchise James Bond sagas with their breathtaking moments, "Never Say Never Again" offers only a few of these scenes due to the prohibitive budget. In fact, the film contains only three devices: an explosive pen, a wristwatch with laser and a souped-up motorcycle. Apart from the tasteful opening title song Lani Hall, the orchestral music composer "Ice Station Zebra" Michel Legrand leaves a lot to be desired. Legrand does not replicate any of those snappy jazz features that made John Barry's music so memorable for the regular Bond franchise. All in all, "Never Say Never Again" seems more in the first two Bond films "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love" ?? and "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" to approximate Earth's theme. <br /> <br /> "Never say never again" presents Sean Connery's James Bond as an older 007 who has lived his day and been taken out of active service to teach. Ironically, Roger Moore was a year older than the movies of Connery and Moore Bond, who were treated 007 as an active, young man. Sean Connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent, and Lorenzo Semple's script has some changes that emphasize Bond's age. At first, Connery had fought to play Bond without a hairpiece, but compassionate wisdom prevailed, and Connery had a piece of hair. He looks tanned and fit and seems to be in better shape than twelve years ago when he crashed in "Diamonds Are Forever" at the last moment to replace John Gavin. Connery had been working on another film and had gained weight for the role, which he could not remove in time for "Diamonds Are Forever". At the age of 52, Connery still has a juvenile power despite the script's scripted requirements. <br /> <br /> The storyline unfolds with 007 alone trying to rescue a kidnapped woman on a secluded lonely island. He sends several guards armed with submachine guns and frees the woman, only to stab them in the side with a knife if he does not look. It seems that this whole sequence was an exercise designed by M (Edward Fox of "Day of the Jackal") to test Bond's abilities. The new M does not share the use of field agents of its predecessor. M decides that Bond has to cleanse his system of all "free radicals" and has packed 007 into shrublands. During his time at the land clinic, Bond notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and is observed. The nurse is none other than the celebrity Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera of "The Island of Dr. Moreau") and she is responsible for ensuring that no one sees the USAF officer Jack Petachi (Gavan O'Herlihy from "Superman 3"). Petachi is part of a SPECTER plan by millionaire businessman Maximilian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer of "Out of Africa"), who conquers the world powers with two nuclear warheads. The villains implant a double eyeball on Captain Petachi, who has access to sophisticated computers and can arrange the arming of weapons. After stealing the weapons for SPECTER, Fatima Blush pushes him off the street, throwing her snake in the lap, then putting an explosive on his destroyed car and blowing it up. In fact, the first part of "Never Say Never Again," apart from the SPECTER planning conference, belongs to Fatima as she oversees Petachi's stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill Bond, one at sea with sharks, and later at a motel -Suite with an explosive. Finally, Bond meets the beautiful blonde Domino (Kim Basinger from "Mother Lode") and sneaks into Largo's charity banquet at a Monte Carlo casino, where the two face each other in a lavish video game called "Domination "to see who will rule the world. Bond defeats him and Largo now hates him doubly, because 007 is his only rival to Domino and a thorn in his side that does not even seem to be removing Fatima. Bond and Fatima did it after a motorcycle hunt, when he returned the favor and blew them up. Her earlier encounter in the Bahamas when she put up a device to lure a shark after him is pretty lame. Like the original "Thunderball", the villains are catching the kidnapped nuclear warheads at sea, but only the warheads themselves. Bond flies to the Bahamas, where he finds his diplomatic tie, Nigel Small-Fawcett (no less than Mr. Bean's Rowan Atkinson) Concerned that Bond may kill someone and ruin the island paradise, Nigel Small-Fawcett serves as the source of the film's comic relief.The CIA sends Felix Leiter (Bernie Casey) of "Guns of the Magnificent Seven" to Bond This is the first time an African-American leader has portrayed Bond faces his part of the problems of saving Domino from Arab slave traders while Leader and he is saving the world. "Never Say Never Again" is a most respectable one James Bond thriller with many well-kept accents, but never creates the danger that the franchise bond films have, in fact, "Never Say Never Again" looks like a dignity iges Masterpiece Theater on 007.
