Alfred Hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own British movie "The Man Who Knew Too Much" from 1934. This 1956 shot is much easier than the previous one. Mr. Hitchcock was fortunate enough to have co-workers who accompany him from film to film, keeping a standard in his work. Robert Burks has done an excellent job with cinematography and George Tomasini's cut shows his talent. Finally, Bernard Herrmann is seen as a conductor in the magnificent Royal Albert Hall in London at the height of the picture. James Stewart was an actor who worked well with Hitchcock. In this version he plays with his wife and son on vacation a doctor from Indiana. When we meet him, they are on a local bus en route to Marrakech and the intrigue begins. His wife is the beautiful Doris Day at her best. She was a well-known singer before her marriage and is now the perfect wife and mother. The film has some good supporting cast, Brenda DeBanzie, Bernard Miles, Daniel Gelin and Alan Mowbray, who among other things portray their characters can not dismiss it as a failure. "The man who knew too much" is a change for Hitchcock's fans.
