Sherlock Holmes was transferred to the present time for propaganda during the Second World War. One of the results is "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon" with a top Holmes, Basil Rathbone, as well as Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne. It's Holmes's job, a scientist, Dr. Franz Tobel, and deliver his weapon design to the British government before the Germans can get him. However, as soon as the man reaches England, his problems are just starting. Can Holmes decipher the message Dr. Ing. Left Tobel, before he got into the hands of the evil Moriarity, the weapon and possibly save the scientist? This is an effective Holmes story that plays in the atmosphere of Switzerland and Blackout England. The series has worked well in this day and age. It was not without problems, but these problems had nothing to do with time. Whose idea was to make Watson an idiot? The characterization of Nigel Bruce - supported and supported by the scripts - was always the wrong tone. I prefer the characterization of Edward Hardwicke in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series - there he is attractive, intelligent and a credible companion to Holmes. In the Rathbone series, Holmes is often condescending and treats Watson like the clumsy fool he is. However, in this particular film, Watson has the opportunity to be quite helpful in several parts. <br /> <br /> I admit to being a complete sap for Rathbone's recitation of Richard II - "... this blessed conspiracy of this earth, this England" - I can not imagine how much it meant to the British who saw the movie in 1942. Sherlock Holmes has really served its purpose.
