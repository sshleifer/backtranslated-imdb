Colombian terrorists hold a military school in the US hostage until their demands are met. The students decide to fight back. Will they do it? <br /> <br /> Stupid premise, but the movie actually works. The group of children quarreling was in full swing when this movie came out in 1991: Sean Astin (looks very cute); Wil Wheaton (looks miserable); Keith Coogan; George Perez (the good-natured Latino, who is very handsome, very muscular and usually shown only in tight underwear); T. E. Russell (the black guy) and Shawn Phelan. None of them are very good actors (except Astin), but who cares? This is a pointless action movie. The only other good performances are from Denholm Elliott (with a ball as headmaster) and Louis Gossett Jr. as dean. <br /> <br /> Otherwise there is a lot of action, excitement, explosions and little brains. In other words --- FUN! <br /> <br /> Only complaint (and that's minor) - it's a bit too long (there are THREE ends) and there's a lot of occasional, bloody violence (the R rating was well earned). Nevertheless I enjoyed it very much.
