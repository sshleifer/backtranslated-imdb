Film about the failure of the government and the selfishness of adults. Overwhelming impossibility to deal with life and the means with which the children want to live. Only live Stay alive in a cruel world. A nightmare world, we are afraid to see it because we see the truth and are afraid to see it. To see a world of despair, when we all feel so comfortable in our own lives, and even complain about what we do not have when it's so banal compared to someone else. They, the children of the film, are desensitized. They are more than desensitized by what is around them. They see sex as an act, as if watching a television program. When the one boy is with the hooker, Pixote sits on the bed and looks blankly, no emotion. He wants to be a little boy and have a family, but the hooker has no pity and pushes him away. A "human" film with "human" relationships and moral judgment in an ugly, frightened, cruel world. Remind us that life is not fair, but you can still have a human connection.
