This may not be the most exciting or incredible episode they've ever done, but I think it remains one of the most original episodes of Star Trek and the sci-fi genre. Most of the ideas from the retro-sci-fi series, especially Star Trek, have been reused several times, which in turn usually remains a one-time triumph. This is one of the episodes that impressed me the most in the end. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about this episode is how it managed to create such an exciting and compelling story with so few special effects. Well, without criticizing the episode, I have to admit that the effects are very outdated, but what can one expect from a 1967 television program? But the creature ("Horta") in this episode is basically just a rug with some colored rubber. But you forget about it after about 1 minute and start thinking about what it should be. Even the caves do not look exactly like rocks, but you forget it after a few minutes. This episode is a living testament to how good acting and a good story can make you ignore the visual effects. <br /> <br /> The play from the main actor is great as always. This episode features Spock's Second Mind series and is one of my favorites. To put it simply: Leonard Nimoy is definitely a scene theft, and his acting is excellent. Not that Kirk or Bones do not get their share of the episode, but Spock is the most intriguing in this episode. I like the fact that the episode is not a character, but the trio that deals with an alien problem. It's also nice to see an episode that's not just happening in the Enterprise. <br /> <br /> Like most Star Trek episodes, this episode tells us that she is open-minded. I will not ruin the story, but develop according to what initially seems like a typical monster story. It has killed several people and must therefore be killed. But is that really all? I can assure you that the explanation will not disappoint you in the end. This is still my favorite Star Trek TOS episode and I give it a 10/10.
