A gripping exploration of virtual reality, though it's not clear how much the director intended it. This film purposely walks you through multiple layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues to the level of virtual reality you are in. This means an ontological confusion from which the viewer can think. <br /> <br /> Can also be seen as a satire of video games - but the whole movie can fall into the fallacy of an imitative form. It does not seem to be able to escape the video game genre it mimics. So the satire becomes problematic. <br /> <br /> A series of interesting ideas criss-cross: the biological mutant is one; The interface between technology and biology, the cyborgs pushing for reality - and philosophical allusions such as the title of Heidegger, along with existential questions: ie the characters are partially scripted or determined and yet partly free to change their fate You wonder how strange that feels in the game. A character then realizes that this existential confusion is like in real life, thereby erasing the distinction between the virtual and the real. Likewise, with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble around in a world where you do not know what will happen next, and you are not sure how to play, as you have to stumble around the target and the unknown rules out. A virtual game within the game is titled "TranscendenZ". Also a criticism that virtual violence does not feel the effects of real violence. Even heroes at all levels of ontological existence are confused by violence. They do not like it, but it's exciting and part of the "game" that they fear is real. <br /> <br /> The creator of the game, the god of the system, is ultimately murdered; However, in parallel with a video game we've just experienced, this scenario is played in parallel - and viewers believe it's still just part of the virtual reality. In the end, the movie does not solve the doubt as to whether this is "real" or not, but the point is clear (for me anyway). Existence means being there: they are there. They are put into a set of rules and secrets on every level. Ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. And his usual game motifs express our own fascination with violence like a royal way into the subconscious. Despite claiming that Cronenberg confirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film, he claims that he is very much against the "reality ... terrorist group terrorist group name" that exists both in the game and on the "real" Level is displayed. It seems that Cronenberg himself has not thought too much into the film even though his impressive education comes through. The interview in Cineaste gives the impression of an intellectual trying to be out of propensity to avant-garde. Cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination - the clich√©d bourgeois-modernist credo - despite the recognized ambivalence there. (My impression here might be due to a limited interview.) Nevertheless, Cronenburg seems to overlook the point that his film betrays the fallacy of an imitative form (here he imitates computer games while satirically criticizing them, but a critique that can not "transcending" the same form, probably because he actually thinks it is "imaginative" and radical, but the imaginative world of the film is less tolerable and more Jejune than our all-too-real world, and remains trapped in the computer game world.
