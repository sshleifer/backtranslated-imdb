This movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is. It's a movie for kids and parents, and it's "timeless". I've seen this movie before Ocean's Eleven and have to admit that the actors in OE have lessons in advance, but the Klatretøsen game is much more down-to-earth and moving. Why I say Ocean's Eleven is the fact that these two films have a lot in common and Klatretøsen is so good! that it is comparable to OE. Compared to what we are used to in Denmark, the 3 teenagers play their role in a perfect way so as not to believe. The various cases of impossible files are handled in a way that you would not believe by many young actors (and sometimes not even the "old guys"). The history ? It has something to do with Ocean's Eleven again, except to steal the money. In Klatretøsen you have to climb into the vault room. The part, in which the young people have to take care of Ida's younger brother, gives the film a fine element. Imagine how you rob a bank with a 2-year-old child with a diaper on his arm :-). <br /> <br /> This movie can be compared to most "adult" movies like MI2 and Ocean's Eleven. Yes, I think it's so good. It's best to see it in a theater because all the children in the room will comment on the movie and these comments will forever be in your heart :-). <br /> <br /> Greetings Klavs.
