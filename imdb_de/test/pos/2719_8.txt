I thought I was wasting my precious $ 50 to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend, who is an avid fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to appear for the film. That really bothered me when I went to this cheap theater because I had seen King Kong for $ 50 in one of the best theaters in the city. At some point the movie starts and surprisingly I did not complain. <br /> <br /> A great story and wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma. Shabana Azmi is a divorce who has dedicated her life to the well-being of her mother and step-sister. Konkona Sen Sharma is a schizophrenist (saves me the spelling), who imagines something all the time. Rahul Bose also gives an outstanding performance. <br /> <br /> The story is that Mithi (Sen Sharma) is a schizophrenic. After being brutally raped in her field service as a reporter, her level really rises, her fiancée leaves her for the person she has become. In her whole world she comes down to her. Shabana Azmi, her older stepsister, takes care of her, and Mithi believes in her imagination that she was married to her fiancé, has five children, and is staying at 15. Park Avenue (which is actually in New York). The plot continues as Mithi suicides, believing that no one believes her and she is being held captive by her husband in her home. As fate would have it, Mithi and her fiancee meet when they are both on their way. 11 years after the brutal rape, her fiancee has no existence in her real world, she can not recognize him. Her fiancé, now married and with two children, believes it is his duty to correct the wrong he did eleven years ago, and he promises to take her to Park Avenue. and he does it. He takes her to a place in Calcutta that supposedly looks like her husband's home. As Joydeep / Jojo (Rahul Bose), her fiancé talks about his cell phone, he loses sight of Mithi. Everyone comes looking for her, but she is nowhere to be found. She finally gets what she, her family, and her own imaginative family have been denied in her own world on 15th Park Avenue. I have to say that it touched my heart. I myself am now a fan of Aparna Sen. The camera work is excellent. And the quality of the performance is proverbial. Konkona Sen Sharma as a schizophrenic child gives a solid performance. Shabana Azmi plays another amazing role as the older sister of divorce, who has the burden of keeping the family. Rahul Bose, another nice and quiet role (I do not know why this guy does not get big breaks, he has so much potential). Finally, Aparna Sen, she still captivates the audience, even if she is not in front of and behind the camera. <br /> <br /> A very deserved 8/10 ....
