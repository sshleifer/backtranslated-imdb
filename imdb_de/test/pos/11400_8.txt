This is not so much a review as proof that it has once again proven that the Academy rewards money, not artistic achievement. And I have to say that I am sad that this usually artistic and intelligent gang of imbd members has dropped this out of the top 250. Boogie Nights is powerful, raw and courageous through script, directing and acting. Only a few films can claim this triple crown.
