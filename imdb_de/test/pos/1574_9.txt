Until I did a web search for "What Alice Found," I did not know that the name of the movie was embedded in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The full title of the book is "Through the Mirror Glass (and what Alice found there)". <br /> <br /> The Alice in the film has a very different background to that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. Their fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire, stealing money from her ass-banging boss and leaving for Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She encounters a middle-aged couple in a camper (the husband is retired from the military), who rescues her from a strange man at the side of the road and the collapse of her car (possibly due to her mechanization). <br /> <br /> As it turns out, the couple are heavily involved in truck stop prostitution and see cute, young Alice as a promising recruit. The woman (played by Judith Ivey in a performance worthy of a major award) buys sexy Alice clothes and shows her how to apply hot makeup. At first Alice accepts her services passively and does some tricks with the couple's instructions. The encounter, shown in detail, is very different from most cinematic genders, but it can be typical of what happens most often in real life. The man is shy and respectful and apologizes for being "completed" too quickly. <br /> <br /> What's wonderful about Alice (unlike her prototypes from Clarissa to Sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself. That's how things really are. Prostitution is everywhere. Humans are neither good nor bad. Alice leaves the motorhome with her well-earned money and sense of mutual respect.
