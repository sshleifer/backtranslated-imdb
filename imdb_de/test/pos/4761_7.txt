**** SPOILERS **** Buried under a mountain of medical bills, and his funeral home, which can not dig him under the Undertaker Vito Lucia, Tony Lo Bianco, had a plan with which he could make a lot of money helping his both sick buddies Moon & Bo, Richard Lynch & Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> Vito approaches his friend Buddy Manucci from childhood, Roy Scheider, as a mob informer to gain Buddy's confidence and tell him about Vito's mob activities on the streets of New York is going on. Buddy is a cop who works in a sub-pink unit of the NYPD, the Seven Ups, doing things "in their own way" to cleanse the streets of New York from criminals. <br /> <br /> Vito gets information from Buddy and lets Buddy look like he's really giving him tips about the mob and the current things, and uses that information to tell his colleagues, Moon & Bo, the gangsters of theirs Weekly revenue and abduction of top mob loan sharks they consider ransom. <br /> <br /> Everything is going well for Vito & Co. until the mob decides to take revenge and mistakenly snatch blows and kidnappings A member of Seven Ups Ansel, Ken Kercheval, who worked undercover and thought he was would be one of the hoods that kidnapped and demolished her. Later, Ansel was accidentally killed by Moon when he blew up the trunk of the car, thinking that a suitcase full of money or ransom was in it. Fast-paced and exciting movie featuring This dirty and dirty New York City photography was so effective in the movie "The French Connection", which features Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco, also featured in this film. An incredible chase that began in downtown Brooklyn and ended in the wilds of New Jersey, about 15 to 20 miles away, with Buddy almost being beheaded for his heroic efforts. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider, who is not a big man, is as tough and effective as any great action actor I can think of, as if Clint Eastwood had been in the same movie. Scheider reminds me very much of him, he even looks a bit like him, the former welterweight and middleweight world champion Gene Fullmer, who defeated the big Sugar Ray Robinson for the middleweight championship in 1957 and works in the movie as well: robust and destructive. <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is doing very well as Vito, the Undertaker, is the lowlife heel who plays Buddy and the mob enough to kill Buddy's partner Ansel. Even though he's garbage, Vito does not feel sorry for him because he only wants the money he gets from the demolished gangsters to pay for the hospital and medical bills of his sick wife, Rose. Even the fact that Ansel was killed because of his actions, Vito never wanted anyone to get hurt, but as they say, if you play with fire, you'll end up being burned. In the end, Vito has a lot to explain to the not so sympathetic and caring gangsters. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Seven Ups" lets the late Bill Hickman do the dangerous stunts with the chases and star in the movie. Hickman was also the stuntman in both great movies, in which he drove on the streets and highways of New York City and San Francisco "The French Connection" and "Bullitt".
