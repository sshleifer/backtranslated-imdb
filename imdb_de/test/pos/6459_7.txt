The Edge of the City is a highly acclaimed fifties film that highlights Sidney Poitier's acting and John Cassevete's brooding on-screen presence. Directed by Martin Ritt. There are great acting and breathtaking on-site photographs in black and white. <br /> <br /> Poitier is a real pleasure at this point in his career and Tommy Tyler, the character he plays, is happy and open-minded. He befriends Axel Noordman, played by Cassevetes, a young man who suffers from bad self-esteem and a past he wants to keep under wraps. Tyler, a black guy, takes his friend out of his bowl and introduces him to his family and a new friend. Tyler and Noordman are busy at the New York docks at a time when workers were expected to pull the leash when they knew what was good for them. Chef Charles Malik, played by Jack Warden, in one of his many hard-nosed roles becomes the center of dissatisfaction, leading to a blatant showdown with Noordman. At the end of the film we stand back with mixed feelings. However, the two main characters have left the audience with a story of friendship between two different men in a hostile world.
