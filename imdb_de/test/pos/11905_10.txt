I love this movie and I can recommend it to anyone. Damian Chapa and Jennifer Tilly played their roles perfectly. Only the characters pull you into the movie. The direction was also great. The most creative shots I've ever seen The entire scene remained on the screen throughout the movie, with no scene slow. The movie also has a lot of action-packed scenes, cars being blown up, and so on. The movie is just an all-around masterpiece. If you like real entertaining movies, then look at this because you're at the edge of your seat all the time. I've put this movie on my top ten list ever because the movie is never boring and thats it's my kind of movie.2 thumbs up, all the way up !!!!!!!!!
