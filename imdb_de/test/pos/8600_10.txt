Considering the recent typhoon that hit the country hard (see H. Typhoon Ondoy), I thought it was "Black Rain" (1988, Japan), Shohei Imamura's haunting black and white masterpiece on New World. To re-consider the destruction and aftermath of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima in the final stages of World War II. The destruction and effects of both catastrophes (war and typhoon) may vary in degree and quality, but the trauma and scar (physical and psychological) are still present. <br /> <br /> It's a testament to the power of a movie to keep its images as strong and indelible as the first time. The only difference is that, in my case, viewing these images has gained a stronger sense of power and strength first-hand due to a close-to-nature weather disaster. There is, so to speak, a sense of kinship. <br /> <br /> Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. His films are always a pleasure because of their anarchy, sensuality and earthiness: "The Pornographers: Introduction to Anthropology" (1966), "Eijanaika" (1981), "Warm Water Under a Red Bridge" (2001), both of them Palme d'Or winner "Ballad of Narayama" (1983) and "The Aal" (1997), to name just a few. Who would have thought that he had once served as an assistant director to Yasujiro Ozu, the strictest and most minimalist filmmaker in Japanese cinema? On the other hand, it was the strict formality and domesticity of Ozu that Imamura opposed. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, with "Black Rain" you can feel the traces of Ozu unequivocally. The father (or father figure) desperately wanted to see his daughter marry before time runs out, and the silence and quiet of the scenes where all members of the family are shown together (especially the dinner scenes or in Ozu's) film lexicon , the Tatami) are something that the revered filmmaker would constantly explore in his works ("Tokyo Story", "Late Spring"). In essence, the overall subdued and targeted quality of "Black Rain" is a striking contrast to the bacchanalian chaos and instinctive drive of Imamura's entire filmography. <br /> <br /> However, this does not mean that watching the movie would not be a completely disturbing experience. "Black Rain," as the American film critic Leonard Maltin has aptly described, is "full of vivid black-and-white images." In the first fifteen minutes of the film, Imamura shows no effort to portray the immediate and graphic horrors of atomic bombs one after the other (stiffly burned bodies, hanging flesh, dead, everywhere fire and debris, madness everywhere). An attack on the senses of the audience, this is definitely the case, coupled with Takashi Kawamata's bleak black and white photographs (he shot the camera in Yoshitaru Nomura's drama "The Incident") and Toru Takemitsu's chill score (he played the music in such classics as "Ran" by Akira Kurosawa and "Double Suicide" by Masahiro Shinoda. <br /> <br /> Even during the supposed "quiet" phase of the movie (ie, five years after the atomic bomb), you can never have a sense of contentment and order the discomfort and pain are still felt strongly by the survivors, not only in terms of physical health failure but especially in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma.It seems indisputable that humanity is the heritage I want to wear the bomb as long as she lives. <br /> <br /> I wrote an article about "Black Rain" several years ago (posted on IMDb.com), but only compared to Volker Schlondorff's great "Tin Drum," another movie that deals with monumental human stupid global catastrophe. Also, it has never been my practice to write twice about a film about which I have already written something. In response to the recent catastrophic weather that devastated our country, I was once again invited to write about this remarkable Imamura film, as the film and recent event draw a wealth of lessons from the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and the long-term scars and wounds caused by large-scale destruction (whether caused by humans or nature). <br /> <br /> There have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction ("Testament," "Threads," "The War Game," each located in their own countries), and "Black Rain "is among them, if not more, unapologetic for both, and a grim account of the individual and community disintegration caused by atomic destruction and the fact that it is based on a historical event. <br /> <br /> Just a few weeks, another disaster movie from Hollywood, Roland Emmerich's "2012". , Ultimately, (no pun intended) will be the big screen. As we all know, the American director has a number of "catastrophe / apocalypse" films - "Independence Day", "Godzilla", "The Day After Tomorrow" - having no other purpose than just entertaining, without really anything Insight into the nature and wisdom of the apocalyptic catastrophe and the affected human condition. I wonder how this "gigantic" movie will exploit the trauma, the disorientation, and the anxiety our people are still experiencing as a result of the recent catastrophic weather. To say that this strip is a cautionary tale would probably be an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> But yes, I will still see "2012".
