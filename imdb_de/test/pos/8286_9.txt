"The Chipmunk Adventure" is one of the biggest animated films of the 1980s. Alvin and the Chipmunks have always been interesting to me because they really got me started rock and roll. None of the chipmunks has bad qualities. Alvin is really the star and looks cool. Theodore is the endearing sensitive. Then there's Simon (my personal favorite), the smart guy who's often a party fighter. I also like the Chipettes very much. There is Brittany, who like Alvin always tries to be so popular. Then there is Eleanor, who, like Theodore, is sweet, sensitive and loves food. Janette is the only chipette not very similar to her counterpart. She is very naive and really awkward. <br /> <br /> In the first full-length movie of the Chipmunks, David Seville goes on a business trip to Europe. While playing an arcade game, Alvin loses to Brittany and says that if he had the money, he would really drive the Brittany around the world. Unfamiliar with the children, a man named Klaus Furschtien and his sister Claudia, who have been trying to deliver diamonds around the world for cash, overheard the conversation, saying they let them race around the world for $ 100,000. Alvin and Brittany accept that and move on. <br /> <br /> This adventurous movie contains many great songs. "Off to the World" for a suitable title song for the movie. Then there is "Getting Lucky", one of my favorite songs in the movie. "My Mother" is probably the sappiest song in the movie, but I always cry. "Wooly Bully" is the only cover used in the movie (the rest was completely original). Then of course there are "The Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll", which in my opinion has to be one of the biggest musical numbers in film history. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie very often until my tape died. I still see the movie though. This is actually a fun movie for people vacationing in a foreign country for the first time. It gives you an idea of ​​what you would expect from world travel. Definitely one of my childhood movies that I would recommend to the fans of the 80s and the fans of Alvin & the Chipmunks.
