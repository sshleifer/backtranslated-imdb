K-PAX is exactly what a heartwarming movie should be. The story is about a mysterious mental patient Prot, played by Kevin Spacey, and his unbelieving psychiatrist. Powel, played by Jeff Bridges. The two have a very friendly relationship, and as their relationship grows, Dr. Powel not wonder if there's more to his mysterious patient who insists he's from another planet called K-PAX. This movie is very funny, and Kevin Spacey pulls well-placed insoles as if it were his second nature. K-PAX is an intelligent movie, and I did not expect it to go where it is. In the end, I thought about the little things in life and about the wonder and magic of everyday life that we so often take for granted. I have left the theater with a warm, fuzzy feeling and for families and couples who have a date, K-PAX is a great movie that will not disappoint. I can recommend this movie to anyone who is more interested in the monotonous releases of shiny, action-packed Gore festivals.
