I was a big fan of Asterix comics when I was a kid and looked at every single one. I've never heard of this movie when it was released, but yesterday I saw it with my kids. I remembered the comic well to know that the story was much added to the movie. Some of the changes I was thinking were a bit cheesy (like the "modern" dance of the nephew and the daughter of the Viking chief - almost everything about her), but most of all I found it amusing enough. Most of all, watching the reactions while my children watched it confirmed that the film was satisfying the target audience. As a family movie, it works better than other Asterix titles I've ever seen. Many of the names that were not in the book I found had the same appeal as the ones they were. Overall, a fun family movie, whether you're an Asterix fan or not.
