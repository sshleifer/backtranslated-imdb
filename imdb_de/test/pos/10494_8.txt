I have to admit, when I started to watch this movie, I had no idea what was going on. So the beginning was a bit confusing for me. However, this did not diminish my enjoyment of the movie. The characters turn out to be more complex than they might seem at first sight, and that makes this film an unforgettable movie. At first I heard that this was a real "Hollywood" movie. While there is obviously no stereotypical element of "guns and fists," the compelling achievements of talented actors like Martin Sheen and Sam Neill more than make up for it. I would rather see a movie with more substance than to shoot every day.
