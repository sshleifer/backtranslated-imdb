Random Hearts sneaked up on me. Criticized for the implausibility of a) the premise and b) the pairing of an IA policeman and a member of the congress, as well as their slowness, the film felt good to me and was even surprisingly intriguing. I found my interest when the film moved back and forth between Fords and Thomas's life when they first came out, and in very different environments in very different ways with the death of their spouses and the subsequent revelation that they people were involved, others were involved. It could happen; two conjugal spouses of two people could be in the same plane, the plane could go down, the survivors could be brought together by the aftermath. What if it is unlikely? Improbable is not the same as far-fetched. So ... what if it happened? Why not speculate? <br /> <br /> The services of Ford and Thomas are credible and differentiated. Instead of finding their coupling implausible (opposite sides of the railways - give me a break), I felt driven by grief and betrayal that neither party knew how to handle. The script does not bring them together too soon or too easily, and the end of the film does not dissolve their relationship conventionally. I find it unsatisfactory if the dialogue raises interesting folds or insights into the personal and professional implications of the situation, but which apparently never goes far. And if you make the mistake of thinking too hard, Harrison Ford for the part seems to be about 10 years old. For five and a half dollars at Wal-Mart, with a detailed commentary and behind the scenes, the DVD is worth a visit. I do not think I would pay $ 20 for a bet, but my wife could do it. OK, ten ...
