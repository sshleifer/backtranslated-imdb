The reason why I discuss this again is that the previous report was written by someone who left this movie, not even half. Unfortunately for him he has missed a movie of tremendous beauty. I agreed that the movie was going to be very slow. The friend I was with fell asleep for a while. I woke him before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. Fortunately, the film evolved into a story of love, drugs, and how it was to be young and free in the experimental sixties. Fantastic performances from the two leads and a great look for the film, which gave it a real authentic feel. Be patient, as with many great movies it's worth the wait, and I'm definitely looking forward to a new movie! 8.10
