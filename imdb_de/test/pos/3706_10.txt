Mom should really be given a different title to distinguish him from any other movie in the title "Mom" or the word "Mom". <br /> <br /> This is a far superior zombie movie that offers so much garbage that keeps getting whirled up and all ends up almost as much as any other zombie movie out there. <br /> <br /> It's so different and refreshing that it almost defies categorization. <br /> <br /> The nice old lady who picks up a spooky lodger who happens to be a meat eater, who then infects the old lady, who also turns into a carnivorous zombie or ghoul, which is not well defined. <br /> <br /> There is a pathos in the story as her son realizes what she's become, and while initially appalled, she tries to help her by providing 'food'. (I'm not going to say that anymore for fear of inserting a spoiler!) It's one of those "quiet" movies as opposed to cannons, blasts, raging explosions, car chases, etc., and so many movies make the same garbage, but always still with enough bloody moments to satisfy horror fans, while at the same time adding sadness to the story, along with a touch of humor, as opposed to downright stupidities of some so-called "horror movies". <br /> <br /> There is a particularly beautiful atmospheric setting at the beginning of the film where the old lady sits alone in her room with her Christmas tree alone and looks so 'innocent', but what will she do !! Oh my! <br /> <br /> A gem of a movie and even if not your thing, should at least be viewed by a real horror fan.
