For those who are interested, I've managed to get this on DVD from Ebay (I have not gotten it yet - every day now). <br /> <br /> I was desperate to get this, even if it's a VHS quality on DVD does not bother me. If you are interested, contact me, and maybe I can help you. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it's ridiculous that I had to wait almost 7 years to see that again, but boy, it's worth it. <br /> <br /> All my colleagues are at work desperate to see it too. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'll post later on the quality. <br /> <br /> Just do a search on Ebay, if you want, guys. it is there to buy
