I saw the movie yesterday and really enjoyed it. Although there was some clue I could find after the second time, I could not wake up the Dow-Dawn case. Maybe that was my carelessness. The subconsciousness of a woman became concrete with the personalization. "Let me leave the key phrase of the film. Let me go from the deep inside of your brain, and we will both be free to film that pushes the boundaries of human consciousness and the brain. Anyone who has seen the "machinist" would recognize the similarities with dawn. A person who could not escape his conscience (again, a psychological and an abstract concept), meets this in humans and he will only be free from the acceptance and recognition that there is no way out. I would also like to mention about the performances of "Brking Dawn's stuff". Although she does not have much experience, actors and actresses, including directors, are shown separately, a decent performance that has created a synergy that enhances film quality
