I saw the movie for the first time a few years ago and was totally and absolutely impressed, but its sensuality. It's one of the most touching films I've ever seen, though it may seem a bit pretentious and artificial - too pretty, if you will. One thing is certain, however - the cameraman has done an excellent job - every picture deserves to be cut off and shown as a separate art peace, comparable to the images of Chirico or Bernard Buffet /> The music is a perfect background to the story, especially that of U2 played between the first and the second novel of the beach scene. As for the casting, I can not be objective because I like Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue very much and can not add the praising comments of others criticized the film and let me watch the film more critically for the second time. No doubt the scenery is great and the casting is great. However, this is not enough to create a comprehensive and coherent film. The second novel (when Sophie Marceau Malcovic tells her story is somehow superficial and does not say much about the motivation of those involved - was it just about making a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked Marceau or what?). Apparently, it does not add anything to the idea of ​​the movie, and even the hoarse voice of Malcovic is unable to link it to the main rendition. Other stories are more likely and really nice shot. which spoils many of the logical errors in them. The scene in which Jean Reneau surveys the city through the huge window of his apartment on the roof of the tall building is absolutely incredible. The feeling of damp air and fine haze that spreads from the first "Ferrera" scene can literally be felt through the screen. Antonioni is undoubtedly a great master of shadows and penumbra. My favorite novel is the last - the most romantic, profound and meaningful - I think it's the most Antonioni-like in the entire movie - almost a parable. Probably the positive overall impression of the film is mainly due to the recent one shot somewhere in a small Gothic Italian city with its winding narrow streets and winding sidewalks, fountains with the l'eau drinking water and the monumental cathedrals ... It was laconic, but very touching My impressions and comments on the film, even if they are chaotic, would motivate someone to spend an evening with (it works better with home theater, if someone is by your side than in the cinema). Have fun. <br /> <br /> Please forgive me for incomplete English and any spelling mistakes
