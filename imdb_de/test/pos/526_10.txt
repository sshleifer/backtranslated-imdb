Never before have I been as impressed by a movie as this little play about four groups of people in crisis or many. In a way a bit like short cuts, but at the same time completely different. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of lead characters that we all get to know very well when their stories unfold, and that's because with people showing their good and bad sides, their weaknesses and their strengths, that's a lot Drama and laughter. <br /> <br /> I can imagine the next equivalent in a US film, which is much weaker in every respect. Royal Tenenbaums in every respect. <br /> <br /> Four Shades of Brown tells the story in English, the story of a stressed hotelier and his wife, as well as his older parents (who are magicians on the road); about the receptionist at an animal crematorium and the failures of his family; fourthly, about the members of a cooking class (who mostly talk about their tolerable life) and fourthly about the funeral of a jogging jockey trying to orchestrate the family outside the grave by singing during the funeral and appearing in 3D as high-tech equipment, who have lost all his fortune (the family gets nothing, not even the famous horse is given to the family)! <br /> <br /> There is warmth and compassion in this film that is filled with grief and laughter that I've never experienced before. Most of the actors were new to me, except Robert Gustafsson and one or two others, but they all deserve the big slam the movie made in Guldbagge, Sweden, extravaganza (= the Swedish "Oscar" Awards) a week ago! <br /> <br /> Prizes for male, female and male supporting cast were included in this movie, plus a few more! <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, take a look at it - the hours go by quickly!
