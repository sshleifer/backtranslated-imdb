I was angry that Dick Tracy, the most awful movie with terrible makeup, received the best price for the make-up academy. The Nightbreed (based on the better "Cabal" novel) looks great, the acting is excellent and David Chroneburg is a really scary and terrific antagonist. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on Aaron Boone, who is recurring nightmares about a society of monsters that live under a graveyard. Does he find it or are they real and call him? His Pyschologe (Chroneburg) convinced him as a murderer, as a murderer of families. Worried and suicidal, Boone seeks refuge in Midian, but the monsters do not want him first. He is also persecuted by his friend Lori, who refuses to give him up, even after he dies and comes back cold and monstrous. <br /> <br /> But Decker does not let Boone go. He picks up the locals in a complete assault on Midian, like a holy war with the name of God being led by the devil. <br /> <br /> Barker's motives for misunderstood monsters may come from his experiences as a homosexual man, but they are always strong and honest. Nightbreed turns the genre upside down. The monsters just try to survive and want to be left alone, but the man chases them. <br /> <br /> A 20-minute cut was originally submitted by Barker, but the studio has hacked into this broken masterpiece. Barker finds it hard to find the missing footage for a director-cut release. Until then, this version must suffice.
