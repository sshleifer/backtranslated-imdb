Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean is at the forefront with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers, and other comedy greats. I have never seen people laugh so loud and literally fall out of their chairs as when I introduced them to my videos and now DVDs with Mr. Bean. I'll never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was visiting and I asked him if he had ever seen Mr. Bean. "Who?" he said. So I took out my video and showed him the one in which Mr. Bean is in church and starts to nod. My brother laughed so hard that he fell out of the chair and kept his stomach from laughing. He became an instant fan of Mr. Bean. We all know how strange these episodes are, but it's fun to share them with others. I have seen so many people laughing until it hurts! Favorite episodes are: the visit of the queen, the stay at the hotel, the appointment for the dentist, the Christmas episode (a classic ... plus children love it!) And the New Year party. Rowan Atkinson is a funny genius!
