Minor spoiler follow. <br /> <br /> This movie is even stranger and more unconventional than "second floor songs". There is no main character that we follow. There is no "action" in a conventional way. There is no emphasis on a happy ending. There is no crowdpleasing. In other words, Roy Andersson has returned with a vengeance. Instead of focusing on conventions and fixed formulas, Roy Andersson focuses on an idea. I will not go into what this idea is, but even if you do not "understand" it, I promise you will experience the greatest visual depth ever recorded in the film. The majestic scenes of "songs" fade here in comparison. A work of visual splendor. <br /> <br /> So be nice to your fellow human beings because "we are the living" and only you and I have the power to change our lives. At least that's what I thought when I saw the last scene in the movie. The inhumane bomber planes flew over the city in the movie to take our lives. <br /> <br /> And of course, do not forget to watch this movie if it has a limited release near you. This is one of the films that really has the power to make you a better person, like de Sica's "Bicycle Thieves". A very warm and humanistic film.
