Bedroom and Corridors was one of the funniest films of the 1999 Melbourne Film Festival. The UK is about a young crowd of roommates and their various relationship dilemmas. Much of the humor revolves around a support group for men of an age-related age, in which various instruments such as the "Rock of Truth" pass. They also go on a "hunter-gatherer" weekend with funny results. Trust me, you are laughing your teeth out.
