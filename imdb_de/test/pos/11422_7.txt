This comedy by Stan Laurel is a cute parody of the Valentino movie BLOOD AND SAND. If you've seen BLOOD AND SAND, you'll probably appreciate this movie and laugh at some scenes that mock the Valentino movie. However, if you have not seen this movie and just watch this movie, you probably will not be very impressed - although I liked the title cards really well, the word "bull" was used in a very funny way again and again. <Br/> <br/> Stanly plays with Vaselino a bullfighter who looks pretty weak and only wins because the bulls are lazy and not aggressive. Even the bull at the end of the film who allegedly killed ten men is obviously just a domesticated cop. <br /> <br /> No great movie in every way, but still a sweet and harmless movie.
