This was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon and the first cartoon with sound. It is based on a silent movie called "Steamboat Bill, Jr.". with Buster Keaton. Mickey neither spoke nor had gloves in this early Mickey short film. He could just whistle and make music. The song he played was "Turkey in the Straw" and used several animals as musical instruments. He plays as a xylophone the teeth of a cow and the teats of a nursing pig like an accordion keyboard. Captain Pete, however, is very crazy and lets Mickey peel potatoes in the galley. Peter's parrot flies to the window and tells him to peel the potatoes. Mickey throws the parrot a half-peeled potato, laughs and closes the cartoon. I was able to put this cartoon on tape and I like it very much. I think the Disney shorts are much better than the feature films.
