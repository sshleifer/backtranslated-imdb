Where should I start? Let me say, after watching the full movie and the peculiarities of the DVD, my wife and I watched the whole movie again while the director commentary was playing. I can not remember ever having experienced more than 7 minutes of such commentary on a movie. It is worth listening to. <br /> <br /> I am not a boy from the south, but I spent some time in Memphis some time ago and I have a feeling for the area. This movie almost smells to the south, it is so real. Samuel Jackson, one of my favorite actors of all time, is great as the emotionally crooked Lazarus, and Christina Ricci gives the performance of her life as Rae, a woman who was badly injured during her short life. I've always liked Ms. Ricci's work, but in this performance she puts 137% of herself on the screen every second. Awards and small statues are not enough to reward her for what she presents to the audience in this film. <br /> <br /> There are other places where you can read the essence of the story. That's why I only comment on the work. I had heard the name Justin Timberlake before seeing "BSM", but had no idea what he looked like or why he was famous. I'm 60 years old and I bang my head on the target audience, to say the least. After watching this movie, I will recognize it. He can act! He gives a substantial, credible performance as a loving soul mate to the County slut. <br /> <br /> The director is from Memphis and shows reverence for his home region. He is also a good storyteller. <br /> <br /> ..... and I MUST mention the music. I love blues, and the soundtrack for Black Snake Moan is a true blues fan-feast. <br /> <br /> I write less well than usual because my enthusiasm for this film overcomes my sentence structure. Watch this movie and I mean now.
