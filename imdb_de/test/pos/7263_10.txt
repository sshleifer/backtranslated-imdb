I usually hate period movies. Living in England at the moment is a nightmare if you have an allergy to period drama - which I do. This is the best, though. It's not serious and Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are great, Liv Tylers is good as well, though her English accent is dodgy. <br /> <br /> The movie has everything for someone who just wants to go to the cinema to enjoy themselves. It has action, adventure, drama and comedy. I'm not sure how well the jokes will go across the sea, but hopefully they'll make it. It would be a shame for the American public to miss this movie. It shows that English filmmakers can produce something that does not involve constant cursing and sex. Both are balanced in this format. Iain Robertson's camp portrait of the wealthy gentleman is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class are hilarious! <br /> <br /> As a trailer for "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is wanted to say .... "If you see another movie" .... this spring Plunkett and Macleane do it. It was fun, Actionlurve and of course Jonny Lee Miller with an English accent for a change!
