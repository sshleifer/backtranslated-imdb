It often happens that a Hollywood movie impresses a young person. Not only does it take a lifetime, it also inspires him to study ancient cultures as a career. This was the case with the film from 1954 titled "The Egyptian". The audience was impressed by the sets, the costumes and the great spectacle of this film, so soon other films followed in vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who became fewer parents after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it's not hard to wonder why he's going to spend his life asking questions. The boy Sinuhe (Sin-oh-way), who means "He is alone" (Edmund Purdom), becomes male and continues to ask the reason, even though he graduated from the School of Life to become a doctor. During his founding years, he buys a lifelong friend named Kaptah, who is brilliantly played by (Peter Ustinov) and Horemheb (Victor Mature), who rises from a plain officer of the Guards to commander of the armies. His life offers everything from a quick rise in social status to condemned criminals, outcasts, a miraculous healer, to a station in life he would never have expected. Fine acting goes to Jean Simmons as merit, Michael Wilding as Akhnaton, Bella Darvi as seductress, Nefer and John Carradine as a memorable Grave robber. Tommy Rettig, plays Thoth, son of the Egyptian. In his last years, "He's Alone," he finally discovers the answer he had sought all his life to leave to his son, now in the care of his lifelong friend. Excellent movie! ****
