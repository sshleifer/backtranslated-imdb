This movie is a variation of a theme that we have all seen time and again - the Posiedan adventure in space. The characters are all serial characters - vivacious heroine, Judas, coward, etc. The only question is who's next. Sometimes this proven formula works - as in this case - but more often than the truly insane "red planet". <br /> <br /> Why is this working? Because it is stylish. The action is above average. And above all, it is unpredictable. The conclusion is not signed. I really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised how it would end. That alone deserves top marks in my book. <br /> <br /> It's a fascinating and entertaining movie. And although it would never change the face of cinema as we know it, it does not disappoint.
