This year I was very happy to have seen several films in the art museum of my university. Sometimes, more or less in half, I can not see the movies there. I systematically tried to watch every movie I missed. So far, plagues and pleasures on the Sea of ​​Salt and who killed the electric car? are the other films that I had to see this way. The film deals with a fascinating subject and is well theorized (emphasis later), but not as successful as Plagues and Pleasures, but far superior to the electric car. <br /> <br /> The thesis of the film deals with the future of the American concept of suburban life. It questions the feasibility of such a practice when the price of oil rises. The film thus discusses the origin of the suburb and its development until the early 2000s. One theme the film discusses in detail is the alienation that the suburb creates among its inhabitants. While several people live together, they do not "know each other" when we define the word. For me, this is the film's strong point: its appeal to actual human emotions. We can understand the filmmakers' argument so much easier because they do not have to convince us of the legitimacy of their argument. This is also one of the reasons why Salton Sea is such a wonderful documentary. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Suburbia is losing its message in the brand statement in support of its key argument. While the interviewees speak, their arguments are increasingly becoming those of militant environmentalists. We are told that oil production will peak this decade, but no scientific evidence (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc.) will be provided to support this claim. We receive little information about how this date was calculated. Fortunately, this was the only serious mistake I could make in the film's argument, but it's still a blatant one. Another less important discrepancy I noticed was the liberal (political) bias that could polarize some viewers. However, this trend shows detailed clips of various events, not the filmmakers. The clips, especially those from the fifties, seemed a bit unnecessary to me. The film was no better with her presence and would have been more succinct in his absence. <br /> <br /> When I was thinking more about this movie before writing this review, I wondered why I found his argument more convincing than other documentaries I had recently viewed. Finally, I realized that the filmmakers were indeed offering an analysis of the suburban problem. They propose a decentralized village system in which pockets of people would live together. They think this practice will reduce the need for fossil fuels and reduce space requirements. They define wasted space as the long parking areas between shopping areas. The unbelievable thing about this assumption is that it is actually conceivable. Most documentation vaguely claims that a problem should be solved, but it does not provide a method for doing so. When I think more about the movie, I decided that this analysis saved the movie for me and why I rate it positively. <br /> <br /> While the End of Suburbia is not perfectly convincing or fluid in the presentation, it's a worthwhile investment of its time. It not only deals with the current problem of urban sprawl, but also provides realistic insights into their change. The public can also enjoy the high production value with various clips from the 1950s, which are associated with the modern Arguers. People living in Atlanta, Georgia, or the Triad region of North Carolina will particularly enjoy this documentation because urban sprawl is the most prevalent there.
