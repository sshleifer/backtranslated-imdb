SPOILER <br /> <br /> As you may know, I have commented on many silent short films in recent months. Well, I have no idea why I comment on Steamboat Willie. I guess I just wanted to comment something, so I looked at it and now I comment on it. This is one of the first cartoons, of course, and I think it's not the first cartoon with sound. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot. Mickey Mouse drives a steam boat as Pete drops him and he drives. As they stopped for the cargo, Minnie Mouse tried to move on, failing miserably. Mickey picks her up by a crane. Then a goat eats her piece of paper with the turkey in the straw. They use the goat to make the song. When I say that, I mean that they used the goat as Victrola. Mickey plays the animals on the steamboat for instruments to the song. Then an angry Pete throws Mickey into a potato room and Mickey has to peel potatoes for the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is another groundbreaking silent movie. I mean, that's the third Mickey Mouse cartoon. Yes the third. This is not the first cartoon with sound. I think there were two more before that. In any case, this movie is really groundbreaking. Mikcey was also more violent than he mows. I mean, he throws a potato at a bird and maybe slaughtered him brutally. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Recommended Movies: Plane Crazy.
