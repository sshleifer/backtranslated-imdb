This is a cute little movie that does pretty much what it promises - great entertainment. After all, if a movie announces that it offers top SASS shooters, you'll find that it's not a likely candidate for the Best Picture Oscar. These guys are shooters, not actors. Her next clue is that the movie does not play Nicholas Cage or Jennifer Aniston, d. H. You should not expect to see the current hottest names. It was just an old entertainment program and in that sense it's just as good as many of the old "Oaters" I've seen over the years. <br /> <br /> How to get "Hell to Pay"? You get 100 minutes of good old entertainment. You have the chance to see some stars from the past few years who behave the way they did in their prime, but a bit older. You will see some good SASS shooters in important roles and some SASS ham in the background. It was great fun seeing people I shot with and visiting at home, and who are my good friends, can do something that many people only dream about - they live really honest gosh movie. They do so many wannabe actors, and would-be shooters will never get the chance, and I think that alone makes it worth watching. Admittedly, not everyone is a SASS member and I, too, have seen a lot of fun and humor that others might miss, but it's still a good, old-fashioned conversation, and frankly, there is Cinema a lot of movies I can not imagine. Check out "Brokeback Mountain" to get "Hell to Pay" and see how some real cowboys have fun.
