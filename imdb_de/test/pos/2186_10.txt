I've seen this piece on showtime a few years ago from home, and when the last note was hit, I wanted to jump off the sofa and give the production a standing ovation. As it was, I shed a tear that there were so many fantastic performances and songs. For my birthday, my kids bought the VHS version and the CD of the play with Len Cariou in the Sweeny Todd role. <br /> <br /> I have shared the piece with many ... some find the subject a bit sick, but no one has anything but praise for the songs. <br /> <br /> I've always loved the interplay in songs with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn, and Hearn and Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin. <br /> <br /> I have to own the DVD.
