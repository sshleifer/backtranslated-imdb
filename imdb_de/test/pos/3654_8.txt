I saw this movie at the Seattle International Film Festival in a packed house of avid film fans and Indian ex-jabs. The movie is amazingly beautiful and flowing for a first movie. The direction is self-confident, especially among locals who were spontaneously recruited for extras and parts. While the plot and storyline are elemental to non-existent, the enjoyment of the performances and the scenery compensates for the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big draw for lovers of world music. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days a day in another place, look at Hari Om for inspiration. It was not posted in the questions and answers, but I imagine Hollywood could learn a lesson in budget filming when he learns from this director.
