What you bring to the film influences your point of view. I've been in the Air Force for 30 years, and every time I see it, I'm touched to the end. Would a 15-year-old boy who has spent his life flying in jets feel the same way? But I can only affect him. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart makes a wonderful turn as - Jimmy Stewart. Considering that he was a pilot and a General of the Air Force Reserve, he's probably almost an expert on how a pilot would behave as a living man. You can not fault his delivery or his acting. He is a pilot who is a pilot, that's enough. <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler --- <br /> <br /> It's the last minutes of the movie that keep touching my heart. Lindbergh flies without radio and has no idea if anyone ever expected him. If he flies to the Paris airport, it attracts the uncertainty of the landing field. What is that down? The moving circles, which look like cobblestones or cornfields, must ask you if he is in the right place. They go on and on, pouring past his vision until he gets deep enough, and see that on the night of Paris he saw the light of the city that was in the upturned faces of the THOUSAND men waiting to land.
