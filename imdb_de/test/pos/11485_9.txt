Do not hate Heather Graham because she is beautiful, hate her because it's fun to watch in this movie. Like the hip clothes and the cool environment, the actors work well together in this movie. Casey Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally illuminates the screen. The minor characters - Goran Visnjic {sigh} and Patricia Velazquez are just as talented as they are beautiful. Congratulations Miramax & Director Lisa Krueger!
