This is an excellent documentary about a story of which I had not heard before. The first solo nonstop sailing race around the world took place in 1968-69 and involved a handful of racers. It's a truly fascinating story about man versus nature and man against himself. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure in this story. The film elegantly combines interviews with footage taken by sailors aboard their boats. The story is very exciting and sad as we learn the details behind the story of Donald Crowhurst. This is one of the best documentary films of recent years. It has real human feelings as men face this almost impossible task of steering the world alone without interruption.
