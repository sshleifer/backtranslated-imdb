Wonderful family movie that should be a must at Christmas time. It is a mystery to me why it is not so. A real lost movie that I met for the first time. It flickered on my old 19-inch black and white RCA when the Million Dollar Movie on Channel 9 in New York City was still in vogue. This fantasy led by Rudolph Mate should be under every Christmas tree. But it has never been released on a home video. A pity, I think I saw a part of it on AMC a couple of years ago, before they cut many of their older films out of rotation. TCM should fill the gap and play it Easter or Christmas Eve: any movie with Santa, Aunt Bee, the Hostess Cupcake Lady and an actor by the name of King can not be bad. Ann Blyth as "Sally" is a bunch of energy. During her schooldays, she rushes over to the chapel to pray that St. Ann helps to guide her jumbled and financially troubled family, and it works. After graduating, she places a statue of St. Ann in her own bedroom. Once, O'Moyne's entire home is relocated to another address, and I think this was done to end an adjacent dispute between O'Moynes and the insidious fellow next door. Blyth is cute as a button. Edmund Gwen can play the retired grandfather in his sleep. All in all, this is a satisfying movie experience.
