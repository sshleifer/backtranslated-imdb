Who said that it has to be credible? Do yourself a favor and switch off your ration before you sit down to watch this movie. You will enjoy the experience much more. You'll find that you forgive some of the film's most unusual plot settings and accept it for what it is - a great family movie. I really appreciated that I did not even have to worry about "questionable elements" in a children's movie. That's worth the price of the ticket for me. And he manages to maintain his naturalness without realizing it - older children will enjoy this movie. Enough good humor to interest adults. Very good movie.
