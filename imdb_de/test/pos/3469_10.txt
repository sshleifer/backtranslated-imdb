Until I saw this movie, "Life is beautiful" was my favorite movie of all time. This movie is everything that should be a great movie. Great script, unsurpassed acting and directing that neither approaches nor leaves behind the sentimentalism the subject seeks, without the emotional impact it demands. This film contains the taste that could not come from Hollywood, and lacks the preference that would come from France. A wonderful movie even over the caliber I expected when I see the handmade movie logo. I do not have to go into detail because the previous posts cover everything why this movie needs to be seen by everyone on this planet.
