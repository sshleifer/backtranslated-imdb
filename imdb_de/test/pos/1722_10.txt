I love Dr, that so much! I think David Tennant is the best dr the show has ever had and Billie Piper the best companion! I liked the way Dr and Rose had such a relationship and a great relationship, and the Dr came several times to express his love for Rose. It unfortunately ended after only two seasons. I will miss to see bunch of roses and think the show without Rose will not be the same! But David is still there to make me laugh and to see me happy as he plays this fantastic role! I rate this show at 110%, it's fantastic! The graphics and monsters on this show are wonderful and each story is different but a bit interrelated, and I actually learned something about love, the world and relationships from this show. That's why it has to be one of the most fantastic shows ever!
