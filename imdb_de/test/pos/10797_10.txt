In one of the less-watched films of the late 1980s, when Oliver Stone rode up with Platoon and Wall Street (and before his Opus Born on July 4), he played that look and directed the world of radio, specifically a radio host in the middle in Texas. This man is Barry Champlain, who once came in his career from Eric Bogosian, who wrote the original play and also co-wrote the script. Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those experts you hear on the radio stations that may shut down many of us. He has ideas, opinions, and not only is he not afraid to say it, but also to defend himself against the callers. The callers are indeed the driving force in the film, as Barry must fight the mindless, obscene, racist and absent-minded people. Later, he also has to deal with his boss (Alec Baldwin) and a hit-or-miss deal to head across the country to the southern station station where he is located. <br /> <br /> movie I was curious what it would look like on stage (I imagine it was a one man show as Bogosian had several on the side), which is the direction of the movie phenomenal. Stone is known almost as a typography, as a director who loves fast cuts, the boundless effects of montage and the effects of camera work and other little tricks that give his films a distinctive, almost authentic look in the 90s. But in the 80's he had that energy and fever quality for the look of the movie and was not as mad as the other movies. To add the right intensity to the studio and headroom of Barry Champlain, he and DP Robert Richardson sometimes make the room look claustrophobic, pithy, insecure and definitely nervous. The scenes in the middle of the film where Barry is not in the studio are pretty much normal, but the style and substance in the radio scenes are among the best I've seen from the Stone / Richardson combination /> <br / > And you can not misjudge the performance of Bogosian. It can be repugnant, offensive, angry, passive and anything we love and hate in radio show hosts. There is also a fun, almost distracting supporting role for Michael Wincott as Kent / Michael / Joe, who calls him one evening, and the next one is invited to the studio. These scenes are a bit uncomfortable for a viewer, but they are very much in the subculture of the 80s, for which Barry is as fascinated as he criticizes. The stoner can not "understand" it but as he says to him, "it's your show". It is indeed hard to handle everything that goes on in the conversation, and there is a lot of that. But it's never boring and like Champlain itself it's not easy to ignore. And when Bogosian airs in its climatic tirade and the background pans in a continuous 360-degree spin, it becomes intoxicating and a reason why freedom of expression is so powerful. Stone has also been synonymous with A Hot Button Themes Filmmaker, which deals with issues that have been controversial or controversial, giving them a life force that is not always great, but is its own. Here, Bogosian's abilities and ambitions are not in the way - it's an increase, if any, which makes a very skilful vision of an essentially close one-man show that's already well-written in and of itself.
