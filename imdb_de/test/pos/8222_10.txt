This adaptation for television was a wonderful way for Bill Irwin to show his ability to show physical humor. Against the background of a fight between an actor and his writer / director, Bill's clownish antics reveal a variety of abilities, including hat-tricks, pantomime, dance, and various physical devices. <br /> <br /> Although it's a big hit on the entertainment industry and its craft, it's of interest to people of all ages and ages. <br /> <br /> This work has been televised as a PBS special. Bill did a piece of it on the Tonight Show, but out of context it did not turn out well.
