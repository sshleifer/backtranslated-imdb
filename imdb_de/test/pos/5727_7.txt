OK. Overall, this three-part documentary will bring most interested parties up to date with the world of physics and the last 300 years of the discovery of our universe. If you've read and understood Stephen Hawking's brilliant book, "A Brief History of Time," you could benefit from the visual description of certain concepts I've done to some degree. Greene is bearable, but to explain to the masses, he tends to explain things in a light, patronizing way. This, of course, is intentional and will be perfect for almost anyone watching this series. The visiting scientists were good. (no Hawking, but I suppose he has his own DVD (s)) I have always waited for him to appear, but they are shooting for almost 3 parts through the same ...) I bought the Nova 2 Disc Edition (NTSC) and there were some inclusions that really affected the overall experience. <br /> <br /> 1. The "This is brought to you by .." at the beginning of EACH part was a necessary evil for the first part, but it was very common to see it two more times before it was over. <br /> <br /> 2. I can not help, I suppose, but there are some overlaps at the beginning of 2 and 3 where I had to grab the FFW button several times. <br /> <br /> 3. This CD set was straight from the TV .. (ie showing what last show for those who missed it, and frequent "goto pbs.org for more ...") that appear throughout the presentation. (Unlike the BBC material, which is second to none for presentations, Planet, The Blue Planet, etc.) My 7/10 is based solely on the content. The Niggles were there, but I overcame them. If this was done with this classic British presenter (you know the one), I think that would be a perfect disc set. <br /> <br /> If you've seen this and want more ... then I highly recommend Hawking's book "A Brief History of Time" ... I wish it was a movie as well. <br /> <br /> Have fun watching.
