I think Never Been Kissed was a totally awesome movie. The casting was really good and they worked very well. I really like Drew Barrymore and of course it was excellent for me. At first I was scared because it said it does not appear on video. Boy, I'm glad it's an incredibly cool movie. Look at it, if you do not have it yet!
