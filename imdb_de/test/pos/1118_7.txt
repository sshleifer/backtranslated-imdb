Walter Matthau can always improve a mediocre film, and this film proves it. He is a very realistic performer as a small horse trainer and a single father who plays no part. <br /> <br /> He can be alternately soft-hearted and spotty, then with iron hands to his boys, and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training (we see he does not want his young prospect horse at small race is overworked and injured, but he seems to be ready to risk the horse's life when he comes in the big time). <br /> <br /> This is just one of Matthaus's wonderful ideas, which I highly recommend.
