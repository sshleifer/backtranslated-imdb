The cell is weak on the plot, filled with holes and looks pretty lousy. but none of that matters because director Tarsem Singh gave us one of the most impressive films ever. The whole plot is just an excuse to freak Tarsem and kidnap you into the heads of a serial killer, giving the audience some shocking, enjoyable, stunning and stunning pictures. This beautiful movie will take a long time to come. This film is a perfect case for the "suspension of unbelief". Forget the stupid plot, just let your senses be overwhelmed with the pictures. and J.Lo looks stunning enough to complement the rest of Tarsem's work. The cinematography is staggering, the music is haunting and the costumes are simply mind-blowing. <br /> <br /> The movie is less a movie than a work of art. It's just that the medium is no longer a canvas, but the big screen and the celluloid. one of the most refreshing films of this decade. The cell is a must. A bold new step in film production. <br /> <br /> a gripping 8 !!
