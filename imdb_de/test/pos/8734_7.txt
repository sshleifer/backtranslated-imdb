When I saw LAUREN BACALL CACTUS FLOWER play on Broadway, I never dreamed that one day I would see an actress like INGRID BERGMAN in the role of Bacall on the screen. But here, Ingrid really does make some good comedies, while the dentist pretending to be WALTER MATTHAU's wife, so she can continue with the joke he said GOLDIE HAWN From start to finish, good-humored stuff, that during never runs dry humor and jokes throughout his term. There are many one-liners or gags that are far beyond the usual situations you hear on TV - the lines sound true because they fuse so well with the characters and their motives. <br /> <br /> Like a girl contemplating committing suicide over her unfortunate affair with Matthau, GOLDIE HAWN (fresh from her days as a star in "Laugh In" of television) makes a stupid blonde Role to perfection. It's easy to see why she won the Oscar for the supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Ingrid surprisingly takes on a rare comedy role, though sometimes she seems a bit too matronical for the role. In any case, she is a surprising choice for the nurse who does a freeze act in the office but is considerably warmer outside of duty. As Goldie's neighbor, Igor, Rick Lenz speaks admirably. and suits her in this final scene. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays the kind of character that became his trade in all the Neil Simon roles he had - a lovable kad that catches his own disorder when he lies told for a lie. It's the kind of weird comedy that makes you laugh aloud at some of Abe Burrows' and IAL's amusing lines. Diamond has managed to shoot together based on a French farce.
