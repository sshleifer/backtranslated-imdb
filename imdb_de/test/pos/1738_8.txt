I've never seen Doctor Who (at least not focused), so I was new to the concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. It's weird (it should really say "comedy" in the genre description as well, many plot changes are acceptable only for their comedic value), it's well written and it's economical in its budget. The human dimension is very strong and captivating, which is very rare in current TV programs. <br /> <br /> I have seen the first eight episodes and # 6-8 have been my favorites so far. Even types of stories that can easily be screwed up (through time travel, saving the dead parents, and stuff like that) are surprisingly well received. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is delighted to see her the witty and carefree, though occasionally morose Doctor - if she can find a good substitute for him, I'll be pretty surprised. But I'm ready to give the new man a chance. However, there is no doubt that the Eccleston episodes will go down in history as classics. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Doctor and Rose is especially refreshing. The Doc is more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest, yet there are allusions to romantic allusions between them that are much more emotional and more human than sexual. <br /> <br /> A good show. The biggest downside is the low budget - such a show should have better special effects. And why they do not just use cheaper effects, I do not know. SFX does not have to cost a package today - just watch the Star Wars: Revelations fan movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
