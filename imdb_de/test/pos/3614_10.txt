A beautiful, sensitive film that brings the futility and cruelty of wars home regardless of the so-called reasons. The performance of Cage and Cruz was pretty impressive, but it's the older Greek characters that receive the highest praise. Irene Papas is as beautiful as ever! Although some scenes sometimes seem a bit long, this film will be a heavy Oscar contender.
