If you liked Paddy Chayevsky's "Network," you probably also like this black comedy, because it's another brilliant Chayevsky script, a wonderful satire about city hospitals, and a perfect vehicle for geo. C. Scott. He plays a burned-out medical chief on the most chaotic day he or his hospital has ever seen. His personal crisis is escalating, and his hospital is falling around him as residents demonstrate against the hospital and patients and doctors die at an alarming pace thanks to a biblically-inspired and murderous saboteur. The latter, who theatrically declares himself to be the "Fool for Christ", "Parakleet of Kaborka", "Wrath of the Lamb" and "Angel of the Bottomless Pit", lifts doctors upside down, delivers lethal injections and exchanges patient identities Treatments and surgeries performed on the wrong persons. <br /> <br /> This film is uncomfortable for you, because deadly mistakes like these happen (hopefully not so many, not so often and not in one place) and at the same time you laugh at the priceless character portraits. One is Richard Dysart ("L.A. Law") as Dr. Wellbeck, a sort of prominent surgeon who is much more worried about his investments and publicly traded stocks than about his patients who are fatally suffering from his great indifference and neglect. Diana Rigg is the free-spirited hippie Barbara Drummond who seduces the beleaguered Chief of Medicine (Scott) and tries to get him to run away with her. Then there's the deceived murderer, who happened to be Barbara's father and who works "well enough" in the Indian reservation, where he lives with his daughter and even runs a clinic, which is only driven insane by the reintegration into civilization , By far the strongest portrait is Scott's Dr. Bock exposing his soul as a former boy genius, failed father and husband, brilliant physician and responsible steward who is constantly dreaming of suicide but must live up to the demands of his job. Scott is extraordinary in this demanding role. <br /> <br /> Until the final scenes, you do not know if Bock will leave the hospital for Barbara's reserve and live a quieter, easier life, whether his murderous father will be caught or if the protesting insurgent locals will bring the hospital to its knees force it. Watching the crazy murderer at work, it is believed that Chayevsky tells us that our crazy society forces him to do these things because we are told that he is a different person than cities and people. <br /> <br /> Like my own father It has been, as chief administrator of a number of large hospitals over the years, an idea of ​​the demands of his job and his great responsibility. This story makes this responsibility the linchpin of Scott's crisis. This is both a funny and a frightening movie in which the actors fulfill the significant requirements of Chayevsky's script. It's also a movie that I get more out of when I see it.
