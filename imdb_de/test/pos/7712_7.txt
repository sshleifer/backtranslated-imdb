This is one of the stories from the periphery told by the Animatrix, which is not directly relevant to the war stoppage. A glorifying plot of the movies, but Trinity, voiced by Carrie, appears in it. It's a private detective who gets hired for a lot of money to look for a hacker named Trinity. We see his search, which contains other PIs, just one he meets, who seems to have gone crazy trying to track down Trinity. Finally, he makes contact with Trinity, whom he assumes is a man - narrated in the narrative and something that, despite everything we already know, tells us in his own perspective - in a hacker chat room and solves a puzzle that forces him to hurry to catch a train. He forgets his hat, but his faithful cat throws it at him in a moment of ridicule that is so absurd that it's weird. <br /> <br /> he meets them on the train, but the list becomes visible when agents attack; The agents used him to get to Trinity, and Trinity tried to free the PIs sent to her, which of course he does not know and which is not specifically stated in the animation itself. They often have many interesting background stories, subplots, developments, etc However, they do not show more than the core story and a limited viewpoint to create an additional impression of riddles and intrigues. <br /> <br /> Almost everything in this short is in black and white, the music is reminiscent of film noir and the unconventional, old-fashioned but engaging detective is the perfect protagonist for a film noir title. The trivia section of the title of this title on IMDb also contains some clues that this title relies on hard-boiled literature, from which it also borrowed a lot, a genre of mysteries for detectives, gangsters, etc., that quickly and often challenge conflicts. In keeping with the Studio 4 Â° C animated and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, it is a pleasing variant of the usual Matrix story.
