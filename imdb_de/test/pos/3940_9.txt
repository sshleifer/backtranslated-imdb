Exclusively for coop lovers, although Clint Eastwood is a very strong but unobtrusive presence, one big advantage of this very good documentary is that. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on private archives that show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man with some friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc.). ), as an elderly man, finally as a sick and deadly man. After "the end" I did not feel that I knew the man better. But I spent a very good moment and reviewed many of the best moments of his films. and my respect for the very talented actor and great professional has increased tenfold. The film most interestingly shows how Cooper's career may parallel the development of American society before and after World War II. Two of the great moments are the times when Cooper has to answer justice to communism in the film world. and when James Stewart (also a very big one) received a Cooper award a month before his death. I'm not a wine pot, but ... that was close! Look at it, if you can: It's worth it so much. ... If you love Cooper, that's the way it is. Or an older America ...
