Where this film is faithful to the vision of Burroughs, it is superb. Where it differs from Burroughs, it is outstanding. It's a story about the family, about finding a father through a real and emotional orphan. Lambert speaks of one of the most embarrassing lines in the whole cinema "He was my father!" is enough to bring tears to the most cynical critic. Not a perfect movie - Glenn Close's infamous overdubbing of McDowell's voice is unscrupulous and can only be explained in terms of a very British mistake - but a fine, if flawed, masterpiece and a noble farewell to Sir Ralph Richardson.
