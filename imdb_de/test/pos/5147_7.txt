This surrealist, absurdist film is the first film I've seen from Swedish cult director Roy Andersson. He is a seasoned filmmaker who made his livelihood on commercials and shot only four feature films in the last forty years. This background shows: The film looks like a collection of 52-minute artistic commercials. There is no story linking these vignettes, though some characters appear in more than one vignette (but there is one theme among them: the absurdity of modern life). Some behaviors of the movie (the actors appear in bright, white make-up) are more irritating than enlightening. Some of the skits are very small (a man who is not sure in which snake he should stand). Other skits are better. Best of all, the one about the rock chick dreaming that she's going on a honeymoon with her rock guitarist bride, in a house that's a little like a train (you have to watch it to get it). A film worth seeing, though comparisons made by some movie critics with such great filmmakers as Keaton, Tati and Kaurismaki are exaggerated: Andersson lacks the vision of them and the lack of a story linking the vignettes is fatal for the film's claim to be a film masterpiece.
