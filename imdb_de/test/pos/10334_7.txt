I have not seen this movie for 30 years, so I do not know if I like the movie the way I did when I was 12 years old. At the time, however, I loved this movie. This is a great "starter-chick-flick" for young girls. But be careful with the end. There are tears and hard emotions. <br /> <br /> If you look at it from a 2008 perspective (with so much more knowledge about child psychology, politics and political correctness), I think it would be interesting to see it again. Patty's callous, abusive father, indifferent mother and favorite sister all contributed to her becoming vulnerable and hungry for camaraderie. Patty was sad when Anton left. She had a broken heart when he was killed. The anger that followed was shocking. After all, she was only 12 years old. <br /> <br /> What I have most strongly stated, as I learned in this film, is that "enemy" soldiers are also human. Not all German soldiers were hateful Nazis. When I was older, I saw television programs like Hogan's Heroes and The Rat Patrol, in which even the "regular" German soldiers were not identical to those of the Gestapo. <br /> <br /> "Regular" soldiers were drafted. The Gestapo was hand-picked by volunteers for their special attitude of hatred. I believe that one of the privileges of a Nazi was that they had special tasks and therefore did not go to battle. Her specialties were interrogation and torture. Later, during the Cold War, I reflected on Russian soldiers and remembered SOMGS. We have learned that the Soviet Union is "evil". But the reality was that Russian soldiers did not want to destroy America. They had a job. Your government has probably told you that our government wants to destroy their way of life. Which was true in a sense since the US fought to end communism. The lesson is still applicable today. German soldiers were not like Nazis, nor were Muslims like Al Qaeda.
