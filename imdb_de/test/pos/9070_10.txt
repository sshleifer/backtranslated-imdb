I'm usually wary of movies that hover around the 6/10 mark of IMDb. I would like to believe that people know what they are talking about and what they like. I think the trick in reviewing is getting closer to "Hey, if I like movie types like these - I'd give it a higher score than I'll give now, because I do not like those types of films." Then people judge differently and put more emphasis on acting or maybe history or directing. Anyway, landing the plane here - I had borrowed this movie before and did not have time to look at it. I did that this morning. <br /> <br /> Wow! Watch this movie. I am personally interested in the paranormal / have read about near-death experiences, so I was automatically addicted. I'm not sure if some commentators said quality was wasted - I disagree - acting was great - I think that's the only time I did not mind Julia Roberts Kiefer Sutherland (At the time of this review, he served a jail sentence for DUI) and Kevin Bacon with an interesting hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Overall, the direction, the atmosphere, the acting and the story, especially the idea of ​​karma, and, to quote Nelson Wright, "What we do is important to me" , So true. <br /> <br /> 10/10!
