In "The Squire of Gothos," Kirk and his crew encounter a powerful superman who captures the captain, "bones," and some crew members for no apparent reason. I could be wrong, but I think this is the first Star Trek episode I've ever seen and the program that made me hungrier. It's not one of the best episodes, but the rock-solid premise of an alien being that puts the Enterprise crew in a corner is a situation that the show enjoys so much. In a sense, the superhumanoid awaits one of Star Trek's most famous characters, the enigmatic "Q" of Next Generation. This episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation: Uhura is the first time it's part of the action, and the story allows the viewer to see what a lovable Uhuara figure can be if history allows it. Too bad the show has never fully explored this iconic figure.
