I have to admit that I might have missed tiny moments when I was not paying enough attention, but I've had enough of the story to agree that it's a great family movie by director Lionel Jefferies, Grandpa Potts at Chitty Chitty Bang Bang played. It basically starts with a happy upper middle class family living in Victorian London. One night, the father (Iain Cuthbertson) is visited by two strangers, he goes with them and does not return. They move into a cottage in the country and here the children; Bobbie (Jenny Agutter, whom I first saw in Child's Play 2), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) keep the mood up, with their fascination for the nearby railroad. Every day, they wave the passengers in the passing trains faithfully and avoid with courage and vigilance an accident and become heroes. Her kindness makes her friends, including important people who can help find the secret of her missing father. Also with Dinah Sheridan as Mother / Mrs. Waterbury, Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perks, William Mervyn as an old gentleman, Peter Bromilow as Doctor Forrest, Ann Lancaster as Ruth and Gordon Whiting as Russian. It was number 29 of the 100 Greatest Family Films and number 24 of the 50 Greatest British Films. Very well!
