I tell you, though it's funny how many swear words are in this one. I'm sure the number of bad words and swear words in this area would probably count up to 200, because of what I've heard last, there are the largest number of dirty words on this page. A South Park episode has 165 counts the word s ** t, but apart from that, it's so funny because it shoots swear words and pedophiles in the head. Watch out for your own survival and watch out for Cartman's father, and also the annoying voice of Chris Hanssseeeen and Kyle must save Cartman from pedophiles (the predator show is also on the date line) and they feel a peado and when they get there arrived, the Peado "shot himself"
