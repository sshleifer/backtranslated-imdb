I have a DVD at 1 ?? Discount, no idea what it's about (but at this price I can not resist ..) In short: I was positively surprised. On the German DVD (Part 2 of a Series of 3), episodes were recombined into two 85-minute segments and decommissioned. Here are my results, based on Wikipedia's episode list: <br /> <br /> "Doomsday" is In My Boots + The Voice (last episode). <br /> <br /> "War of the Machines" is Hel & High Water (1, 2) + Pod Listener + Juggernaut Down. <br /> <br /> Well, what should I say. Women with underdress are of course interesting for older men. I've never seen Charlie's Angels so often, so I can not compare, but the more I watched, the less I looked for bikini tops and their fillings. Instead, the characters (both m and f) became more interesting. I can imagine that even feminists have their fun. All in all, perhaps a guilty pleasure, but it was a pleasure: ^)
