I loved it, it was really cruel and disgusting. I thought the ripping of the human flesh was quite provocative. The way the human crucifix was portrayed over Jesus Christ was really interesting. The tearing of limbs and jaws was incredibly brutally horrible. Do not look at it, if you have a weak heart, you could not stand it.
