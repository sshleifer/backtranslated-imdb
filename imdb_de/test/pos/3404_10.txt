I saw this movie when I was much younger, but it captured me. I loved the relationship between Orry and George so much. I was so excited about the love story of Orry and Madenline. I'm a hopeless romantic so it really appealed to me. I especially liked it when he met her for the first time. I just wish he had more time with her and her baby. So you know in book three that I was so hurt he died. I did not really understand that because they had little time. I loved Patrick in this movie. I just bought all three books together and can not stop looking at them. My 12-year-old son is stuck. He likes the fighting in the war. I cry every time. I wish I could meet Patrick and Madeline in person! It was a wonderful movie and a good cast!
