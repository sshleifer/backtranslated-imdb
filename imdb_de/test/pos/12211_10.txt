I want when they bring the surface back. I really enjoyed the show together with my family. I found that the development of the plot and the plot were first-rate. As the other has said, everything seems to be reduced to the lowest common denominator. Nothing but sober, politically correct junk survives. Just check the internet for how many people saw the show. It's also not nice to leave it to us what happens to the characters in the series. This is the same thing that happened with the time travel show, which I believe was called 8 days, but should have been called Backstep. Did the Olympics kill the surface? I know that the writer strike killed another of my favorite shows, which was the biggest American hero years ago.
