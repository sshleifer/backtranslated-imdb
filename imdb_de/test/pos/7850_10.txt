This movie has some pretty shocking scenes and themes, considering it was made in 1971. Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page, and Elizabeth Hartman do a great job in the film, as do all the performers. The film begins during the Civil War and begins when the wounded Yankee soldier Johnny portrayed by Clint Eastwood receives shelter and assistance at a girls' academy in the South. <br /> <br /> The headmistress of the school, Ms. Farnsworth (Geraldine Page), a teacher Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), and a small group of half-grown girls may have been a little too long without a man in their midst. <Br /> <br /> While their loyalty lay with the Confederacy, their emotions and physical needs definitely lead them in the opposite direction. Johnny immediately uses his masculine charms to try to pull the women on his side - and prevent them from leaving him to patrol. a brutal rape and youthful inexperience combined with jealousy - with some unexpected consequences turned upside down for both Johnny and the school's residents. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
