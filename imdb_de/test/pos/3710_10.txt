Although this was a movie of less than forty minutes, it is one of the best directorial and dramatic stories I have ever seen. In less than 45 minutes is achieved, which most films can not reach in more than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is the story of two brothers, one 18 and the other 10. They come from a poor farm family in Mississippi. Both are lost in war and conflict of duty and love the family. <br /> <br /> It brought tears to my eyes, especially because the entire movie was so well played and directed, and it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other lingers. <br /> <br /> I can fully recommend this movie!
