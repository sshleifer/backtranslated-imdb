Tobe Hooper (fresh mainstream success with 'Poltergeist') is aiming for the sky this time. "Lifeforce" is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's "The Space Vampires". The screenplay of 'Aliens Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby 'varies slightly, as I've been told: the futuristic storyline has been modernized, and Hailey's comet has been added to coincide with its actual passage through the earth a few weeks after the release of the film. I read). <br /> <br /> The story is about a shuttle mission (commander of Steve Railsback) being escorted past Hailey's comet as it passes the earth. Everything runs smoothly, but when you reach the comet you discover that an alien ship is hidden in the comet's coma. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated bat-like creatures. Looking deeper into the ship, a chamber is found containing three humanoids (two naked men and one rather naked lady) in strange stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow. A little later, the ship returns to Earth, but NASA can not make contact and another shuttle is launched to determine the status of the mission. While docking with the Churchill, it is discovered that a massive fire has apparently killed the crew and all data about the flight. The three humanoids remain however. However, it has been learned that an escape pod had been launched, but whose whereabouts are unknown. <br /> <br /> They soon discover the origin of the alien when the very attractive Space Vampire Queen springs from her sleep to easily seduce the life force of the men around her. If you suck her, she will make you like her and if you do not feed after two hours, they will dry out and become dust. The goal of the three is to douse enough of the essence of the population to propel and entertain them and their ship for the journey to the next planet, to devastate them as well. Fortunately, the Commander survives re-entry into the capsule (crash lands no less in Texas) and now has a psychic connection to her regal pungency, the queen, and is able to become the hidden queen too Tobe Hooper (from "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" (1974)) does admirable work in his biggest production so far, while she and the surviving male attempt to dry London from her souls dry. <br /> <br /> , The production gathered many fine technicians from the entire film industry. Production designer John Graysmark (fresh from 'The Bounty (1984)') uses all four stages of Elsree Studios to design the spacious interiors of the ship and such. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to science fiction following Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi (1983) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every image of the widescreen frame with great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra, who has revolutionized the groundbreaking effects of the original "Star Wars" (1977), manages to reinforce the envelope and uses lasers to create some very creative and spectacular effects. Heck himself maestro Henry Mancini gives the film a very catchy title theme, which gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of adventure. Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May (vampire queen) are quite on the shoulder in the acting department. Railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can be as crazy as no one's business. That comes into the hand as his mind wears off as the Queen's grip solidifies his soul. The great French actress May does not have many lines (was there more than ten?), But her often-naked presence never gets old and you have to praise her for having the jingle bells. Pretty much everything the Queen has to do there is to be fed, and to do that she must seduce you with her sexual presence. Job done and where do I register as a victim? I really enjoyed how they worked on the old vampire clich√©s and yet managed to make it fresh yet easily recognizable. Almost everything is considered here: bats (their true form resembles a big bat), coffins (the stasis fields resemble them), transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything), massive sexual attraction (Miss May ??. Duh) Not to mention that they even contain the old standby-through-the-heart (this time a little lead dagger to the energy center just below the heart). The only thing they did not talk about was religion, but I think that the vampires who end up using the cathedral as their home base can only be a bit of a wink and a nod. In short (yes right 800 words later) 'Lifeforce' is an excellent combination of science fiction and horror that pays homage to the vampire theme, adding some neat, different wrinkles. The impact and scale of the production is enough to keep the summer movie (at least at the time) and horror and sci-fi fans busy. 4 out of 5.
