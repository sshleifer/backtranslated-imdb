(Beware: spoilers! - though it's hard to ruin this movie by narrating details.) Eisenstein's black and white propaganda film is not for everyone. It is very old and rude. What makes it great for me is the soundtrack, not the original, but the updated soundtrack. Even better is the orchestral version that Prokofiev created (my favorite is Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony). <br /> <br /> The movie is funny in some places. It is reminiscent of the old "Midsummer Night's Dream". Some outdoor scenes are pretty great. Some of the actors are also pretty great. (The actor who played Nevsky might have been a superstar today, as well as the warrior chick Vasilisa - definitely a rocker.) This could be the world's best collection of Russian proverbs (there are tons of them - they do the bulk) of the spoken lines.) <br /> <br /> The combat scenes actually look much more realistic than most high-budget Hollywood flicks. These guys are just as awkward with their fights as real peasants. The guns look uncomfortable, so the actors probably tried not to hurt each other. <br /> <br /> The actor playing the German "Grand Marshall" really * really * tries to look really scary at the beginning of the movie. He looks like he's really a pussycat. After being trapped, he looks so pathetic. (Speaking volumes about the intended audience, is there?) <br /> <br /> A very humorous note is that the German army brings an * organ * played by a figure in a black robe. Watch the Russians tear down this guy as he plays. <br /> <br /> After the battle is over and almost all Germans are dead, the best part of the movie (and the music) comes, the song is sung to the dead soldiers who died in defense of the motherland. This part is so sad that it's almost an anti-war statement. <br /> <br /> Ten times as many men as women have rated this movie. Wonder, why? <br /> <br /> Warning: Joseph Stalin liked this movie. Ironically - he killed more Russians than anyone. "He who comes to Russia with a sword will die by the sword."
