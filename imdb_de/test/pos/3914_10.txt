PEOPLE ARE STUPID. You should not rejoice if Paris is killed with a whistle in your head! It's just rude! What did Paris do to you? What if you were that? You would not want people to cheer for your death! Anyway, it was really bloody what I liked, and it was cool when Elisha's fingers were cut off. It was strange that they did not have two sons who had tree and everything, there is room for a House of Wax 2: Ressurction or so. Paris was great to play in the chase scene. Elisha and Chad chemistry are great, they deserve an Oscar. My friends and I left when the guy said it was hot Paris and cousin Skeeter's guy coming out. Lol.K bye.
