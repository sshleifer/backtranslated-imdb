I loved the movie absolutely positively. I have just seen it and can not wait for it to appear on DVD. It is a beautiful, well-drawn masterpiece. I am always enthusiastic about the artfully drawn work of the Ghibli Studios. <br /> <br /> Others commented on how Sosuke Risa called by her first name. He never calls his father by his first name, unless he talks to somebody about him. I did not have the impression that Risa was his mother. It was not mentioned or suggested by anyone. It's obvious she's his stepmother. So he gives her the promise to come home, and he gets angry when he finds her empty car. His mother must have died when he was a child, because he mentions that Risa cares for her. In connection with his father, who is much at sea, he has problems with the suspension. Everyone also talks about how mature he is. This usually occurs when a child loses a parent.
