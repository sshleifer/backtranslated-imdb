There has been much progress in gender equality in the last century, but not so much in the world of movies. I do not talk about what's going on behind the camera, I'm referring to the taste of the audience. The idea of ​​a "chick movie" is alive today and there are still many action and horror films that appeal to men in particular. Sure, there are men and women who enjoy the movies that are outside of their typical population, but there are not many films that resonate across the board. Hitch, Will Smith's latest vehicle, attempts to change that trend by being a chick film that casts a dose of male perspective. Smith plays Hitch in the title character Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a "Date Doctor" who teaches men how to approach a woman and have a successful date. Hitch enjoys his job and loves to see how men successfully achieve their goals of going out with the woman of their dreams, but due to a bad experience at school, Hitch himself is somewhat clouded by the idea of ​​love. As the story unfolds, the film introduces two seemingly separate storylines. The latest case of Hitch is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients, the beautiful heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Hitch has his doubts about Albert's chances, but if his customers' wishes are sincere, Hitch supports them. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Hitch meets gossip columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) and is immediately attracted to this strength woman. However, the date doctor apparently can not follow his own advice to persecute Sara. It gets even more complicated when Sara examines the relationship between the bookkeeper and the heiress through her job. Will Hitch be able to reconcile his private life and his job? More importantly, can Hitch believe in love again? If you're a real movie fan, at least once in your life has been complaining about the release of the Hollywood movie factory and looking for something new and original. Well, Hitch is not this movie. However, most movie fans will also admit that a formulaic movie can sometimes only work on a conversational level. Hitch qualifies for this movie.
