Years before marriage contracts became a solid affair, Ernest Lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are based. Bluebeards Aighth Wife involves Gary Cooper as a multi-millionaire on the CÃ´te d'Azur, who has been married seven times and now marries Claudette Colbert for number eight. But Cooper is a good sport. He agrees with his former wives on an annual price of $ 50,000 a year, according to an agreement they sign before marrying him. Sounds like what we now call a marriage contract. <br /> <br /> Of course, Claudette wants a lot more than that, and she feels Cooper takes a too businesslike attitude to marriage. She would like to make the right deal and is ready to make some considerable effort to get it. <br /> Bluebeard's Eighth Wife has some really funny moments, the original Cooper and Colbert meeting in a men's business where Cooper is located he just wants pajama tops and Colbert just looking for butt. And of course my favorite is Colbert, who spies on the detective Cooper and blackmails her to spy on her. Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the movie, as the same, nervous detective. <br /> <br /> I've often wondered how Hollywood could conjure up a movie like this with so many people who are not French. Of course, Cooper is an American and Colbert's occupation is the only one that actually has a French background. Although David Niven is charming as always, it is a ridiculous Englishman if he is a Frenchman. Still, Bluebeard's Eighth Wife is an entertaining movie and a great example of what was called "the Lubitsch touch." Back in the day.
