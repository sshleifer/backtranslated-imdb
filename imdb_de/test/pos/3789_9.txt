Given all the comedies with a military situation made in history, someone had to be first. You could say that Charlie Chaplin invented the genre in Shoulder Arms. <br /> <br /> Hard to believe that this was a daring step back then. Considering that some of the best films involving people like Bob Hope, Abbott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy did military service and were filmed during the war, this is just something that is accepted and laughs at Chaplin and his colleagues Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford set out on Bondtouren. He was a great supporter of the Allied cause, unusual for someone of his leftist views. It only seems natural that the tramp was drawn and, unfortunately, whirled around and messed up. <br /> <br /> Many things you would see in the service comedies of World War II had their beginning Shoulder Chaplin had no more imitators because the war was over within a few weeks of the release of the film. <br /> <br /> However, a comedy art form was created by one of comedy's greatest geniuses.
