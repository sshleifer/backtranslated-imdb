Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one. The film was very well received and rightly helps to land contracts for the production of 'Memento'. <br /> <br /> Below is an exquisite example of how movies should be made. No fancy effects or blood-dripping blood ... just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to tie up his writing again. The actors, everything unknown to me and I suppose most people have done a good job bringing the characters to life. They were all believable and that's all they need. The film is confusing because it plays a lot with the chronology, but in the end is very rewarding. The film is a bit too short to be a full-length game, but any extra length would have ruined the style of the film, and the brilliance of the script would have been reduced. Although the film is short, it has all the aspects that make a movie attractive (IMO): a fascinating beginning, an exciting middle and a surprising ending. <br /> <br /> I dare say the following is almost as good as Memento, by far the best movie. The scrambled chronology is equally masterful in both films, the astonishing twists and turns of action are in place and the acting is very good. <br /> <br /> This movie was filmed at just $ 6,000, but the quality is much higher than most (almost) million dollar box office hits. The use of black and white can be a heavy pill for the big audience, including mainly Nolan, who demonstrates his skills to the studio bosses :-). And what abilities they have ... rarely have I written so much as in 'follow'. Even Pi does not even come close to IMO, though it's also very good. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that should not be missed by any movie lover. If you liked memento, follow is definitely for you.
