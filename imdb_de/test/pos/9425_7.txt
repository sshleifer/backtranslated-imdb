This is a great late night movie! What I mean by that is that I really enjoyed my $ 3.00 VHS copy (now I have a $ 6.99 DVD copy!) On many evenings just before bedtime or when sleeping. There is only something in this movie that is fun to see in repeated sightseeing. It could be the fun that Basil Rathbone has in "The Secret Weapon" with several disguises that deceive the bad guys and Holmes' assistant Nigel Bruce (Watson), but not the housekeeper (Mary Gordon). It could be espionage, cracking and WWII issues. It could even be the light touch with which the director handles the threatening situations in which Holmes finds himself while keeping the story moving. Whatever it is, "Secret Weapon" is simply a pleasant and entertaining detective story that takes us back to a time when the Nazis sought world domination, and to the benefit of fellowship between Watson and Holmes. Regardless of whether you agree with the patriotic speeches and noble "save the world" themes of this film or not (I think they're right!), I find that they only help make this beautiful, old Adventure movie is fun for repeated visits. I rate it as a pleasant 83/100 points.
