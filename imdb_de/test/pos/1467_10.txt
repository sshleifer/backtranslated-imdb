This movie is a very nice and slow movie. There is nothing Hollywood in it. It is very Danish and the characters are very real. It is the first Danish film to pick up on this transsexual theme. It's really about love that has no gender. I would not say that this is lesbian love, although the two main characters (the transsexual Veronika and Charlotte) dress each other. It's a story about love and life. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty much in the two apartments. There is almost no background music, which makes it more real and intense. The two actors who play the main characters are great. They make her really real. They are not archetypes, but real people to meet on the street. I think it's the first time I've seen a transsexual. Very well done.
