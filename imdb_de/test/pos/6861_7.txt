A horror image that is ultimately set for parody but is still in play could frighten a few of those who are nervous or slightly disgusted when they see what's under their skin. I still laughed. It was easy to decipher the true murderer, and his acting did not help. This only made Potente look even better. Anatomy is not exactly a horror image for foreigners of the genre, but the included should get a few unwanted laughs and an interesting climax in the German horror cinema. 6.10
