I've seen Jimmy Stewart in all regular roles, but the "Spirit of St. Louis" was named one of his favorites. The movie is a bad cashier when it was released. This movie was largely forgotten today. Stewart tells the well-known story of Lindberg's famous flight in 1927, and at first glance seems a miscarriage, and his familiar voice never lets you forget who you see. it feels like George Baily is coming back from the front. But obviously, Stewart has been working hard on the role, and he's doing everything right, so you soon do not care that Stewart was 20 years older than the man he portrays. Stewart's Lindberg is so gracious, all-American, apple pie-friendly, that you're involved in the story, and you realize that Stewart Lindberg, with all the aha-shucks, wanted to portray Yankee know-how that he could muster up. Lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the US, and Stewart seems determined to save the bill. Flashbacks are cleverly used to keep a really boring story going, and I was struck by the subtle references to the beliefs that were scattered throughout the film; Lindberg tried to teach a hopeless priest to fly just to face the priest, or Lindberg refused to wear a St. Christopher medal to save weight, only to find the medal in his lunch bag after he had crossed the Atlantic. For me, this is not a movie about a man's epic journey into the unknown, but his realization that this life is much bigger than the things we can see and feel.
