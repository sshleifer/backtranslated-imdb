Three crazy couples, all SIX OF A ART, get involved in a crazy search for stolen bank robbery. <br /> <br /> This is a lively, witty comedy with the six stars - Charlie Ruggles & Mary Boland, WC Fields & Alison Skipworth, George Burns & Gracie Allen - all of you are passionate about doing what they do the best way to get a laugh. Ruggles & Boland make another film appearance as a husband and wife - this time in love as usual. They were a perfect team - she's the shrill lioness, he's the nervous bunny - and they dominate most of the time here on the screen. From start to finish they are a real pleasure. <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen continues the vachelon-like pattering, which was perfected on the radio and eventually put on television, with George, the eternal hetero, and Gracie, the eternal fool. Sometimes she tends to be over the top in the movie, but it's hard not to like her. Her heart was obviously made of solid gold. <br /> <br /> While Skipworth is fairly short - only fragments of her impressive personality flash through - Fields is in his element as the unsightly sheriff of Nuggetville, Nevada. Whether he explains how he got the nickname? Honest John 'or frolic at night looking for the missing Moola, he is still wonderful. Best of all, he can carry out his entire classic pool routine to keep it for a grateful posterity forever. Finally, he does the almost miraculous - he silences Gracie. <br /> <br /> Paramount was so pleased with the success of SIX OF A KIND that they wanted to bring the most important players to another comedy. Only Fields disagreed. He felt that he had now reached the point where he did not have to share a movie with other famous comics. The studio finally agreed and began preparing Fields' first solo feature, YOU TELLING ME (1934).
