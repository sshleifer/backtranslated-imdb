These worker girls go to hell, soap is a time capsuleer, thanks to their flawless physical production, the costly 1950s (look at all those bows and pearls), the creamy Johnny Mathis theme song and the (for his time) daring sexual attitudes. Rona Jaffe's novel, on which the film is based, is constantly being re-released. A few years ago, Vanity Fair dedicated an article to this delicious candy in a movie. Take a look at the new DVD broadcast and you know why. <br /> <br /> The three leads - Hope Lange, Diane Baker and Suzy Parker - reflect the girls from "How To Marry A Millonaire" or Carrie Bradshaw and their friends from "Sex and the City". "Gentlewomen singers take a trip ..." Their romantic adventures and sexual entanglements are the stuff of pocket passion: Empty caramel corn, no nutrients, nothing to eat.

It breaks down into a romantic swoon rather than a wham-bang-melodramatic finish, like Jerry Wald's other famous soap opera, "Peyton Place," where Lana Turner cried and gritted her teeth during a rape Attempt. Here, Hope Lange walks up the New York sidewalk, looks stocky, is eternally hung on the (but now, of course, sober) Stephen Boyd, and they just walk away together ... in the sunset, one suspects. Otherwise, this is pretty much the definition of a guilty pleasure. Oh yes ... there is also Joan Crawford, who spits fire at all the young girls and smokes cigarettes as she hisses over her hi-jacked lover's phone. And the titles are in pink, with band lettering reminiscent of the department store ads of the late 50s. Do not miss
