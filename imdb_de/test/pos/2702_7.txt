Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is the old familiar feeling of the 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb in the title role does a good job, but I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearmaker movie that well illustrates Karen's and Richard's careers, as well as the personal struggles Karen and her illness struggled with. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very well done. However, Karen Carpenter found that it was a time when she was very special and made her fans and music lovers happy. Even if you were not a Carpenter fan, this is a nice story that shows how a great talent can fall prey to society's pressure.
