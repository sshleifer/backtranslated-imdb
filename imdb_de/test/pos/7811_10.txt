This movie absolutely deserves to be one of the best Hindi comedies ever made. Rajkumar Santoshi is best known for his hard-nosed social dramas, but this is by far the most effortless film he has made. <br /> <br /> The storyline revolves around the two small town antics Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan). They want to get rich fast and move to the big city. They split the same plan - to recruit a rich heiress Raveena (Raveena Tandon), who is the daughter of a wealthy businessman Ramgopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal). So the one who marries Raveena gets all her wealth in her hands. But when they get to know each other, there is a heated argument over who marries Raveena. It comes to hilarious gags and situations as the battle continues. At the same time, Ramgopal Bajaj's identical twin brother Shyamgopal Bajaj wants to eliminate his brother and niece and seize family assets. Add to that a selection of fun characters, including a Raveenas maid Karishma (Karishma Kapoor), a fault-prone butler named Robert (Vijoo Khote), a manager named Bhalla (Shehzad Khan), who haunted yesterday's rogue Ajeet and a fun gangster Gogo (Shakti) imitates Kapoor), who looks more like a pirate, and a fun comedy awaits you. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time looking for LOGIC in the movie. Leave the company of your brain and ENJOY it. The actors are so in sync with the script that there is no room for error. Dialogues (Rajkumar Santoshi, Dilip Shukla) are funny. Music (Tushar Bhatia) and lyrics (Majrooh Sultanpuri) are unforgettable. The imaging and choreography (Saroj Khan) of "Yeh Raat Aur Yeh Doori", "Ae Lo Ji Sanam" and "Dil Karta Hai Tere Paas Aaoon" is fitting and will stay in my head forever. <br /> <br /> The film made two superstars, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan (who eventually became superstars). Aamir Khan is perfectly in his first comic role. I greet his funny timing. Salman fades compared to Aamir, but is still sympathetic. Among the minor characters Paresh Rawal is characterized by its double role of Ramgopal and Shyamgopal. <br /> <br /> The film failed at the box office surprisingly. I do not understand why. I still recommend it to everyone.
