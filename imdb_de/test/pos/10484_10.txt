Sublime - perfect - profound - a true lesson about the idealized meaning of life. We are completely involved in the life travel of Martina and Phillipa and <br /> Babette. Their longings, longings and sacrifices can be heard long after the end of the film. When she saw it years ago - as it gained much fame over the boldness of its theme - half the movie was a single dinner -, the audience was "oohing and aahing" while some of the courses found their final graduation br /> <br / > Gorgeous figure, laughing at the response of the guests as they were completely seduced by the pleasures Babette presented to them and were completely surprised at the end of the film. Years later, when I saw the film after my own twists, I realized how profound the film is. The tears flowed out of this view. The film's meditation on the passage of time and the way it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life, love and art and generosity is really something that that you can appreciate.
