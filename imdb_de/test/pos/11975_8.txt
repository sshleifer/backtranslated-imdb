When a saboteur blows up a controversial government research lab, two experimental animals are moved to a small community in Washington State. One is a dog with unusual intelligence. The other is an "Outside Experimental Combat Mammal" or "OXCOM". For reasons that continue to flow into the movie, the ox hates the dog and tries to kill it. Observers deal with the accidental involvement of Travis Cornell (Corey Haim), his mother Nora (Barbara Williams) and his friend Tracey (Lala Sloatman) with the dog and Oxcom, two agents of the National Security Organization, Lem Johnson (Michael Ironside) and Cliff (Blu Mankuma), track them down. <br /> <br /> Many comments are made because watchers are very different from the Dean Koontz book, which serves as a launch pad for the movie. This is true. However, it should not affect your rating. If you want the book, read the book. Judge the film according to its own merits and not according to the book. Bill Freed and Damian Lee, who wrote the script, are just as much artists as Koontz (that's not a quality comparison, just a statement that they're all artists). That's the director Jon Hess. Her job as a filmmaker is not to slavishly pursue the book as if it were a script. They adapt the book as an artist to create a unique work of art. It is based on the book. Not identical with it. You must relax your prejudices / expectations by watching the movie because you will experience a work of art that you are unfamiliar with even if you have read Koontz's novel. <br /> <br /> Is Watchers a good movie? It's pretty good, not excellent. Good enough to earn a "B" or an 8. Hess starts things on the right foot with one of the nicest filmed explosions I've seen for some time. Unfortunately, he immediately stumbles after it while listening to some very thick, jargonistic depictions. After this scene, Watchers faces a clichéd 1980s movie when we meet Travis and Tracey for the first time. <br /> <br /> Veering towards cliché is a trend that is constantly threatened. But it's just an offset. In most cases, Hess is able to overcome a well-trodden area with a number of interesting twists: both Travis and Tracey come from a single home, and their sexes are reversed. Both have unique, mature relationships with their parents. Although it's a horror movie, the focus is on a cute, intelligent dog who often feels like an adventure movie like horror, thriller or sci-fi, all of the genres he comes in contact with. Hess introduces a large group of characters, some of whom are late in the game. The movie is never confusing, however, and no characters feel like they're in the dust - all the strings are tied up nicely at the end. The structure is also complex in that there are two main villains, the second of which is less and less obviously disregarded in the course of the film, until a twist accompanied by brute force makes an antagonist more apparent. Soon after, Hess gives us a nice moment of doubt about the other opponent. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake in my eyes is a dreaded error that has been common in horror movies since at least the 1980s - the "attack". Scenes are recorded too dark, too close, too blurred and too sharp. It makes it extremely difficult to say what's going on, which dissolves most of the suspense of scenes that should be a highlight. Certainly part of Hess' motivation was the style, and this is the typical justification for this problem, the concern that the creature looks more humorous and / or fake than scary and exciting. In my view, it is not a satisfying solution to offer the audience a dizzying blur. Only at the end of the movie we see the creature costume / make-up clearly. It was good enough that better attacking and shooting scenes would have brought the movie to at least 9. Regardless of the degree of correspondence between novel and film, Watchers offers a gripping story of intelligent, seductive characters. It's often a nail bite, and the horror scenes are wilder than you might expect, if not quite bloody (though there's a lot of blood in some scenes). Observers tend to be undervalued due to misconceptions about the role of film in adapting literature. Do not miss or reject it.
