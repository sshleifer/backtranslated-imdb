This is the last feature film filmed by Michelangelo Antonioni with the help of Wim Wenders and fits in from his short story collection "That Bowling Alley on the Tiber". Beyond the Clouds contains 4 short stories with familiar themes to which we have become accustomed from earlier work and summarizes these themes in vignettes interwoven by Wender's direct scenes featuring John Malkovich's The Director character. However, most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth to which we are accustomed to from an Antonioni movie, while Malkovich's narrative of supposed depth permeated with an ambiguous dictatorship that sounded a bit presumptuous and inappropriate. Nevertheless, all four stories seem to touch random encounters, and extremely fast romance novels that at first sight seemed more lustful, perhaps due to lack of time (since they are short stories anyway) to enable more Layered approach to carefully defining and crafting the characters as we know them from a typical Antonioni movie , And the obsessive approach is for the characters to undress to show a lack of deeper connection that is sacrificed for the immediate gratification of the flesh. Perhaps you would like to convey this with an observation of the more modern relationship? <br /> <br /> The first story, a love affair that never existed, tells the romance between Silvano (Kim Rossi Stuart) and Carmen (Ines Sastre), who meet when someone asks for directions to a hotel , and later meet in a cafe. It's as if destiny plays games when they meet but later meet again and meet again, but like the games that people play, it's almost like an L'Avventura or a La Notte with no communication and communication the expectations The man. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich's director plays a key role in the next short film show, which shows some really cool looks at a girl who works in a shop, played by Sophie Marceau. She is deeply disturbed and uncomfortable, but she has somehow gathered the courage to approach him, and while I thought she should scare him off, she tells her background that she murdered her father by giving him twelve times stabbed. But in no time, the two are in the direction of bedroom gymnastics. <br /> <br /> The next short film, Do not Look for Me, is the longest of all, with Peter Weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between playing his lover (Chiara Caselli) or his wife by Fanny Ardant. Perhaps the star who has more stars in the game, and Jean Reno eventually came up with a coda that extends the small universe in which this shorts exist. Unfortunately, Reno's involvement was stifled by laughter as he entered the implausible realm of laser-fast romantic tangles. There was a key element of L'Eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a pane of glass while the introductory story about the soul story was pretty interesting. If there is a negative subject in this short film, it is the duplicity of the man. Between this and the next was a small scene that our couple from La Notte, Marcello, reunited Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau, where the former has painted a landscape reminiscent of those in the Red Desert. Finally we have the last shot of This Body of Dirt, starring Vincent Perez as a young man looking for a girl (Irene Jacob) he has just met and falling in love with, only to find that it is also a late love , It's a relatively speaking piece, just like the first story, with the characters talking to each other on the streets of the city they are currently in, reminiscent of Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise. <br /> <br /> While on the whole the film may have been successful as a single piece, they were never meant to be a collaborative effort, as the "excuse" of connecting them was that the director had possible stories and explored the inspiration for his next movie.
