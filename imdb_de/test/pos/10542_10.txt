This movie is the best horror movie I've ever seen. The acting is terrible and the action leaves much to be desired, but the doll has given me nightmares for weeks. Seriously, if you have small children, do not let them see that. Of course I'm a bit biased because of irrational fear of dolls and dwarves. also a body double cameo of the guy who makes mini me verne troyer. and a superfluous nudity, a must in any horror movie on a low budget. All other horror movies are directed against it forever in my book.
