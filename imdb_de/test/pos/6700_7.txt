Lifeforce is certainly one of Tobe Hooper's best films. It has some great special effects and a lot of nudity, so it seems like a dream of a typical horror fan. The movie is creative and I think that's the script of Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. Good filming and a good scary atmosphere make it a solid movie.
