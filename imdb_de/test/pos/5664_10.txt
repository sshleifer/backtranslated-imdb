That's certainly not the best movie ever. But that is certainly worth seeing for people with a special mind. So the one who loves sadness and depression and terrifying fairytales, wolves and real madness at night - welcome! If you find a copy, of course :) As for me, I could only stand it once ... But since then, the wolves and Saint-Lucy and child drawings and a headless Christ live in my nightmares.
