Chucky is back ... and it's time! This time with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little quote from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least at this rate, the camp is back. This has been the crueler of this series so far. It has some good spins and some good action scenes. <br /> <br /> This was by far the funniest in the series, bridging, if unintentionally, the gap between sheer horror and horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It will be a scream! <br /> <br /> "Jesus, the music scene has been over since I died!" Chucky <br /> <br /> We needed the lightness as the puppetry gets old. The comedic element and the better action scenes bring this back to the quality of the first, as the idea was fresh and new. <br /> <br /> 6.8 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
