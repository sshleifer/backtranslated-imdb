"What is his name?" "Loudon." "Loudon what?" "Clear." <br /> <br /> This gag will still get me TWICE ANNUAL once the movie is released. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie a lot back then and I love it today. I had to look at it a hundred times, and when I recently bought the DVD, I remembered some dialogues. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman imprisoned for a crime not committed When she gets out, she decides to seek revenge. Griffin Dunne (whatever happened to him?) Plays a lawyer for the father of his fiancee (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki out of jail to the bus station and make sure she gets on the bus as part of a supposedly new PR program. A seemingly simple task, but there are a lot of complications, some funny dialogues and some admittedly silly but funny scenes. <br /> <br /> Madonna has a stupid voice in this movie that I could only watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible to me (hence only 8/10), but then again I can not imagine that she does it in her normal voice. <br /> <br /> This movie shows Madonna's comic page (too few these days), and she's really funny in the role. Dunne makes a great slide, while Haviland Morris is perfect for the engaged fiancee. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but I think that's a great movie and will sit down and watch it 100 times more.
