While my kids enjoyed the movie (and later announced that they would buy it later), I think I got more than they did. The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I did not use the cutting comment aloud, but I thought so). It's a good-humored midlife movie, a bit juicy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the kid stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his mother dies?), But all in all a good time. There was also something to tell our family - did my children think my life was boring? What do you expect at 40? How can you dislike a movie that leads to a good conversation with your kids?
