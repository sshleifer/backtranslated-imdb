I do not understand why everyone hates this movie, except for the fact that they are just jealous and never left their music career like mega pop star Aaron Carter. Whether he likes it or not, Aaron has had more success in his young life than most people ever dreamed of, so it seemed only natural for him to make a film. Lou Pearlman and his company are known for over-exploiting their pop-protégées. Do you remember Justin Timberlake's excursion into the TV movie Model Behavior? Granted, this movie is not big and impressive, but it should not be. It's not an attempt to impress people or become an Emmy Award winner, it was released directly on DVD. It's just a sweet little movie about a clumsy teenager who gets her dream of being with her favorite pop star; I know many of you had this dream sometime from your favorite singer, do not deny it. It's sweet and gentle, and I appreciate that I have not stepped into the area of ​​sex, violence, and vulgar language that seem to sneak into more and more of our current films. Where is the decency? Where's the Line These days, there are dozens of teenage dramas, as teenagers are a big market for business. At least for me, this drama is more bearable than Bratz (aka Slutz). in tank tops and miniskirts and is faths better than the gore festival movies like Saw. I feel for the main character girl because I was a high school kidnapped girl who loved and still does Aaron Carter and NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys and other pop music; and how Aaron's character would be stifling "testophobia", especially in Math. If you judge this film only because of the fact that you dislike Aaron Carter and his fame or are jealous, then you will of course hate him and report on the garbage talk. The only reason Britney Spears 'dribble' Crossroads scored a higher score is because she has boobs. Accept this movie for what it is and not what you want. I think this happy, formulaic teen movie ends with a high note and lets you sing.
