Jamie Foxx is very good at embodying the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. To the film's gratitude, it shows both the good and the bad about Charles's character and the choices he made personally and professionally. <br /> <br /> This is a smooth-looking movie that gives you a rich sense of the periods in which the story takes place. It does not just look good, it sounds good too. I just wish there was more music here. If it's inserted, it's fabulous, but it's not enough of it. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, at least for verification purposes, that the story was true, I was impressed and disappointed with Charles, which meant that the story left some memorable impressions since I wrote this 16 months after the cover letter. The most important impressions are: <br /> <br /> GOOD - Re-Living Ray's tremendous talent and foresight to take a step forward and capitalize on musical opportunities such as going "country" for a while. The man had the utmost confidence in himself, but did not seem arrogant. It was also memorable that he struck his heroin addiction - without help! That's just amazing. <br /> <br /> BAD - I also remember from this film how easily Ray managed to come first and be disappointed that he was so unfaithful to his wife. One really sad comment was that his wife was more angry with him for missing his kid's Little League games than for all the cheating he had done to her, even if he fathered a child with a member of his singing group The only negative thing I had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis of his problems due to an early childhood child, the random death of his brother. This tragedy was used as an adult for all Ray's misdeeds, which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions. <br /> <br /> Note: There is an enhanced version with The DVD says it's so badly edited it's not worth watching, so stick to the "Theatrical Version".
