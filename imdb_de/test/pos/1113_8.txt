The most vivid portrait of the small town curiosity I've seen in a long time - and I'm not just talking about Australian films. This piece seems to have been made "under the radar," and it is truly a fascinating piece that has a worldliness that has been largely unseen in recent times in Australia. Filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's rather slow and strange - it seems to move here and there, but it's not really sure if it's a thriller or a "head movie". But the amazing aspect of Alex Frayne's film is his iron fist and the ruthless direction. It never wavers, it is highly controlled, precise and absolutely confident. The camera is one of the most artful, beautiful and lyrical I have ever seen. The sound is all psychological, the music builds the tension. <br /> <br /> The third act starts up the story and the episodes collide and come together - do not try to put together the puzzle of the last 20 minutes. It's a bit of a cheater - but at this point the movie has one a little trance, a kind of hypnosis, and you've sold a riddle - that has no real answer.
