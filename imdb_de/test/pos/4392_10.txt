I loved this movie! I saw that when it hit the cinemas, so I can not remember all the details. I remember it was based on Homer's story about Ulysses. Names of places and events are changed, but you can still see the similarity with the story. <br /> <br /> I found it funny how they get themselves into trouble and how they could make themselves out of it. I enjoyed this version of the modernized old stories much better than the Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes. <br /> <br /> I agree that in some parts of the story it sometimes gets a bit dull, but all in all is a great adventure with some great actors.
