This was shown in Rome in a Roman cinema (not as bad as it sounds after being shown at the Rome Film Festival). It is an art film and a festival film that will surely inspire this audience for its peculiarity of style, droll humor; Ability to draw comedy out of the suffering of others; attractive, cheerful music; punctual appearances; Surpassing sweetness and humanity - but doomed to failure because of its curiosity and lack of convincing action, the average audience should ask themselves what they look for and why someone admires it, how it was done at all. Andersson almost gives us a series dry skits. They go through different topics. Money: A man at the next table (Waldemar Nowak) squeezes the wallet of a wealthy man with a cell phone in a restaurant with a glass of liquor, then he goes and orders a series of smart suits, made to order; A deadbeat son calls his famous father from a lavish assembly to ask him for another loan. A shrinking man worries loudly about his exhausted investments, while his wife only squats him in bed with a shiny Viking helmet. Depression: A primary school teacher (Jessica Nilsson) collapses in the classroom because her husband called her a "harpy;" The carpet seller's spouse (Pär Fredriksson) collapses in front of the customers because he called them that. Some men have depressing dreams. But hey - that's Sweden. Are not all depressed? Love problems: A fat Bohemian couple dissolves constantly; A girl groupie has fantasies about a lead guitarist, Micke (Eric Bäckman). Wives strike doors when their men start practicing their instruments. (Also, music is obviously a connective theme.) Besides the dashing guitarist, there is a tuba and a drummer who play in a Dixierland band and also play marches and funerals, each scene has an added accent from the music that cleverly plays a sequence connects with another.) A furious storm in front of the window of many scenes, heavy rain, people outside, thunder so loud that it sounds like a battle that rages all over the country. This also unifies the sound and gives the impression that different scenes are taking place on the same, terrible, stormy day. Andersson is a master of visual composition and static medium-distance recording and the film has a misty gray. Designed by DP Gustav Danielsson, Green Look is perfect because it dampens the Swedish winter while sparkling with the director's subtle colors, closing each scene with a smile. You almost never knew that cloudiness could be so beautiful. (Or maybe it did: Alexcanr Sokurov sometimes creates such effects in very different contexts.) Within scenes and throughout the film, there is a kind of silence that results from the visual style, the tempo of scenes, and the detached humanism of Gothenburg the general outlook. There is something about a completely controlled style that is calming and soothing. <br /> <br /> Not everything works equally well. One can feel impatient in the sequence of barely related scenes that read too much, sometimes like the work of a Saturday Night Live writer who needs Prozac. Because some scenes just make you move or make you laugh, it's obvious that others fall a bit flat. <br /> <br /> But some scenes are real zingers, and an obviously triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream - described and dreams were another important thread - in which the girl groupie presents herself in a bridal gown with married to her fey guitarist ideal playing a delicate series of riffs while a crowd of admirers gather in front of a large window. The vantage point changes to the outside and the window slowly slides away, as if the building from which the newlyweds look out, leave a train leaving a train station and taking them on a honeymoon. It is a fresh, subtle and rather sublime effect. <br /> <br /> At some point, you can feel everything in You the Living, including the recurring scene where the barman always barks a bronze bell announcing the final order time, whereupon all torpedo clients rise from their tables and one get another drink. <br /> <br /> An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great movie," and that's right. It's limited to a dozen types, but it's great. Roy Andersson is a small master (like a medieval miniaturist) of the inner comedies of the Scandinavian darkness, and this film is unlike any other. This year, as Cannes's selection "Un Certain Regard" showed, this is also the Swedish contribution to the Best Foreign Oscar 2007. Hard to say what Bergman would think, but Andersson worked with him. is famous for its lavishly produced TV commercials, some of which can be seen on YouTube. Bergman called them "the best commercials in the world." It will be interesting to see if this director, whose craft is as subtle as his point of view, will work for some time in longer segments. Meanwhile, a good movie fan must really see that. <br /> <br /> "Schadenfreude" is not quite the right word. That means joy in the misery of others. Andersson teaches us to rejoice in the misery of all of us.
