Most of us children who grew up in the 40s or 50s were western buffs, but this escaped me to this day in the Movies for Men Channel. I loved the movie story, the cinematography and the outstanding casting of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. in the lead roles along with the ever-reliable Ward Bond. Apparently, this film was the inspiration for the later television series 'Wagon Train', in which Bond again presented as head of the waggons to the west. Johnson steals the movie with his riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts, as Ben does in this movie. Other well-known personalities include the handsome Joanne Dru as Denver and an early, non-talking role for James Arness, who later became famous for his role as Marshal Matt Dillon in 'Gunsmoke'. If you like movies of this genre, you can not miss this movie.
