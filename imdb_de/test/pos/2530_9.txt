For me, this is another movie I saw on the Los Angeles "Z" channel when it was in action. And it was one more of those films that I saw in my youth ... and learned that there is a world out there ... one I did not want to accept. <br /> <br /> Moving to Los Angeles and seeing the international cinema became a guilty pleasure hobby of mine, and to date no premier broadcaster has complied with the "Z" channel in its international film screening. The three international films that are in my young mind were "Spetters", "Beau Pere" and of course this "Pixote". <br /> <br /> This was the most shocking and saddest movie I have ever experienced. This was also one of the first films that made me understand that there is a difference in cinema: entertaining and informing. Let me be honest. Growing up in a small town on the East Coast, I had no idea that such a thing existed to that extent. Everything I knew from South America was leaflets about fabulous Brazillian holidays and Columbia had a lot of drug trafficking. Then comes a movie like Pixote. Sad. Disturbing. Uncanny scary. You look on: kids. Those in need of refuge, love, understanding, and all these things are a way to survive day by day through drugs, sex, robbery, theft, sleeping on the streets and in sadistic group homes, etc., prostitutes, etc., and one wonders, HOW can things happen in this world? <br /> <br /> Pixote is not a movie for entertainment, but a movie with information. It shows shocking and disturbing pictures - but it shows the lives of these everyday street kids.
