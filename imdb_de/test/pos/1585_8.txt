After the death of all high-ranking officers, Commander Craig-Scott is promoted by the Laundry and Morale Corps to the command of an intergalactic spacecraft of Starcups Corporation. His main task is to find habitable planets and, of course, long-term coffee markets. <br /> <br /> Craig-Scott and his deputy, Chief Blather, are unlikely to find themselves in command except to the extent that they are fully capable of keeping the crew underwear clean - which means cleaner Underwear does not diminish, especially if incompetent commanders regularly pollute these subordinates well. <br /> <br /> The episodes are presented as a series of short 2-3 minute reports from Commander to Earth. The humor is a mixture of crooked dead and unheard of physical comedy. Think the minister is meeting the red dwarf, but with a budget for the shoe string. All Sci-Fi's usual action devices are here - aliens, nuclear weapons, computer malfunctions - but each one is enhanced by the fresh, lemony scent of high-quality detergent low-budget, but the slightly cheesy effects and props fit the show's absurd premise. Do you remember the funny hockey helmets you wore on the old Battlestar Galactica? Is the brand name "Jofa" still visible? Okay, Commander's Log contains a lot of it, but it's cute. <br /> <br /> Commanders Log is not a high-art, but it's not what it's trying to do. It's just a bit of fun. That makes a good job.
