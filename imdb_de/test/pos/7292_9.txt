I do not understand why critics would beat this movie. It's a teen movie that's actually serious, which is a rarity. I admit that there are moments that are extremely juicy, but it's about young love. It has to be juicy to be valid. My biggest complaint is Chris Klein. While he was funny in American Pie, he does not seem ready for switching to more dramatic fare. He is very uncomfortable in some of his "mom-stuff". Hartnett and Sobieski, on the other hand, show remarkable depth and credibility, as do their parents. Although the script is very clich√© with lovers who spit out poetry, the actor makes it work. The director shows some strong pictures on the screen. Beautiful cinematography, beautiful music, great young actors, I was impressed and I'm a bad critic when it comes to teenage movies.
