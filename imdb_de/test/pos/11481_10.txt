There was a video in the US called "Cartoon Scandals," which featured banned cartoons worth an hour. Most of them were from the time of the Second World War. That's the first time I saw it (and heard of it). <br /> <br /> The cock during the opening news program turns into a vulture with an Asian face saying 'cock-a-doodle-doo please'. Then there are eight minutes of propaganda, which are played like a newsreel. <br /> <br /> Viscous racist, but if you look at it as a piece of history, it can (and should) be forgiven. <Br /> <br /> Cutting cards for sandwiches. <br /> <br /> Displays the ruins of Rome while calling Moussolini 'Ruin # 1'. '<br /> <br /> A minesweeper with broom. <br /> <br /> A manned bomb with the pilot and the inscription: "RET ME OUT!" <br /> <br /> And of course the stereotyping. Every Japanese was drawn with big teeth, bowed constantly and said "Please" at the end of each broken sentence. <br /> <br /> The funniest piece? The air-raid siren, with two men bowing to each other with needles in the pole. "oooo-OOOOOO" Hey AOL. Let this out. It deserves attention. My wife laughed about it. And she is 100% Japanese.
