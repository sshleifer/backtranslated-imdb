I saw this movie when it came out. I thought, what an average movie. I now realize that this director was ahead of his time. This is a great movie and a great soundtrack. I've seen my share of rock movies, but that's a long way from the spinal cord (which I did not like)> This movie takes us into the life of an 80's rocker who wants to be nothing else. This is nothing else than our inner child, who wants to grow up and become a * ROCK STAR *. Yes, I said it. Everyone wants to grow up and be there (weather said or not). This movie puts you in the center of emotions and you can almost feel the excitement of Izzy. I have to admit that the acting was less equal, but the music and the story were enough to hold you until the credits rolled. The watch is worth it, especially if you're a fan of Ole's mighty hairbands.
