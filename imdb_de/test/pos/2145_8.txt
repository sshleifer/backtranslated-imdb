I really do not know why this movie was so hostile at its first release. Sure, it's overlong and somewhat unfounded in its depictions of sexuality and violence, but there are also many respected films. I really do not think the people who hated "Heaven's Gate" really understood it. "Heaven's Gate" in its uncut form, similar to "The Deer Hunter", shows the gross differences between an insecure and dangerous life (like the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and the comfort and privilege (like the "Americans"). "Wyoming and Averil in the Prologue and Epilogue.) Living a hard life is painful, but it can also be invigorating, in contrast to the boring life that Averil leads in the epilogue, since Michael Cimino made a great effort to paint the picture Historically correct, it is fascinating as a document (and possibly a charge) to American life in Old West Wyoming, and the dialogue is often genuinely clever and emotional, combined with great music and cinematography makes the film seem like a truly poetic work of art. Granted, "Heaven's Gate" with its refusal to patronize the viewer is not for all tastes, but Hollywood turns out to be a commercial mess every year so much easier to dismiss as careless eye candy (even if an example of it becomes a blockbuster), that "Gate" and Cimino really deserve more respect. All people should see the uncut version at least once and then decide for themselves. <br /> <br />
