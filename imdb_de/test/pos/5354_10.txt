There are some aspects of Park's films, especially Wallace & Gromit, which I would describe as great. The first is subtlety and observation, whose flagship is the character of Gromit. He does not speak, he makes no sounds, all he has are eyes, brows and posture, and with these he commands the film. Park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression. The comedy and the emotion are conveyed by the subtlest movements and work great. <br /> <br /> When you watch the movie, you need to be aware of the entire screen. Usually you are led to the things in the movies, the screen is not overly clogged, there are not many things that distract your gaze from the main features or actions. Park seems to be different in his films. He adds extra content to his audience, there's action in the background, at the side of the screen, even off the screen, and there's almost always something in the foreground that catches your eye. His films are about multiple viewing and discovery, they are superimposed with jokes and complementary actions. Throughout the film, there are layers of things on the canvas, jokes in the foreground, possibly on a glass label and background shadows that betray action. One can imagine that the films for Park have always been an event, and the films he loves are the ones he wants to see again and again. This is reflected in his films and in his most popular characters. <br /> <br /> Then there are the bizarre and crazy inventions that Wallace makes, something that is reflected in the plot and twists of the turns. Plot, everything is bizarre and off the wall, but in this world it seems to be completely normal. One can imagine that in Park is the head of Wallace. <br /> <br /> There's one more thing that makes these films so unique, namely modeling and precise hand animation. I have to admit that I was worried when I knew Dreamworks was involved in creating this movie, and I thought they were putting their computer animation experience to the forefront. I was afraid that Wallace & Gromit would become CGI entities or the smallest CGI used to clean up the feeling that modeling led to the movie. <br /> <br /> Not so. You can still see fingerprints and tool marks on the characters, and this is not a distraction from the movie. This just adds so much real feeling and gives the character and scene on the screen a sense of physical depth. > And what about the movie? Well, I have to say that the plot change was something that I had been thinking about for a long time before the movie was in the cinema, and it was no surprise, but it did not affect my enjoyment. It was really all about watching the shooting and the weird timing of the discovery and reactions, and it sucked me in just as if it were a thriller, and yet I was laughing all the time. The film was intriguing in many ways. To see how the animation is done, how wild the inventions are, how Wallace gets into trouble and Gromit brings him out, where all the cross-references in the movie are and where all the jokes are! I have to admit that after talking with my friends I could not believe what I had missed. <br /> <br /> There's something else in this movie than the others, there's a new level of adult humor here and I do not do rude jokes (though there's a couple that's just so British you can Do not laugh), I mean jokes that just fly over kids' heads but hit adults in the face. The kind you're used to is somewhere like Pixar. This makes the movie even more attractive. <br /> <br /> Okay, let me try to be a little negative here. I did not notice the voices in this movie, do you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognize them? Well, I was just too wrapped up in the movie to interest or remember who they were ... okay, that's not negative. Let me try it again. The main plot was not as strong and gripping as I expected, and I found myself in the side stories and the characters themselves caught ... again ... that's not a bad thing, the movie was just so much rich entertainment. <br /> <br /> I honestly can not say anything bad about this movie. The worst thing I could say is that the title sequence is pretty repetitive in the end! Really, that's the worst thing I can say. <br /> <br /> The story is a lot of fun, well positioned, well written, well executed. There are many fantastic characters here, not just Wallace & Gromit. There's so much going on on the screen, so many references and jokes (look at Lady Tottingham's clothes), cheeses everywhere, jokes for the whole family. The characters are extremely exciting and you will find that you are attracted to them before you know it. There is just so much in this movie for everyone. <br /> <br /> There is so much to say and write about, but I know that it will quickly become a step backwards for Park and Aardman. A series of "This play was really funny" and "It give a little bit when ... "and I would rather tell you that this is a great movie to see and experience the whole thing for yourself. I will say that the rabbits are excellent!
