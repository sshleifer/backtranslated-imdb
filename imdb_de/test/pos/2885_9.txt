John Osborne's adaptation of "Picture of Dorian Gray" is a fine homage to Oscar Wilde's talent as a novelist as well as a playwright. On the screen with some edits, he cuts through three crucial scenes from the piece (one of which is an important scene between Basil and Henry, which shows that time has passed.) The spectacle, however, is brilliant. Sir John Gielgud returns as Lord Henry to his savage roots, and although he is about a decade too old for the role, he becomes the enigmatic, life-loving Kad and cynic that Wilde so meticulously brought to life in his novella. Jeremy Brett is also strong, offering a touching portrait of desperate artist Basil Hallward. Peter Firth, who was not originally my vision of Dorian, treats the role with style and grace ... and later with convincing cruelty. The minor cast is as good as Gielgud's former co-star, "Importance of Being," Gwen Francon-Davies plays his philanthropic Aunt Agatha with dignity, and Judi Bowker touches Sybil Vane. Witty, pathos and suspense of Wilde are remarkably transferred to the screen. My only other problem is the hairstyles. Many of them seemed out of place, looking more like the Victorian hairstyles of the 1970s than the actual style. Overall, however, acting and writing raise this production to the highest level of small screen quality.
