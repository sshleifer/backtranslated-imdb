This was the movie that first showed me what a great actor Martin Sheen really is. He humbly claims that Charlie is a better actor, Charlie can not give him a candle. <br /> <br /> I found it exciting and really enjoyed intertwining the love story with the main story (and I usually hate love stories). There is a great action in the end that seemed absolutely believable to me, especially in the early '80s, and probably now. <br /> <br /> The final scene brought me to the edge of the seat. This film shows all around that betrayal is often spent by those we trust, while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect, and that human compassion is found where we least expect it. <br /> <br/> Irerose
