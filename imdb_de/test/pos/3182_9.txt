This was such a great show for black people back then. We loved it so much. It was the only show about black middle class families on TV. back then. Please publish this on DVD. I know many ... many people who still talk about the show. When it's released, I'm sure many black teenagers will find this enlightenment equally interesting. The show covered many topics from racism, racial discrimination, teenage pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer pressure, and more. The show ended so abruptly and left the fans speechless and wondered why it was taken out of thin air. Since then we have seen only a few actors and actresses. Please publish it on DVD ASAP.
