Fata Morgana is by far one of the craziest and most astonishing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because there are elements to document its images, but the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, and so unclear that I wonder if this story was really worth it, just about those pictures can exist. The film is essentially the story of Earth and the creation of the Earth, taken from the perspective of an outsider, alien or indescribable, all in the Sahara desert. The title of the image refers to the illusion or reflection of real and hallucinated images that people often experience in the desert. These are also referred to as illusions. The film begins with a plane landing, followed by a plane landing, and over and over and over, over and over. With each landing shot of the plane, the actual architecture of the place where it lands dissolves, and the plane itself begins to slowly dissolve and become less and less real and more and more reflective images. The visual language in this film becomes more and more intense and unusual with the continuation of the picture. The narrative tells of the genesis of the universe as alarming sexual images of sand and landscape move past the camera. The shots go further and further into the desert and Herzog films everything he sees and finds. The world's strangest reflections can be seen in the distance as Duke encounters some of the purest and most photogenic collection of outsiders you'll ever see. When the Leonard Cohen soundtrack sets in, you can be sure that you are in the world of a crazy man who loves the universe. <br /> <br /> I can not say much more about this movie without ruining anything, but I'll say it's a sobering experience and there's really nothing like that. I love watching movies that are only in their own classes. This film is certainly a good example of how Herzog loves to mix narrative and documentary into an exchangeable form. Unfortunately, Fata Morgana is a little longer than welcome, but as it nears its end, the images will most likely be burned into your head forever. Definitely a must for those who are obsessed with nature and the origin of the universe.
