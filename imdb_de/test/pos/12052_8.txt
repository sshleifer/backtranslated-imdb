I've never seen a Bollywood movie before, but I caught it for the first ten minutes, laughed silly, and hit the R button on Sky +. I am glad that I did that !! I hope I do not insult anyone (because basically the BF and I loved it!), But we could not take it half as seriously as the actors - especially the obsessed (who, I know, is a big Bollywood star .) because we've seen him on the cover of many DVDs and I've even seen a doll from him in Hamleys today! The BF goes on with this guy - I'm starting to think that he's obsessed! He keeps saying that it's weird the traditionally good-looking who's the anti-hero of a movie! But then we like movies that are not your Hollywood predictable prices. <br /> <br /> It was overkill, but it's really fun. If all Bollywood movies are like that, let's have a closer look. I had this blooming song in my head all week and I can not speak a word Hindi! PS All recommendations would be grateful!
