Oz was the first original television program HBO put on its channel (in the 1-hour Forma) and it remains the best ever ... The story is simple ... Oz is a surreal look into the life of High-security prisoners in Oswald who focus mainly on "Em City". Well, there are many things to thank as a compliment to this show (in my opinion that was the best on TV when this show was aired), directing (top notch), acting (Best of the Best) and the characters ... this Show literally blew my socks off ... This show was a critically acclaimed gem until the sopranos bowed after critics mocked this epic story of trust and family to notice this compelling drama ... Oz for me is a better show than Sopranos in general, and it's a shame that I never aroused a big Emmy ... = / <br /> <br /> <br /> to all those involved in this great, exciting show ... <br /> <br /> KUDOS
