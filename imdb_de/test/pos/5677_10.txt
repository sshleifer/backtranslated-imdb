BLACK WATER must be one of the best Australian films I've seen in many years. My girlfriend and I sat and grabbed us in the right places. This is such a crocodile film as OPEN WATER was a shark movie. In other words, the creatures are only part of the dilemma, the trap in which people find themselves in circumstances. How the directors Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich take so much suspense and terror out of such a modest situation is amazing how they unfold. And when I speak of terror, they are not exaggerated, artificially constructed, writhing moments, but rather small touches that, if you ask yourself, "how would I feel in this situation," cause you to "fear Joke ". The performances were great, the pace and beautiful cutaways to other mangrove lives were superb and the final moments of the movie felt right. This is a fitting feature debut for two directors who should rightfully be proud of it. Take a look at this beautifully filmed and exciting movie.
