This film gives Daniel Wu the chance to make a great action movie, but I think the character of Emil Chow is really great, brave, but determined to correct wrong. Plus the main terrorist, I'm wondering about his revolution. I wonder if he does this for the good or the bad. A movie that tells us about Todd, an amnesia terrorist who until then was seduced as undercover he learns who he really is. The consequences he draws from his terrorist family give him the choice of salvation. <br /> <br /> Purple Storm was one of the best I've seen this year. The movie is really exciting when filled with massive action scenes by Stephen Tung Wai, who have won the best action sequences of the Hong Kong Awards. (9/10)
