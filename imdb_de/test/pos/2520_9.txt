A direct X file that shows the action is always intelligence. Rob Bowman's direction is sharp and sharp, the episode now looks as fresh as it did almost a decade ago. David and Gillian both perform well and both seem to appreciate the lack of luggage - it's a standalone X file that even non-fans can meet and enjoy. Junior Brown tells the two leaders during the scene, and he's so convincing that you'd think the crew was driving right into nowhere and knocking on the first door they came to. Bryan Cranston is as intense and energetic as Patrick Crump. Meanwhile, he admitted in interviews that he hardly knew anything about the X files prior to this role, which makes his performance on the ground all the more incredible. A brilliantly stupid episode.
