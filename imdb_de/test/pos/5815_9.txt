Although not the best work of Cassavetes, Minnie and Moskowitz are almost perfect in all their efforts. The plot is bizarre and charming and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive array of emotions - much more drama than comedy, unlike IMDb's profile. Yes, the story is whimsical, but not arbitrary. it succeeds as credible, if a bit forced - which I will come back to. All the artistic aspects have a true Cassavetes form: the cinematography and the camera work are a pleasure, and the soundtrack - albeit rarely there - is complementary. Besides, I think that on average I've noticed some nicks on Godard and the like - as I have in some other Cassavetes movies - (namely, the abrupt cutting of a song in a scene) that are interesting. <br /> <br /> I think the plot is well structured, with the first half being especially enjoyable. For example, Seymour's conversation with Morgan Morgan (Timothy Carey) in the diner is wonderfully funny and intriguing, setting the tone for the philosophical commentaries made throughout the film. This philosophizing - a tradition in Cassavete's films - has made the film for me. Seymour's amusing and profound monologues immediately eliminate the first impressions of him as a hippie simp - though his character is strangely similar to his in Faces (1968). However, this brought me (at second glance) to the view that it was against Cassavetes best work. I got a liking for this movie, which was missing when I first watched. Unfortunately, there are some aspects that make this movie imperfect. I find the plot unbalanced. As I said before, it is building up well, but it will take some weight here and there, especially towards the end. Due to the spontaneous style in which Cassavetes worked, and especially the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise, the quality of his product can easily go both ways. In this case, it is inconsistent. I guess most of this movie was improvised, and most of it was beautiful. Unfortunately, one or two scenes just do not work. In particular, the scene fights Seymour with Minnie's colleague in front of her house. Cassavetes allowed his actors to move freely in dialogue during the most intense scene in the film, provided that some were planned ahead. I think that was a mistake. One has the impression that Cassel does not know exactly what he should do, as he keeps fumbling in his speech, often makes no sense and makes too many actions. all this damages the scene and character development. I understand that Seymour is supposed to be a snappy idiot, but Cassel's attempts here are misapplied. Why is he cutting off his mustache? These errors are due to: lack of direction on Cassavetes part; lack of understanding and foresight of Cassel; Lack of samples and preparations; and so on. Cassavetes apparently did not learn from his mistakes when he allowed the same thing in his next film "A Woman Under the Influence" (1974) - the scene of engagement and the end. > The shortcomings I mentioned are not insignificant, but they do not ruin the movie. They just make some scenes dreadful and unrealistic, affecting the flow of the movie and affecting its potential. Despite what I've mentioned, I really like Cassavetes and all his actors, especially Cassel. This is a very enjoyable movie, though it proves the precarity of Cassavete's style.
