If you need the instant buzz that only euro sex movies of the late '60s / early' 70s can trigger, then look no further because you've just stumbled across the maternal love! Subsequent TV director Schivazappa in Psychedelic Porn (the softcore variation) is generally not considered a classic of its kind, but he beats many well-known titles by Tinto Brass, Jess Franco and Joe D'Amato for a loop. Radley Metzger was definitely ahead of everyone else when he recorded this wonderfully twisted small number for US distribution through his company Audubon. Beautiful cinematography (favoring symmetry compositions) can cause cries of "presumptuousness" in those who swear by modest back-shot skin shots. Hey, as far as I'm concerned, it's their loss, because this is an exciting ride of a movie with spins, so twisted that you might not even believe them after you actually saw them on the screen! Dagmar Lassander (immortalized as the seed owner of Lucio Fulcis' HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY) has never looked more exquisite than she is the subtly portrayed innocent (?) Researcher, who by the madman Philippe Leroy (along with the whole Kunsthaus) His favorite, one wonders if he has the good mood to mention this on his CV, since their initially violent "relationship" to the S & M-colored love story. However, nothing, it seems, is in this sick and imaginative gem of a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity. I was completely amazed and enchanted as Schivazappa had suggested oral sex during a scene (I'll let you find out for yourself ...) and Lassander's gauze-clad boogie into an incredibly groovy 60's song They become iconic, much like Sylvia Kristel's settled on this wicker chair in her EMMANUELLE time. You may not know this movie yet, but believe me, once you've seen it, you'll never forget it !!!
