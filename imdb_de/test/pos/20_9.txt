The many other comments about the movie say it all. We would like to say that we showed him around 30 in our Community Cinema last week, and that he received an average score of 8.6. So we would recommend it 100% to today's audience, especially if it's on a real movie screen and then talking to others about how our audience did it. The performance of the performing performances of the entire troupe was unbelievable and pretty fascinating. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were the stars. but all were well staffed. For our afternoon audience, most of whom are "seniors", the fact that the conspiracy was easily tracked due to the clear language and the wonderful, non-technical use of camera and sound was a major influence. > <br /> How nice, many said, to see a really great movie that's British: not even twenty years later: not full of blood and guts: not confusing, because everything is slipping around the scenes, camera shots and back and forth through the history: no shady sex scenes. Such views were even voiced by some recent statements.
