This program ran for a short while when I was a kid, I remember seeing it while I ate fish and chips. <br /> <br /> On the back of the Tron hype, this series was very much in the style of Streethawk. Manimal and the like, except for more computers. There was a geeky kid whose computer somehow created this guy - Automan. He would take care of crime and the lot. <br /> <br /> All I really remember was his fancy car and the little eye-catching cursor thing that pulled the car and it was generally helped br /> When I look at it somebody can he also remembers very little. Was it real or maybe a dream?
