There are several ways to misunderstand this movie, and some have been shown in recent comments. This is a movie that should be analyzed as a free replay of a familiar theme and therefore can not be compared to the opera, the book, or other Carmen films that were previously seen. It just stands alone and I have to say that Carmen does it very well. It's a mistake to compare, because this is the first step in denying films the chance to be independent, creative works of art. Vicente Aranda is a master of the atmosphere and the artistic direction, the costumes and the photography are extremely well coordinated to achieve a pleasant aesthetic experience. Let's take it the way it is. <br /> <br /> And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clichés in the movie. Well, historically, the film is very well researched and you can see the results of this very serious work in every scene. Not only is it an accurate portrait of the "black Spain" of Messer and Espadrille portrayed so vividly by Goya, but it is also part of the story as seen by a foreigner fascinated by the folkloric side of this society , Honestly, if you do not want to see a cliché about Spain, you should not buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in that case, these stereotypes are presented before they become one, and the ability to see them eliminates our own prejudices. <br /> <br /> Another important prerequisite for understanding this movie correctly is speaking the language. It is unacceptable to criticize the performance of an actor for not understanding his lines. If the rest of the audience did, the problem is probably somewhere else. Paz Vega has a flawless language with an Andalusian accent and everything she says is understandable and believable. Her Argentine partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, also presents a compelling portrait of the Basque officer who became a "bandolero" and her accent is well learned. <br /> <br /> No less important is a minimal open access to the material. To say that Paz Vega is "terrible" implies that the author of the sentence went to the theater for wrong reasons. We already had a critic in Spain in one of the most respected newspapers who recommended pictures that he found gay, without explicitly mentioning them. And that was not completely fair to the rest of us, especially to those who did not realize that the man was writing parts of his anatomy that many readers did not necessarily care about. I'm not suggesting that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different from those of a talented and beautiful actress who plays an almost classic role, because that's what we got. Paz Vega is Carmen and an excellent in Vicente Aranda's film.
