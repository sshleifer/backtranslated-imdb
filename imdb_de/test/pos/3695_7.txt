Without looking at the details of a good ... though somewhat provocative ... TV movie, there seems to be consensus among users that "nobody is being accused here". <br /> <br /> I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes, can be young and horny (and handsome) because he does not get as much as he wants from his mother, that does not mean he's in bed Climbing can have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he was about to watch with her, but I do not buy it. People have to take responsibility for their actions. He not only "crossed the line" by having sex with a very vulnerable teenager when he was reportedly "the responsible adult," and he said, "Your mother may never know about it." How responsible was he then? Yes, it is a good movie, but he understood what came to him. Do not fool yourself, people, that what happened was "nobody's fault".
