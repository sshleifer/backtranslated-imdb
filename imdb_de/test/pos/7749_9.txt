This show is great. "Haruhai Suzumiya" is not only a very well written anime show, but also reflects things like philosophy, science fiction and a little religion. In some places it is funny and in others "sweet" (for lack of a better term). Actually, this may lead to my lack of experience with Japanese anime shows, but it's one of the best of its genre I've ever seen. I have not seen such brilliant showrooms on a TV show since the original Star Trek. I hope the authors continue to add strange new characters and give more insight into the already great characters that have been added. <br /> <br /> 9/10
