I've seen this movie twice and its theme is an invigorating one. I've been involved with computers for many years, and this movie inspired me technologically as well as a fresh love that excited the oven of my poetic passion in the heat of falling in love. Very original idea, great attraction in the way in which it holds you, as it tells its story, for heads who need a release from the everyday realities of this life.
