I really started enjoying this show. It started slowly and did not give the chance it deserved. It's summer, so many people are away from home watching TV. I know there are some talent and singing competitions, but I like them as much as many others. Believe it or not, if the American Idol is ready for the year I miss it. Although this was not an American idol, I thought it had potential. I feel bad for the singers on the show who are really starting to grow on me. I wish they would rethink it and resume the show. I think it was a premature step to break off. My only complaint about the show is that I did not care too much about the judges.
