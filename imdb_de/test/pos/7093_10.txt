It is not surprising that the majority of the higher-rated votes were cast by women over the age of 45. This is the time frame in women's lives when they become the janitors of elderly and sick parents. In June, I lost my mother due to cancer complications and experienced most of the feelings Zellweger presented in this film. Yeah, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real, and the story's plot was extremely accurate. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for a wonderful portrayal of life and death and the promises of tomorrow.
