If Sicily is a Baroque territory with its doubling of perspective, this is part of this film's challenge to realism. And it's an exhilarating pleasure to surpass Fellini with not just one but three directors, and of course the actual Bellocchio, who made some really great films and should not be disturbed by his honor. To Manzoni's "I promessi sposi" there are a variety of settings and casting improvisations with an actual marriage. Sicily is also an area of ​​Skulduggery (you already know this version of the island, so no spoiler is involved). A comical version of it makes Sergio Castellito's work with watch dogs on the floor of the Great Hall of a Palazzo worth seeing.
