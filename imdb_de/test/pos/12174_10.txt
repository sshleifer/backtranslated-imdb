The two main characters Erkan and Stefan are a Munich comedy act. I was wondering if this is one of those typical slapstick movies where the story either does not matter or just does not exist. When I saw this movie, I was very happy that there is a cool story and the main characters really fit into it. <br /> <br /> All in all, very amusing and no ordinary German movie.
