I think this film is a stunning but deceptive film because it seems so simple and uncomplicated: a Vietnam survivor tells his devastating story, and part of the story is reenacted locally. Critics sometimes even claim that Duke's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are. We know that all documentary films are "mediated" to some degree and this one has Duke's subtle hand, especially in the stunning music, the incredibly expert selection of archive material and the management of cascading images. The evocative power of this film is amazing, starting with the title, the opening title card from the book "Revelation" and the first voice-over. This is a movie that you can watch again and again with increasing astonishment, not a simple commodity that is swallowed up on the way to the evening news with their favorite drink. This is one of the movies that you can resonate with for a lifetime.
