"The Merchant of Venice" is one of Shakespeare's most famous plays and is still performed regularly in the theater. Incredibly, however, this film seems to be the first English language version developed for cinema rather than television. In the early days of cinema, there were a number of versions that were made in the UK or America, but these were all dumbbells. <br /> <br /> The reason for this neglect of the game may lie in the sensitivity of the alleged game of anti-Semitism, a topic that has been even more sensitive since the National Socialists came to power in 1933. (This may explain why all previous versions were written during the Silent Period, but in 1908 or 1922, it would have been easier to portray Shylock as an uncomplicated villain than it was today). In my opinion, the film is not anti-Semitic at all. It should be remembered that Shakespeare did not have a permanent Jewish community in England during his lifetime. The Jews were expelled at the end of the 13th century by Edward I and were allowed to return only to Cromwell, about forty years after Shakespeare's death. As far as we know, Shakespeare never traveled abroad, so it is likely that he himself did not know any Jews personally or experienced the effects of anti-Semitism first-hand. The piece is not just about the Jewish question, but an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice. In fact, it could be a codified examination of the mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England (something Shakespeare would certainly have had first-hand) and a call for greater tolerance between them. Back then as now, traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes had always portrayed Jews as avaricious, but Shylock's main sin is not greed; If so, he would surely have accepted Bassanio's offer to pay six thousand ducats, twice as much as borrowed from Antonio. Shylock's besieging sin is anger rather than anger, and the root of his anger is the way he and his fellow Jews are treated by the Christians of Venice. In general, Jews are not only regarded as second-class citizens, but Jewish money lenders like Shylock are also special targets for abuse, even if the services they provide are necessary for the Venetian economy. The game shows the ruinous effects of prejudice. Views of this kind not only corrupt the Christians who hold them, they can also corrupt the abused Jews. Shylock's vengefulness is disproportionate to the injustice he has suffered. By spitting and calling a dog, Antonio behaves like a booric bigot, but boorish and bigotry are generally not considered crimes worthy of the death penalty. In addition, Shylock seeks revenge on Antonio not only for the undoubted injustice done to him by Antonio, but also for all the injustice he suffered through the Christian community, such as his daughter's marriage to Lorenzo. <br /> <br /> It is thanks to the director of the film, Michael Radford, and his star Al Pacino, that they understand all these questions. Pacinos Shylock initially has a kind of angry dignity, which gradually leads to vengeful rage and finally to his degradation in the process scene through Portia's argumentation to pathos. We clearly see that he was the instrument of his own destruction, but we can still sympathize with him. In my opinion, none of Pacino's performances I've seen was equivalent to the first two "Godfather" movies (not "Scent of a Woman," for which he won an Oscar, and certainly not "Godfather III"). but "The Merchant of Venice is the one closest to these benchmarks." The other theatrical achievement that stood out was Lynn Collins' luminous Portia, who voiced her lines with great clarity and simplicity, and the intelligence and ingenuity that characterizes her I was less impressed with Jeremy Irons Antonio, who seemed too passive, Antonio is a complex character, partly a loyal friend, partly melancholy thoughtful, partly religious fanatic and partly enterprising capitalist had grasped the first two aspects, it was difficult to imagine that his Antonio was either spitting on someone of a different faith or his entire risk was exposed to risky trading. <br /> <br /> Radford's interpretation of the play was written by the film critic The Daily Telegraph attacked Pacino's performance but did not like the periodic scenario and argued that Shakespeare should be put into a contemporary context if it was to be "relevant" to a modern audience, citing a recent stage production that sets the plot in Weimar Germany. I would deeply disagree with this approach. The theater and the cinema are quite different media, and while there were some striking Modernist approaches to Shakespeare in the cinema (Trevor Nunn's "Twelfth Night"), a traditionalist approach is often the best. (For example, I preferred Zeffirelli's "Romeo and Juliet" to Baz Luhrmann's). The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare in a modern form is pure intellectual laziness. We are not ready to see the greatest writer in the context of the Elizabethan society that produced him, but prefer to disguise him as a replacement of the 20th century. Radford's Traditional Approach Not We can only understand that bigotry and vindictiveness are old, universal problems, but also produce a visually striking film. In the piece, the scenes in Venice itself are characterized by turbulent actions; Those housed in Portia's country house in Belmont are happier and more peaceful. In the film, the Venetian exterior scenes were filmed against the background of a foggy, wintry gray sky, similar to "Do not Look Now". The candlelit interiors with brightly lit faces against a dark background recalled the light-dark effects of a Caravaggio painting. I suspect that was quite deliberate, as Caravaggio was a contemporary of Shakespeare. In contrast to dark or foggy Venice, the Belmont scenes (taken in a charming Palladian villa on an island in a lake) were marked by sunshine or peaceful moonlight. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Shakespeare adaptations of recent years; an intelligent and visually appealing look at a complex game. 8.10. <br /> <br /> A few mistakes. We see a black swan on the water in front of Portia's house. These birds come from Australia and were only introduced to Europe in 1596, the date the film was made. The portrait of Portia in the lead box is also painted in the style of the Florentine Botticelli, who was active about a century before that date. Lynn Collins may be reminiscent of a Botticelli beauty, but it seems unlikely that a Venetian woman from the 16th century painted in the style of Florence from the 15th century.
