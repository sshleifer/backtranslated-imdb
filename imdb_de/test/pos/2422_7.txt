I was 19 years old when I saw this movie for the first time in the theater. I have a vivid memory of another end. Not very different but clear. I watched the movie last night and was wrong. I think the following can not be called a spoiler because it never happened. The end I remember was that the boy hid completely naked in the house. Frances Austen found it easy and after she had confronted him, she slowly dropped to her knees and went down on him in front of the camera. Only his face was in the frame and it was quite obvious that he allowed it, albeit against his will. But something did not show in the film. Sandy Dennis was 32 years old when she made this movie, Michael Burns was 22 years old. In the movie, he complains to his sister that Frances is making too big a deal with sex. Yes? So, go to bed with your buddy and do it. WTF?
