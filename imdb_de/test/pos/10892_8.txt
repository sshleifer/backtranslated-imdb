There is not much that comes close to perfect storytelling and the exciting action levels GoldenEye. When it came out, it was the best game ever, and it remains strong today. <br /> <br /> I admit that this game became boring after a few months of the game and not I played it again two years later, until I played it again for the first time. <br /> <br /> There are 20 action levels, which are probably the most of any James Bond game to date. Probably the most memorable one is the tank level, which was probably the most explosive video game sequence at that time. And the shoot for the first person as well as the use of Q-Gadgets is what James Bond fans always like to use that now appear in the PS2 games. This game does have some great action and useful gadgets, but I expected a little more, even in 1997. I also did not like the fact that this game had neither Q nor M or Moneypenny or any of MI6. While watching the movies, Bond interacts with these characters at least a couple of times, but they are nowhere to be seen in the game. And vocal dialogue would have made the game livelier than the textual dialogue that they eventually used. They had the technology. They just did not use it. <br /> <br /> Probably the most annoying feature of this game is that it follows, in a sense, the story of the film exactly and is otherwise incoherent. For example, there are two levels at which you must protect or save Natalya, even though she can look after herself in the film. There are also some unnecessary levels, such as the boot level, where you have to defuse some bombs (which is not in the movie), which adds nothing to the plot. There are even some levels where you can save Natalya, but at the beginning of the next level she is trapped again. As? <br /> <br /> Alright. Even these little things can not really suppress this game. And although I prefer the newer games, you will not forget this Bond experience in any case. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
