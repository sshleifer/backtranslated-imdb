Lent the video for a slow Saturday night. At the first sight I thought it was funny. It took a while for us to get used to the American caricatures (here we are more attuned to British grotesques), but very pleasing. <br /> <br /> I saw it again next night and I'm really warmed up for that. The characters even seemed to be more human. A movie that you could watch several times and get more out every time. My wife hated it, however. I assume that there is no sense of humor.
