The progeny is about a husband and wife who experience loss of time during lovemaking. Unaware of what this bizarre experience means, they try to continue their lives. The man begins to question the bizarre event and gets help from a very annoying psychiatrist. He comes to believe that foreigners are responsible for the passage of time and that the unborn baby, whom he thought to have once been his and his wife, actually belongs to the foreigners. If you ask me, this is a great scifi / horror story. An extremely dubious real scenario with alien kidnapping and hybrid breeding is definitely a thumbs up. I love all things related to aliens, and this story definitely provided some good ideas. So if you're also interested in extraterrestrial things, you should be pretty happy with Progeny. At least in terms of history anyway. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the movie is pretty average overall. With average action by all actors. Yes, also from the thoroughly awesome Mr. Dourif, who still delivers the best performance. Although the black chief physician delivers his lines really well. There are a few points in the film where part of the delivery is awful or laughable, which is fine in my book. I like it cheesy and it had some nice smelly cheese, and I mean it in a good way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you can not blame all the actors with a less than stellar script. I was not particularly interested in the mother Hysteria the movie was going for. She wanted a baby so much that she neglected everything and dismissed what her loving husband (who is a doctor !!) said to her. It has almost reached a point where you did not really care what happened to her. <br /> <br /> The Progeny is another film by Brian Yuzna from the icky-sticky Film Society. Again it delivers some slimy effects, and again it delivers a pretty unique horror story. If you are interested in scifi / horror or are a fan of Dourif and / or Yuzna movies, there is no real reason not to check this movie if you have the chance. A generous 7 out of 10.
