I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he said he was watching Hoods and it was funny. So, as I said, never against the family! The demand for more lines is fine because I often want to express my own opinions. If something is misspelled, it is most likely my vision and not my brain. This gives me another chance to make my shots on The Departed. Knowing exactly what's going on in the last scene with no prior knowledge usually means it was not that exciting. All you need is a good director, the same guy I think he made my favorite mob movie "Goodfellows," but in a completely different way. I have to see hoods to make sure it's not better than "The Departed" Gibbs is
