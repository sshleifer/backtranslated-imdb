Once upon a time, Troma, the company that brought us movie classics like The Toxic Avenger, Rabid Grandma, Poultry Spirit, Redneck Zombies and Surf Nazi Must Die, decided long ago to adapt Shakespeare's famous play "Romeo and Juliet". This adaptation decided to spice up the story by adding perverse sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, body piercing and incest, and they managed to create a bizarre but funny movie. Anyone participating in a Troma production should know what to expect, and this is a disrespectful and perverse comedy with a lot of political impropriety. Expect a lot of nod to other Troma movies and a lot of reused gags (turning over cars and pushing heads). Many may think, it sounds like bullshit that only idiots would find funny ... they may be right, but at the same time they may need to be a little lighter and enjoy the madness and sanity of Tromeo and Juliet. <Br /> <br /> With a great cast, a witty script (by James Gunn and Lloyd Kaufman), a matching soundtrack and lots of great visual gags, Kaufman has once again managed to turn things around and hell to digest everyone. Get popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends and enjoy Tromeo and Juliet for what it is, a Shakespearean adaptation with lots of balls. The end. <br /> <br /> 4/5
