Are you looking for proof that real life is more entertaining than fiction? You just found it. This great documentary about an aspiring filmmaker (Mark Bortchart) who does not want to be beaten is the funniest movie I've ever seen - probably because he's one of the most tragic. Strangely, the more I watch the movie, the more inspiring I become.
