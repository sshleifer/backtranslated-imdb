Luckily for Bill Murray, this is such an easy project as he pretty much has to carry it. Meatballs is the story of Camp Northstar with low rents and how its advisors deal with campers and each other. Then much is done of their wealthy rivals from the opposite lake called Camp Mohawk, who are held in a two-day Olympics. In addition, Bill Murray clowns and makes a pretty memorable movie debut. <br /> <br /> The film is sprayed with medium-sized laughter, giggles and more than a few laughs on the way. The biggest laughs come from the pranks the nerdy camp leader played. Three of them concern the counselors who take his bed outside in different places while he sleeps. Morty or "Micky", as everyone calls him, wakes up on the roadside, is strung in some trees a few feet above the ground and finally floats on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some fun moments in which the advisors strike each other, but this is a PG rated film that has little mischief. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a serious note with a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course, it's up to Murray to teach the child how to open up and give him the confidence that he will have to run a marathon during the Olympics. The sentimentality of Rudy's situation seems to have been greatly addressed. Notice how after leaving the bus, Murray sees the child sitting alone in the grass and says, "You must be the short depressed child we ordered." You wonder if this line was really in the script or that Murray had only Adlibing while the cameras were running. In other words, Murray might as well have said to Makepeace, "You have to be the actor we hired to play the stereotypical, lonely kid you see in most summer camp movies that does not fit." But before it's all over, Murray's performance makes this plotter more than bearable. He really seems to have a good chemistry with Makepeace. <br /> <br /> The film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. Very little of the events that are shown to us is even easily credible, but "it does not matter". This is a pretty good movie on many levels. Do not let the absurd 5.6 rating of this movie put you off. Murray will always make you laugh. Just be warned ... avoid the sequels !!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman !! 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
