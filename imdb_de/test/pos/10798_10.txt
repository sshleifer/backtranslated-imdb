If you think of "Oliver Stone," the films that come to your mind would be his biggest and most controversial, like Platoon, JFK, Born on July Fourth, or Natural Born Killers. Do not talk to radio normally. It's actually a pretty small movie. More than half of the film plays with Barry Champlain in his radio station, who speaks into his microphone. But believe me, this is one of Oliver Stone's best films and should NOT be missed. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a character study. Barry Champlain is a rude, self-destructive, risky talk show host who says too many things and gets into trouble with his boss, his lover, his fans and even some Nazis. He does not like his audience and his callers, and many of them do not like him (whether he or she likes, but have no idea why). But in the end he says in his show, "I guess we're hanging out together." <br /> <br /> See Talk Radio even if you do not like Oliver Stone movies. You might be surprised. I was sure. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
