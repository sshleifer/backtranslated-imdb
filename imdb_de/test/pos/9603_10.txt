.... could it be that ITV would not release this absolute classic because they would show their current series of Mike Bassett as it is? When I talked to some co-workers about Mike Bassett, I mentioned that Bostock's Cup was a far superior offer, and I was surprised that I was the only person in my entire office who actually saw it. That can not be right for a movie that has to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, ITV does not have the best record time for producing comedy that they would jump at the chance to at least repeat something that is really funny. If this could be combined with a lucrative phone competition that we believe the bus driver will go next to, they might be interested. <br /> <br /> Come on ITV Original to see quality comedy / drama. Do the decent thing. Repeat it, then you get it on DVD.
