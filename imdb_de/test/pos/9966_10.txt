Seriously, where is Al Pacino's Oscar nomination for this movie? Is it true that we take him for granted at this point in his career? Pacino here is extraordinary. He gives a complex, heartbreaking performance as Shylock, the Jewish money lender. The movie was great on the whole, with beautiful shots of Venice and a perfect pitch to hear. All the other actors are also doing good work, but the real reason to see it is Pacino. I've seen all nominated 2004 Academy Awards, and I have to say that Pacino was stupid with the play, the lack of campaigning by the studio, the late release date with no big boost, or most likely all of the above. In my opinion, the best performances of the year include Jamie Foxx in Ray, Don Cheadle at Hotel Rwanda and Al Pacino at the Merchant of Venice.
