This is the most humane and humane film I have seen in a long time. The irony abounds, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a movie that does not preach, but does not condemn. It is a cinema that is at its best, yet the story is made up of several real events. <br /> <br /> Which of the two is more amazing, Sarandon or Penn? It's easy to say who is more personable, but it's hard to say who is more persuasive. They are just great. <br /> <br /> You may think that all killers should be killed, or you argue that a life without parole is not a life and that death is more merciful. Whatever your personal feeling, this film gives you the opportunity to take a break and rethink. <br /> <br /> In the end you just want to sit in silence and think. That's what great drama does, there's catharsis, it creates a moment in time, a shared memory that touches our humanity.
