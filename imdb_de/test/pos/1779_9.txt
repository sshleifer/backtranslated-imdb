'Identity?? , , , , I am part of my environment and I have parted from them and it is possible for me to make these distinctions clear so that we can have an identity and what is in our identity is everything that has ever happened to us. ""). <br /> <br /> Pieces like Decalogue V have intimidated me, I felt that if I accepted them then I would compromise something, what I thought before is really not worth it. what naturalism is trying to say, I experienced a tangible catharsis, one that was started bit by bit and is still alive, that I still have to reckon with, it still works in me. <br /> <br /> The movie It was not likeable in itself, it does not have to be said that the death penalty is bad, there are certainly angry people, whether they should die or not is for another film, what Decalogue shows is that they are good, beautiful people Those who kill other people when their society and their original urge rouse them up. <br /> <br /> The "science" of naturalism has helped me appreciate Decalogue V. It's not worth writing about why I am had not left before, but I now see the value of doing art so as to "make" people or maybe people do something. <br /> <br /> There is a method for Lazar's compromise. , , Light. Much of this meaning makes sense only with hindsight. This should not be too strange for an idea: For how much respectable science does not make sense in retrospect? I flinch when I say it, but naturalism seems to be so much more productive and less nihilistic if I have the strength to say to myself, "This ruin, this process, this natural process is making me fight the system . " <br /> <br /> I do not believe that naturalism paints a doctrine of the demise of humanity that challenges us to give up our powdered wigs and go into the woods. Instead, I think that it catalogs evidence and experiments that we can ignore, of course. We can ignore everything we want, if we want to give the naturalists more bodies to bury. <br /> <br /> For despite their aesthetics, which was designed specifically without sympathy for the probable and catastrophic fate of their characters, they are thrilled by reader's innocence and literary snobism. I see the delightful risk in the hope that the audience understands what to do with what it sees. As mentioned above, the danger is that fate will be cut in stone. There is danger in the hope of rejecting the natural, because it does not correspond to their world view. <br /> <br /> And I do not think the "hopeful" either needs to be rich or happy. I have not seen it, but it seems that the film American Beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstances as a visionary or consolation. There are ascetics as well as troublemakers and beggars who wonder where their humanity is, who grieve because they can not find anything that separates them from their landscape. <br /> <br /> Landscapes can be portrayed powerfully and beautifully, but in reality landscapes do not appear. They change safely and dramatically, but only through a great law of nature over which no one really has power. However, it can not be changed by itself.
