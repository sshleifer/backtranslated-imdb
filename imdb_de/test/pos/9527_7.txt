In Victorian times, a father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of high treason and sent to the country. The children adapt to their new situation, make friends, and call on the help of a friendly old man whom they wave to on the train to help reunite their family. Actors who make films are often not very good at it. However, Jeffries, the veteran of dozens of British comedy classics, is one of the few exceptions. His brilliant conception (he also wrote the screenplay from the novel by E. Nesbit) of a classic British children's story makes this film an art. While the story can be highly idealized, the wonderful performances and incredibly moving Yorkshire Dales settings make for a truly memorable movie. The photography of Arthur Ibbetson is the definition of good filmmaking - it's not a setting for telling the story, but at the same time the images create a fabulously romantic atmosphere. Agutter is just perfect, because the kind-hearted Bobbie (okay, I fell in love with her early on, but I can not argue with anyone) and Cribbins, whose comic pedigree is like Jeffries, is as Perks the Unforgettable Humble, but proud carrier , This is a movie out of time; romantic, charming, very pleasant and with a nice na√Øve feeling of warmth all over.
