H.O.T.S. is a funny movie for a trip back to a time when Skin Flicks had a more positive program of fun. They were just made to tickle and have a few laughs. Everything looks less cynical and dull. The girls are all natural and some are playboy playmates. The simple conspiracy deals with a group of young women who open an unsanctioned nurses' house to return to the corrupt students who have despised and insulted them. Instead of today's common tricks, most hijinks just make innocent fun. The women are decent actresses for this genre and are usually very attractive. To keep our attention between the above without scenes, we have mafia followers, a stolen bear, a hot air balloon, a funky housemother and the cheapest robot ever seen. There is even Danny Bonnaducci from the Partridge Family. If you have a sense of humor, then let yourself go and enjoy light entertainment.
