This film is a tour de force by Julie Taymor, who directs the set and the masks. No one comes close to their imagination on the modern opera stage. Since shooting this film in 1992, she has enjoyed great success in filming and directing musicals. One can only hope that she can be persuaded to return to the opera one day. I would like to see a ring cycle being directed by her. The current Rheingold in Covent Garden has giants with oversized hands, just like the characters in this movie. The current Butterfly at ENO uses Japanese puppet games. Chance or proof that Taymor's influence is omnipresent. Taymar uses fancy costumes, masks, puppets and origami birds to recreate the story of Oedipus on a stage on stilts above a lake. Red ribbons are a recurring theme. They are used as an umbilical cord when Oedipus is born, they hang down after the glare of Oedipus' eyes and are used in a breathtaking effect as a crossroads when Oedipus slays his father through puppets. <br /> <br /> This neoclassical opera ballet by Stravinsky found legitimate ambiguity until it came to life through this movie. The music is uninspired but harmless, and Philip Langridge, Jesse Norman and a very young Bryn Terfel make the most of it. The singers are quite immobile in keeping with Stravinsky's wishes. Min Tanaka is the dancing Oedipus to Langridge's singing Oedipus. This leads to a slight confusion towards the end of the dance of Oedipus, who is stinging the eyes of the singing of Oedipus. <br /> <br /> The libretto is in Latin, but do not worry if your high school Latin is a bit rusty. There is a helpful narrator introducing and describing each scene in Japanese.
