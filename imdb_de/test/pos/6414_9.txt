(The description of the mood of the film can be considered a spoiler - because in fact not much is done). <br /> <br /> Great ... <br /> <br /> Is it of special interest to me for dystopias and utopias? Is it for the atmosphere of the movie. Or is there more magic? If so, it is certainly the ultimate person ... <br /> <br /> This film is undoubtedly extremely artistic / artificial (depending on the taste). I can imagine that most people who hate seeing slow movies (and those of Tsai Ming Liang (whom I did not enjoy otherwise) are one of the slowest I know, who suffer during the movie 'People are unable to slow down and pass time - and watch them without feeling wasted - you can take this piece as a torture or therapy ... <br /> <br The theme on the surface The lack of communication - even if we live in rabbit cages - side by side - but not really together People are tired, a little tired and can not describe it, they just do not want to touch the others, touch them , talking, facing them as if they were gone, the big block of flats seems empty and the ever-falling rain awakens the strange melancholy inside, and sometimes it has to be something abnormal, unexpected, an unwanted decay like an L och in the concrete floor - so we can reach each other. <br /> <br /> One of the possible ways to look at it is this: Do not overlook the inner world of the characters - consider the entire film space as in itself. And ask - why is it there? Where can these depressive states and moods arise? Is there a place for them, they have no right to be here? And look for the answers (if you need them) between the walls and hallways of the block - rather than inside a barely transparent mind of a man. <br /> <br /> The key to understanding is not to be understood - to understand Let borrow a movie - as a subject of investigation - in itself - and in the end safely return to our colorful and "normal" acting reality. <br /> <br /> Then you may reach Me - the feeling of a real, possible, non-pathetic hope that we are still essentially human beings ... and this state of mind can greatly help one to live in this world ,
