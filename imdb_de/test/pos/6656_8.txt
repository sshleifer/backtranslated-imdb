I saw Cold Mountain and the English patient again this weekend. The first is a civil war melodrama about Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who repels the army to return to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), a girl he hardly knows. Both films were lovingly staged by Anthony Minghella, who does an extraordinary job. Although Cold Mountain is very good, it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less foliated backwoods. Romantic epics need a compelling heroine. The English patient had Kristin Scott Thomas, who was perfectly cast as a clever, seductive and gorgeous Katherine Clifton. The main problem with Cold Mountain is Ada, who looks stupid and gloomy and lacks quality that makes you believe that Inman could be obsessed after a kiss. As an actress, Kidman has a limited reach. She usually plays strict women who are opposed to stoicism. Kidman was also too old to play the love interest of ing√©nue and Law. The film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and vulnerable. For someone who was allegedly in need and almost starved to death, she seemed ridiculously well-fed and covered. Kidman was so well-groomed that it looked as if she had spent three hours making-up for every scene. Michele Pfieffer could have played the role perfectly in her younger years. Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement. Renee Zelleweger was dressed more appropriately, but her animated performance chewed the scenery, but perhaps she tried to compensate Kidman. Jude Law was in his own silent movie in the role of Ulysses, but played his role well. Ray Winstone was excellent as a London / Southern villain. <br /> <br /> During the Civil War, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and might speak monosyllabic. However, if you see the BBC adjustments of Dickens, Austen, or Mrs. Gaskill, everyone is articulate. Maybe that's unrealistic, but it would improve my conversation.
