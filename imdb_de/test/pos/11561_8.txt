Okay ... it's 2005, and if you finally watch this movie, you'll probably say it's outdated. But here's the thing, the script was bold, the notoriety of the music industry was just as bold at the time ... and it took some time for music created by African-Americans to be promoted to the same level as white. In some cases it is still - but in the 70s, this movie dealt with some "backgrounds" that many never knew. Now we have "American Idol" - "Pop Idol" and other such things that involve us in the minds of record execs and how they think they should market something that sells and does not market talent. <br /> <When I was a kid, I loved the release of "This is the way of the world" on Earth, Wind and Fire, which included some of her biggest hits: "Shining Star", "Reasons", "Yeanin ' , Learnin '"and the title. I did not know that this was a movie soundtrack ... until I moved to Los Angeles and got the wonderful "Z" channel. <br /> <br /> The "Z" channel featured this movie as part of a "Harvey Keitel" review. I had no idea that Harvey Keitel had so many films - and when I saw this movie, I was surprised. This movie is not a cinematic masterpiece, but deserves more credit than it received. It's a nice little movie. Harvey Keitel is more than a "vanity piece" for earth, wind and fire. He does an excellent job as a torn disk manager trying to "combat the system". There are a lot of lessons to be learned and many "insider" transactions that have been suspended. <br /> <br /> If you can find this uncut, it's worth a look.
