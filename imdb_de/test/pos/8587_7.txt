In the film Lumumba, we see the faces behind the monumental shift in Congo's history, after being reclaimed by the Belgians, and we see the motives behind the men in whose hands the raped and starved land fell. <br /> <br /> Lumumba is not a movie for the hyper masses. It demands the attention of the viewer with raw, truthful action and complicated, full dialogue. The main part of the plot is shown only by actions, it is based almost entirely on words, but there is a recurring strand that is only action, and it is the stroke of genius that makes the film an illuminating and powerful panorama of tense political struggle Independence of the Congo gave birth. <br /> <br /> This movie is real. It is a rough representation of the rulers and those on the street. It is content-wise eye-opening. And it moves in the passions and emotions of his superbly portrayed characters. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a history buff, a movie fanatic or just a good storyteller, Lumumba is a must.
