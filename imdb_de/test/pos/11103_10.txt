There is something about true stories that make them more interesting than fiction. I think it's the fact that the truth was always stranger than fiction. The Hawk and the Snowman tell the true story of Christopher Boyce and his buddy Daulton Lee. Boyce (Hutton) is a retired old boy and intellectual who tries to find a job that can support and entertain him. His FBI father can pull some strings and give his idealistic son a job in the defense department. Boyce has little responsibility and seems complacent with his colleagues. Over time, however, Boyce begins to learn top secret information that makes him question the morale of his government. The idealistic Boyce soon sees the illegal operations that the CIA carries out, especially in Australia. Boyce finally decides that he will forward some of the top secret information he turns to the KGB. Of course Boyce's mistake is the assumption that the USSR is the good one because the US is doing bad things. Over time, Boyce and his drug dealer Lee (Penn) sell their top secret information to the KGB. What was once idealism becomes capitalism and espionage. The strength of this film is the incredible performances of Hutton and Penn. Although one of them starts with the best of intentions, both are soon in an infinite downward spiral. Good direction, music, everything. Not just a great movie, but one of my absolute favorites.
