The "Rabbit Seasoning" by Chuck Jones, the second in the popular hunting trilogy, is often considered the best of the three. I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of awesome cartoons, but I'd have to admit that 'Rabbit Seasoning' is the best-cut script. It focuses on the language, while Bugs and Daffy go through a series of complex dialogues in the great tradition of Abbot and Costello's "Who's on Next" routine. As a longtime Daffy fan, I've always been happy about the hunting trilogy, because it's consistent that Daffy gets all the best lines (the famous "Pronoun-Trouble" is one of the classics of all time) and does most of the work. Beetles play the role of a cool manipulator, while Elmer, as always, is the confused dupe. The hunting trilogy is so much fun that Daffy and Elmer threaten bugs so little that it basically just pulls back and has a few light laughs. Elmer falls into whatever trap is imposed on him, but it's poor old Daffy who gets the worst of it and gets shot in the face over and over again. His beak gets into more and more ridiculous positions. It builds everything on the inevitable climate declaration "You are despicable". Rabbit Seasoning is a true classic, a complicated example of the impeccable timing of Chuck Jones.
