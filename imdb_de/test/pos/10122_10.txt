As someone who often goes to the movies, I have to say that this is one of the most impressive films I have seen this year. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. gave outstanding performances that allowed the audience to lose themselves in the different emotions and really feel for the characters. It's nice to occasionally see a movie that does not just depend on special effects, but allows the story's characters to touch the human psyche on many levels. I wish Hollywood would produce more movies of this caliber.
