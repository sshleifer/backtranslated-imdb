I remember watching this movie on VHS with friends many years ago. At first I thought it was a boring car film. But, to my surprise, it was one of the best movies I can remember. <br /> <br /> It has a good story and above all some great Aussie cars and road races. I loved Fox's car the most, which was a working Dodge Charger. The paintwork that was done on this car, in my opinion, really excellent :)! <br /> <br /> There is also a black 57 Chev with two doors that will later be included in the movie. <br /> <br /> I got a copy of this movie on VHS at K-Mart here in Australia last year. I had plans to convert this movie to DVD myself, as I believe it is a movie that is worth the conversion. But to my surprise this weekend when I'm through the DVD movie, I found DVD. So of course I took it with me because it was the only copy. <br /> <br /> Whether you really want to see classic street racing with real muscle cars, including a great story with no rice burner insight. Then this movie is for you !!!! Here is some additional information from the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> He will win at any price Fox is a young man man who lives in the fast lane. He thinks he's the fastest guy on the street - but road races are illegal. If he does not accept his last challenge, he could lose his girl ... if he accepts it, he could lose his life. To live dangerously, to live fast and to win at any cost is her obsession. They do not return, they do not give in ... and they do not ask for help.
