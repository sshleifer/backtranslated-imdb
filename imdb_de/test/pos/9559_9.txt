In a previous comment I mentioned how much I liked this movie - better for the second time. I can not escape that opinion. Strangely, I can not find anyone who liked it. <br /> <br /> My mother wanted to see it, but some friends told her "No way". My sister and her family saw it and half of the theater was halfway. <br /> <br /> My wife suggests that the Australians see the characters as ordinary, everyday Americans and that's why it's not funny. But hey, most Americans think that all Australians are like Crocodile Dundee, so it's nice to have the other shoe on the other foot for a change.
