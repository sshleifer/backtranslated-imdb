My opinions do not flow in most cases with the majority. I tend to be artistic, imaginative and different. This film was reminiscent of Frances Ford's "The Black Stallion," which creates a fantasy setting to showcase the beauty of a great creature that is not readily available for peak performance except on this multitude of documentary films. Unlike these nature films, this offering uses the best filming techniques the industry has to offer for a diva who creates one of the most sensual superstars (the cat) on the screen. This fantasy shows the cinema A love affair that develops between a French soldier (he is also very nice) in the Egyptian desert and a female leopard he encounters when he encounters an abandoned Egyptian temple is fascinating. I bought it from the bottom of my heart. If you are the least open to fantasy and appreciate the grace, beauty, power and sensuality of the cat, you should enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The only mistake in my book was the end. It was perfect for a final in Romeo and Juliet - that would have surpassed me. <br /> <br />
