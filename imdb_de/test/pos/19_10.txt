This is one of my three favorite movies of all time. My only criticism is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts that showed the actors individually and not as a scene together, but the performances were so great that I forgive him absolutely wonderful; brilliant. The script is great and gives a very good picture of life in the theater during the Second World War (and thus, as it was in the 30s). Many great, subtle touches, many broad, exaggerated strokes, everything made perfect. Scene after scene blows me over, and then there is the heartbreaking climax.
