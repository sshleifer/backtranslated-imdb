At the beginning of the film, Cagney's Johnny Cave character told his gumshoes at the Office of Weights and Measures that unscrupulous shopkeepers had cheated American consumers of more money than the entire National War Debt last year! Then he goes out and buys a particularly greasy, green grocer for the short sale, who offers him a sack of sugar that is four ounces (oh, the scares !!) and a thin chicken, and a thin chicken that is the scales of his butcher quite liberally referred to as six pounds. After which the fur - or in this case feathers - flies. Uh, fly. When a political-racketeer attempts to derail an investigation into the stupid poultry supplier's practices, our hero becomes a lone wolf leading the war of housewife weights across America. After all, there are four cents here and a quarter there and before we know it, we have anarchy! The news of his intransigence soon reaches both the mayor's office and the governor's office, and Cagney becomes a significant man. If it sounds silly, it's not - the dishonest retail practices are just a plot tool (or, as Hitchcock McGuffin would say), and although unfamiliar, it works just as well as any Treasury Agent or G Man-Anthology, The Battle is conducted against shady crooks who operate outside the common good of the country. Clearly the production standards are Grade-B, but it's Cagney who makes this movie a pleasure: this was his first film outside of Warner Brothers, after he sought the release of his unreasonable contract in court, and he seems to feel comfortable amused himself immensely - the performance recorded here is intelligent and crackles with its unique energy and surefire radiance. The presence of Mae Clarke gives the entire production a definite Warner feel. The supportive players show solid performances, and the story moves deftly after a rocky introduction that seems to start three or four roles in the story - but sit back and enjoy it for the Cagney showcase and the time capsule of depression.
