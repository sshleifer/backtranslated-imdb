For cheese from the late 80's that's not that bad. There are many pretty funny one-way liners ("That was great theft!" - "Thank you!") And Madonna does a good job; Nothing worthy of mention here, but that goes for both razzies and Oscars. I'm curious to know if the movie would have been better received using her regular (pre-British influenced) voice instead of the hyper-bronzy accent. Well. As a side note, I met one of the actors who played a motorcycle cop during my work. He said it was a funny movie he could work on, but he gave me the sad news that the actor who played Buck, the UPS delivery man, died about a year after Who's That Girl
