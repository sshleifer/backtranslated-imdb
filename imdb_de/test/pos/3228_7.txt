The Gilmore girls are a mother who had a daughter at 16. Now the daughter is 16 years old (in Season 1) and they live like sisters. To share everything, to trust completely. <br /> <br /> I like The Gilmore Girls, but I do not know why. The mother named Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and the daughter named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel) are both very beautiful women. They are both funny and charming in their own way. There are some funny minor characters like Luke (Scott Patterson). He and Lorelai may both like each other, may even love each other, but none of them really acts. They have their little moments. There are a few other supportive characters, most of which are very funny, and with their winning touches. <br /> <br /> What I like most is the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is developing into an adult. The dialogue between them is fast, sharp, funny and sometimes touching. The band they have is beautiful. Feel good with the Gilmore Girls, give it a try.
