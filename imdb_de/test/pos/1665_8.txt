The fact that it is still a predictable movie after 50 years says a lot about it. It's smarter and more interesting than almost all current films of the same genre you can find, and has a kind endearing sense of innocence. I'm not a big fan of this type of movie, but I could watch it all without boredom, making it a good movie that can be seen with someone who does not necessarily share their taste in movies. I liked the black and white palette, the excellent casting, the clever raid scene where you guess what trick they'll pull next, and the end like everyone else. Looking at the robbery sequence reveals the power of silence, which unfortunately is so little used in today's cinema.
