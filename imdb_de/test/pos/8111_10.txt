The Great Dictator is a great movie. Charlie Chaplin manages to be extremely funny and witty, and at the same time he delivers in his satire a strong statement against fascism. The anti-Nazi speech of Chaplin at the end with his values ​​is one of the great moments of the film. In this film, I felt that there was a higher level of intelligence that went beyond truly intelligent filming.
