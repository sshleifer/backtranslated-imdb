This movie was really a breath of fresh air from the load of Hollywood crap that I've seen lately. The acting is great and the characters are captivating and strangely adorable. There really is not much to the story, it is simple and works well. A simple movie to sit and enjoy. The atmosphere was fantastic and the sets really helped drive the movie and offer some nice pictures. The film obviously has aspects of horror, but is more geared towards the humorous side. You will not laugh hysterically, but you will smile all the way. The humor goes very well with the characters and the excellent acting does not hurt. I really saw this movie because of the fact that Ron Perlman was there. His role is slightly smaller than I expected, but it does not matter; The rest of the cast is more than enough to keep you busy. If you like horror, look at this. If you like comedies, look at this. Look at it anyway, it's really good.
