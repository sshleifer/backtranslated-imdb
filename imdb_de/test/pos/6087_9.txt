"The English Patient" can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean, whose far-reaching epics such as "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Bridge on the River Kwai" must inspire director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed and plays like "Lawrence" in North Africa, but during World War II. The story is complex, but it comes down to a forbidden love between a meaningful and often difficult archaeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas. The story is based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje is told in flashbacks by Fiennes' Count Laszlo de Almasy - the title character. The fact that his name does not sound like an English name plays a key role in what unfolds. In a plane crash, he was badly burned when the film was opened. He is cared for in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the far-reaching movement over time and place and the development of characters beyond the two unfortunate lovers. The film makes it clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living or worth dying for. If you are romantic in the heart and can appreciate a movie without the usual happy ending and simple moral codes, you will find that "The English Patient" speaks directly to you. <br /> <br />
