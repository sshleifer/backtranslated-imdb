Funny movie, I had a great time watching it. The star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes referred to as Steve Arkin) is a popular actor from Turkey. He has played in many tough roles, epic sword films and romances. It was fun to see him with an international cast and some really lousy-looking gloves. If I remember, it synced in English, which made things even funnier. (somehow as if John Wayne spoke Turkish).
