Since Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry, I expected a movie that would tend to a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary, the poet is portrayed as being sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, bad father, liar and hypocrite, and perhaps a coward. Of course, one could argue that all of these things are beneficial to being an artist and, above all, a poet, since, among other things, art serves to undermine the standards of conventional morality, but I do not think a positive role model will help could be out of such a bunch of personality traits. In any case, I found the other male hero of the story, Captain Cillic, a loveable character. The two female roles were played by actresses Knigtley and Miller and were especially charming as she played songs in a sleek outfit to inspire the bombed Londoners during World War II. Another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays in relatively progressive milieus that believe that age-old conventions can easily be surpassed. The atmosphere of lightning was as convincing as the portrayal of the different views of people who have experienced war, as opposed to those who talk about possible political outcomes. I think you would recommend such a movie.
