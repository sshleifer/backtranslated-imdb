Tipping the Velvet (2002) (TV) was directed by Geoffrey Sax for BBC Television. The basic plot is a story of growing up for the protagonist Nan Astley, who is well played by Rachael Stirling. As a teenager, Nan works in her family oyster house. Everyone expects them to stay at home, then marry a suitable husband and fit into family life. Nan expects that as well. <br /> <br /> Everything changes as Nan meets Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes), a beautiful and talented performer who dresses in men's clothes and conquers the hearts of her audience. Among the spectators is also Nan, who is sexually attracted to Kitty in a way that she does not feel attracted to her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows Nan to London and through her ups and downs (terrible) as a lesbian and sometimes a male impersonator. <br /> <br /> As typical of the BBC, every minor role is played by a great actor. The BBC has a depth and breadth of performing artists that is really great. None of the supporting actors stings in my head - they were consistently good. Both Stirling and Hawes are wonderful, and their acting carries the movie with them. <br /> <br /> It is always sad to be reminded how difficult life can be for someone who does not fit in with social life. I know that even in the US lesbian life is not easy. Imagine the obstacles of love and happiness for lesbians in Victorian England. We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.
