River's Edge is a great movie, and it's a shame it did not make a big deal in movie history. In the 1980s, there were a number of coarse-grained films about the school, but of all the ones I've seen. that is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film takes on a disturbing plot, adding the topic of teen slackers and their indifferent attitude towards things, taking the story to another level. The movie works because the central story is interesting and played by complex characters. The movie begins with a murder. We follow the murderer, called John, as he goes back to school and tells his friends about what he did. Instead of giving the expected response, most of them barely react and the strongest reaction the killer receives comes from Layne; Who's making it their top priority to help John clear up the mess and get him out. The other friends ponder the crime, and soon one of them goes to the police. River's Edge offers a variety of great performances of its young cast. Keanu Reeves has a reputation for trading in wood, and with good reason. but it fits in very well with this early role and this performance is easily one of his best. Crispin Glover is the biggest challenger to the slightly crazy Layne. Glover is always in the foreground in every movie he's in and gets a bit over the top; He convinces as the lead in this film. Reeves and Glover are well supported by a talented young cast that includes Daniel Roebuck and Joshua John Miller, as well as the great Dennis Hopper in a wild role. The film is characterized by a very dark picture, which looks good with its nihilistic tone. The main characters are all from the "Slacker / Stoner" generation, and the way they really are not interested in murdering their boyfriend is more shocking than the murder itself; and the point that the film tries to make about modern society is both strong and clearly defined. The movie is also quite funny because of some lines of the characters; But the humor is pitch black and obviously this movie was never meant to be a comedy. All in all, this is an excellent and memorable movie that is definitely worth a visit!
