This is my favorite movie of all time. And I always think of it as John Huston's Requiem. <br /> <br /> I must have seen it at least 20 times and never tired of it. The mood, the script, the singing, the dinner, it's like being invited into someone's house and watching the events and not being able to attend, even if you want ... It's a rare treasure, this movie and I can do not write enough praise for it. <br /> <br /> It is incredibly busy, with some Abbey Theater faces and the wonderful tenor voice of Frank Patterson. The eponymous poem by Lady Gregory is one of the most moving ever written. Anjelica's scene, going downstairs while listening to the song, is one of the best performances everyone has ever seen in the movie. I cry every time I see it ... for all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> We all lost love early and cry for our young hopeful self. <br /> <br /> Donal McCann played in too few films for my liking, he simply loved the stage work and stuck with it, and it's our loss that we no longer have any of his performances in the film since he does this delicate role through expression and expression so much depiction of a deep love for his wife, which is never reciprocated and he conveys this inner grief when he knows that. <br /> <br /> If you want your action and plot movies to avoid this, there's no beginning, no center, or just a lens with the characters and all the little ones at a dinner party in Dublin 80 years ago Nuances and shades of personalities that are so beautifully portrayed. <br /> <br /> Bravo to all who participated in this production. 10 out of 10.
