I was fortunate enough to see this movie before the release last night, and although I did not expect it, he actually enjoyed the movie very much. The rescues and ocean impacts were amazing, and certainly made for a moment of sitting tension, probably all the more knowing that there are guys doing this for a living. The weaker parts of the film are largely about stereotypical scenes. I will not spoil the movie, but that really follows the rules of An Officer and Gentleman, and these moments give it a bit of a cheesy aftertaste. <br /> <br /> As I said in this movie, it's pretty good and worth a visit as long as you get past the clich√©s.
