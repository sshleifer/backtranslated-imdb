You, the Living (2007) Mordant. I've never written that word, but it comes to mind here. Let me have a look. Well, it's part of it - corrosive, but also funny. So corrosive funny. This is a damn movie, with so much dry, dry joke and quirky humor it's impossible to dislike him on any level. Filmed in a very economical style, often with a static camera and really balanced, stable compositions, as in theater stages, we see a short staging. <br /> <br /> But that makes it normal, which it is not. Ordinary life is crazy, ironic, adorable, shy and depressing. And impossible We, the living, have to live, and since we are alive, we can also acknowledge this. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you think you're laughing and do not know why. Exactly. And the publicity material somewhere said it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python, and what they mean is that it has the dry, quiet, scrutiny of Ingmar Berman's famous Swedish films, but it has the crazy, somehow touching elements of British comedian. <br /> <br /> I would definitely watch at least half an hour of it. Part of me thought I had gotten through - the rest continues in a similar compilation of little skits and moments that are gradually evolving, but there's no grand episode or climax of the usual kind. There are some great moments later, even just the attention for the thunderstorm, which leads us nicely out of worldly human events. <br /> <br /> Filming is great in its classic controls, almost like a series of Gregory Crewdson scenes (actually surpassing the photographer). And the acting with all her usual, non-glamorous folk is right. An amazing, beautiful, strange experience.
