It's my favorite movie because there's so much going on that you do not even see it at first glance and wonder at so many things. "Did Kieslowski mean it or is it in my head?" For example - Is the judge intended to be God or a superior being? <br /> <br /> Irene Jacob is also brilliant in Double Life Of Veronique, though there are some superficially prettier actresses, but none who manage to impart beauty of mind with physical beauty the way she does. <br /> <br /> Tritingnant is also great without really saying much, and the things he says are excellent, like his answer to Valentine. , , "His".
