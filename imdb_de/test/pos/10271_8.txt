A smooth production that arouses the interest of the first scene in which Max selects a ring in a jewelry store. Much of what follows reminds us of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream," in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's friends. This is where Max and Lucien, who love at first sight, mix with Lisa and Alice, and Alice complicates things when she calls herself Lisa. In addition to the happy mess Max tends to get involved in incidents that evoke memories of the time two years ago. And because Max has many of those dreamy episodes, we're going through one flashback after another, in my opinion too many, because the first time I watched the movie I was not sure if I was in the present or in the past, I'm running Corridors, stairs, through doorways, elevators, etc. I accept all this in a fast-paced movie, but do we have to let so many people collide? After four collisions, it no longer has any effect when you apologize for the pun. Top marks for art design! The apartment itself is really nice with its tasteful decor, but I wonder how some young women can afford such luxury in Paris. It is always exciting to have a person who aims to commit suicide by jumping out of a window. It's also in this movie when Max gets out at almost the same time. But one or two kisses soon make him feel better. If you find your way through all the flashbacks, you are finally at the airport, where Max's devoted sister gives him a very loving kiss. It can be said that she solves the complications of love, like Puck in a "Midsummer Night's Dream".
