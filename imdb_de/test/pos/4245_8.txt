Remember the time when this movie was made by Robert Downey Sr. a very good entertaining black awareness feature that was a subway hit in California-Los Angeles and New York at the time. A hippie classic in which changes that occur in the business world are striking, refreshing and interesting comedy. Not conforming, unlike the founding society of 1969, is still very good, but today's American life is quite different from 69 for the baby boomers.
