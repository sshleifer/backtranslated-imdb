Ted Danson was a good choice to play Gulliver. Although he was mainly comedy, he shows that he can do drama just as well or even better (though it's a lot of humor). It's hard to keep an eye on the American accent, especially since his character is probably English, but that's just a small thing. <br /> <br /> All the villains are equally well staffed: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O'Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Despite the fact that most of them are either tiny humans or giants they are 100% credible in everything they do, and their motivations are very clear, eg the constant suspicion of the Lilliputians towards Gulliver, Grildrig, the hatred of the (giant) dwarf on him for abusing his position as a jester Dr. Steenburgen is great as Mary Gulliver (another English 17th century figure with an American accent, but no matter). She is a deeply tormented figure because she has waited nine years for her husband to return home. When he finally does, he talks about tiny people, giants, a flying island and talking horses! Despite the strong element of fantasy in the story, Mary is a very believable character. The special effects are stunning, especially considering that she was filmed on TV at a time when CGI was in her movie Childhood It looks very realistic when we see a 6 foot tall man walking through a city filled with people who are 6 inches tall. <br /> <br /> The Cameos are also great: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All the great actors who create a strong side cast that complements Danson's outstanding acting skills. <br /> <br /> The Houynhnhms and the Yahoo are probably the most effective element of satire-side history: a society of speaking horses that have no vices that humans have, while the Yahoo's are primitive, disgusting people, who powerfully mate and appoint their leader, depending on how disgusting he is. The study by Gulliver and Mistress is also very good, showing the differences and similarities between people and Yahoo. <br /> <br /> By far the best version of "Gulliver's Travels" and one of the best mini-series ever.
