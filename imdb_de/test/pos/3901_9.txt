This was a fascinating movie that really got me excited. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy and he has a wonderful performance. His great sympathy, coupled with the way his character breaks through the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I waited anxiously for the whole house of cards to collapse around him (and subsequently himself as his confidant and mute witness). After the end of the movie, it took me a few minutes to relax. I was so busy. <br /> <br /> All-round performance, not just at Macy. Arkin was pretty good, as was Cromwell (he was surprisingly heavy). In short, I recommend this movie to all fans of Macy and / or the murder mystery. However, you may want to prepare to feel a bit guilty.
