I saw this movie about 12 years ago, and I still remember it as if I had recently seen it. So much has influenced me this movie. <br /> <br /> Considering that this is a 1950s film, I think it was ahead of its time. It surprised me how much it has maintained its integrity in this area, which some people considered taboo at the time. Very realistic to show the turbulent and heartbreaking journey an addict decides. One can only imagine how the audience at that time was influenced by the realism of this film. <br /> <br /> I personally think that it was one of the top five screenings of Frank Sinatra on the big screen. When others talk about movies that deal with mental illness and / or addiction, I recommend The Man with the Golden Arm always as one of the five best viewers.
