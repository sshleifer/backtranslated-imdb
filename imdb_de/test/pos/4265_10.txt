Sometimes the mainstream news media seem to be driven by a group of no-brain reporters. They simply listen and report what others are reporting. <br /> <br /> This documentary shows what can be found when more overhead is spent on reporting. <br /> <br /> True journalism should be about giving people different perspectives on what is happening so that they have a good chance of forming their own opinion. <br /> <br /> This documentary and the popular media reports will help you. At least for me, there was a lot of relevant information about the purpose / motivation behind today's protests around the world at various political summits.
