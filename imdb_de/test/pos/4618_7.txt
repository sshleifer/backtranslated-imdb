At the Cannes Film Festival in 2006, he gained some fame and seems to be yet another modern and profound school drama. <br /> <br /> It's about a group of teenagers going through a revealing and desperate day of school. Everything revolves around a suicide - at the very beginning - at 2:37 pm. The characters are somehow connected. What moves them is described by short interview sequences that are strictly recorded in black and white. The characters are well written, the drama is fascinating (especially Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcus are discoveries). <br /> <br /> Let's stay with the film technology. That really impressed me. There are rarely any cuts, usually the camera follows a protagonist as in Gus van Sants' Elephant. Some scenes are presented more than once, but from a different perspective (here: character). This is certainly reminiscent of a slowly evolving but enthralling atmosphere that literally draws you inside. The colors are vivid, somehow inappropriate considering the hard action - but that is nothing less than a smart contrast, a disturbing "everything is good". The use of lighting is always sufficient and underlines the actual mood of the characters. And finally, there are decent placements for music. <br /> <br /> 2:37 itchy somehow from the beginning. It's not about compromise or a laugh. It summarizes what psychologists would define as terrorist moments. This film focuses mainly on emotional chasms. There is no one who can not deal with any kind of neurosis, even the smaller parts shown (eg the teachers) seem to be in a state of disorder. And that's why this movie is not really good. The summary of the pervasive tragedies is unrealistic for the bones. There is no: friendship, love, smile, truth, passion. There are: forgery, humiliation, despair, illness and beatings. It's like being hit hard in the face all the time, but after the first hour you're deaf. This strip will hold you until you discover something very educational in the end. <br /> <br /> To be sensitive and outstanding: 9. Being technically innovative and original: 9. Being one-dimensional: br /> <br /> Forms a solid 7 out of 10 points.
