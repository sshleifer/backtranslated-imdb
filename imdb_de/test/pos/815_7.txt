"Blind Date" is one of three stories made by author Vida Hurst. Many familiar faces in this 1934 vintage. Mickey Rooney as a musty little punk. He seems to be in the movie for comedic and homely "family values". Jane Darwell plays the strong-willed mother again, as she had done with Grapes of Wrath and the Oxbow incident. Ann Sothern is Kitty, who was with Bill (Paul Kelly), but she meets the rich Bob Hartwell, played by Neil Hamilton, who may be better for her or not. It's safe to say that this was done at the very beginning of the Hays production code - at a certain point, Kitty says she can not be alone with him when there's no one else in the house ... what a change from only a year or two ago, when everything was all right. Good solid conspiracy, but a lot of talk and mushy love stories. It begs the question what a girl should look for in a man; should she consider herself a man of integrity who treats her kindly, or simply finds a man with a lot of money, as most films from the last 20 years have advocated ...? and how do men change when their situation changes? Pay attention to violence in the foreign dance marathon scene. Television viewers from the 1960s will recognize Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon from Batman. There are also a few comic dramas in the off-screen series for some of the actors in this movie a love triangle. Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer, who was 20 years older; Rooney was married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) have beaten off in real life. The title "Blind Date" has been used several times for movies, TV series and even cartoons, but none of them seems to have the same story as this one.
