I had to get this movie because it was not where I live. I waited patiently and the wait was worth it. I totally fell in love with this movie. The chemistry between Walters and Grint could be seen, since they also worked together on the Harry Potter films. The woman who plays his arrogant, righteous mother has really convinced me and how much a hypocrite she is, I believe great work to play the role. I just wish we had seen the real sex scene or more of it. LOL, but of course we have to use our imagination to do it, as it was below. (giggles) I totally thought the movie was worth the wait and see if you want a good movie. Rent this movie. I have to say, Rupert has done a really good job and it's nice to see him making films outside of Harry Potter, although I totally love him as Ron Weasley. The whole cast has done a great job and I hope Rupert continues to act outside of Harry Potter to expand his skills!
