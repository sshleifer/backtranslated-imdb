If "Love Me Tonight" is the musical for people who do not like musicals, it has to be said that "The Gay Desperado" is definitely not a musical for people who do not like opera. In fact, although it is apparently based on a comic operetta, it is not a musical at all, but a fake bandit story with interpolated, unrelated arias to show the voice of a character; and what a voice it is. <br /> <br /> Nino Martini, as the young singer Chivo, who joins the bandit troupe to get a spot on the radio (no, the action makes no sense either later ...), has a glorious one golden tenor, whose style is not dated since the recording time. The trills and warblings of some of his musical contemporaries are a bygone fad, but it's easy to imagine Chivo "Nessun Dorma" facing a World Cup crowd and leading the charts. Although he has a captivating smile and a decent dramatic range, he is unfortunately totally unable to act and sing at the same time. The result is that the otherwise fast-paced movie shudders to a halt every time Chivo lays his hand on his chest and begins to declaim, and the viewer's tolerance for the outcome is likely to depend on his appreciation of operatic performance. Aside from this drawback, the film is a pleasing broad-brush satire about Hollywood conventions, and especially the Mexican bandit stereotype, which achieves the ultimate goal of all these parodies by making its characters engage the viewer's interest if the joke would otherwise stale. The bandit boss and his buddy have the traditional double-act relationship, there's an enigmatic peon with a carved teak face and a spirited heroine (a young Ida Lupino) who performs the generic image "They say you hate me, but you really love me "routinely with a refreshing twist. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is entertaining and quite funny, and I feel I have my monetary value - but it can not be denied that the musical interludes are admirable in their own way, they perform to serious problems with the stimulation.
