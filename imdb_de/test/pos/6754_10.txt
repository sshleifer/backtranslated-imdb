I still can not believe that Starevich made this movie back in 1934. The animation is just perfect, and amazingly, with all the advanced technology we have today, there are few animation studios that are capable of producing a little gem like this one. It has everything: a great story, beautiful warriors (though in some cases it's a pathological kind of beauty), special effects ... Well, it's definitely not a kids movie, but it's a must for anyone seriously interested in animation.
