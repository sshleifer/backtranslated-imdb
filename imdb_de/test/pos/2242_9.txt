Okay, there was that weird hole in the plot that could drive a Zeppelin, but how well was that emotional stuff handled? It would have been so easy to go down to the cheese dairy, but the author did it. The image of the ex-female cyber-man making crying noises when she saw her reflection after she regained her feelings will remain with me forever. This is twice as much, that the monsters have shown a soft side and have been presented sympathetically, the last being the last Dalek from the first series, but it worked from Jove. The other ex-wife, who had been "upgraded" on the eve of her wedding, and Jackie Tyler recognized her husband after she became "cyber" and you have a permanent neck lump. Go on!
