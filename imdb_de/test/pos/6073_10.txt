Since 1996, I've seen this movie first. I have never reached the end of my satisfaction. I feel like I want to see more and more. My God, I do not think it was ten years ago, and I can believe that. I almost remember every word of the dialogues. I love this movie and I love this novel, absolutely perfect. I love Willem Defoe, he has a strange voice to spell the words "Black Night," and I keep saying it without getting bored. I love the music of Szararem, it is so spiritualistic that I have come to another world deep in my heart. Can someone feel what I feel and someone could make the movie like that? I do not believe it Thank you Ondaatje Thank you Mingela.
