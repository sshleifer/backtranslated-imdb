This is a powerful movie that seems to have never returned after the censorship period of Joe McCarthy. It influenced me as a Jewish teenager who had friends of different colors and whose family had suffered in the second quarter of the 20th century among the fascist regimes in Europe. In contrast to the later rip-off "On The Waterfront", which seemed to use some of the same themes to adapt to the forced political correctness of the time of Hollywood, she told her story directly and with respect for the characters and for the reality it became fictional reflected. It was an antidote to "Gone with the Wind," "Birth of a Nation," "Triumph of the Will," and so many other glories of hatred and violence. I would place it next to the recently released German movie (also virtually hidden in the US), "Rosenstra√üe". <br /> <br /> I remember that the TV version, also black and white in format as well as in the story, was black from some stations, because the wife of the black hero was white. As a young civil rights activist, it has led to a conflict for me, on the one hand against smoking cigarettes and, on the other hand, against the boycott of a sponsor of the television program in Georgia, a major tobacco company (I do not remember) which one else has someone?). <br /> <br /> I would like to find a CD of the movie or TV show to make my sons look something that expresses my opposition to racism in general (as opposed to combating racism against Jews) and recognizing the inherent connection between racism and militarism.
