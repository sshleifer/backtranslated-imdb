If I think the movie is a bit high, you can blame it on sentiment. This is one of the first films that I can remember and totally love. I saw it in drive-ins here in California in the late '70s. I was already a big fan of "The Muppet Show" on TV, so I was prepared for the movie and the film did not disappoint. Basically it takes the whole absurdist ethos of the Muppet show and transports it from variety to a road movie. Kermit the frog is in search of celebrity; Not because he wants to take champagne baths and drive in a private jet, but because he wants to "make millions of people happy." Naturally. <br /> <br /> On the way, he picks up all his beloved Muppet friends, preferably Fonzie Bear, whom he meets in a run-down bar to stand up. They sing "Movin 'Right Along," a song that has always charmed me with its happy melody and friendship and shared discovery. He also meets enough Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer movie, including comedy stars such as Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle, and Mel Brooks. Especially Brooks has a pretty boring bit, and you feel like Henson could've cut out some of these cameos if he was not afraid to offend the stars. However, as befits a road trip movie, Dom DeLuise is the first person he meets. The ending is one of the stranger examples of the literal demolition of the 4th wall that you will find in each "Children's Film". The Hollywood dream seems to collapse as a real rainbow breaks through the Hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery. I am sure that this should have something to do with Jim Henson's personal or spiritual experiences. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie with Muppets. If you or anyone else wondered why the Muppets were so popular in the '70s, considering how bad the movies have been over the past few decades, I think this movie has at least aged well to give a clue ,
