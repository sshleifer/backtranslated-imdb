Oh yeah! Hollywood remembers how to use the good old formula, and when the lightning strikes, that's a pretty wonderful feeling. Rarely does Hollywood create a masterpiece, because lately there seems to be more concern that you have to hurry up and get the most rewards in a hurry, or there is the question of too many cooks being there. As a rule, good scripts are the result of a talented writer who completely controls his property, understands his material, and is a good writer. Then there is a small important part that is often neglected by marketing geniuses who so often lack creativity and vision: A good actor. <br /> <br /> A good actor can make the difference between a mediocre, half-cooked attempt and a fully realized film that may not be an important and relevant movie, but adds to its genre and may become a classic of that kind , We only get a few romantic comedies, and we are people starving for them. The sexy humor of "Sex in the City" is the romantic but stormy relationship between Big and Carrie, and people flocked to "Mamma Mia" because they had a romantic relationship skilfully played by Streep and Brossnam. It could have been a stupid musical, but it touched us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "Nights" gives us more of that with the amazing talents of a woman doing great work in romantic films, Ms. Diane Lane. Since her time as a child actor, we have seen her talent, combined with her appreciative soul, make us look into the hearts of the protagonists of history. A few years ago, she teamed up with Mr. Gere to offer us, as a woman unsure of her consequences in "Unfaithful," a torturous, romantic, and sexy performance, a work that would at least be a success can do Oscar. She is back and does a more impressive job in this romantic gem than a woman who has given up her romantic outlook, and suddenly realizes that there might be another chance around the corner. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lane makes this movie pulsate with intelligence and passion. Her facial expressions convey volumes about the different emotions that her character undergoes. We can read frustrations, yearnings, despair, anger, hope, loss and a reach that is far removed for many of the marketable types Hollywood is constantly pushing down our necks. Here's a mature performer with the gift of projecting real emotions and allowing us to connect with the material in a way that moves us when we become part of the experience. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lane is such a triumphant joy as she goes through transformations from the first scenes of the movie to the very end. Her discoveries become ours when we celebrate with her the power of hope and love. She is able to bring back the unsurpassed joy of a person in love, much like a teenager does, and yet she never lets you consider her character stupid or irresponsible. Her eyes are expressive jewels that can even move the cynical in the audience. She is one of the stars who can do wonders with just one look. It's the classic feeling of yesterday's big films. Her work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of Hepburn, Davis, Garson, women who played everyday characters and made them memorable because they created complete characters. <br /> <br /> We admire those great actresses who reenact the legends of real life and are rewarded for it. Half of their work is done through the mysticism of the characters they embody. As much as you may think, it is the roles of Lanes in this film that make a more impressive performance, as they are created from scratch, have a personal touch and without any prior theatrical material support, such as plays and background art famous legend whose life is paid tribute to the canvas. Lane's character is a woman whose experiences could be any of us. It represents our dreams and emotions with quality, class and just the right feeling. It is a remarkable achievement and we should be grateful that we can still find such a remarkable performance today. <br /> <br /> There are some adjectives I could use to pay tribute to their work, but I can only say that in my humble opinion every single frame of their work in this film is one of the greatest performances ever brought to celluloid by a living performer. Thank you, Mrs. Lane.
