I do not want to write too much about the movie, but basically it's an action / comedy with a bit of romance about two men who meet in unlikely circumstances and become street people. Fantastic performance by Robert Carlysle and everyone else involved. An ingenious 'baddy' who really makes you hate him. Some great funny lines - really laugh loud, great action and a great plot. Choice of music and ambiance everything fantastic, brilliant in all directions and brilliantly written. I can recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good British movie or a good deal of action. I do not know why the movie never left. If nothing else, watch this movie for one of the biggest finals ever. Nothing to give away, but the heart really beats!
