Call it manipulative if you want, but I fell for it. Sure, there could have been more character development. Yes, there could have been better filming and less consistent "Movies of the Week", but Ed Harris was impeccable, Cuba Gooding charming and touching, and we face the people in real life, as many of us really know the motivation of others. Not many. We got a little insight into the motivation of the coach (in my opinion, a very provocative dialogue, which should not be neglected). In my opinion, this was a lovely tribute to a person who left his "comfort zone" to another person, and in the meantime, he touched hundreds of more people. A lesson to which I must all remember. Why is it so hard to do the right thing? I can recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone who has a heart. You will not be disappointed. Bring your Kleenex with you. 8.10
