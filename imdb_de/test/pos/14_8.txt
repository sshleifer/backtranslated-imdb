I participated in an advance screening of this movie, which is not sure what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher. Both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. While the underlying "general" plot is somewhat familiar, this movie was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher performed well, playing each other very well. The human weaknesses and strengths of their respective characters have been incredibly played by both of them. The scene in which Costner confronted Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard's rescue elite was the movie's most memorable emotional moment. The "specific" act was an education in itself that represented the personal sacrifice and required physical training that the Coastal Rescue Coast Guard of the elite Coast Guard must undergo in preparation for their only mission and responsibility ... to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and "wow" ... I have not seen such a raging sea since "The Perfect Storm". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's "Carnivale" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard in Kodiak, Alaska, in a convincing and persuasive role as a leader with the requirement and the necessary ice water in his veins. The film miraculously gives way to overdue exposure and respect, and eventually the Coast Guard. It had applauded the audience in the end.
