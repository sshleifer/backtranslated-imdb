I saw that over three years ago at the Hong Kong International Film Festival. I went in without expectations, as Christopher Nolan was not a name then, but it sounded interesting and proved to be one of the best things I saw at this festival. It worked well on the big screen. The technique of cutting scenes from the sequence added to the mood. Mr.Nolan ended up giving a good account of its creation, enough to stop anyone from becoming a filmmaker! I liked it better than Memento, though perhaps because of lower expectations. And the fact that it was more of a kind of house movie.
