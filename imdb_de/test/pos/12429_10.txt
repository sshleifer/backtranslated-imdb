If you made a really good black movie, added a few little Jeepers creepers, and then a jaunt with a touch of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a house with 1000 dead bodies ... you'd have MONSTER MAN! I went into this movie, I did not expect much, but I really enjoyed the movie. The whole premise is really kitschy, a monster man in a monster truck hunts people, but it's so funny that the writer / director does not expect you to take it seriously. Justin Urich is a comic book and should have a promising career. He is identical to Jack Black. the only problem with the film is the incredible hero role eric jungmann played. But all in all, if you're looking for a really fun movie that will tear you down until you roll in the aisles, and at the same time scare the fuck off of you ... Watch this movie.
