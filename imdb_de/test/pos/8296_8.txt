Family happiness falls apart when father, rich in wealth from the beginning (Michael Ontkean), becomes poor and can no longer support the family. Then mother Faye (Jaclyn Smith) has to take on the role of breadwinner in the family and starts working to feed the family, while at the same time managing family life on her own for a while. Not always as good, but as good as she can. Family life is not much easier when the father learns that the son Lionel (Joe Flanigan "Stargate Atlantis") is gay and with his lover John (Joel Gretsch "The 4400") also an old friend of the family lives together Father makes Lionel, that he is no longer welcome in the family. Lionel was the one who meant the most to his sister Anne (Leslie Horan) during her education because the family neglected her. Anne can not bear that her father cut the strings with Lionel, so she ran away from home. Since this was not enough, the son Greg (Brian Krause "Charmed") logs on to the marines and is sent to war. The plot in this film can sometimes feel a bit thin, although it is still very realistic, which makes it worth seeing. As this film illustrates many sensitive relationships and situations, I would think that it is best appreciated by a mature audience, even though it would not hurt for teenagers to see it and get something to think about before adulthood.
