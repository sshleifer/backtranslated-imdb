House of Dracula I liked much more than Frankenstein's house. Carradine is much more passable and his acting is not as ridiculous and exaggerated as in HOF. The actors deliver solid enough performances. The subplots (such as the monster, the village grower, the village idiot, the hunchback nurse, etc.) are well mixed, so that no one in HOF is a strange splinter. Run better than the sewn together yard. The hunchbacked nurse is as likable as the hunchback in HOF. The doctor is very good. In addition, Lon Chaney adds a stylish touch to his wolf man. Twice worth seeing. A classic universal horror with the typical flair of the 1940s. Especially good is the performance of the doctor before / after his blood was contaminated with Dracula.
