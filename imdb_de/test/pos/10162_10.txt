Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and Jo McKenna (Doris Day) travel to Morocco for a vacation where they meet a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel GÃ©lin) in a bus. The next day, this man is murdered, but before he dies he tells Ben a secret; an assassination will take place in London. The rogues kidnap Hank's son (Christopher Olsen) to make sure Ben does not reveal their plan to anyone. Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) is a very intense thriller is awesome, as always in Hitchcok's films. James Stewart is wonderful. Doris Day is a delightful person and actress, and she can also show her singing talent. The song Que Sera, Sera plays an important role in the movie. This movie is a movie with many classic scenes. In the last scenes in the Albert Hall, without dialogues, you can barely blink your eyes. This movie is now fifty years old. Time has not diminished in any way.
