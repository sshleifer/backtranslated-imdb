Oh my God!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooo much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so incredible ... I loved it as a kid and I still love it as a grownup. It's my favorite Disney movie from allllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should see it, watch and love it. My friends and I see it a ton ..... It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is at heart a child or a child. My favorite part is the song and dance number with all the strays and Thomas O'Malley. The authors / producers / directors have nailed this piece completely ... yeah, nailed it to the wall. <br /> <br /> xoxo ~ Wolly ~ xoxo
