Uzumaki, is a visually stunning movie, and I do not think anyone can argue that. But unfortunately the story is a bit flat. <br /> <br /> The movie is still entertaining. It uses its wild style to tell a somewhat non-existent story. The movie almost only works on its characters and style, but in my opinion it leaves much to be desired.
