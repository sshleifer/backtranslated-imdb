I can not say that this show is perfect. Perhaps all previous commentators will remember the old slot from Tuesday 10:30, which was filmed by the butchy humor of Butch Elvira Curt ("There's a Space Shuttle with a 747!"). Oh, the glory of scrambling, pressing any button on the remote to let it change. <br /> <br /> Given the fact that comedy can not be pulled into a showcase and creates the comedic genius of the truly Canadian Trailer Park Boys. But hey, they try it. <br /> <br /> This show is by far one of the better original shows. However, none of the following will laugh at the apparent "players" who show their stupidity when picking up girls: a) "Stupid" Girls - Obviously, they can not realize that they are exactly like the girls on the show. Unaware. Get on the male flesh, you can call yourself a whore tomorrow and get his name. He looks good, he has to be popular and nice. HAHAHAHA !!! Oh, but you would never do that! No one would ... if they knew this happened <br /> <br /> b) Unsocial guys who think women are nice guys - It's obvious these guys will succeed in what you fail or not at all only to be experienced to bring your urge to a boil. Take a closer look, they are usually shot down. They say stupid things. <br /> <br /> c) Girls with Respect for Each Other - Obviously, it is wrong to misconstrue to hold your highly female species in real life situations. Nobody is played. Women are not objects, they can not be played because they are all very faithful angels who go to clubs to talk politely, without fear that guys will try to pick them up. Oh, wait ... hmmmmmmmm <br /> <br /> Just as EVERYBODY will say that this show is not funny and does not teach you anything, I have to take the other side. The show can very well describe how relationships work for men and women. The way they think and how they think and social hierarchy. It's fun to see and hear the guys making absolutely idiotic comments on the things the women say ("My grandfather died recently" "Oh ... well, are we having fun tonight?"). <br /> <br /> It's also an association. The place where people enjoy themselves and lie down. No matter who you are, you go to a club to interest or pay attention to someone. Boys go there to test their game and pick up girls. Girls go there to flirt with guys and find the one that best sweeps them off their feet. Lighten! <br /> <br /> If you are a type, you will learn a few things about the different approaches and the different effects that they have. If you are a girl, learn how these "spiky" whores really think, and learn to distinguish them from real men. The next time you get separated from one of those douchewads, you find out that it's not because of him, but because you're stupid and thought he was the best guy ever, when he gave you a heavy cock all the time was
