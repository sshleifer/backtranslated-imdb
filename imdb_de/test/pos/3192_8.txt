I first saw Love in Limbo on free TV five years ago, and since then it's been a movie I'll always remember as one of those movies you see and will forever be influenced by. <br /> <br /> For the uninitiated, Australian film has a long history of making funny comedies about lovable losers, and Love in Limbo is a prime example. While Russel Crowe is the only actor (though he's everything a movie needs these days), the rest of the Aussie cast is good - yet he steals the show as a nervous, nerdy, virgin loser. <br /> <br /> The general premise is similar to American Pie. A group of friends who want to lie down and become men. As you might expect, the entire movie focuses on it (with a subplot about the leader's mother and various other incidents) and is full of humorous situations that bring him to an inevitably sweet end. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed American Pie, you do not expect it to be the same - but expect the same conventions to appear. Love in Limbo is not a cruel romantic comedy - but it definitely has its part to laugh at, fist pumping moments where the good wins and the situations that every Australian has or anything to do with it. <br /> <br /> See it if you wanted: American Pie, almost famous. Strengths: Good Aussie cast, easy to understand, good perv value. Weaknesses: Predictable at points. My rating: 8 out of 10
