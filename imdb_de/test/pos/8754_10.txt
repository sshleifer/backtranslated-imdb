The best thing to say about the movie "Traffic" is that it drew attention to the British miniseries "Traffik". As many people have noticed, the current film suffers from the story being cut short to accommodate the short attention span of moviegoers and the turnaround time of theater owners judging the film's success at overpriced food sales. <br /> <br /> I recorded this mini-series for the first time in 1990, when it was shown on public television, and I've often seen it. The entire documentary-style series has a strong element of tragedy and downfall as the characters turn to their final destiny. The strongest of the three stories is that of the Pakistani family, who was forced into the city to find a way to keep body and soul together after the poppy plant was burned by the army in a staged demonstration of power for western politicians. The strains of the family are similar to those of the family of rickshaw pullers in "City of Joy". After all, the farmer finds work, but he goes along with his pride and honesty. <br /> <br /> The Pakistani part of the film has a special significance today as it fights Al Quaeda's supporters, and gives understanding the support of such movements among the disadvantaged poor of Pakistan and Afghanistan, who rarely receive money flows into these countries. The film makes it clear that farmers barely see 25% of the aid, which should encourage them to grow other crops. <br /> <br /> With the American inability to see anything other than black and white - Good guys v. Bad guys - it's interesting to see a different view where there is no black and white, only grayscale. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler. The only problem I had with the story was that instead of going back to fiction as in the past, as in real life, things had to end with the "bad guys" to find out what would happen to them , That being said, this was fine work, as we rarely see. The cast was outstanding and the German and Pakistani settings helped the film to a "different" feeling (what a change it made if he saw Germans as something other than the bad guys in a WWII movie).
