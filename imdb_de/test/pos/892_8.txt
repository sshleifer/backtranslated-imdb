Like NIGHT STALKER and then X-FILES, the show prepared a fantastic situation and the main characters had to take care of it. In contrast to these, the heroes did not have an empty bag at the end. They usually had tangible results. It was also made clear that the "good guys" were in a dirty job, where they sometimes had to pull unpleasant things. Imagination, joke, acting, which was not always too serious ... I miss it. One reason is that I find it hard to think of too many shows - besides BANACEK - that caught the audience as well and immediately caught their attention. The authors were characterized by extremely unlikely, if not impossible situations for which the characters then had to find an explanation. Explanations, which had often penetrated 90 degrees, turned into the uniquely unexpected, but still made sense. I also agree with another reviewer that the Anabelle character was underused, but when she was on the screen, it was not just for the eyes. She was quite competent and stood by the two male executives when she sensed that the point she was making justified her. A rarity these days. Sullivan? If he was not in the department, he would work for the KGB or the CIA. He's such a cold, ruthless guy. He knows how the world works and realizes what it takes to get the job done. King? It is clearly a game for him. One he stands out for and invites in ideas for the detective / spy novels he writes as his supposedly 'right' job. He's probably the funniest of the three, though they all have their moments and often. I agree that the later spin-off series, which contained only its character, did not have the interest of the original.
