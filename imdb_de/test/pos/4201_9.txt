Playing the role of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently did not receive any credits. Too bad. <br /> <br /> All Dead End kids do their job wonderfully in this 1939 entry. It's weird to see them with their Brooklyn accents in a western setting (I think that should be Bowery). They even show some swimming skills. <br /> <br /> I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing / love / crime story. My favorite is currently in the fight scene at the end of the movie. Busby Berkeley shows his expertise in dance film as John Garfield moves his feet and as we watch the movement, the camera moves to his face. I'm not going to reveal why or when, but his facial expression at that point probably brought the public of 1939 to the movies. <br /> <br /> Some will think that John Garfield Frank Sinatra looks very much like many scenes. Only his face. Actually Frank did not make any movies, so maybe Frank looked like John. The boxer named Smith in the movie looks like a clone of Ed Begley Jr .. Now I have to tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you look at the movie, look at Grandma's hands. May Robson does her part well. She seems to have hands that wander a bit. In a scene where she and a crowd walk into the boxer's locker room (John Garfield), watch her touch the lying John Garfield while carrying only his suitcases. <br /> <br /> A great ending. Many wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> The best line could be at the gas station, "... eight gallons, that's a dollar twenty-eight ..." Tom Willett
