ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" is the story of a nobody driven to fame. Only to realize how he lives his dream, he has not imagined that. We've seen it all before (in better movies), but this human story captures the world of rock'n'roll with a brutally honest and insightful advantage. It receives a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. The script by "Crazy / Beautiful" director John Stockwell depicts the hardcore universe with memorable images. It does not explain what it's about, it shows us. <br /> <br /> "Rock Star". Originally titled "Metal God" stars Mark Wahlberg as Chris "Izzy" Cole, a Pittsburgh office, delivers a salesman who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, the fiery singer of heavy metal rock group Steel Dragon. Although Chris already sings for his own tribute-rock group called Blood Pollution, he does not insist on writing his own songs, but insists on playing only those of Steel Dragon, just as they perform them. His group is annoyed with Chris' obsessions and gives him the shoe. <br /> <br /> This devastates Chris as well as his supportive parents and loyal friends Emily (Jennifer Aniston of TVs "Friends"). Then he receives a call. It's the Steel Dragon Band. You saw Chris Tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer. In no time, Chris races into the dizzying world of the sudden star - from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately it is not as rewarding as he expected. <br /> <br /> A true story inspired the "Rock Star" concept. Ohio-based supplier Tim "Ripper" Owens actually replaced Rob Halford, the singer of Judas Priest, after singing for a tribute band. The rest of the movie is probably fiction, though most of what happens must be the experience of many other bands. The film describes the different qualities of being a rock star. It explores the aspects of touring, personality differences, the risk of drug abuse and violence, relationship issues, sexual freedom, dishonesty and the extreme measures taken by producers to please fans and keep their popularity high. <br /> <br /> I saw all of Mark Wahlberg's films, and this is the first one that deserves my affection. Wahlberg, a former singer / model, has made films like "Fear", "Boogie Nights", "Three Kings" and most recently Tim Burton's missing remake "Planet of the Apes". I start to admire the young actor more and more. Although he has not appeared in many successful films, he has taken many chances and played different roles. "Rock Star" is his best movie so far. I can not think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed Chris Cole's struggles and aspirations. Wahlberg really makes Rock Star Rock. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston also lights up the screen. She creates a chemistry-rich relationship with Chris that engages the audience. It's tragic what happens to their relationship. We take care of these characters very much. <br /> <br /> During the film concert scene, director Stephen Herek (who also directed "Holy Man" and the live action version of "101 Dalmatians") creates a thrilling atmosphere. He captures the scenes with an intense urgency and a raw, unmistakable energy. The music numbers provide the movie with the best scenes that are most involved. <br /> <br /> Herek Herek can not hold the energy and the excitement. At the three-quarter mark, he loses the spark as the film becomes boring and uncomfortable. I understand where history has to go to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it had before. In "Almost Famous", a much better movie about rock and roll, there is even in the saddest scenes a certain interest and life. Here it feels like the filmmakers lose their passion. <br /> <br /> The message comes a little too late and suddenly in the story. The film becomes a moral story that wants to offer us a juicy goal. The filmmakers might as well stop everything, appear on screen and say, "Now audiences, the moral of the story is ??" We understand the topic, but it is too immediate. The personal discovery for Chris must be gradual. Fortunately, all this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the movie, barely enough to completely destroy a whole good eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good cause. "Rock Star" is not a great movie. See "Almost Famous" for a remarkable movie about rock and roll. For Marky Mark, however, this is a turning point in his career. <br /> <br />
