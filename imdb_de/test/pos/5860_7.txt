this is a homicide detective who is fighting a few young, rich children who can do no better than plan a complicated murder and cover it up. They seem to outsmart the police at will. They mock the detective by planting clues and leading them on a wild goose hunt. This movie has a neat plot with a few good twists at the end of the movie. Sandra Bullock does a good job as a woman on the sidelines. She is not sure of herself and fights with her inner demons. Keep a man in her life, especially partners, they seem to be leaving her for some reason. All in all, this is not a bad movie, it lets you guess the very shocking ending.
