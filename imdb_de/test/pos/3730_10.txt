Great movie. Post-apocalyptic movies kick in the ass. This is no exception. Maintain the pace and interest without a little dialogue (mainly through good character development). The fight between Reno and the hero was tough. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval weapons to show how primitive and wild humanity had become without their technology and Guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and the end was a bit spacious, which meant that I found it difficult to understand the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence. All in all: Kick-ass character development, design, story without dialogue cushions and above all the ever-appreciated, barren landscape of a post-apocalyptic desert landscape.
