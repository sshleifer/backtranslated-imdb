Anyone who has ever doubted Ingrid Bergman's ability to comedy has to look only at the "Bells of Saint Mary". OK, so she's a nun with TB who's probably in love with Fr. O'Malley (think what Luis Bunuel could have done with that), but she also showed a wonderfully smart sense of fun that made her wish that the directors had thrown her into comedies more often. In "Cactus Flower" she is a strengthened dental practice (Walter Matthau is the dentist), who loves her boss, but keeps him buttoned. When she is forced to act as his wife to persuade (not ask) her mistress, she lets go and pop the buttons. And she is a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is harder translated than usual on the screen of a Broadway hit (you can see it's three acts). It's a French farce (it was originally from the song "Fleur de Cactas" by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gredy) and hits all the right spots. Matthau uses his great Hang Jowl expression to create a wonderful effect, and a bloody blond freshman, then called Goldie Hawn, almost steals the movie as a dizzying lover who decides to give up her meal because she regrets 'the woman'. Even if "the woman" has a ball. Hawn made such an impression in the role that what she stole was Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.
