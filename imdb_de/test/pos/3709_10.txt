William Faulkner was one of the American writers who won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Faulkner wrote mainly about life in the south, especially in the years of depression. Many of his stories have been adapted to the screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers tell two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Older brother Pete Greer goes to Memphis, Tennessee, to report like hundreds of thousands of young men, some of whom would never come home. His younger brother does not take his farewell well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without his brother having to find any money. He is surprisingly a soldier of another kind, as he would like to register with 10 years. Ron Perlman plays a surprising feat as the military leader who manages to take care of the boy. This short film won an Oscar for best short-film action movie that's deserved. If it were longer, it could keep up with the longer movies. Everything else like costumes, art direction, and the restoration of the American era of 1941 is perfect. The film also shows the heartbreaking war at home, with most Americans surviving the Great Depression. The actors and actresses are not known, but they perform first class. If Hollywood made more quality films, I would probably go to the movies more. If Broadway had more quality programs, I'd go to the theater more.
