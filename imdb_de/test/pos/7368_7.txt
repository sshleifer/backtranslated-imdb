I recently bought this movie for $ 3 at a flea market, and although I'm glad I did not have to pay the usual $ 19.99 for this DVD, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. <br /> <br It's built like a horror anthology, divided into 5 stories, including the "Connector" story, which involves four teenagers whose cars break down a dark, lonely road in the middle of the night. Apparently, these kiddos like horror stories because they decide to do until the morning - telling scary stories around the campfire. Each character in turn tells a story, after which his own story is completed with a small twist. <br /> <br /> The first story, "The Hook", is a bit of a waste of time, a bit bland and dull. Fortunately, this is not one of the main stories and only takes maybe 5 minutes. It's just for the introduction of the movie and it's easy to miss the unoriginality of this piece. <br /> <br /> The second story "The Honeymooners" is okay anyway. It's about - you guessed it - two people on the honeymoon! They travel in a motorhome to Las Vegas. They decide to stop somewhere for one night, but are quickly warned by a mysterious stranger who is to leave the place or risk being attacked by dangerous, unknown creatures. This story has a pretty good setup, but only an "ok" delivery. Basically, it's pretty entertaining and mysterious until the monsters show up, then it's kind of a bit nasty. <br /> <br /> The third story, "People Can Lick Too", is my personal favorite. This is a young girl whose parents go out for the night and the older sister company gives them up for a party. So she will be all alone - a fact that she knows from an Internet buddy. Problem is the internet buddy? Is not exactly a thirteen-year-old girl. The conclusion of this story is a little less climatical than I would have liked, but still pretty good. <br /> <br /> The final story "The Locket" is definitely the most packed with the most atmosphere. In a scary mansion on a dark, rainy night, it's the story of a young man (played by Glenn Quinn!) Who's on a motorbike and just stumbles through the house when he's having a problem with his bike. He meets the dumb girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first sight. Unfortunately, everything is not all right, and it may have something to do with the locket hanging around her pretty neck ... <br /> <br /> After the stories are wrapped up, we have a twist with the four teenagers in the Car, a turn that should have been obvious in retrospect, but did not really come, and it's a pretty enjoyable conclusion to film. <br /> <br /> So all in all a good movie. Rent it if you can, because unfortunately I do not think it has a great value for the new look. But next time, you're in the mood for a scary frightening little movie in the same direction as "Tales of the Darkside" or something similar. Grab this movie and popcorn, turn off all the lights and treat yourself to this surprisingly nice little flick
