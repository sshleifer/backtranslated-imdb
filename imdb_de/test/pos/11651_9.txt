This film is about a very sensitive argument. If you're looking for something that makes you think, then you're right. Tim Robbins has done a wonderful job and the result is a kind of documentary drama that should be screened in schools (for the strong topics covered). What about the actors? Well, they are just great. Susan Sarandon is truly "the face of love" and Sean Penn is, as always, incredible. An absolute must!
