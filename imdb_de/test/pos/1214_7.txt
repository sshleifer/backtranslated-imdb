This was a very good PPV, but like Wrestlemania XX about 14 years later, WWE put so many games down that some of the games were useless. I will not go through every match on the map because it would take forever. <br /> <br /> But one of the main highlights was HUGE Pop for Demolition, which won the Tag Team belts from Haku and Andre the Giant. The first mixed-day match with Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri against Dusty Rhodes and the late Sapphire and the first fight between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan. <br /> <br /> Some games were a waste of time. Just as the Bolsheviks vs. The Hart Foundation were about 40 seconds long, Koko B Ware and Rick Martel were short and Big Bossman against Akeem too short. Mr. Perfect vs Brutus Beefcake and Ted DiBiase vs Jake 'The' Roberts' of the snake were very good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating - B
