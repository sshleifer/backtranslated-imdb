"Tourist Trap" is one of my favorite horror movies of the late 70's / early 80's. A group of young people go somewhere, a couple in the car, and this car has a flat plane, and our movie starts with the young man Woody pushing the tire in search of a gas station. He finds a seemingly deserted place, but hears voices and inquiries and receives for his use a piece of pipe through the belly. The rest of the young people are coming (in a VW Thing) and they pick up Woody's girlfriend and find exactly this place, Slausen's oasis, or something. And then Mr. Slausen passes while the girls are delving into the creek. Of course, the VW Thing has mysteriously died at this point, so Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum with many wax figures and he lives in the museum, but behind it is a big house where he says Davey. And who is Davey? Why, Davey Crockett, he says ... but if it was Davey Crockett, they would probably all be safer. The girls stay alone while Slausen helps to fix the car, but curiosity gets better, of course, and she goes to examinations and finds the house full of scary mannequins and a rather animated man named ... Davey. What follows is a rather spooky night of horror, one after the other, they are captured by Davey, who says he is Slausen's brother. A girl (formerly kidnapped) is treated with a gypsum facial that leads to death when it closes the air supply. In any case, there is a certain turn and kind (but funny) Mr. Slausen is not exactly what he seems to be. A good, scary horror strip of the late 70s and many mannequins make for a very spooky atmosphere. 7 out of 10.
