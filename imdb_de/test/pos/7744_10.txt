"Tempest" is a somewhat selfish, uneven, discursive film. But when Lord Byron, another Greek visitor, protested to his friend John Murray, he protested with his equally self-centered and discursive "Don Juan." "It may be reprehensible, but is not it life, is not it?" > <br /> The connections to Shakespeare's "Tempest" may appear a bit meager, as another commentator here claims. But watch the movie again after rereading "The Tempest". What makes this film flawed is its uncomfortable mix of uncomplicated normal narration and sudden, seeming improvisations, especially between Cassavetes and Rowland. To be honest, these scenes are the most notable and exciting in the movie when they are the hardest to watch. The music of this film composed by Stomu Yamashta is also overlooked. Especially beautiful is the perfect little piece that accompanies the afternoon siesta, as people, animals and seemingly the entire island collapse to oversleep the hottest part of the afternoon. It is a sublime moment and representative of the best aspect of this film and the one thing that unifies it to some extent, the fact that it is (apart from extensive flashbacks and the very end) the story of one day on an island, from the awakening tonight , <br /> <br /> All in all, I would rather watch this movie a hundred times than some bombastic Hollywood crap. And in fact, I've probably seen it several dozen times. Most of the time I see something that I have missed before. <br /> <br /> (Confession: I'm biased, this was the second movie I made my Greek-American goddess for.) <br /> <br /> Worth knowing about this movie: <br /> <br /> - It was Molly Ringwald's first film and Sam Robards'; <br /> <br /> - It was not actually shot on an island, but in Gytheion, the southern tip of the remote Mani peninsula in the Peloponnese of Greece; <br /> <br /> - The (by today's standards) primitive special effects were still made by Bran Ferren, who later became head of Disney Imagineering. Later, he was an adviser to US intelligence agencies; Paul Mazursky, director, chose the title of his current autobiography "Show Me the Magic" from the script for "Tempest".
