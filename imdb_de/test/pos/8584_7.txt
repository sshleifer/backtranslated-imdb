I suspect there is a revisionist history here, but you definitely feel that Patrice Lumumba was a troublemaker who brought his people to power from the moment the Congo declared its independence. His inability to control his people and his decision to launch Soviet aid to get his military back on track was obviously what had involved the United States and led to its murder. The US, however, did nothing to replace it with Mobutu. They made the situation just as bad. Maintained with excellent cinematography and rousing score. Definitely worth seeing.
