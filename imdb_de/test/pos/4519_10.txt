I just watched this movie at an advanced show. I had not read the book and knew nothing about the story, but it was because the book was voted "book of the year" by two local colleges. Therefore, I can not compare the book to the movie as others have done. <br /> <br /> In short, I thought that was an incredibly moving story. The drama was credible and the insights into Afghan culture and political history were both interesting and shocking. My oldest friend is Iranian and American, and so I felt an affinity for certain values ​​and traditions of the Middle East that were portrayed in the film, as they reminded me of the times I spent with his family on topics like friendship, family, human values ​​and courage under attack are universal and well developed in the film. I will not list the details of the plot because they are available elsewhere. But due to the technical aspects of the film, the acting and especially its heartbreaking story, I would definitely recommend this movie.
