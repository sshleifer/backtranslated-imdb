Okay, I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I worship her! How innovative I love that she has a cooking department - I admit that I occasionally skip this part just because I'm WAAAY too hungry! But I also think it's great that you can find the shopping list for the next day on their website. I think it's great that she has regular helpers and has made some of her viewers her regulars. I love how personal she is and how creative she is. I also like how she makes her Mystery Guests. She just seems a lot more honest than so many other talk show presenters. She still gets infected occasionally and I love that. I love her talking about her personal life and reminding people how happy she is. She has even mentioned tabloids and it is so funny! She also has the funniest stories! Anyway, I'm a fan for life. Even my 2 year old knows who Rachael Ray is and he loves her too!
