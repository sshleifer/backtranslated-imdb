"Balance of Terror" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made. The film "Enemy Below" (starring Robert Mitchum) is a film about a cat and mouse game between two captains during the Second World War. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play a similar game with a Romulan ship. This is the program that is known to introduce the war-hungry Romulans who are distant relatives of Vulcans. It is an incredibly exciting episode that is firmly engineered for maximum impact. It's also interesting to see how the episode contains a number of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as a Romulan captain (he will later play Spock's father Ambassador Sarek). A worth seeing episode!
