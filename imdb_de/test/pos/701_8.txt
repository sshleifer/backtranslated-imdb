I liked this western starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford. He has pretty much everything a Western should have. There are shootings, action, chases on horseback. It's a bit of a romantic angle, hinted at Edgar Buchanan, who plays Uncle Willie McLeod, a character who pretends to be a stupid fool but is actually aware of it. Randy Scott plays the city sheriff and Glenn Ford plagues Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith, a hunted outlaw. At some point he tries to change his behavior. I liked the different mix of characters in the movie. I did not always find it quick, but I never found it boring either. Although the film is 1943, it is in color. 8.10
