Plunkett and Macleane are a wonderful update to the baggy tradition that preceded Johny Depp and his pirate friends. The tone is light-hearted, with a touch of social commentary, but nothing too heavy. You could almost see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in it. <br /> <br /> It begins in low gear, with the introduction of the characters and the definition of social inequality and rebellion; Once the boys hit the highways, the hallway is up. The robberies are grand and stylish, with romantic accents that are the bread and butter of the Swashbucklers. The actors are dedicated and help lift the material a bit hollow. The figures do not have much depth, but they are played with so much charm and skill that it does not matter. Muh was said about modern music. The music of the period tended to calm down, which seems out of place. A classic score with Celtic rhythms for the action pieces might work, but the more modern, rebellious rock and techno music seemed to give the action an edge. Because the characters are more legendary than reality, accuracy in music seems pointless. The pieces tend to adapt to the mood of the scenes being broadcast, so it usually works well. I just wonder how they missed Adam Ants Stand and Deliver. Do not make mistakes, this is not a serious movie. It's pure escapism and a wonderful lark. Tony Scott shows some of his father's visual flair, but I do not think we'll see many Oscar nods in his career. He seems to understand the material here and subtracts a fine film. Over time, he can prove to be a name to be reckoned with. It took his father a while to mature beyond visual stylization and become a round director. This is definitely an occasion for an entertaining evening or a dizzying film festival.
