I saw this movie as SCREAMERS on TV and loved it. I heard an interesting story about this movie. When Roger Corman released it for Drive-Ins in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent a trailer that was not actually footage from the movie. It is supposed to be a picture of a naked woman being chased by a monster in a lab. Angry customers complained during the movie opening at the Drive-in's that they did not see the movie they were paying for. Theater owners called Corman and said their customers felt choppy. So Corman had to run off copies of the footage and send the positive film to the theater owners to put themselves in the film. Since the footage was never part of the negative film, it was not shown on any video, DVD or television program. Has anyone ever seen this material? Who saw this movie at a drive-in cinema in the summer of 1981?
