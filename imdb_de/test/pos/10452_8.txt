This is one of the best and most underrated teen movies ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw how this grew up and it was and is one of my favorites, maybe not as popular as "fast times" but just <br/> <br /> <br /> There is a serious side to this movie. As already mentioned by other reviewers, it begins as a comedy and turns into a drama that goes through about halfway through. That's the beauty of it and what makes it special. You get everything. Humor (not unlike "fast times"), drama and a BIG BIG soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think every kid who's just about to attend high school should see this, it would give some idea of ​​the trip they are about to leave. Cmon - what kind of kid would that look at that would not be able to identify with someone in the movie? The fact that it gets halfway so serious is also cool and just brilliant. You do not even see it coming. Definitely a lot of surprises. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU CAN NOT KNOW. <br /> <br /> Great, kneeling humor. (Who could forget the scene between Gary and Camilla?). I can still hear it, "Oh my strong burrito !!" Priceless !! <br /> <br /> Some scenes between Gary and Karin are hard to see (especially the last scene of the Grobschlucht). There are so many women out there like Karen who would have made exactly the same decision as they did. Think about it - how many women refuse men with gold hearts (like Gary)? I know I made it - and so many women I know. This film will stimulate discussion and, in spite of the countless times I've seen, still leaves me full of admiration for the filmmakers and performers. Everyone in this film will find someone to identify with, or who is probably more than one person. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music used is just great (many cars, u2, many obscure (now) songs) from the 80s. - an 80s purist space.) <br /> <br /> But do not make a mistake, it's not the music that makes this movie unique, it's the story itself, plain and simple. One of the best of its kind and a classic teen movie.
