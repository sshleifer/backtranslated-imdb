I filmed this movie on DD while he was flipping the channels ... And thank Heaven when he just started .. After studying in Pune, this movie released many happy memories of the city. That is not made ... Every character is so well etched - the grandfather, the kid, the doc ... besides the social worker, who scratches a bit, the rest of the movie has little flaw ... a merit entry for the Oscars, even if it was not nominated ... definitely leaves a lump in the throat ... Who needs porridge to tickle your tears? And to think that this movie needed Sachin Tendulkar to spread it. Although I was in Marathi, there was hardly a moment when I could not watch the movie ... the subtitles were good. A must for every fan of a good cinema.
