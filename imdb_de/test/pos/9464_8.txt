At first, I honestly thought it would be a crazy movie. But after seeing that, I was pretty surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincingly funny along with the minor cast (especially this character played by "Bullet tooth Tony" by Snatch, what a contrasting role between these two films!). Now I can not say if an actor is good or not, but especially her acting was absolutely enjoyable. Although the plot has turned halfway into a teen-bopper love triangle (though very funny), I feel that this should not be ignored, which I think is really easy: just entertaining. So, if you stumble upon DVD or theater, I'm confident you'll enjoy it.
