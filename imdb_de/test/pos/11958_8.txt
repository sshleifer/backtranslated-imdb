Ok, so there are always people who seem to make it a thing not to like movies because they are good, but prefer movies, depending on how depressing or boring they can be or if they come from a foreign country. Apart from that, One Crazy Summer is the perfect example of what a great American teen comedy should be like. The jokes are a good mix of Slapstick (a la Bobcat Goldthwait), Surreal (Bobcat under the inspiring direction of Steve Holland) and Dry (John Cusack, one of the driest and funniest actors in American cinema) No character in this movie who does not at least one funny line delivers (ok, except Demi Moore). <br /> <br /> Yes, it's immature, yes, it's a screw ball, yes, Bobcat dresses like Godzilla and Trashes a scale model of a seafood restaurant. It's too damn funny. Look at it.
