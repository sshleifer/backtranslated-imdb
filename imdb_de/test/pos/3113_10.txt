George Cuckor, known as a director of women, could not hope for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. It's a remake of Bette Davis Campy's "Old Acquaintance" by John Van Druten. This movie is definitely outdated but still sexy. <br /> <br /> Bergen and Bisset shine as best friends who compete in everything, but make friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a "serious" author, intellectual and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls' school and they start a life-long not so friendly contest. Later in her life, when Liz is a "promising" but blocked author of serious fiction, Merry decides to try writing, which bothers her mate about Merry's accidental approach to the craft, which she perhaps takes a little too seriously herself. makes you angry. <br /> <br /> Much to Liz's annoyance, Merry's trashy novels hit the bone, and in the end, her old friend Liz judges her novel for the National Book Award. Bergen steals the show as the haughty writer of steaming bestsellers who, in connection with her latest literary triumph, wants to bring together the bits and pieces of her life, but unfortunately things are never so easy. <br /> <br /> The Side Cast These include David Selby, whom you may remember as the tragic Quentin Collins of Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner, and of course a deliciously young and curious Meg Ryan in her first movie role since leaving the soaps to have. <br /> <br /> Rich and famous is cranky, sporty, witty and wise. It culminates in a New Year fiasco stressing the enduring nature of true friendship, and I never let a year pass without watching it on New Year's Eve. Look at it and you will see why.
