The jazz soundtrack gives the impression of a Clint Eastwood movie. <br /> <br /> Actually, it seems to me that Burt is doing Clint. The story is good and the film is full of deposits that I carry with me today. (Reynolds to villain: I pull the chain on your buddy because you're not in my town And you want to know the worst You're from the state!) <br /> <br /> Highlights: The Technics 1500B role is a beautiful role for audiophiles! <br /> <br /> Charles Durning, unmarked while listening to tapes of prostitutes with (kind of) phone sex. (You'd have to see it, trust me, it's weird.) Brian Keith plays against the guy as a tough guy. (And doing well!) Bernie Casie's preoccupation with Zen. Rachel Ward. IMPRESSIVE! (Where did she go?) <br /> <br /> Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show band play their chasms as usual. (Joe Williams's guests are on vocals, Manhattan Transfer has re-recorded "Route 66.") The soundtrack adds class to the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Do I have to say more? It could be Reynolds best movie ever. <br /> <br /> (Yes, he plays himself as usual, but it works!) <br /> <br /> Have fun!
