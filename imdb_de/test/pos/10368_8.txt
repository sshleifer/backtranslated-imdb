Although I definitely definitely read that particular Agatha Christie book, I could not remember it except for the name "Abernethie." That's a good thing, too, because developing this story without knowing how it will develop has allowed me to reiterate the sheer genius of Agatha Christie: the way she seduces you and then the carpet beneath pulling out of your feet is the main reason for their success and their timelessness. In addition to their stories, the outstanding production values, wonderful locations, wonderful music, first-class acting, elegant governance, etc. are the reasons for the success and timelessness of this series - and all these virtues are represented in "After the Funeral". , A tip: be vigilant from the beginning - even in the opening sequence hints can be found everywhere! In contrast to the peaceful-looking landscapes in English and some small signs of humor, there are also some pretty nerve-racking moments. A must for mystery fans and generally a very good movie.
