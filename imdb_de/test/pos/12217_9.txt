It's not often that a television series grabs me from the start. After a random download of the pilot for Surface I had stuck to my place for the entire episode. After that, I immediately went in search of the feverish attempt to learn all about this wonderful series. To my chagrin, I found out that it had been canceled after only 15 episodes, despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable ratings. Such a shame. <br /> <br /> Since then, I've acquired the remaining episodes and found the first 5 or 6 of the best televisions I've ever seen. It was just fantastic from start to finish and as another reviewer commented, I loved how they ended each episode with a huge ending. I imagine I see it every week, when I screamed with excitement, simply fascinated and desperately waiting for the release of the next episode. As I grew up, I've always heard it used to be in the serial movies, and it ended with a huge cliffhanger to get the audience back to the theater for the next episode or one of the suits that decided to kill it , and apparently the people behind the show must have seen the writing on the wall, because after the 6th episode it definitely comes to a worsening. I would not say that the episodes actually get boring, but many of the plot elements get a bit more clich√©d, and I have to say, the last episode really felt like cheating on me. I just wish the creators of the show had a fair chance. The * ONLY * other show I felt like this was the first season of Stargate SG-1, which was just enormously swinging and very "true", soulful and heartfelt. Surface was a great show, and maybe one day a well-to-do TV lover will see all the emotion about the show's cancellation and bring back this show. At least one can hope. :)
