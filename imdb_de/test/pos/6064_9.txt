This is one of the best non-English series I have ever seen. It interweaves interesting single and double episodes of crime fighting with a personal aspect that you simply can not find in CSI. The individual characters all have a personal life that blends well with their day job and occasionally bothers them. In addition, all characters manage to evolve naturally in the episodes. <br /> <br /> The casting is outstanding and has been recorded all over Denmark, which is a good example of the highlights of this majestic country. Unfortunately only 32 episodes have been made, but they are first class television. I hope they are considering making some more episodes of the same caliber.
