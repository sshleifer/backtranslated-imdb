I first saw this movie as a teenager (I'm 40 years old now) and have long considered it my favorite movie. The story is tremendously moving without being sentimental. Acting, especially of March and Loy, is dead. And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for his role does not take away the credibility of his romance with Theresa Wright (whom I believe is the only surviving protagonist of the film). It might have turned out to be another post-war melodrama, but the script and cast are just too good to do that.
