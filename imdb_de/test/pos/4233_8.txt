Chucky is back, but this time he's not scary (a lot) - but he's funny! Tiffany, he kills her promptly and turns her into a doll too. Tiffany and Chucky are now in the case of two high school graduates - eekkk !! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie - it's a lot of fun. It's scary, funny, weird, crazy and stupid in one! <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10.
