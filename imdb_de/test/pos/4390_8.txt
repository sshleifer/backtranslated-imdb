I was really and wonderfully surprised by "Oh brother, where are you?" The video library was from all the movies I wanted to rent, so I found it. I came home and as I watched, I fell deeply in love with myself and laughed out loud. The Coens made a great movie again. But I think when you watch this movie for the first time, you get to know the characters. The second time, now that you know her, you are laughing so hard that it could hurt you. I would recommend to EVERYONE to see this, because if you are not, you will really miss a filmedel for eternity. 10/10
