That's not very well written. The songs are not memorable. The cast, however, expresses a great deal from this Martin and Lewis in the Navy situation. Both look good as young sailors. They are believable. The scenes on the submarine show how close these submersible missions must have been in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Many sailors in many scenes. Hundreds maybe in a big outdoor practice field and again in a boxing arena. <br /> <br /> You will see James Dean in his scene. He is conspicuous, although he is an extra here. In a scene where Jerry walks through a busy street, we see some of his "almost accidental" comedy that he would bring into play years later in The Patsy Jerry in the boxing ring shows his high energy in the late 40s and early 50s was his trademark. Dean and Jerry dancing is a bit of a treat. Not great, but better than most non-dancing movies. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing if you do not care about black and white. Good end. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
