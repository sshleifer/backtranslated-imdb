I found the episodes fascinating and well written. As a television program it was entertaining what I expect from fictional entertainment. I like the "relationship" between the professor and his security guard ... although sometimes it's a bit difficult to understand her Scottish accent, which she says. I had hoped that there would be more than four episodes. I acknowledge that a commentator / reviewer in this series commented on his opinion as a doctor. I understand the comments of this gentleman. However, this is a fictional television series that should entertain ... and no exact facts presented as a documentary. Patrick Stewart is good and makes his character believable. If you want to watch a documentary, this is not the series for you. However, if you want to look at unique scientific theories in an entertainment medium, you will enjoy the four episodes.
