I expected this movie to be shit, but what I got was a pretty good Slasher / Gore movie. Most death scenes are sufficiently brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the best. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but does not bring much besides the movie. Kane was good as a murderer and as a terrifying juggernaut is absolutely believable. I have seen the "turn" from afar, but I liked the movie anyway. <br /> <br /> But what really struck me was the direction. Gregory Dark could actually have a career in legal film. Aside from overusing the horror movie "Speed ​​Cam" (do you know where the guy's face shakes fast?), Here are some good shots. The camera angles and environments really emphasize Kane's size and make him look even bigger than he actually is. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep story or characters, this is not the case. But that's not what slasher movies are about. If you are looking for good violence, or if you are in bloody movies, take a look!
