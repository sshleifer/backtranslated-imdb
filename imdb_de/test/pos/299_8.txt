It's this movie that many people call classic - Apocalypse Now, now a reissue, Redux, 22 years after its original release. <br /> <br /> The film is loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it is the main act (if any) of Captain Willard's voyage on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict to end a rogue colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he encounters, and he tells the story of the colonel on the way. <br /> <br /> My first feelings about the movie are that sometimes, especially at the beginning, it's not very exciting. but at least a good dose of comedy is used in the form of surf-fanatical Col. Kilgore. However, as the film progresses, reading Willard in various reports about Colonel Kurtz builds up some suspense until the end is in sight when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an unbelievable level and there stops The End. <br /> <br /> The usual aspects everyone is looking for in a decent movie are all of a good standard. Especially the cinematography is extraordinary and I think that the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest are all to be highlighted. The score I found initially sounded out of place, but as the movie progressed, I'm not sure if it actually got better or better, or if it was up to me, but in the end the film left me very much. <br /> <br /> This is the second time I have seen the Redux version (I have seen the original about four times). I say now that I saw it for the first time I was disappointed. I expected a "classic" movie with a lot of war. The fact that Willard got the mission at the beginning of the movie and did not perform until the end left me bored, as all the interaction between the characters on the way the movie is playing seemed unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not fully defined (because the focus is more on the character and the journey than on the plot). In most cases, a second consideration is required to fully appreciate the movie (as with all other films) are more character than the plot); the second time, you know where the action is going. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> With the big four Vietnam movies, Apocalypse Now captivates the rest of the atmosphere, but lacks the action and engagement of Platoon, the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter, and can not really do it with Full Metal Jacket (probably my favorite of the four) compared. Apocalypse Now is a great piece of work, especially at the end, where it becomes stunning and is recommended for anyone who likes a good character-based movie and does not engage in occasional violence.
