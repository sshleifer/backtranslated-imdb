First a word of caution. The DVD box describes this movie as a comedy. I do not think that was the intention of anyone involved in the movie except some marketing idiots. Although it's light and a bit funny in some places, it's NOT a comedy and if you expect it to be disappointing. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of this movie and had absolutely no expectations in one way or another. Considering that the other two DVDs I bought were big disappointments, I was very happy when I saw this movie. Acting, writing and directing were excellent. The story itself definitely interested me because you do not normally see films about France's last month before the Nazi takeover in 1940. She gave an insight into the parasites who gave up so quickly and agreed to seal their beloved country. On the way there are acts with a selfish and weak actress who was played very well by Isabelle Adjani - who looks great after all these years. She kills an ex-lover and then finds a poor juice in case. This juice escapes from jail and finds it - along with another lover - a senior government official and a weasel played by Gerard Depardieu. In addition, a subplot is introduced about a Jewish physicist who tries to smuggle deuterium out of the country, and this eventually becomes the main plot. The story has many nice twists, a slight sense of humor (without trying to be a comedy), and some exciting moments. Together they will create a nice package that you will like for sure.
