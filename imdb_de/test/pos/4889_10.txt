I'm addicted to the TV show, the live shows and everything they do. And this was the last piece they made as "The League of Gentlemen" on TV / Film. <br /> <br /> If you love the show, you will absolutely love the movie. It's a nice end to her TV series. <br /> <br /> It's smart and funny. <br /> <br /> Although it's not focused on some of the most popular characters, it's still great to see all the characters together and with the authors. A must for every fan of League of Gentlemen. <br /> <br /> Watch it!
