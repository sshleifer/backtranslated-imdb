Jamie Foxx was the epitome of Ray Charles. After a few moments you stop watching a movie and see a biography played by the great man himself. Ray Charles was really a genius of music and the film was outstanding. Nobody has or will ever write, play or record music like this musical giant. As he passed the flesh, the world lost one of its greatest American heroes. As for the movie, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a classical music scholarship and how Ray could play enriched the director. What could be better than that? You do not have to have a "double" game piano and then try to split the screen from another person's hands into Jamie's face. It worked wonderfully. I loved the fact that it was so difficult how difficult Ray was. He was not always a nice man. You were not for him either. He was a drug addict, a womanizer and sometimes just stubborn. But I think that made him great, so I can not blame him for that. I choose Jamie for Best Actor!
