Batman Returns is considered quality when talking about superhero films. His predecessor, Batman, is by far the largest and most thought-out comic genre in my opinion. To say that Batman Returns was disappointing, he or she did not fully see the movie and considered Danny Devito acting as the penguin. Devito and walking provide unforgettable moments. The story of Batman seems to be dark and Tim Burton has been fulfilled, as the comic Batman portrays. Batman Returns offers comic relief, action, excitement and imagination. and it should not be considered "crap," though we are all entitled to our own opinions.
