You know these movies, which are obviously terrible, but you can not help loving them? Well, this is Evil Ed, possibly the best horrible movie in the world. The sound is rubbish, dubbing is crap, the script is nonsense and the special effects are Pap. However, I can not help but love this movie and I've recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. Sam Campbell (or the man who plays him) should be featured in the Actor's Studio series because he's so memorable. Maybe the biggest movie villain was not called Tony Montana. Seriously, if you do not expect much, you will not be disappointed. Keep the movie carefree and you'll rate it at ten soon.
