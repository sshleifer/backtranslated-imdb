In "Driving Lessons," two British middle-class families meet as Grint's character comes into contact with Evee (Walters), a somewhat distraught actress with ego. Grint reveals his overpowering and supra-Christian mother (Linney) and travels with Evee to Scotland to accompany her on a journey to a poetry reading. Something she claims to be the last due to illness. <br /> <br /> Grint's portrayal of a caged youth brainwashed by a presumptuous and even hypocritical mother is the masterpiece of the film. His depiction of a subject teenager in search of his true morality and his happiness is intriguing when he observes himself throughout the unfolding. The film is sharply filmed and well thought out, with a few moments that make you tired, an achievement, especially when it comes to the nature of the plot. Walters really grabs her character with both hands, successfully bringing the audience to her side, emphasizing Linney's ironic immorality everywhere. Her role in "Driving Lessons" is in every respect pleasing and memorable. <br /> <br /> The plot evolves well and makes the crowd cheer on Grint as he returns to Evee during his lunch break during his lunch break to apologize for his misconduct. The values ​​in the piece are continued in a consistent manner until final drawing and worked out thoroughly. The overbearing (and exonerating) guiding principle is that religion does not lead to happiness and not to morality. <br /> <br /> The audience remains sympathetic to the radical but lovable Evee She and Grint have entered into an irresistible big-screen partnership that has been transferred directly from their debut in the "Harry Potter" series. Charismatic and beautiful acting together with a taut and objective guidance make this Christmas a must.
