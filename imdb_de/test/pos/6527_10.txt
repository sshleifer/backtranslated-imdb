This is the first American movie I have seen this year, and I think he will be the best because of the feeling. As a teen singer in America, Aaron is not as popular as before. Most of the Americans I met said his song was fake and he did not even know how to rattle Understand him. Being a pop fan is difficult, and being a pop star is harder. I think that Aaron (JD) did something real for us this time. And I think people should learn to understand each other. On the other hand, I like the music in the movie a lot. I remember that the first song that appeared in the movie is "Saturday Night" and also includes some real live shows from Aaron. And the second one is "One Better", so if you like this movie you might also be a pop fan. Finally, I hope you will have a great time. A voice of a Chinese boy.
