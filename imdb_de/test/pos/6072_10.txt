In a critical scene, while Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) lies in the Cave of the Swimmers, she writes something that Hana (Juliette Binoche) has read by declaring that "the light is now extinguished and I write the darkness. .. "A sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematographic brilliance of the distracting English patient. With such a dramatic momentum that keeps you going and a strength of film that does not let up, this movie proudly celebrates the secrets and romances of World War II, taking elements of Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia with Tuscan independence. <br /> <br /> The English patient unabashedly draws the heart and leads us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second act and a nice ... nice final act, and he is not 'It's just the wonderful tempo and the Surroundings, it is the performance of Ralph Fiennes, who also sympathizes with us, when Graf Almásy is an unlikely character from the very beginning. Typically typified as a rogue, he depicts corrupted but ultimately human colors as a man who is attracted by the desperate love he has to fulfill. Many will criticize this film for its so-called "glorification of adulterers," but those who know nothing.The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash at take-off) are spectacular, as the patient is the regretful man under who suffers from what he did, the evil that was once in him, while the man from before the crash is a person like any other He wants this woman, but he can not have her, Fiennes brings the human-like qualities from Almásy In a way NO OTHER actor could do, there could not have been a better actor for this job. <br /> <br /> So, please take these comments to heart, watch the movie Those who call it "boring" or "despicable" know nothing and should not be ashamed of such a one-dimensional view of the film, a view they have neither studied nor corrected, and true They do not seem to plan to correct them. The English patient is the best of any film that has ever won the Best Picture Oscar and is hidden in its poetic triumph for so many reasons.
