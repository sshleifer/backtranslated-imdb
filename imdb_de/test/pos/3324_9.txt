I have the feeling that in the fifties this movie looked just like "Waiting to Exhale" with white women. As in Waiting to Exhale, all female characters were mixed with men who were either married or not good. The only difference, aside from the obvious, was that there was not much humor in this movie. I would even say that it was tragic. Only one of the male characters seemed to be nice and sincere (Hope Long type), but even then there were conflicts in this relationship. <br /> <br /> The story is about three young women who shared an apartment together and who had hopes and dreams of success. Unfortunately, romance did not seem easy, even though they were young, intelligent and attractive. This movie could be described as a tearjerker whose saddest part is the character of Suzy Parker, whose obsession with an ex-boyfriend leads to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> This is a must.
