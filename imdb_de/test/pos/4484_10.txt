It's one of the best movies I've seen this year! I do not agree with the person who said it was boring. Of course some people do not find this movie scary at all, but personally I have spent a very good moment. This movie changes very sex scenes with scary scenes. There is also a nice touch of humor. For example, when the woman tells her husband that she was abused by her father in childhood, and then her husband says, "How can someone like you abuse someone," and he tries to fix her on the bed for sexual games: Very funny! I recommend this movie to anyone and I'm sorry for my bad English (I'm from France).
