When you think of Soviet cinema, I usually think of Eisenstein's propaganda masterpieces or Tarkovsky's somber meditations. Although they are great films, they are not the most entertaining material in general. The countries within the Iron Curtain, however, evidently enjoyed their escapist musicals as did the states. In fact, from the 1930s to the 1970s, forty of these song-and-dance extravaganzas were released with great reverence by the public. However, they are completely unknown in the West, so this documentation tries to correct this situation. It is a great job to present these films and place them in the right cultural context. Although I have never been a fan of musicals, I found this documentary completely convincing from start to finish. It's proof that, no matter how many movies you see in your life, you're just scanning the surface of what's out there. <br /> <br /> As for the movie clips themselves, they are very entertaining. While some of the musicals are an obvious propaganda in which the workers sing how much they love to work under the regime, some films (especially the later ones) look quite successful from a production point of view. Besides, they are all extremely fightless because they are so foreign to my western eyes. There are some similarities between them and the American musicals I'm used to, but the existence of a strict state enforcement of a message gives them a surreal edge. They certainly do not resemble the musical produced in the West. This documentary is one of the most bizarre and entertaining films I've seen lately, and it's an absolute must-have for any movie fanatic. (9/10)
