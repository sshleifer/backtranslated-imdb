I'm so sorry that people complain that Never Say Never Again is just a faint remake of Thunderball. Yes, the influence of this film is unmistakable, but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of reworked films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films as the 1998 revision of Psycho. Although the opening theme of the twelfth (and last of Connery) Bond films is one of the worst of the entire series, the film itself still manages to stand alone despite many other weaknesses. Apart from that, the weak title song also fits in well with the closing dialogue of the film. Sean Connery was getting a bit older when this movie was filmed (at least by James Bond standards), but there's plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this is not exactly unknown to filmmakers was. James Bond is about to retire before he gets his job. He spent most of his time in teaching and did not, and there is even M's insistence that he pay more attention to his health, diet, and workouts, and that he moves more and does not. Besides, this is James Bond, remember? This guy is supposed to be a super man, and all his fans are upset because he has gray hair. As this guy retires at the end of the film, M sends the poor "Small Fawcett" (in a witty cameo by Rowan Atkinson) to tell Bond that he is worried about the safety of the free world and all people without him can not overcome the fact that he is no longer a sparkling young man. Come on, Sean Connery could STILL play James Bond, as well as he ever could, or at least better than anyone else ever. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film deals with the thoughtful plan of stealing nuclear missiles and holding the world hostage (as Dr. Evil would say, "Oh damn, let's just do what we always do? "), so obviously there is not much news, but this is one of the Bond films that made the better deposits. Is there a funny scene where Bond is asked for a urine sample? "If you could just fill that mug for me?" "From here?" There are many good one-liners, but the sexual allusions that target Mr. Bond are particularly prevalent in this issue. Later, however, he accidentally throws this urine sample into the face of a rogue and makes him scream as if burning his face. Not a very good attempt at comic relief, especially since this guy kicked Bond's ass with some sort of super feather device that could cut through just about anything. And of course Kim Basinger plays in this movie one of the best Bond Girls of the whole series. <br /> <br /> It's no secret that Never Say Never Again is badly dated and one of the things that has come to worst is the special effects? with the exception of the rockets, which were obviously spurious, but still impressive for 1982. The colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was completely ineffective, and the laser clock was one of the worst things in the entire film, second only to those damned sharks. Obviously, Fatima Blush has put some kind of device in his diving tanks that attracts sharks (though they had strange guiding mechanisms), in a scene that probably inspired the classic line: `I have a simple request. And that means sharks with FRICKIN laser beams on their heads! And then, of course, there's the exploding hotel room scene, which was repeated in an episode of The Simpsons, and apparently followed by another compulsory and overly casual one-liner by James. <br /> <br /> The domination video game of Largo, the villain of the movie, is a particularly catchy scene, and the movie also offers probably the best motorcycle hunt in the entire series (well beyond the ridiculous in Tomorrow Never Dies). However, despite many of its strengths, the movie's flaws remain clearer at the end of the film, largely due to the anticlimactic underwater closure (one of the more obvious parts borrowed and inferiorly rebuilt by Thunderball). It does not matter that Largo Bond gave some important information when he left him alive in the tower (Dr. Evil's brilliance: "I'll just leave him there without seeing his death and just assume that everything is going according to plan was.) What? ') The climax of a fast-paced action movie should never take place in a subdued underwater atmosphere. <br /> <br /> All in all, Never Say Never Again has a high priority on the James Bond scale, and Connerys winks at the end of the movie (and the two closing lines) at the time he could do so Return another round as Bond. Of course, this is not very likely, so we can only hope.
