I was a kid when I saw this show, a bit after Buck Rogers, both from the same Buster Crabbe, and I have to admit that these movies have always been part of the best entertainment I've ever had. The fight against Emperor Ming was one thing, but I was more interested in the ultimate destiny of the Delta triangle with Dale and Aura. Barin came and persuaded Aura to forget about Flash, very innocent ending her obsession with good-looking Flash. The series has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be viewed by any audience. Another thing is that I learned to swim in the water, as Crabbe did when fighting shark males. The soundtrack was also nice, though it was previously used in another film by Boris Karloff's Frankenstein. It would be nice to have the DVD of this series, provided it contains Spanish subtitles (not yet available).
