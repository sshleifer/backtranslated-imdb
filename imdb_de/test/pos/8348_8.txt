I loved this movie almost as much as the original version! What kind of teenager is NOT going through what Scamp is going through? Do you want to find independence by moving further and further away from your family? The songs were nice and the character designs were great. Lady and Tramp look almost exactly as they did in the original feature. They have done a good job on the voices of these two, even considering that the original voice actors are probably dead. More lines to Lady, Annette, Colette and Daniel. Well, at least they had common sense to keep the same scenery as the original movie.
