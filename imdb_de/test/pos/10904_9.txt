In the 1997 comedy IN & OUT Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comic twist. Kline plays Howard Brackett, a small town history teacher who sits down excitedly to watch the Academy Awards as one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is a candidate. He is nominated for his performance in a film in which he plays a gay soldier. If he wins, he thanks Howard in his speech for inspiring him because Howard is gay. Now this is Howard, because he has no idea why this guy would say so on international television. Howard is even engaged (with Joan Cusack, in an Oscar-nominated performance), so he has no idea where Dillon's Cameron Drake got the idea that he's gay and he has to defend himself in front of everyone at school shocked that nobody terribly shocked, what Cameron said about the Oscars. Howard has a birthday party where he gets birthday presents like the soundtrack to YENTL and explains to his guests why Barbra Streisand had to do FUNNY LADY. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked, but promise to support their son, even if he is gay. He is also visited by a city reporter (Tom Selleck) who wants to write an article about him because he is also gay. The moment in which Selleck gives Kline a big kiss on the lips is a classic. But with all these little things, Howard actually questions his sexuality and wonders if he's really gay ... much to the aggravation and frustration of his fiancee Cusack, who is more than confused. The scene in which she leaves a bar in her wedding dress and stands in the middle of the street screaming about the lack of single men in the world is a classic. But what I like about this movie is the way Kline fully invested in the role and was not afraid to look stupid or gay. There's a fabulous scene, probably the most famous one in the movie, where he buys a record, how to be macho, and the guy on the record talks about how real men do not dance, and a disco tune sounds (I WILL SURVIVE, if the memory serves) and the narrator on the record says no matter what you do, do not dance, but Howard can not help himself and he lands in the whole room with his groove thing. It's hysterically funny and Kline plays it with sincerity and verve. The movie is not for or against gay ... it's just a nifty and amusing character study of a man trying to figure out who he is. Wonderful movie.
