Crimson starts off with cool jazzy music, so I immediately liked it, but as the movie evolved, I began to wonder if the music was not the best part. We have a few thieves who steal a jewel robbery, and if someone does something wrong, an alarm sounds and the police chase them, and when the car drives around a roadblock, one of the thieves becomes (Paul Nash, Jacinto Molina, whoever always he is) brought here shot. Now it seems he is dying, but with the help of a drunken doctor and his friend (and his wife) he is rescued, with part of the brain of a nightclub owner named "The Sadist". The sadist is unhappy because the gentlemen who abducted him have lost their knives to remove their heads. In order to injure the injury (or in this case the death), take off his head with a pull and let the body find the authorities, oops. Once the brain transplant is complete, Nashy wants to devastate any woman approaching him because he now has the mindset of his donor. Of course, all of this is unlikely and has medical equipment that seems to have been bought at Radio Shack, and overall it's rather cheesy and sloppy. But it has a good look and feel from the early 70's and the music is cool. This is not so much a horror movie, but rather a thriller with many thugs fighting it for turf and babes and other flailing things, but it's strangely entertaining in a way I can not describe. 7 out of 10.
