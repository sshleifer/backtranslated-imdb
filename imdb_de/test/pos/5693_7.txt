During their holiday in Northern Australia, Gracie (Diana Glenn), her husband Adam (Andy Rodoreda) and her younger sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) decide to go fishing in the Blackwater Barry Tour. Her guide Jim (Ben Oxenbould) uses a small motorboat and guides the tourists along the river to a secluded spot. When they stop, they are attacked by a giant crocodile that capsizes their boat and kills Jim immediately. The three survivors climb a tree, and when they realize that help would never come to their rescue, they decide to find a way out of their sheltered place. In the muddy water, however, her boat is turned over and the crocodile steals the trio under water. <br /> <br /> "Black Water" is a tense, realistic and dramatic low-budget movie that complies with the warning at the beginning, based on a true event. The acting of the unknown Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody and Andy Rodoreda is first class and lends credibility to this simple yet sinister story. There are many similarities between this film and "Prey", but in different environments. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo Profundo" ("Deep Fear")
