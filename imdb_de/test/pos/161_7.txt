I know little or nothing about astronomy, but still; At first I was a bit skeptical of the plot of this film. It follows three children, all of whom were born during a solar eclipse and therefore have no emotions and so (of course) become reckless serial killers. The action sounds ridiculous at first glance, but as soon as you realize that a solar eclipse fades out Saturn, and as you know, Saturn is the emotion planet, everything collapses. It makes perfect sense and then you know you're not just watching another stupid 80s butcher with a pea brain plot. Thank god for that! Seriously, Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise, but that more than makes up for it with its originality. It's not the most ingenious masterpiece you've ever seen in the cinema, when a few kids are slaughtering people, but if you can choose between this and another boring Friday, the 13th clone, I know what i would choose. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie helps out of the hole some people think it's a stupid act into which they've been buried, the fact that it's extremely entertaining. Many slashers are formulated way too fast, and the audience is watching just to see something gore. However, this film does endure with some great creepy performances of the children (which are traced back to spooky children's classics such as "Village of the Damned"), a constant stream of sick humor and a small, but for the nature of the film impressive film, tension and suspense. One thing I really liked about this movie was the large selection of weapons. There is nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (coughing on Halloween cough). But this is not the case, as Bloody Birthday has room for everything, from skipping ropes to bow and arrow. There was no room for a chainsaw, which is a shame, but I think not every movie can contain a chainsaw.
