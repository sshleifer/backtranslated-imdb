The highlight of this film is certainly the cast. Diana Rigg, George C. Scott and Bernard Hughes, just to name a few. <br /> <br /> I have more time in hospitals and with them collected doctors over the years that I would like to think about. <br /> <br /> This comedy attacks the pomp and presumptuousness in all areas of our society by setting up one of its "most haughty" institutions ... the medicine profession. <br /> <br /> The idea that such an approach might be possible may be a shock to some, but it is a pleasure for anyone who has the perspective of experience. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brock (Scott experiences a mid-life crisis of monumental proportions before our eyes, and we'll be thrilled to get in touch with Miss Drummond (Rigg) The thread of the absurd is woven into this wonderful mix in the form of irony, that the hospital seems to kill its own workers while they are abusing their affairs. <br /> <br /> The climax is unpredictable (unless it's) and it makes it even weirder if you guess. <br /> <br /> It's not everyone's cup of humor and he has weirdly funny "dark moments" when you're open to her. <br /> I loved every minute and loved it on DVD to see.
