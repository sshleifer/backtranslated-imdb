This relic from the days before production of Production Code and Hays Office is fun, not great, but entertaining. <br /> <br /> Based on a song by Rogers & Hart, which was a huge hit at that time, the story It is the dance hall girl Barbara Stanwyck, the wealthy businessman Ricardo Cortez (who was indecently handsome ), but whose heart belongs to her neighbor Monroe Owsley. She and Owsley marry, but keep it secret while dismissing Cortez, who still holds hope. She helps her husband get a job in Cortez's company, but married bliss quickly turns sour as Owsley develops a fondness for high life and gets off with a college sweetheart and plays in High Stakes Bridge (Yup!) I know it is pretty funny .. ..). Finally, he signs $ 5,000 from Cortez and is about to be close to his devoted wife's move to Cortez ... and I'll say nothing, though the end was certainly a surprise. <br /> <br Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie. She is quite successful in one of her earliest roles. Owsley is the weak point; He is unsightly and snooping, while Cortez is remarkably polite and sexy while his performance is serious but unobtrusive. <br /> <br /> While it's supposed to be a drama, it's full of laughter, many elements have unwillingly grown old bad. But there are many good funny lines; At some point Stanwyck says to Cortez, "My brain is in my feet while yours are in ..." That's pretty damn suggestive for 1931! There's a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this movie in the last few days before the code caught on. An amusing antiquity, a good reminder of how far we have not come in seventy years ... This story could easily be changed in 2003, but could retain the basic plot with the original ending.
