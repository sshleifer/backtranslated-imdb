I would recommend this as the most successful attempt so far to make a film about the Soviet Afghanistan war. And it's a very honest and responsible picture, from small uniforms and weapons to human relationships, wartime routines and Central Asian landscapes. It was shot in Tajikistan shortly after the withdrawal of troops in 1989 and not in 1985. The Italian star Placido was just perfect in the role of Major Bandura. Other characters also looked very natural, especially drunk club leaders :-) The scenario seems to be jammed in the end, but could have an impact on the civil war in Tajikistan, which started directly during the filming of the film. The entire film crew sometimes had to flee under fire. The final scene is a pure "Harakiri" behavior and reminded me of the final sentence of a famous samurai movie: "We won all battles but lost the war". It could also be a metaphor for the collapse of the USSR - the big country that can be shot back by the small, offended child.
