I absolutely loved this movie. For me, the best reason to see is how strong a contrast to legal dramas like "Boston Legal" or "Ally McBeal" or even "LA Law" is. That's the reality. The law is not BS, won in a final argument or by a ridiculous defense that you pull out of your butt, like the "Chewbacca Defense" in South Park.) This is a real justice, the legal system has gone terribly wrong the work of GOOD lawyers - not the Shyster clich√© that uses all his skills to correct it. There will be more to the restoration of your faith in humanity than a Frank Capra movie or the KILLING OF A MOCKING BIRD. And most importantly, I cried. During the movie, during the featurette included at the end of the DVD - it's amazing. Wonderful movie; Thank God the filmmakers made it.
