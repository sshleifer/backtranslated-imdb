I think Dirty Dance was a great movie. They tried to make another Havana night, which was good, but it was not a dirty dance. I would like to see another dirty dance with the same people. I think without them it would be a mess. Often films are made as they try to add more, they start to change people and the films fall down the mountain. I would like to see dirty dances that have another one to see what happened after they could be together. Patrick and Jennifer got together so well. This movie was made in 1997 to do another. But this time they start where they left off and hold the same people in it.
