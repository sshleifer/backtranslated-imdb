This is a captivating women's drama that men can enjoy. The plot follows a young woman (Hope Lange), who works for a publisher after college. We can forgive her for leaping from the secretary to the editor (hey, it's Hollywood) and a few other mistakes. Here is one of the few films in which the former great producer Robert Evans (here beautifully representing a rat with women) appears. It also has a mature Joan Crawford and a great minor cast. Listen.
