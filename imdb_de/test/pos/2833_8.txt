I saw this movie when it first hit the market in France 54 years ago. Ninety years ago, I was nine years old. Today I still remember every black-and-white frame, especially the black frame, because it was so tense and scary, those creeping attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers who were forced prisoners to fight each other, the last fight with the unveiling of the car with the Gatling that fires him, the last fight between Peck and the boss, and the happy ending that made me breathe again. I have not seen it since, and I do not know if it would be a good idea to see it again today, it was such a fabulous moment for the kid I was.
