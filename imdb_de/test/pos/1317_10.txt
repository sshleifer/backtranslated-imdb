Mishima - a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best film by Paul Schrader until today. Mesmorizing Cinematography, accompanied by Philip Glass' mystical film music, added to the story of one of Japan's greatest writers a completely magical aura whose originality and painterly narrative are beautifully portrayed in this painting. Like any gifted character, Mishima was troubled with serious self-controversies, with the conflict between the "pen and a sword", as the director formulated it in his last chapter, or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings and life's main point in a notoriously masculine society with centuries of warrior traditions that widen the gap between the sensitive and militant traditional sides of Mishima itself. All of the Schrader films (and the ones he's written for) are basically stories The inner conflict within a man who does not belong in an environment where he lives. The same applies to Mishima, who - apart from the Japanese military school - arouses the education for the love of the theater and the words. His death consisted of these two key points in his life, it was about words and theater that ended in a lifelong play. A movie like this always happens, and most will have to wait a lifetime to achieve that beauty. 20 out of 10 !!
