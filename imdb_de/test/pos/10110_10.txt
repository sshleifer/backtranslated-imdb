"A Tale of Two Sisters" is a brilliant South Korean psychological horror that left me speechless. The movie offers some delicious moments of gruesome horror and is extremely creepy memorable in the lead role. The direction of Kim Ji-woon is well done and the cinematography is absolutely great. The plot is a bit confusing, but some scenes are wonderfully scary. The action is rather slow, but I was not bored. I was extremely curious and fascinated. The house in which the film plays looks incredibly threatening and isolated. "A Tale of Two Sisters" is next to "Ringu" and "Cairo" one of the most original Asian horror movies I have seen this masterpiece as soon as possible. My rating: 10 out of 10.
