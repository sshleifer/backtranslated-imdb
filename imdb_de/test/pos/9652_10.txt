This is the best French movie of the year! I've seen it twice and loved it both times. I did not find it boring at all, although it is very long (3 hours). I'm seventeen, so obviously I have not witnessed the events of May 1968, which was a major turning point in French history. It's actually quite universal: people my parents' age can identify with the characters, as well as people my age. Garrel seems to perfectly understand the young people, their way of thinking and the complications of love, as well as the loss of illusions about the possibility of changing the world. Maybe because the character played by Louis Garrel (his son) is supposed to be Philippe Garrel himself. Well, great movie, no action (must be honest on this point), but so strong feelings that you can not possibly remain indifferent. If you are looking for a relaxed Sunday evening movie, do not waste your time, you will be disappointed. However, if you like cinema, you'll love Les Amants RÃ©guliers, a charming film that comes close to the Nouvelle Vague artists' films of the 50s and 60s.
