This movie is fantastic because it showed how good cartoons really looked in the 80s. The animators were not as lazy as they are today. The cartoon had so many details and had very few resources compared to what we have today. If more people asked these cartoons for retransmission, then maybe all the other cartoons of the 80s would be shown on television again. To finish my sentence, I just want to say that this is a cartoon that I really wanted to bring back to being back on TV.
