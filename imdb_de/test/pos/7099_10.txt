This movie has the look and feel of being put together in a matter of days, much like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Still, it's still a classic among my favorite creatures. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS Ahead ******* Count Dracula and Larry Talbot; aka Wolfman, the lab of Dr. med. Edelman, who is looking for a remedy for his nightly anti-social behavior, eg. For example, killing people. In the meantime, Dr. Edelman kindly the corpse of the Frankenstein monster. As he is obsessed with bringing it back to life (a common characteristic of scientists, crazy or otherwise), he contradicts his better judgment and leads to monstrous chaos and madness. One of the ultimate universal classics of his time (Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein followed 3 years later), rated it with this reviewer at 10. Onslow Steven steals the show as a good doctor after being infected with the blood of Dracula and a half Werewolf / vampire creature that had a tragic end. At 1 hour 7 minutes it packs a lot. A worthy addition to my video collection. <br /> <br /> Rating: ***** out of *****
