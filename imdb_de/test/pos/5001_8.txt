I originally saw this film when I worked as a musician in the summer of music theater. If you have ever worked in the theater - especially in a summer theater - you will really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some moments really bad writing in the movie, but overall It's a nice tribute to the theater and why people love it.
