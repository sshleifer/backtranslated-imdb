Love Jones is one of the best movies I have experienced. <br /> <br /> The most important element I would like to emphasize is the fact that it is very clever. I've studied this movie in its entirety - with more than one movie watching, certain things unconsciously dawn on you - the direction of this movie and writing are chic, hip, and artful! I am in love with the direction. Amazing is the scene in which Larenz Tate and Nia Long drive by motorbike through Northern Chicago at night. The director of this film has awarded DESERVED for his great work. Love Jones is a classic and sexy movie. It underscores the fact that we can be people who love, who have shortcomings, who love to live, to learn and to be ourselves without the hype. Be our natural selves. <br /> <br /> The poetry is wonderful, but the plot, the dialogue and the scenes really make this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves to be seen. It's a great movie for lovers and friends to sit back and watch, or the hopeless romance (like me) to sit back and enjoy alone on a Friday or Saturday night. Every day of the week, where calm, loneliness, and some entertainment are needed, I recommend Love Jones.
