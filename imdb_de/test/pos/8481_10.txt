Jamie Foxx is absolutely Ray Charles. His performance is just awesome. He owns the movie, just as Spacek had "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid "Great Balls of Fire." In fact, it is hard to remember that the role of Ray Charles is played and not played by the man himself. Ray Charles is legendary. He is well established as a musician and the music is deep, complex and innovative - even more innovative than I knew before watching this movie. The film was supposed to turn new fans into a young audience that may not know much about their music. The life of Ray Charles provided excellent biographical material for the film that goes far beyond a musician's film. I admit that until this film I knew very little about the man's life. I am impressed that I am impressed by Ray Charles' courage, strength and innovation as a man and a musician.
