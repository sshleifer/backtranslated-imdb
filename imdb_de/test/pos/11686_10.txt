A bit of guilty indulgence these days, it used to be a must when I was in high school. It really is a great enlightenment of the burgeoning punk scene in LA in 1980. While the bands are playing, Spheeris prints the lyrics in subtitles, which of course is necessary if you really want to know what the guy is shouting into the microphone. But it also turns the POV of the camera into a tourist who walks through this strange world. The band interviews show an honest approach to music that really does not exist anymore. On the other hand, it's not easy to get $ 16 / month through former church cabinets like Chavez of Black Flag. How many unknown bands do you know that do not like the Dickens trying to get a record deal? These guys just did not care. And who can not love the comment of the little French guy who used to be a "singer" of the Catholic discipline (whose member was Phranc). His scratchy voice delivers one of the best single interviews ever recorded in the film: "I have great news for the world ... there's no New Wave." Angry! What a relief!
