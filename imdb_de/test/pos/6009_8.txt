We all know pieces of Gulliver's travels. Little people, yes, sure. Liliputians Also giants that some of us can remember. Some may remember the word Yahoo comes from here. It stops for most people. <br /> <br /> Swift's book is ubiquitous in school libraries. There I read it for the first time, and there were many people who read it for the last time. She is treacherously easily written like many of the old adventure books. Children can read it. Nevertheless, it drips with satire, black and uncompromising. I think most screenwriters forget when they adapt this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie remembers though. Our hero, Ted Danson, gives a credible and serious performance as the world-matched man thrown into mysterious lands like our own country. Gulliver's travels criticize everything. Theists, scientists, government, citizens, ethnicity, humanity. Few are spared, and most of the satire is just as fresh today. <br /> <br /> Although he is very faithful to the story, the film also ventures new perspectives, which all work very well. The scriptwriter deserves all credit for being so well balanced between time and activity (so it's not boring). <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are way above a TV movie. With a little marketing this film would have done well at the box office. All the fantastic worlds that Gulliver visits are well-made, well explained and often very funny, similar to Swift's book. Actors are all professionals, as this is a British production. Mary Steenburgen stands out with James Fox 'Dr. Bates, the frighteningly cruel doctor who, like nurse Ratched, wants only the best of the patient. <br /> <br /> Well, a modest suggestion, if you ever get the chance to get this movie, do it. It is a real pleasure.
