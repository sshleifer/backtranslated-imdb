As a spectacle, it is difficult to criticize Nihon Chinbotsu. The Japanese people have benefited from its close relationship with the sea, and the concept of the film implies that a whole world and way of life is endangered - thanks to its volcanic heritage. From the point of view of reality, it is quite stupid to have a drama in which the whole of Japan disappears under the waves. Why Japan? <br /> <br /> Let's assume we have a movie reality fueled by the spectacle (and popcorn) instead, and some may influence that. Compared to adventures with Japanese radioactive monsters, this looks more mature and faster. The emotional element is highlighted and it really works. (However, it loses something to the overflowing theme song at its peak.) Is Nihon Chinbotsu believable? Probably not, but the exciting outbursts and relaxed pace make for a pleasant night-long conversation.
