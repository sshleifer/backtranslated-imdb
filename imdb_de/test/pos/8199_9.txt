I'll admit that I do not know about the existence of this movie until I saw it on a cable outlet. I was very impressed by the novel structure of the film. The film, which is in a language I do not understand, shone for me with intelligence and nuance. I think that speaks for the quality of the film. It was visually stunning. The acting was visually fascinating. The movement traditions of Chinese theater used to enhance dialogue are so persuasive after Western film, in which actors traditionally focus more on dialogue. The action in this movie comes straight to you, without causing an explosion that will grab your attention. Human action is so affective here. The added benefit the film gave me with a story about one of the largest tourist attractions in the world, the Dead Army of China's first Qin Emporer, was very impressive. It seemed to give the film international relevance beyond the film's big ethical themes. This is a movie that I can recommend to a variety of friends and acquaintances.
