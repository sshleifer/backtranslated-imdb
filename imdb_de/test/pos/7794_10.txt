AAA is my favorite movie ... I've seen it several times (can not remember the count) and every time I just love it ... This is the best movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. The comedy. The dialogues and the performance is amazing. All the actors and actresses have done a great job ... you can not stop laughing as you watch this movie ... it's just weird. and the acting of Paresh Rawal was as always excellent ..... The music is inspired by the old Hindi movies (60s) and is good ... the whole cast of the film has done a great job ... <br / > <br /> Overall, it's a great Indian comedy movie ...
