Wow, I've certainly seen some of Kelli McCarty this summer. I did not know that this woman has done so many softcore movies in the last three years. It's like seeing a future softcore star bloom in front of me, much like Michelle Hall did a few years ago. <br /> <br /> "Passion's Peak" is the third softcore streak I've seen in Kelli McCarty. with "Girl for Girl" and "House of Love" are the others. "Desire and Deception" was okay, but it was not spectacular. There are spoilers in this review, so just read if you want. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Christina (Kelli McCarty) walking out of the big city into the mountains. She inherited a house from her dear deceased grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain lodge. Before she can even lay her things down, a woman named Kim (not credited in this movie, but rather aggressive) posts guests to stay there. Now she has to get the house in shape quickly - the childhood friend Chip (Bobby Johnston) comes to the rescue. Chip helps her bring the house into working order. She hires two local slackers to work at her lodge - chips sister Bait (Samantha McConnell) and her sex buddy Hank. <br /> <br /> Now the guests are coming. The first to arrive are Eric and Linda (Flower), two stereotypical lawyers who start with money. Linda and Eric get into a heated argument during a dinner party in the middle of the movie, which leads to their dissolution. sad stuff there. Next up is the novelist Sophia, played by B-movie goddess Monique Parent. She uses again this stupid alias Scarlet Johansing and this time she looks very professional - of course with blond hair. It would not be Monique if she did not have at least one scene in which she plays with herself - and she pledges herself during one of Eric and Linda's sex scenes. James and Shene (Devinn Lane) - yes, the porn star Devinn Lane) also shows up for a small weekend. Without knowledge of Shene, James and Christina have quite a history. James and Christina used to make an appointment, but Christina broke off to get to this cabin. James comes to the hut to bring back Christina, but his plan fails. Christina spills beans on Shene, causing Shene to enter and go to the local bar to undress for the locals. Shene lands in the now-only Eric's sleeping bag, and they go together. Bait realizes that she wants more than just sex with Hank, and Christine finds true love for Chip, with Sophia taking in everything and writing in her next novel. <br /> <br /> Actually ... if you ask me, the whole movie was like a novel. I do not know if the writer wanted this effect, but I got that impression. Sophia had some of the best lines in the movie and came up with the idea that this is a romance with a live action romance. She seems to enjoy all the battles and setbacks. <br /> <br /> Now for sex. There was a lot of it and it was the usual stick. Monique moaned in both sex scenes. This movie was exciting, and the story will actually get the audience interested between the sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Monique was just Monique From all the softcore actresses I've ever seen In recent years, she's the best actress in my opinion, she can really be acting and be sexy which is why she holds No. 1 in my Skinemax top 10 position in the soap opera "Passions", I do not know why she does not make it any more. "Flower was mostly a background scene." Samantha McConnell continues to impress me and Devinn Lane is another hardcore actress in the softcore realm and doing a pretty decent job doing it.) <br /> <br /> Sex: B (It was good, but not impressive, spectacular, lots of moans.) Not on the R's -Rated pay attention.) Version, trust me .... most of the good stuff is taken out. My grade is for the unabridged version.) <br /> <br /> Story: B (A solid plot, w I throw in a fake section "Ooh, the building inspector will turn us off" towards the end, which upsets things. The underlying story between Christina and James was nice, and Sophia's dialogue, full of the metaphors and images normally found in romance novels, was a nice touch.) All in all: B + ( I found this movie quite entertaining, it's not a surefire softcore hall-of-famer like "Girl for Girl," but it's a respectable addition to the Skinemax collection.)
