After years and years I will finally find this movie! I really wanted to see how it matched my memories. I remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine and waited behind two wooden boards crossed in the wooden ship, staring out with only a pale white face. This only attitude was probably the most refreshing attitude of my childhood. I remember how shivers ran down my back. When I see it now, it's obviously not scary, but quite unconscious, to see the same pictures again. If someone wants a copy please send a private message to me. <br /> <br /> The story itself is fairly standardized BCFF stuff. It is strange that the message this time is quite unclear - there is no real moral in itself (except that "spirits are here to help us?" Or "prejudice against ghosts!"). Greed / capitalist viewpoint regarding the Desire to benefit from the mine A massive act of irresponsibility on the part of the captain encouraging the two children to follow the vague implications of a mind not just into a mine, but into a new mine hole, which is absolutely dangerous the kids then climb down a giant ladder deep into the mines, simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too, and it's also strange that the ghost picks the boy to help the imprisoned adult, and not only helping the trapped adults to direct them.
