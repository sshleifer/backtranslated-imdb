I love how he experiments. From Tak Chappan was just as exciting as Satya and his company. Jatin, the newcomer, also fulfilled his role and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really irritating, but I think he suited the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has a lot of progress and no songs in the movie make it any better. I only wish that he logs Urmila on for his upcoming upcoming movies. I think they are the best director / actress I've ever seen. I have not seen Naach yet, but I'm looking forward to it. For some reason, I find Antra Maali not so exciting on screen - unlike Urmila.
