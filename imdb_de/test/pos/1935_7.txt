This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's earlier films and certainly has an unconventional theme. She makes money by dancing with men in a dance hall. She really does not like the work, but she lives. Her boyfriend seems to be a pretty nice guy but is also hounded by the rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after the marriage it turns out that her "nice guy" is a thief, a crazy weasel and the rich Cortez turns out to be a guy. By the end of the movie, Barbara had just enough, since every SANE woman would leave this terrible marriage. In the 1920s and early 30s, Hollywood did just about anything it wanted and some of them had themes or scenes that would surprise many today - such as nudity, adultery and bad language. While TEN CENTS A DANCE is not an obvious example of this morality, it does have an issue that would never have been possible after the creation and enforcement of the hardened Production Code from 1934 onwards. In a way, the code was great - after all, parents did not need to worry about what their children saw in movies (like nakedness in BEN HUR, 1925). However, it has also resulted in some of the films being over-disinfected - and it could not be possible to make and approve this film because it tends to glorify the divorce - a serious no-no from 1934 and beyond , That's a pity, because I do not think that TEN CENTS A DANCE was able to talk about it at all - especially because the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to an eager thief. Although the film could end in divorce and marry a man who had twice divorced himself, it could not be. Overall, the movie is interesting and thought provoking. It was also well equipped and suited its relatively short duration. Take a look at it. <br /> <br /> For your information - unfortunately Ricardo Cortez was NOT Hispanic, but changed his name because of possible prejudice because he was a Jew. He was an excellent leader of his time, but today everything is forgotten.
