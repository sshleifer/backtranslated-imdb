To those of you who commented on this movie earlier and hoped to see it again, I hope you did. It was aired today (November 28, '04) on the Lifetime Movie Network. I subscribe to Dish. Karen Arthur conducted William Petersen and Barbara Hershey in this southwestern Gothic-like story. The lighting, the cut, and the dialogue contributed significantly to the film, and Hershey and Peterson were perfectly cast for the roles, both playing sensitive, bold, and intuitive characters. The screenplay was excellent, as was the side cast. <br /> <br /> I did not know that the story was based on the truth before, and now that I know it, I have to stay because Santa Fe is a jump, a jump and a jump from Tucson. <br /> <br /> As an engineer, I was fascinated by the theme of the unique construction of the staircase and the man who designed and built it (who was he an angel? But the story, and there are several depictions like this is what fascinates you most, you certainly have a strong feeling that God was in his heaven in every detail of all this drama in history, and you know what I'm talking about for you who saw the movie For those of you who have not, I will not waste a minute of it ... <br /> <br /> Good holiday, Bob Shank Jr, Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ
