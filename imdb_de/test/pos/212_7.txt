None of that was on TV and probably will never happen again. From the first image of this police light that dazzled you, and from there you heard the words, "Police Unit - in color," you were shocked to see that this was not an ordinary sitcom. <br /> <br /> Also kill a "guest star" and then never refer to it again, where had you seen it before? Then the actual show started and if you were not careful, you would miss some jokes in the background. Do not pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry. This was the show for which VCRs were made, long before Married with Children or The Simpsons. <br /> <br /> The stories made no sense and the dialogue was sometimes so funny that you had to think about it for 5 minutes before realizing that it was a joke. <br /> <br /> The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came straight from Dragnet and they were absolutely straightforward (no funny accents or expressions), but instead puns and twists were absolutely played sentences. Only once, as I can remember, was there a segment for stupid laughter - a scene that included a visit to the dentist, suction, and lots of saliva. There were some boring moments - like the informant Johnny and a performance of some celebrities. That was an absolute joke, but they had to use it in all six episodes. Well. It can not be perfect. The important thing is that you have knelt deeply in tears of laughter for the rest of the time. Leslie Nielsen was fortunate that this revived his career by bringing the Frank Drebin character into 3 features, but that must be was also an Achilles heel. Can you remember seeing him in anything other than Naked Gun work? And do not count the terrible Mr. Magoo, who has been reworked for live action. He probably made a lot of money.
