I think this movie has everything. It has really cool music that I can never get out of my head. It has cool looking characters. IS REALLY funny (you know, the way you crush on the floor and you'll say the funny parts over and over for three weeks every day) after a robot) it's really cool. It's one of those movies that you and your whole family can watch, get together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy and see it twice more. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny parts, as when Kurt was trying to get Edison's attention, then shook his finger and threw a paintball gun at him to paint paintball. In this context, I told my cousins ​​who saw it and told them what had happened. There was also a really funny part as Edision ran into the room and Kurt was there (just before they argued) and Kurt talked about his "weird dream" and how he was "Superman". I loved this part, although it has been a while since I saw it, so I do not remember that part. Everything the actors said was funny, as Kurt says, "I worship you like a GOD!" to the robot. <br /> <br /> Although there were some bad things, it was a great movie. Man, I can not stop laughing. I wish I had this movie. );
