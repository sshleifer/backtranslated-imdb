FOUR FRIENDS was billed for the first time at HBO in 1982 as a sleeping hit. When I heard the term "sleeper" at the age of 14, I really wanted to see one. (!) Boy - I was surprised! This movie! I did not really fall in love with a movie without special effects outside of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE - not to mention a "hippie movie" ... but after growing up with a few hippies, I understood the power behind Mr Penn's film , FOUR FRIENDS are definitely unique. The script is so personal - and this cast !!! Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor so well! He embodies only the "writer type" at a discount - both smart and awkward (the scene at the window ...) and strong yet so vulnerable. For me, it starts to be what it's like to be so agitated by Agirl that it lasts for over a decade ... and I've always found consolation in the character - and in the movie. FOUR FRIENDS was a crime partner for me in the '80s - and I caught the movie on HBO whenever I could, even if I had to stay up until 5 in the morning! And yet always at the end - it's a sense of loss when all these wonderful characters are disconnected from the spectators on the beach. Jodi Thelen personifies "this girl" to the point - it's so hard not to be charmed by her. This movie is really a test of time. Now and then I watch my video ... or show it to a friend ... and it still gets a solid reaction. I have known women who absolutely fall in love with Georgia! So many levels ..! Only an incredible little piece of human 60s. Very special, very magical. I recently found THE NOVELISATION OF FOUR FRIENDS by Robert Grossbach - and it's even more detailed than the movie! Current dates etc. A real find! And even more - haha ​​- I found the novel when I was looking around in a second-hand bookstore ... in Omaha, NE from ALL places !!! I think you have to keep an eye on her! When I was working in L.A. in 1992, I worked as an extra - I went to a reddish little store for memorabilia - and there were a lot of stills from the movie !!! Unfortunately - I was broke and could not give in ... but boy, these photos of Georgia and the boys together have just gone through me! I met director Joe Sergant on the set of SKYLARK in Emporia, KS, in the summer of 92 ... and we talked about FOUR FRIENDS - very cool! Besides ... I worked in a video library in Omaha in 98 - waiting for a woman who was related to Jim Metzler ...! I told her to tell her that there was a child in Omaha who just watched the movie fanatically - and made the best of it. Once again - the movie captures everything that Danilo's character has in his heart ... great, great work - one of the best efforts of Ms. Tesich and Penn. Steve Tesich is painfully missing. An incredible writer. "Isadora Duncan !!!" <br /> <br /> - C.
