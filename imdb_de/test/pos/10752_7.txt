For those looking for the crazy stunts that featured a dumb Harold Lloyd comedy, this is not the movie for you. What The Cat's Paw gives us is an interesting and atypical character for Lloyd who wanted to establish himself in the sound. <br /> <br /> For me, the film comparison closest to Lloyd is Peter Sellers in Being There. With all the training Lloyd had received in dealing with the world, he could have been as well-insulated as Sellers. <br /> <br /> But where he grew up, he was a missionary child in China and I do not know how much Christianity he and his family could teach the Chinese, but young Harold has learned the wisdom of Chinese philosopher Lin Po he's constantly quoted as a fortune-cookie aphorism. As it turns out, Lin Po turns out to be a wise guy. <br /> <br /> However, Lloyd's father, Samuel S. Hinds, has decided that his son needs some training in the modern world of 20th-century America, and send him back. Be the guest of the Pastor of the Native Church that supports the mission. The pastor there is the constant candidate for the reform movement of the city of Stockport. But no sooner does Lloyd come and the pastor dies. <br /> <br /> Now the reform movement is a scam and the pastor a patsy of political bosses who need a strawman opponent at every election. They decide that Lloyd may be a better Patsy than the guy who just died. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Patsy in these films proves not so easy as a suggestion. In fact, Lloyd is constantly quoting Lin Po. The way Charlie Chan distributed his wisdom is the opponent of the crooks who run stockport. In addition, Lloyd wins the admiration of Una Merkel, an equally cynical lady as Jean Arthur in Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith. The cat's paw is still a beautiful political satire, though it did not establish Harold Lloyd as big a name as in silent movies. A handsome cast of players was selected by director Sam Taylor, who was crowned by George Barbier, who plays a political boss who discovers Lloyd and actually shows a series of honesty.
