It just shows how wrong you can be. I did not expect to like this movie. I was disappointed with both the Kill Bill movies (though I preferred the second) and Death Proof (though it was better in the shorter cut of the double-slip release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature filmmaker - technically superior - including the last great performance that Robert De Niro has evoked. Since then, while his films were okay (I did not hate them), it seems to me that he has been pouring water into referential, reverent, selfish Juvenilia. <br /> <br /> Then I read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and I hated it! Sure, it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were some great characters. But on the side, it was more youthful garbage that was largely ruined by the title's uninteresting Basterds. I seriously thought about not seeing the movie. The followers did not convince me. It was not until I had the opportunity to see the film in London with a Tarantino Q & A episode that I changed from my head. I thought it would be worthwhile to hear him in Q & A, as I know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person. <br /> <br /> So little was I prepared for the sheer fun and glamor of the Inglourious Basterds. Mr. Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown is a triumph. Yes, the references are there, but they do not disturb the story, they are not the driving force. Yes, Eli Roth is stunt casting, but he works well, has little to do, but looks aggressive and does not care about the movie, as I had feared. While admiring Mr. Tarantino for using stunt wife Zoe Bell in Death Proof to amplify the excitement of the great stunt scene, the lack of any key acting abilities was a problem for the movie. The same can be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, notably Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, written by Tarantino. <br /> <br /> What this work really does is how tall it is. The Western atmosphere of spaghetti for much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully exaggerated, without falling too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so great. The audacity so great. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers I was bothered by the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance, but they are funny in the context of the movie. Pitt is really brilliant here, just what he has to be. He's Mifune's stormy samurai in Yojimbo, he's Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there's a James Coburn vibe and of course a suitable Lee Marvin advantage. <br /> <br /> Christoph Waltz (who I did not know before) and Melanie Laurent (who I first saw in a brilliant French-speaking British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and I think both will be much more in the future used. Obviously Tarantino did not lose his eye for casting, which seemed to leave him in Death Proof. Waltz is just as big in his performance. Terrible and yet theatrical. He is Fonda of OUATITW, Van Cleef of Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is fit Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. Both are blind here. <br /> <br /> That every member of the cast gets the fun of what they do, while not only enjoying themselves, having fun and laughing, helps enormously. The laughter - and there are many - comes organically. Only Mike Myers is on the verge of tipping the mark and pushing too far, but his scene is just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender, who seems to have snatched straight out of the gray of Attenborough's Great Escape leader /> All Actors shine and Tarantino casts wonderful flourishes, but those who work with history. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is an uprising. After a sensational slow opening and a glorious intro to these inglorious Basterds, the tempo never goes away for over two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> It also looks nice and marks this as a return to the real movie - rather than complacent stupidity. As always, the musical decisions are inspired by Morricone. <br /> <br /> The movie is bold and hilarious. After a summer in which almost every movie has disappointed me, it was a great surprise that the really funny and entertaining, but also engaging and impressive movie should be this, if I had never believed it from script form. Welcome back, QT.
