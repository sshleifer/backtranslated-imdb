The director and author Jean-Pierre Rappenau was eight years old in the spring of 1940, when the Third Republic of France broke up within a few weeks. It was a time when "all adults were a bit crazy". He and the production staff have lovingly and meticulously recreated this world in a film in which all characters are essentially fictional. The structure, a classic farce, is ideal for the period in which multiple plotlines dovetail and overlap to form a logical, satisfying conclusion. The basis for this plot is Frederic, played by the brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere, who meets Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The real strength of the film lies in the supportive services. Mr. Rappeneau has exquisitely cast the film with actors who voluntarily have ideas for actions and dialogues and who know and prove that it is possible to fully implement a character with only two short sentences of dialogue. Although not as influential as Renoir's "Rules of the Game", "Bon Voyage" is well worth a companion to this classic. Although the audience demands a lot, there is a lot back. One of the demands is tolerance for a certain deception and misleading about the genre we are looking at: a crime melodrama, no, a spy thriller, oh, a romantic comedy. Recommend it to friends. Just let her know that it's a romantic comedy.
