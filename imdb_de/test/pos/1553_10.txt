If you focus on alternative realities and think about what is real and what is just a fantasy, then this is a thriller that will inspire you and make you think. Try to get a copy of it and see for yourself! I saw it recently at a LA film festival and it was by far the best in the group I've seen. It helped that it really was about something, unlike the others that were screened. It is very well directed and the production value is first class. I would compare it to Jacob's Ladder because it gives you an idea of ​​the actual reality of the world in which we find ourselves. Definitely try to hunt this movie, and if it's happening at festivals near you, try listening.
