I've seen this movie in 75 years, and for me, this film was a kind of openness about how important it is to care for wildlife and wildlife. When I got a dog, I called him TRUSKA (In Movie..Avakuns Dog) to never forget this movie. By the way, I have a copy of this movie, but it is in Portuguese and the quality is not as good as a DVD or a new VHS (I recorded almost 20 years ago and in SLP-Speedy. ) So the quality is not that good ..) <br /> <br /> If someone wants a copy ... will I try to convert to DVD and I can send you OK? <br /> <br /> Ot's A great movie, and I agree that this movie always has to be viewed.
