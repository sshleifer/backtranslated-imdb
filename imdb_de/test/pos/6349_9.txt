A rich experience can be gained by watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a seemingly simple story of a gifted student, Yiu Kwok, who later becomes a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. He is married and has two sons. At home, it seems normal. He still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage, and his sons alternately fill him with pride (the elder) and disappointment (the younger). His passion for poetry makes him an object of astonishment for an older student in one of his classes. The student, Choi Lam, draws pictures of him during the lesson, one of them with a flower coming out of his mouth. She teases him more with her intelligence than with her sexuality, although that too is an element. Of course, he is not immune to their attention, although for a while he tries to maintain the demarcation line between teacher and student. <br /> <br /> The reason why he does not succeed in the end is complicated. First, the communication between him and Choi Lam is very deep. It becomes clear that she really likes him and it is mutual. Second, there is a long-standing problem in his marriage that is brought to light when an old friend of his wife and wife gets sick. The consequences of the woman's involvement in this friend, past and present, are almost too sad to endure. <br /> <br /> In this film nothing is treated insignificantly. All characters have a living inner life and an easily recognizable story. The two leads, Jacky Cheung and Anita Mui, are outstanding, as are Karena Lam as student Choi Lam and Shaun Tam as older son On Yin. <br /> <br /> Recommended without reservation.
