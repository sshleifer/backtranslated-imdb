I just love this movie and I programmed my TV to record when it returns on November 2nd. It's a really nice love story with a twist. The song that is played at the end of the film is one that you do not think would be a big hit, but it's a song that stays in your head. I'm trying to find the song so I can hear it and play it. I really do not have any style for the shows I see, or the songs I like to hear, so I'm pretty open to seeing things open-minded. I would like to say that there are some parts in this film that are not intended for the whole family. This movie shows skin. It's a bit like a lifelong movie for women, about women. I say to watch the movie, and you like it just like me.
