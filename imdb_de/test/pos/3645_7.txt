Like I said, I'm not a fan of Tweety. He's just so annoying, I wish Sylvester would just eat him and put it behind him. In this cartoon, Sly is homeless again and returns from garbage cans. He discovers a cruise ship leaving the harbor nearby and decides to board if Tweety is one of the passengers. <br /> <br /> The ship provides a proper stage for the subsequent abductions, and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If it is only once, he succeeds by chewing and swallowing, ending the irritating Canary forever. But when cartoons starring Tweety are pretty good, but thanks to this brilliant cat they are EVERYTHING.
