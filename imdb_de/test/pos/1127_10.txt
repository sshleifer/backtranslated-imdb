I love this program. I hate it when it comes to the season finale, because it feels like forever, until the season starts again !! I watched this show since the pilot threw all the way where Rusty started college, and sees Casey as his sister. Now that he goes out with Dana. I love this show. I am so glad that Cappie and Casey finally got together again, which drove me crazy !!! As far as Evan and rebecca are concerned, I hope they get back together, which feels like in the final. I've looked at the bulk of the cast and am so shocked that Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) is the daughter of Kelsey Grammar !!! this just surprises me so much and the other thing that is a huge SHOCKER is that she was born the same year as me and that she was born at my baby brother date of birth with my year and I watched her all the time had and had no idea !!
