-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy end * boo * <br /> <br /> - "Jaded" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a city trying to escape her past , There she meets two lesbians and after a few drinks they decide to have fun. But one of the girls goes a little too far and rapes her while the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach, where the incident happens the next day, and is taken to a hospital. After that, we spend the rest of the movie trying to bring the two girls down, while at the same time finding new information about who she is and where she comes from, and a bit about her past. <br /> <br /> - Director and co-writer Caryn Krooth does an excellent job with this film, considering his budget is very low. It is held in the hand and sometimes looks like 16mm, but fits in with the movie because the story demands a tough look. The actors are doing everything right with what they are given and there is nothing to complain about. The outstanding feature of the film is of course Carla Gugino, who shows everything in this film. She is actually more naked in this movie than in "Sin City". Christopher McDonald is also in the movie, but his character is really pointless, but it's fun to look at him. I did not really pay much attention to the music, because it does not really attract attention, but it does the work with what it has. The movie is R-rated and for a very good reason. It is sometimes very sexual and very vivid. It's essentially bordering on softcore at times, but the sex scenes are necessary for the movie, so it does not feel like it's just there to be there. Although there is a pointless scene where Chris McDonald does everything right, this scene was a bit pointless, but it's probably not a big problem, I think. The only flaw in the movie is that, after all that we go through in the film, we can not see the trial. It's like having sex and no orgasm or anything. <br /> <br /> -It's a shame that the talented Caryn Krooth has never made a feature film since then. This is a highly gifted woman who can do great things on a small budget. I really hope she's back in the game soon, because she's a great director. Jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema. Instead, we have a fun movie showing a great director. <br /> <br /> - Hide the kids and close the curtains, you do not want people I think you watch porn while watching this movie.
