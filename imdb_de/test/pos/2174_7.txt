First, let me confess that I have not read this particular Balzac novel. Maybe I direct my caverns to director and publisher unfairly. My experience with Balzac in other stories is still that he writes as a realist rather than an obscurantist. This is certainly a movie that pays off, but in the end it leaves you completely confused. Was the colonel a fraud used by the lawyer for his own purposes (or whose person goes beyond himself)? or was the colonel not a fraud, but as aforesaid by the lawyer; or did the lawyer really try to serve the honest colonel? The director and / or the editor seem to have deliberately obscured these questions for me, which does not look like the realist Balzac. At the same time, the film does an excellent job of defining the characters, if not their motives, and the cast and production is superb. This opening battlefield scene will keep track of dreams. However, it is still surprising that contemporary filmmakers all too often prefer ambiguity. Were not the problems and motives of all these characters for Yves Angelo complicated enough?
