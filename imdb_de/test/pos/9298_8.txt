Let's face it, Australian television is mostly awful, but this is a real diamond in the rough that does not see enough people. The chase crew that releases the satirical newspaper and CNNN are trying out something new by combining live comedy, recorded skits, and political satire into a show filmed in front of a live audience, much like Rove, but funny. They love to cause controversy and this causes some of the funniest moments in the show, especially Chris, who asks his wife to "float" live on breakfast television, and Julian hands over a novelty check signed by Saddam Heusein to the head of the AWB. It must be one of the funniest Australian shows since the Micallef program.
