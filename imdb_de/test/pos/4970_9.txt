Deep Blood ... It's one of those movies you talk about here, and you say no other Italian Jaws rip off! Well, Deep Blood is a long way off. It's cheap because filming is possible, and on the other hand, it's also creative. In Jaws and all the other shark movies we've all seen, or from herds, they all use fake sharks. Well, Joe D'Amato's film takes a new approach by using all the stock footage for his shark scenes. This is one of the many reasons why I like Deep Blood so much because it did not use any footage. In Deep Blood, an ancient Indian ghost terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark. In Joe D'Amato's Shark classic Deep Blood. It seems that an Indian elder once warned a group of teenagers of this great evil in the sea, and years later friends are forced to face their fears when one of them is killed by a shark during a series of coastal attacks becomes. Now it is the remaining few to make sure this monster is killed, even if it means going to sea to do it. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato directed and produced this film under his company the Filmirage. Released in 1989, it was later used along with many other shark films in Bruno Mattei's Cruel Jaws: Jaws 5. Joe D'Amato's Hai entry is a great movie, and every Joe D'Amato fan from Shark Movie Watcher should try.
