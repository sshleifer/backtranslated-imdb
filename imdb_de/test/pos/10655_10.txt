I ventured something tonight when I saw this movie. I tried to wean myself from the silent movie results. Sure, when this movie was originally distributed, a piano score was probably played with it. Often the director chose the score itself (Charlie Chaplin often composed the notes of his later silent films). However, most of the music you hear on silent tapes on VHS tapes is not the same kind of music that should be played when the movie is first released. And then there were a lot of silent movies that were played without score. I do not know the story of Potemkin's score, so I decided to look at it for the medium in which this artwork was produced in the film. <br /> <br /> Shortly after I switched off the music without the musical interpretation of the emotions on the screen (or should I say, unhindered), I was totally committed to the film. Visually, it is one of the most impressive of all films. Eisenstein was a master of composition. The editing, possibly the cinematic technique for which Eisenstein (Montage) is famous, is extraordinary. The mood of this movie is anger, and excited my passions. <br /> <br /> It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent movie, especially a drama, but movies like Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is well worth it. Come on! You owe it to see this movie! Their education is incomplete without them.
