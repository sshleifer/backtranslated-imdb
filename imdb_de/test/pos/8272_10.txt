I am so happy that I recorded it on VHS when it was shown at the Master Piece Theater. This is a movie that I can watch again and again. As if life in the early 19th century in England is not hard enough, Prue is born with a "rabbit's lip" and expelled from birth. The people in her village accept her, but always fear that she is "of the Devil's Forge" and that she will address her quickly. Especially when bad luck hits her family. She is strong and courageous, but shies away from Kester Woodseaves, a traveling weaver who draws her eye. Partly because she fears the rejection and because she thinks he's so masculine that he should have a wife as pretty as a lily. Kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of the time. He expresses his opinion and follows his heart. The film remains true to the original story of Mary Webb and thrilled from beginning to end.
