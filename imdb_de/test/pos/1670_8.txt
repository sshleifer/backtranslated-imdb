Du rififi chez les hommes is a brilliant film that explores criminal minds and gives viewers a better understanding of criminals who are fundamentally different from ordinary people like us. What director Jules Dassin shows is that criminals have families and care about them so they stick to a strict code of honor. For them, a family consists not only of wives, lover and children, but also occasional friends and close friends. Unlike many believe that it is hard to believe, Jules Dassin has not tried to glorify the crime in his film, as Rififi does. It is clear that crime never pays off. It shows that all kinds of bad activities can lead to a human loss. In addition to his philosophical attitude, Rifif is worth watching over for its technical finesse. Watching one of the movie's most brilliant sequences about breaking a safe box It's hard to believe the meticulous precision with which criminal heads put their plans into practice. This is a scene no one in Hollywood dared to copy.
