OK. A warning to anyone who is a parent or guardian. Be careful who you watch this movie with, ie - Do not bring kids to watch this movie. I explain why. <br /> <br /> 1 - the title is misleading and the movie has nothing to do with romance - I assume that this was completely intentional for the producers, but annoying is 2 - the movie itself is really, really very disturbing. I have some problems - first, the fact that the film is neither violent nor sexual and therefore not a "horror movie". But it's a very disturbing movie that involves a kid and his parents as well as a small town. <br /> <br /> OK, it boils down to that. The film is not suitable for minors because it contains sequences and images that are disturbing and confusing to a child. It's a bizarre quality, and it's ONLY because it has a kid that makes me feel it's inappropriate. As a parent myself, I feel strong enough to want to tell people because I recently read that there is a release in the cinemas. I think it's my right because it gets a publication and only has a rating of M (because it is not violent or sexual). Just funny and disturbing, but pretty good in and of itself.
