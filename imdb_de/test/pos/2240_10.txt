I would like to point out these excellent points for this movie: <br /> <br /> # 1 Angelina Jolie Sex Scene <br /> <br /> # 2 Foley Artist Has Owned <br /> <br /> # 3 plot was pretty thick <br /> <br /> # 4 DVD includes trailers and chapter stops <br /> <br /> # 5 No animals were hurt in creating the movie <br /> <br /> # 6 tributes to Blade Runner throughout the movie <br /> <br /> # 7 burning garbage bins <br /> <br /> # 8 funny guy without legs <br /> <br /> # 9 voice overs from Jack Palance added a real dynamic element to the movie. <br /> <br /> # 10 Sage recommends, for example, "If you eat with the devil, bring a long spoon". <br /> <br /> # 11 Angelina Jolie was only 18 years old! <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It was an evening of entertainment.
