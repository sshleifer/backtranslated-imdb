Impressive! The French get the hang of it. When we watch their first Asterix movie, we see a good story with nice actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeu), but very lame special effect. In a fantasy story like Asterix, special effects are really important. Well, they did it right this time! It looks great. I personally think that Mission Cleopatra is the best Asterix story ever written. In the movie, no moment is boring. Go and have a look! One thing! They did not go exactly to the script, which I find a bit piquant. For example, in the comic Obelix breaks the nose of the sphinx, immediately all the small shopkeepers begin to break the nose of their miniature sphinx. (really funny to see) .. Well, they did not put it in the movie, instead they dug their noses under the sphinx. Asterix: "You will never look for it here" (guess again). Was funny, but not as good as the original. Another thing I did not like about the movie was the choice of music. It made the movie for kids. But still ... It's a must, C! <br /> <br /> Grz Da Jean Holland
