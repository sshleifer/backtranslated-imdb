Forget about Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and instead opt for this clever comedy of fallacies. I suspect that only institutionalized sexism explains why this film and Stanwyck's other great Christmas story "Meet John Doe" are not worshiped with the same degree of love ... Well, you know what the name is. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck plays as a food writer for a McCall-type rag who has been lying to her pompous publisher for years on the folk backdrop for her recipes. She is an Ace artist until the day Morgan's sailor is towed out of the sea after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks rest at a naval hospital. The film was released in the final year of World War II and is dusted with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia, but never sinks into sentimentality. As always, Stanwyck is sexy and rude, and meets her match in the well-attended Morgan, whom she is loved at first sight. Unfortunately, she has to get married to Gardiner's snappy architect, who has been looking for her hand on CT farm for years, just to fool her boss. <br /> <br/> S.Z. Sakall adds much Hungarian malapropic & double-entender humor as support for Babs' true source of culinary talent. Una O'Connor is hilarious as Gardiner's vile Irish housekeeper.
