I do not understand why all people rate this movie negatively?!?! I loved this movie! Bled is a form of abstract art, and if you do not appreciate art, I can see why you do not like this movie. It was a great change from the average, the vampire movie. If you're looking for a fresh, new and ingenious new vampire movie, then this is for you. But if you want one of them to become bats, wolves, and smolder in the sunlight movies, then watch your old Dracula movies. Sure, it's a bit on the low budget side, but they did a great job with the budget they had. I am very happy that I found this movie because I wanted to give up the vampire genre. I found this movie brilliant! I'll give the author, the director and everyone involved in the movie two thumbs up.
