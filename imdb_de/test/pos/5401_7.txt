The NYT report says that Sigourney Weaver's character is tense and frustrated, and that she may later become the sister of MTM's character in Ordinary People. Say what? Under no circumstance. This lady was bizarre from the beginning. NOTHING like MTM in normal people. I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> Next, the NYT says that Sandy Travis from Sigourney Weaver and Ben Travis from Jeff Daniel's 40-year-old "Children of the 60s" are. Mrs. Weaver has to dance a jig. I believe that by the time she made Imaginary Heroes, she was actually 55 years old. She was born in 1949. <br /> <br /> NYT fixes aside, this was a pretty good movie, considering it was made by so young people. Obviously Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels believed too. The young man who plays Tim was outstanding. <br /> <br /> There are some critical comments that I could make into the script. So I never really understood why Sandy Travis misses her son. Her kind of blown-off behavior may have been triggered by his death, but this behavior continued. I of the entire film, which I thought had more to do with her stagnation marriage, her relationship with Tim, and where he really came from, and other unresolved issues than the grief of her older son. Ben's grief was much clearer. <br /> <br /> So Matt Travis was an asshole. Did his mother think that too? Nevertheless, a very worth watching movie. What is becoming clearer and clearer is not that there is no role for women over a certain age, but that it takes a director like this to fall so in love with an older woman (Ms. Weaver) and almost make it his film pays homage to her. A kind of anti-woody Allen.
