It is a soap opera based on an idea of ​​applied ethics. A film about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie. I did not get any emotions from it, the ideas are not new at all, the tension is missing, it gets boring from the second half, but in the end I think it gets quite interesting in a burlesque way. I mean, you have this paralyzed middle-aged bald man who gets more women than Don Juan. He does not seem to suffer as much as one would expect from someone who has been completely paralyzed for over 28 years, he has no problems with God (and one might expect that to be so), the people around him Seems to be the perfect slaves (I can not forget Bergman's cries and whispers, much like this in many ways, that just bursts with emotion (and not all of them humane)) etc. This movie is the perfect recipe for housewives who Look for an emotional thrill But do not expect to get blown away. The film is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today, as it sincerely intends to pose a modern ethical question without arousing the viewer. Amenabar does not rub his face and he does not take sides, he does not want to make us fanatics for a particular idea. I still have no idea why this movie was so highly regarded.
