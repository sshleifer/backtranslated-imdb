Kramer vs. Kramer is a film that you can hold on and not forget. It's not one of the most popular movies ever made, and certainly one of the weakest best feature films, but it does not mean it's still not important. I thought the movie was well done and made you want to see more and more of it. The performances were the best thing for the movie and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles ever as a lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son as his wife separates from him. Hoffman's son Billy, along with Meryl Streep, the depressed mother of Billy, played another great feat. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the best movies and not a perfect 10, but manages to make the movie worth seeing and valuable. Certainly one of Hoffman's best films he has ever made. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Hedens view: 9/10 *** + A-
