S. Epatha Merkerson shines as a nanny in this touching and living look at the life of Ruben Santiago Jr. (Marcus Franklin) while growing up under the tutelage of Nanny. The film offers a good character study of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture the ups and downs of life in a realistic way, as opposed to so many memoirs that are included in the film. The cast provides a lot of sparks and many identifiable faces appear in smaller roles, including Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Jr., Liev Scribe, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo and Patricia Wettig. Towards the end it loses steam and liveliness, and the final sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling. But overall a great movie with a truly outstanding performance by Merkerson.
