Director Jay Craven's adaptation of Howard Frank Mosher's "Where the Rivers Flow to the North" is one of the finer transitions from literature to video. Craven admires Mosher's work - he also directed "A Stranger in the Kingdom." <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding - especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal. Torn offers perhaps the best role of his career - Noel Lord, the wildly independent former woodcutter who is at the heart of this story. Tantoo Cardinal's portrayal of Lord's housekeeper / wife is also dead. I am both surprised and disappointed that no one was nominated for an Oscar at the time of this movie's release. Benefits of this caliber should be recognized. The only character who is a bit hard for me to swallow is the executive executive of Michael J. Fox. He just looks too much like a kid in this role. I think there is a curse of youthful looks no matter how much people want them. Craven has done a good job of bringing the character of the Vermonts of the early 20th Century to the screen - places, angles all together to transport the viewer to the time and place of history. The cinematographer Paul Ryan was exceptional. The score of the Horseflies is also first class - it fits in perfectly with mood and landscape. <br /> <br /> And the story itself ...? One of the most convincing depictions of the fiercely independent American pioneering spirit of all time - a quality that is becoming less and less in this time. When it appears in modern times, the person is often viewed with suspicion and contempt. In Noel Lord we have a character we can admire for his values ​​and even for his stubbornness. <br /> <br /> This is not a boring "period piece", but a vivid look at a bygone era and a kind of character that has almost disappeared. These are not gilded heroes, but real people, in which both strengths and weaknesses come to fruition. to fight in a harsh environment to live your life and at the same time have peace with the world in which you live. Like today, there are those who exercise power that otherwise would.
