This movie is amazing, although it is not perfect for Hollywood standards, it includes a gentle look at the wide gap between rich and poor, black and white, which is true in many parts of the world. It handles the audience with children's gloves and gives a truthful look at social issues. The children are beautiful, especially the young man who plays sipho. The friendships that develop are generally true, everyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make. The influence of adults is interesting - it seems to be taken away from the experiences of real life, as there are conversations of conversations and interactions - as a child would remember. I would highly recommend this movie.
