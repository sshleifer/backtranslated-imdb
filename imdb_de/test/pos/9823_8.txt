Like many others, I was attracted to the combination of Pollack, Ford and Scott-Thomas. I had enjoyed the work of Pollack and Ford on Sabrina, a well-made film and a careful reworking of the old material. When I heard that this movie was in production, I ordered and read the book. It immediately seemed that this would be more difficult to film. The characters are not always sympathetic, there is little humor, and the author makes numerous action shortcuts to focus on his main theme: this is because everyone views the other as the only one who brings with him the unique combination of loss and betrayal Plane crash, the completely surprised spouses of adulterers would visit each other. In addition, he imagines that a bitter exploration of the hidden lives of adulterers could provide a satisfying solution, and that this experience of "fat and thin" could result in a deeper love than anyone has ever been able to. Although much of the book deals with their bitterness and their hatred for the former partners, one finally finds acceptance and forgiveness. The script only retains the plane crash and the common situation of the spouse. Where the woman is the researcher of research, it is the man in the film, and the woman is never a willing co-researcher. The film has a whole new dramatic signature for Harrison Ford, which seems even more thought-out than the double accident of the plane crash. Also new is the negotiation "congresswoman for re-election" for the woman, which, however, works better. The audience can not live up to the expectations of pure romance or romantic comedy as this story focuses on a very bitter pill. However, if the book achieves determination and forgiveness, but the reader takes the bitterness and allows ease, there is no corresponding moment in the film. Although forgiveness is never suggested, we can assume that healing after a shoot fulfills double duties. The character of Ford does not have to be so indefinite and the change of emphasis of Scott-Thomas is a bit disturbing at first. This movie is not the loss suggested by others. However, it is a hard-to-evaluate film, as the rewriting and adaptation to the screen is below the standard the director has previously achieved.
