I did not expect much from this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it and found it very remarkable. It is remarkable, mainly due to the talent and charm of his star, John Garfield. Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star framed for murder. He has to flee and ends with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is a chance for salvation, but will the past catch up with him? Garfield was an actor in front of his peers. Before the term "method" was ever coined and before Brando ever "Stella!" he brings "of course" on the screen. Its earthy quality and amazing acting talent determine this production. It is also interesting that his role as a boxer has something of the 'Golden Boy' role he desperately wanted on the big screen. Garfield looks like a guy and goes into the distance as a boxer, which proves his acting value. <br /> <br /> Ann Sheridan plays here in a small role as Jack's trampy girl Goldie. I never thought much of Sheridan, but I liked her here. She plays well by Garfield. Dickson's performance is a bit tired and she does not share the good chemistry with Garfield. The Dead End Kids are here and Garfield seems to be their natural idol (even more so than Cagney). Claude Rains is miscast and looks uncomfortable in some scenes. Strange, since he has always been such a reliable actor. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is the director Busby Berkeley, who is known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscopic images of lightness. He has a consistently admirable atmosphere. <br /> <br /> A very good movie that deserves more attention. 8.10.
