Not a simple movie that initially sounds unpleasant with the two main characters, but thankfully, Paula Sage's touching performance is the heart and soul of the film, driving the film into unknown waters and transcending the rather clumsy plot. This gives the film a sense of real truth and makes you think you've seen something special. (7/10)
