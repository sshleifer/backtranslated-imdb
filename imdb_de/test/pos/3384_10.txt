I really enjoyed the north and the south. I think it's one of the best and most elaborate TV series I've ever seen. The caliber of the cast is amazing, you have actors from the golden age of cinema, people like James Stewart, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons, along with other actors who were the new faces of the 80s, like Patrick Swayze James Read, Jonathan Frakes, Genius Francis, Philip Casnoff and Lesley-Anne Down. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men, Orry Main (Patrick Swayze), who comes from the south and George Hazard (James Read), who comes from the north. Throughout the series, their friendship is constantly threatened by the variety of backgrounds, especially with regard to the treatment of slaves in the South (especially on the Orry plantation). However, if everyone needs the other, they will forget the arguments and help their friend. I really liked the chemistry between the two men and was really interested in seeing if their friendship could survive the war. <br /> <br /> I liked how the series showed what life was like before the war so that the public could see what it was. These were the factors that led to the war, what happened then, then Destruction of a nation that was torn apart and then the nation that had to rebuild the country. The war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic for me. <br /> <br /> I think what's great is that there are so many elements going through, romance, history, battles that would interest most people, there's something for everyone. I really enjoyed the romance between Brett (Genie Francis) and Billy (Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell), especially when she resisted her sister Ashton for the first time. The other romances were interesting, because not all were the same, and everyone had something different than the others, which led me to especially watch the story section Madeline and Orry, to see if they would end up together. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best American mini-series I've seen, the story had the right balance of romance and the more serious story that happened back then, but it's just right. The characters are very good to see and the venues are beautiful and the music, especially at the beginning and end of the episode, is as good as tiptoe and works with the mood of the story.
