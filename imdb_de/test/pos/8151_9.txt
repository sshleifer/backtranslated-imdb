I love a cute, warm movie with a happy ending. This movie could be considered a drama in which two characters realize true love, but the story is so touching and so sweet that in my eyes it is a romance. Granted, acting is not that great (that is, I did not give her 10), but they do the job and they do not exaggerate (thank God) and they are cute, but the story is powerful and just adorable ( Some pansies will suffocate !!!!!! It's a great watch for a love story, but if you're homophobic, stay away! For everyone else I loved the movie, it's so cute! I felt it a smaller back-back, but with a happy ending .... so have fun !!
