If you have not seen this movie, do it. It's a genre mix since I've never seen anyone else. Some very surreal scenes, some funny stuff, a movie noir-felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (the second best played orgasm in the movie, surpassed only by Sally), a pitch by Orson Welles that turns into one Artwork united. As a work of art it does not have to be logical in the end, at least not logical for everyone ;-). I had a TV copy on VHS, but lent it to an ex-girlfriend and can not get it back now. But the film should be released on DVD on 10.06.03 in Austria and sure that I will buy it.
