That was an excellent movie! I saw this at the Karlovy Vary IFF in the Czech Republic and won a prize there. This is the first movie I ever saw of Jan (the director), and I was impressed. It's a great story about love and family. The movie offers a great balance of comedy, romance, drama and suspense in one. I will not give away any of the plot, but this is a well-made movie and I would take another look at it if I had the chance! The cinematography / editing is great, the movie just flows and the characters are warm and they are the kind to identify with. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I do. If anyone knows where I can find this in the United States, or if he wants to publish it soon, please let me know !!
