I searched for this movie for years. I have great memories of first-class acting and singing in this movie. I never knew that the reason for the film was unavailable because the Gershwin family - SHAME ON THEM - tried to quell American Classic !! I can only hope that they give in and allow this film to be released and enjoyed by the American public. Sammy Davis, Jr. is his absolute best in this film. The only other performance of him is that she is the same in "Anna Lucasta". Another terrific movie that I wish he would appear on DVD. <br /> <br /> Porgy & Bess contained a first-class All-Star cast. I hope one day you will be able to see for yourself.
