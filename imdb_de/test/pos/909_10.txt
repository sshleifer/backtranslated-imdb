Transcendent, Demanding, Insistent, Emotional, Powerful ... I could imagine a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and its intelligence, and yet I would feel that they were inadequate. I can only say that I'm fascinated by this movie. Applause to Krzysztof Kieslowski, Zbigniew Preisner, Ir√®ne Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant. May "Rouge" live forever.
