WAGONMASTER is one of the most poetic narrative films ever made, yet it's hard to like right away. I love this movie, but I recommend seeing some other westerns by John Ford before he looks at it. When I saw it for the first time, I was 18 years old and had not seen many other westerns, and I hated it. I found it incredibly boring. I've always been waiting for something to happen. It took me several years to love this picture. At first, I fell in love with the westerns in general - the traditions, characters, landscapes, conversations, etc. - and that made it clear to me when I saw WAGONMASTER again, that a lot is happening there. <br /> <br /> I was also just an experienced moviegoer at the time and had learned to value visual storytelling and to hear what each picture tells me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual film by one of the most visual directors working at the height of his career. <br /> <br /> The film is a celebration of a lifestyle and the theme is more emotional and inner than other Ford Westerns. Actually, this is not really as accurate as saying that it has much less impact than the other Westerns. (The other westerns have externalities AND internal emotions.) She puts her Mormon pioneers in the context of nature. There are many shots of animals and children - not for a superficial, narrative purpose, but to illustrate this idea. Therefore, the film can be called a poem. It's not so much about the surface story (which hardly exists) as an emotional idea, and this idea is conveyed through composition, editing, sound, and music. Indeed, one could argue that this is a purer form of filmmaking, as the images directly express the film's emotional idea rather than serving a "story". <br /> <br /> Give this film a chance and allow it to exist on its own terms, not on the terms of other Western or other films.
