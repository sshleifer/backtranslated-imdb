I really liked this movie. The actors were great, especially Potente, who is different in every role; A man who can play anyone; and Loos, who spice things up (she is also a talented singer - she sings the song "My Truth", which was heard when a character turned up the stereo in the lab). Anatomy is a good horror flick that pays attention to its characters. It is also sometimes very bloody and the stage design is innovative. It's too bad they had to do a sequel that is far from the original. <br /> <br /> By the way, two other things that are worth mentioning. The DVD will not be dubbed, which makes the movie look better. Also, be sure to keep an eye out after rolling out the last credits.
