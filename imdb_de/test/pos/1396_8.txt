As a group of escaped prisoners flee to a remote island, it quickly turns out that their new home is occupied by a strangely threatening doctor (Richard Johnson of "Zombi 2"), a mad scientist (Joseph Cotten), his beautiful daughter ( Barbara Bach) and a horde of superstitious natives. The tribesmen say that the doctor created grotesque, half-human, half-fish-like creatures for evil, mysterious purposes. And although the prisoners do not believe this at first, they do not believe they gradually change their minds. "Screamers" is a very entertaining mix of "Mysterious Island" and "Humanoids from the Deep". There's plenty of gore with a really cool beheading scene and neck tearing to boost so-so, but the movie is fast paced and entertaining.
