I wanted to use 'The German Scream' as a summary, but that's been taken. It sums up anatomy well. Assuming you are familiar with reading subtitles, Anatomy fits perfectly into the Scream / Urban Legend package. It's a teen horror set in a medical school where students are missed and then appear as experimental subjects in the dissection lab. Cue a brave student who researches himself and uncovers a huge conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Assuming you watch the original German-language movie (I can not comment on the dub, have not seen the English version). Anatomy is sharply written and skilfully drawn, so that the tension never really subsides. Compared to its American counterparts, the puzzle is revealed much faster, which means that Anatomy is not a slasher until the final unveiling, but develops from a slasher come-body horror movie into a smart and exciting thriller during his run. It's a thrilling ride from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Hats off to the actors involved. Franka Potente proves once again that she is a smart, intelligent actress who can bring any role to life. Her central performance as Paula is a great foundation from which to build the film. The ghostly instructors and the companions of their teachers are equally good, a truly foresighted presence at all times. <br /> <br /> It's also amazing that the movie does not give much away. The pace is fast and punchy, very similar to the previous Urban Legend, which means there is always something going on to keep your attention high. If there is one drawback, some anatomy may find it too cruel for them, but if you stick to the admittedly graphic dissection sequences of the first half, you'll reward the second half with their thrilling thrill tones. I recommend Anatomy to anyone who likes a good teen horror, but is a bit detached from the American mindset.
