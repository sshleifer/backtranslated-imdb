Two things can happen when an ensemble is brought together. Either go out of the theater and ask, "Why?" or you get MANNA FROM HEAVEN, an adorable comedy by the Burton Sisters whose mother not only provided inspiration, but also the script itself. Ursula Burton plays Theresa, a nun whose friends and family had always believed they were touched by Gd Out of the sky, the clan uses the young Theresa's confidence that the money was a godsend so all her dreams could come true. Years passed and we found Theresa, who had returned to her native buffalo, and comes to the realization that the gift must be repaid and calls her friends and family (Oscar winners Shirley Jones, Louise Fletcher and Cloris Leachman) back to the Repay debts before Easter Sunday. The money has long been spent and all characters are in financial trouble. Shirley Jones and Frank Gorshin, a man and a woman who, with their team, learn the important lesson in life, how to dress up in Buffalo for the winter, and my personal favorite: "They expect you to say no "when visiting a restaurant. The audience can only hope that when Theresa reaches her destination, someone will not run away with the money. The film teaches us that it is not the money, but ourselves, that make our dreams and others come true. Every action has a result, not just for you, but for the community around you. When we look in the mirror, we see each other as we would like. MANNA FROM HEAVEN answers the question of how others can see the image we would like to reflect. The Burtons have done an outstanding job in causing the cast to break out of their bowls and create new and imaginative characters. On the day of the multi-million dollar budget, this low-budget Indy proves that there is not the money, but true talents that will make the biggest laughs. Wendie Malick (US President Just Shoot Me) adds a special touch to this already talented cast.
