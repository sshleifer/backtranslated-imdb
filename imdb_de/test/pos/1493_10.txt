This is a wonderful family sitcom. Rowan Atkinson has appeared in other excellent sitcoms, The Thin Blue Line (better than this) and Blackadder (no better than this one). Mr. Bean is a human catastrophe that does not speak. He goes to places and gets into absolute chaos that involves chaos: climbing the jump board and it's too scared to jump off. It takes about 20 minutes for some kids to finally dump him and land in a washing machine drove his car while he was sitting on a roof. Bean drives a mini and has a teddy. <br /> <br /> This was quite similar to The Baldy Man, a series that stares at Gregor Fisher, who says very little, but puts himself into chaos. Best Episode: Do It Yourself Mr. Bean, Episode 9: Bean is hosting a New Year's Eve party, then he gets something to decorate his apartment, but has too much stuff and has to drive his car on the roof.
