This is the best movie I have ever seen. And I saw a lot. I'm not even a Troma fan. I have never heard of Troma before I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I had already given up hope to see a great movie until I saw "Tromeo and Juliet". This movie is a dream come true. Shakespeare would probably be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic. There is sex, violence, humor and satire. It breaks many taboos. <br /> <br /> This movie is neither disgusting nor stupid. It's hard to describe in words how clever, funny, exciting and funny this movie is. The music is great and fits in perfectly with every scene. The characters are very believable and the acting is great. I really took care of the characters. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not just for Tromas fans. It is for all people who have a sense of humor and like smart and credible entertainment, in contrast to completely stupid and incredible mainstream films that do not dare to do what this movie does. <br /> <br /> The bad reviews just prove that this movie is great and a bit out of the ordinary. You love it or hate it. Like all true works of art, it is not understood and appreciated by all people.
