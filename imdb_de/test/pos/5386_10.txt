I saw "Heaven-Ship" at the Cinema Muto Festival 2006 in Sacile, Italy. What a great movie! This Danish Steampunk saga is the moving story of the first trip to Mars at a time when wireless telegraphy has not been perfected. The spaceship has no radio and the heroes are returned by horse and cart from the landing field. Even the subtitles are adorable ... some of them are written in racy couples in the Danish original. <br /> <br /> The actors' performances are ridiculous, mostly hand-to-bracketed histrionics. But the sets are amazing, surpassing everything Georges Melies did a decade earlier (or "The Woman in the Moon" a decade later). Of course, the plot is simple. The crew of the spaceship consists of seven skinny guys and a fat slob. Guess which one is cracking. Interestingly enough, everyone in this film (except dubious Professor Dubius) is passionate about God. Even the Martians. <br /> <br /> The scenographers have an impressive feeling that a trip to Mars is not a fool: the title cards show that the scientists need two years to build their spaceship (with an air screw) and six months, to reach Mars. During the design sequence, there is an extremely impressive setup that must have been choreographed: Dozens of workers race through the construction site in different directions, without hesitation and without collisions. The Danish scientists christened their ship "Excelsior" ("packing material"?) And headed for Mars, although Moon and Venus are closer. If the ship (landing horizontally and not vertically) lands on Mars, it is greeted by "Martian Mars" - Martians - who turn out to be Nordic blondes, all sophisticated pacifists and vegetarians. (As a sophisticated meat eater, I annoyed this part.) It's a good demonstration that Mars has an atmosphere like Earth's and the same gravity. In an outside view of the Martian landscape, the apparent size of the Sun, when viewed from Mars, is the same as when viewed from Earth. I also found that all wise older Martians are male. In fact, the older Elders here are thin on the ground: both the Earth-born hero and the Martian are motherless. The Martians speak a universal language, wearing Ankhs in their robes and welcoming the Earth's visitors with a globe ... which, of course, they hold up with their North Pole. <br /> <br /> This girl from Maryland is Marya, played by an ethereally beautiful Danish actress. (Waiter, I'll have some of this Danish!) We see a martian dance of chastity, which was perhaps winking or ridiculous, but actually quite touching and beautiful. There is a shot in the Martian funeral scene that reminded me of a sequence in "The Seventh Seal". I wonder if Ingmar Bergman has seen this movie. <br /> <br /> "Celestial Kibet" has some shortcomings, but its production design and other merits far outweigh the disadvantages. The credits-named Ole Olsen (who appears in a short prologue) is unrelated to Chic Johnson's vaudeville partner Hellzapoppin. I would give "celestial kibet" a 12, but the scale ends at 10 ... so a full 10 out of 10 for this delightful trip to Mars, the blond planet!
