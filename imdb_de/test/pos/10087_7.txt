Another Asian horror movie full of intense and scary moments. Another Asian horror trademark is the complexity of the storyline that exists here as well. IMPORTANT SPOILER WARNING! <br /> <br /> The movie starts quite simply - two sisters live with their father and stepmother after being taken to a mental hospital after their mother hanged herself. The sisters seem to be very hostile to their mother - especially the older ones - and they seem to ignore their father. Everything runs smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the closet and the older sister tells her father. Then it hits you: "Your sister has been dead for years." It turns out that the older sister still has not recovered from her mother's death and what we did not know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in has fallen younger sister and killed her as well. As for the stepmother, she is the older sister's alter ego - revealed when the stepmother (actually the sister's alter ego) sits on a couch when the real stepmother walks in! I hope this has become clearer for confused Asian horror fans. <br /> <br /> Finally - my favorite scene is the scene where the dad invites friends for dinner and one of the friends starts choking, which causes him to panic. Very scary! 7 out of 10
