An interesting film starring Jordana Brewster as a young woman traveling to Europe to find out what happened to her older sister (Cameron Diaz), who mysteriously died years ago. Brewster is very good and keeps you involved, despite some unrealistic conspiracies, such as amazingly finding and starting a romance with the much older friend of her dead sister (Christopher Eccleston). Nevertheless, mostly good. NOTE B
