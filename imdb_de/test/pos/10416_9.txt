I was thrilled with Niami's debut. I hope we will see more of his work soon. I was fortunate enough to see the movie during its short NYC run, and it seemed like a worthy successor to such downtown '80s turns like "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "After Hours," but with a soft European Mood that made him fresh and funny. A strong cast, mainly against guys, was a pleasure. And I thought the complex inter-threaded charts were just right. Sandra Bernhard shows her best performance since King of Comedy, while Peter Stormare is hilarious and touches Ling Bai. Do you see it
