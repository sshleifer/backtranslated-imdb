This movie is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It is a story that is told at a steady pace, usually not with words, but with cinematic means of expression. A perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music brings creations of human imagination to life in a realistic and poetic way. The story itself is pretty simple at first glance. As the title suggests, there is an archetypal journey, a motif that has been repeated for thousands of years. This motif was always used to represent not only a journey in space and time and beyond, but also had a rich philosophical meaning. The film is a poetic contemplation of the most exciting eternal questions. It's not just an odyssey of a human being; It is an odyssey of our species. The movie is great by itself, but in my case, the impression of it is always mixed with the one from the book. I read it at the age of 10 and I do not think about problems like "What is the relationship between the evolution of humanity and the evolution of human morality"? But the impression was big enough to make me fall for the entire science fiction genre. <br /> <br /> The day I studied in 2001 received only special effects and was not even nominated for the best picture. "Academy Award" became two words that meant nothing to me.
