My friend introduced me to a screening of this movie in Hollywood and it was awesome! It's a movie noir with fantastic acting, great script and cool music. The whole thing was very well done and entertaining. I do not know if there's a release in the cinemas, but this would be a great date movie or a funny movie you can rent if you watch it at Blockbuster. This is the kind of movie I love, on a budget but with style and imagination. I hope Alexandra Holden gets more big pieces than she has in this one, she's awesome.
