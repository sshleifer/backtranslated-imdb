This review may contain spoilers! The decline of Western civilization ...... what a great title? And from a rough movie. This is the best concert movie I have ever seen. A short second was the Talking Heads movie "Stop Making Sense". It was the first time I heard about this movie when Wayne's World came out in 1992. I looked in the name of the director Penelope Spheeris and thought of a cool name. What else did he do? I thought the first name was pronounced as an envelope. After spending some time in movie guides, I came across the critically acclaimed rejection and realized that Penelope was a woman ... my mother corrected me. I spent 8 years of my life figuring that out. I finally saw it on the VHS in Vancouver, where I currently live. The wait was worth it. This captures the LA punk movement very well. This is teenage fear, it's best people. My favorite is the band The Germs, which needs subtitles for the lyrics because Darby crash sings so crazy that you can not understand them. I laughed when I saw that. The band Black Flag live in an abandoned church and the band X are a very smart group. The letter that an idiot wrote to Slash Magazine also laughed at the fact that we do not have to save the whales. There are countless miles of ocean where we can fill in toxins! I became a huge Penelope Spheeris fan after that and saw all their punk movies - Dudes was OK and Suburbia is a cult classic! I own both on VHS. She is a real underground filmmaker and I love her stuff. I would have liked to see this movie in 1994, when Grunge was so popular. I was a big fan of Nirvana at the time, but unfortunately I saw it in 2002 and by then I had grown out of grunge and now I listen to Crystal Method / Fatboy Slim. I know, a pretty quick change, but what can you do? However, if you want a true representation of the punk movement, this is better captured than anything else. Much better than 1991: The Year Punk Broke. This is a difficult movie you can find, but if you get your hands on it, you can borrow it, even if you do not like the music, this is an excellent piece of work. It may be easier today to find DVDs that are so popular. Incidentally, Penelope has produced a little-known Albert Brooks movie titled "Real Life," which I own as well. Very funny stuff in today's reality TV craptacular! Reject rent ...... Highly recommended! Many Thanks!
