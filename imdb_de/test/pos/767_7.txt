Ben Marshall, a religious teenager, is being made aware of the financial situation at home by his domineering mother Laura. She suggests that he find a temporary job to contribute to the budget. In fact, the family took a widower to board with them. Robert Marshall, the father, is a pastor in the local church; He would much rather be out in the country watching birds than worrying about the souls entrusted to his church. <br /> <br /> Ben turns to an older actress, Evie Walton, who wants him to do something for her around the house. "Lady" Evie, as she calls herself, is a woman of a certain age whose career has died, perhaps because she was not so great. In fact, the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera that was popular, but she would rather forget it. Evie, who is a compulsive liar, tells Ben that she is dying, just to forget it comfortably, later, when she comes in to the boy. <br /> <br /> Ben obviously impressed the larger-than-life personality of his employer. He took driving lessons. Evie asks him to do a camping trip, which he does against his better judgment. He knows that it will provoke his mother's anger. Not content with this, Evie decides to go to Edinburgh, where she was invited to read at an art festival. It is this journey that strengthens their bond. Ben meets and enjoys the pleasures of the flesh with a sympathetic Bryony. <br /> <br /> When Ben comes back, everything is crumbling at home. His mother, who had an affair with a parishioner, decides to leave the family in favor of the young man with whom she had an affair. The relationship between Ben and Evie survives the test of time. He also begins to see his own father in a different light. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Brock, the author of "Driving Lessons" and other memorable English films, begins his first directing work on this compelling comedy. The mix of show business and religion, loyalty and friendship is explored in his screen treatment, which makes it a fun time in the cinema. We've seen a similar situation before, as in Billy Elliott, where Julie Walters plays a rising role with a younger man. We had read that the film was based on Mr. Brock's own experiences when he was a young lady with Peggy Ashcroft. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who plays Evie Walton, may be the best excuse to watch the movie. It always delivers. Ms. Walters is a welcome presence in every movie she appears in, and she wonders with her fake "lady." Laura Linney, herself a glowing player, does not quite get our sympathy with her icy mother. Rupert Grint, famous for his Harry Potter films, plays Ben, the young man who sees Evie as a friendly soul. Nicholas Farrell is the betrayed father. Michelle Duncan has a small role in which she shines.
