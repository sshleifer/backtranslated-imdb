I saw SEA OF DUST a few years ago as part of a NYC audience. I enjoyed the movie at the time, so I was a bit confused about some of the changes that have been made since then. Maybe it's my memory, but the version shown at the Rhode Island Film Festival seemed to lack exposure. I'm not sure which version I would prefer, but I can honestly say that I have both appreciated something. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me point out that this is not a popcorn movie. Although promoted as a tribute by Hammer Films, those who expect a showdown between Van Helsing and Dracula will be very disappointed. There is a split, but not a nudity (a basic component of the later films of the British production house). And while SEA OF DUST is filled with gorgeous eye candy (it really is filmed like a '60s movie) and starring Hammer star Ingrid Pitt, it's not like any of the company's images in sound or execution. This movie is very dark, very confusing and (sometimes) very funny. I can not remember that the previous version was as nutty as this, but that's not a bad thing (especially the showdown in the Black Forest, which plays like a three-stooges short). And some of Mrs. Pitts screams are pretty entertaining. It's as if someone has wrapped and let her go. <br /> <br /> However, the uniqueness of this film is not due to the borrowed details. It is in the ideas. As an occasional sci-fi channel viewer, I've routinely set up the network for one-tone variation of a theme (killing CGI monsters, then destroying them). SEA OF DUST is so full of ideas that you stumble over it after a while. <br /> <br /> But do not get me wrong. I am not complaining. If anything, I greet these people for making such an enterprising, low-budget picture and having the courage to deal with so many concepts. It will not be a picnic for people who do not like to think in the movies (you know who you are). But for the rest of us, those who are fed up with the formula of modern horror movies, predictability and disrespect for the public, this may be your ticket.
