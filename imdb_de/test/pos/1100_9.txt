I am surprised that the title of this movie is confused. It is obviously an investigation of the nature of modern love. It implies that love is love while walking is good, but one in which people reserve the right to put themselves first, and when walking gets hard, they get off and go for something else , <br /> <br /> This observation has an impact on generations as it comes from Generation X, makes Gen X comments, and ultimately targets Generation X. It expresses disappointment that love has changed from that of the Baby Boomers, Generation X parents. had spawned in their marriages and family life, and that gave Generation X the innocent and rich childhood that ultimately enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The Generation X attitude to love is of course funky, but as decisions are made and commitments are broken, the biggest loss is Generation X kids. This becomes clear at the end of the movie and was so sharp, that it took me a week to recover from the shock I had received from this epiphany.
