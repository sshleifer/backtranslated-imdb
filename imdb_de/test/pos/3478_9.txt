When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed never to see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago, I had done a pretty good job, with the exception of Shakespere for English classes ... etc ... I've always just watched things that ended happily. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havana Nights, which was cute, not good, but entertaining enough to look at. Having seen this a couple of times in the two years since I saw it for the first time, I liked it, especially the music. So I looked for her and found IMDb ... I saw "Inside I Dancing" and figured she had made another dance movie and looked at it. Later, a picture search took place (by Rory, who was looking for Gilmore Girls posters for lockers). I got a picture from this movie ... I then looked for a trailer, found the trailer and when I saw the hospital and Rory heard Sag saying "You have the future" I remembered my oath and realized that this was not a good movie for would be me. But it just stayed in the back of my mind until we got to the video library and used it for $ 5, so I bought it. After seeing it, I just wanted it out of my head because it was so sad. I still would not go near it until I had cerebral palsy as a vocabulary word. Then I just had to see it again and this time I just laughed, even in the saddest parts I did not feel depressed anymore because I realized that this movie was above all happy and uplifting ... I love it and now it is it's one I'm sure this is the worst comment you've ever read. But watch the movie, it's worth it.
