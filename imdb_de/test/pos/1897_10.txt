The best so-bad-it-good movie ever made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether you need to deal with everyday life or hobble, I can always look for inspiration and guidance. Rudy is the man when it comes to blaxploitation. Nobody is meaner. Watch Dolemite as he and his army of all-female kung fu killers defeat Mr. Big and Willie Green. Great story, right? There are so many one-liners that multiple sightings are needed to improve your vocabulary. If you say a few lines of Dolemite, you're instantly cool. If you fancy a laugh uprising, you can borrow this movie. Also check out The Human Tornado, Disco Godfather, and Petey Wheatstrraw, the devil's son-in-law. Can you dig that? <br /> <br /> "You are not a business eating rat soup, unsure, mum !!"
