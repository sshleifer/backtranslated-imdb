I found this strip pleasant and interesting, and I am surprised that it was rated so low. Actually, I can see why that is. I imagine that it is the fans of Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano who have given the most 1 and 2. So, if you put the tape into the computer and expect it to be fun to see something that shows one or both of these two performers, you might be quite disappointed. Eric appears about half an hour toward the end of the movie and Alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half, and in these she says little and wears less (though she's never naked if you look for it, stick to the hug) Vampire). Although they are always a pleasure, it is a pity that she or Eric does not have much time on the screen, but I still give one 8. <br /> <br />
