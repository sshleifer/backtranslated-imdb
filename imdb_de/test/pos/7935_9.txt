Eisenstein describes his collaboration with Prokeviev as an equal partnership in which image and music were coordinated. Unfortunately, the sound recording was a disaster, which is why the Criterion DVD exceptionally dedicated to authenticity. Fortunately, there is at least one restored version of the film on VHS (BMG Classics) with an excellent re-recording of the music (from the Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir). <br /> <br /> It's interesting to compare this movie with contemporary propaganda films in England, Germany and the US. Eisenstein's film was made in 1938 for fear of a German invasion. and Olivier in 1943, when a German invasion of England was still expected. Both films are staged, but in different ways. Olivier first shows a staging of the play in the Globe Theater of Shakespeare's own company and then takes us out of the theater in a more cinematic (if stylized) environment. Eisenstein's film is cinematic from the start, but the dialogue and speeches are still influenced by the melodramatic conventions of Russian old theater. This works very well for Cerkassov's speeches as Alexander, because part of his work as a prince and military leader should play a role in public affairs. In Nazi Germany, the boring Leni Riefenstahl's first major propaganda film was the Triumph of the Will, which captured a huge political spectacle - masses fueling Hitler's loud speeches. The propaganda in their masterpiece, the film of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, is much more subtle and worship the athletic male body that bears disturbing undertones of the Aryan supremacy myth. But even German propaganda films from wartime could be subtle. Karl Ritter's holiday on word of honor is typical. It shows a young lieutenant who has left the men in his company for 24 hours before he returns to the trenches of the First World War (and is almost certain death). Against the advice of veterans, he accepts her word of honor to return, though he is tried and shot if not. Of course, they all return (though some of them grumble) and probably encourage the public to assume similar responsibilities in their country. One of the better propaganda films of the Second World War in the United States was Howard Hawks' Air Force. In it we follow the mismatched crew of a bomber as they bond with the experience of the struggle and overcome obstacles to continue their part of the war. Typical of Hawks' films, however, their true loyalty is more than that of their country. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein goes back in time to find Russian military success. Ironically, Alexander (like the other Russian princes) descended from the Vikings, who sailed along the Russian rivers to conquer and dominate their own fief. So he is a conqueror who rejects another conqueror. Physically, they are not so different (though the actors representing the German princes were obviously chosen for their ugliness and their grinning stupidity). The real difference, however, is between ordinary soldiers. The Russian peasants are as tall and strong as the nobles. The German peasants who kill from the shield wall to kill wounded Russians are one foot shorter than their masters. There is a historical truth in this contrast. Russian serfs were much better in the Middle Ages than their European counterparts because they could always flee into the wilderness and clear their own land. <br/> <br /> Eisenstein's film also cleverly gives us the first glimpse of Alexander Fischer. In the fight with the Germans, he uses his fisherman's knowledge of the ice as well as his knowledge of their military tactics to defeat them. When Gavrilo breaks through the shield wall, they must regroup and attach bulk to the west side of the lake, where the ice is thinner. <br /> <br /> is the historically accurate way he portrays the politics of medieval Russia. Cities such as Pskov and Novgorod largely owed their growing wealth and prominence to trade, which brought the merchants to power and deposed the princes until their military capabilities and feudal levies were needed to fend off invaders. In the film, Alexander is shown not only as a military leader, but also as a politician who knows how to wait for his time and how he can fully exploit his popularity after the victory.
