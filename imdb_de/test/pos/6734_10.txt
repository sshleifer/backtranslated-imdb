This film begins with the atmospheric promise of a great contemporary Noir Western - anyway after the misunderstood opening flashback. The landscape is beautifully lonely, the characters painfully isolated. While some of the acting are less believable, the plot ultimately provides enough excitement and twists to make this movie worth seeing.
