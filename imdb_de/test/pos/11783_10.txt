I have not seen "Hardware Wars" in years, but I remember it was one of the funniest events of human experience, and it was over too soon. Every aspect of this movie was hilarious and even better than Star Wars. I laughed. I cried. After I saw it, I asked a family member for a moment with three dollars, just so I could kiss it goodbye (I'm joking about the last one). I love it when Ham Salads buddy / co-pilot tries to eat the cinnamon buns from Princess Anne Droid, and the Darph Nader character is just weird! This movie would be great if you watched "Thumb Wars" in a row and I sincerely wish it had "Hardware Wars, Episode II: The Referee Can Fail". (Was there?)
