I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend when he was vacationing in October 1976 in Anaheim, California. As we drove through the streets full of tourists we saw a movie tent showing "ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX". Even before we tried out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic half a mile away, our curiosity gained and we came to this cinematic threshold. I remember that the movie was surprised before the movie started, when I saw that this kind of movie was in solid, extremely conservative Orange County. <br /> <br /> Thirty-two years later, I came across a local video on ALICE IN WONDERLAND business. I wondered if this was the same movie until I looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of the beautiful Kristine DeBell in the lead role and decided to bring back some nice memories. Subversive Video has released two versions, X and XXX, in the same package. As it turned out, the version my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated X despite the original XXX ad. When I saw it for the second time, I realized what the delightful director Bud Townsend brought to the screen. As an example of the reach of this man behind the camera, he directed two episodes of DEATH VALLEY DAYS in his salad days. Miss DeBell, which appeared in April 1976 as cover of Playboy, is ideally suited as Alice. She brings a fresh American innocence into the role of the librarian in her early twenties, who longs for a better life. When her friend is prevented from taking her relationship to the next level, Alice reaches her tipping point. This is a "musical comedy", but the tunes are quite catchy with suitable strings and horns to compensate for the generally suggestive lyrics. Miss DeBell has a pleasant singing voice as she desires to be free. Then the magic begins. The tempo of this film is surprisingly fluid given the genre and supporting cast of Wonderland that allow Alice to blossom into Alice's wife. Special mention goes to TV veteran Larry Gelman as White Rabbit, the only character not obsessed with sex, as he always comes late for an appointment. Or something. <br /> <br /> Featured features include comments from well-known feminist advocate Lena Ramone, who tells how watching this film during her college studies influenced her in choosing a career as an adult movie actress after her graduation. The film, which is partly in the lush, natural splendor of Stanley Park in Vancouver B.C. was shot, comes across his pornographic roots. You can not get away and feel like you've seen a thick band of skin. At the moment, I did not look at the Triple XXX version. The extra sex footage attached afterward would in all likelihood interrupt the entire river and remove the light, airy atmosphere that is noticeable throughout. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Lewis Carroll version is the best way to curl up and explore Alice in Wonderland. For a time capsule, which is the adult archive of the 1970s, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is worth following this white rabbit for an exciting ride full of happy chaos.
