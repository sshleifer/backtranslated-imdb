I really did not see it coming. Roy Andersson cut me out, I'm the perfect fool for a static camera (long live King Borowczyk!) And I laughed hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the movie. He met me directly between the eyes. You have to be a brilliant man to make fun of yourself. Andersson reminds me of the third buddy on the Pequod in Moby Dick, Flask, a man who thought all life was a practical joke that the good Lord himself plays on us. And the web of selfishness in this movie is really weird. <br /> <br /> The level of satire is on fever, you have a deluded, self-pitying dreamer's harp about the cruelty of the world and then ignoring completely spiritual self-reflection screaming in agony. The depths of egoism are hinted at. I never thought that it would be possible to go further than Bergman's "The Silence" in this regard. The grotesque nature of self-love and self-esteem of every single character in this film, however, is mind-boggling. We are shown an existence in which the talentless and idle tracks against a world that they believe was unfair to them, they are really legends in their own living rooms. The people in this film make self-deception and self-deception a great art form! <br /> <br /> Only a woman in the movie seems to have an understanding of what is going on. As an old woman who refuses to leave a chapel, praying for the forgiveness of humanity, her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world I have ever heard. It reveals through her prayers that what is wrong with the world must not be remedied by mere tinkering, that there are not just a few mistakes, but that there is an abyss of corruption, only through cremation and Judgment Day can be corrected. When I watch this movie, I think of a naked monk who was standing deep in a cold river at midnight calling a thousand Kyrie-Eleisons to the sins of humanity. Another big Jape is that it is clear that her prayers are in vain, and indeed she keeps everyone home for closing time. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for the complacent, nobody is spared. There are no idols on the altar, no group of people are attacked to the glory of another group. There has never been a bigger, amazingly beautiful sum of our sins. It's a movie for the end of the world, it's the big joke, the big vile practical joke of human life! <br /> <br /> From the catalog of pictures it is too difficult to choose a favorite. I hit my thigh and almost fell off my chair in the cinema. I had to scream with laughter when a man tried to demolish the tablecloth under a carpet set service. I will not spoil what happens, but the tension builds and something unexpected happens. It's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie theater. I am quite reserved and just could not control myself: that's the measure of the size of this film. <br /> <br /> The filming of "You, the Living" is perfectly formalistic. We show an artist's palette, dingy brown, yellow, gray and sky blue, brought to life by the shock of bright brass textures. It's never a sound inappropriate, it's like one and a half hours of symphonic Whistlerian color mixing. The obsession that this color scheme must have is extraordinary. And no shot is wasted, as with all great movies, there is not a centimeter of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Maybe the best movie I have ever seen.
