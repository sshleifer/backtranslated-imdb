After seeing other Bollywood films with Salman Khan, I can say that this is my favorite of the newer ones. The songs are all pretty funny, especially 'O Priya O Priya', which is a nice mix of Beatles, Indian music and (dare I say) a bit of Prince. The love stories are a bit more believable than about Chal Mere Bhai. The occasional focus on Prem's alcohol intake is sometimes troubling, as it does not seem to make sense to me, but he's played well by Khan - though his voice gets squeaky when he's drunk.
