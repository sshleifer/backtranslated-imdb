This is the question astronomers Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry ask when they discover a hidden world of the earth hidden in this iconic 1969 science-fiction melodrama in this iconic 1970's science fiction melodrama SUN. The plot of the film was designed by British writers Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, the creators of such television programs as "UFO", "The Thunderbirds" and "Space 1999". It is sometimes very strange and reveals the influence of "The Twilight Zone" and even Stanley Kubrick's classic 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The work on visual effects by Derek Meddings, who would later also work on SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, holds up remarkably well among the last three decades of special effect developments; and although they are not really at the same level of the Kubrick movie, they are very great. If you do not expect a STAR WARS type of film and can overcome the occasionally banal dialogue, DOPPELGANGER is a good movie. it was good enough for me to call it "7" and consider it an undiscovered sci-fi gem.
