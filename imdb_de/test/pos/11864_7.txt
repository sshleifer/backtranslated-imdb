OK. Here's the thing. I've read the comments of other viewers - some have thrown the film away and some say it's the funniest, darkest, blackest comedy ever made. Whiffs of Tarantino, etc. Well, not exactly. But guess what? It's still a fun and ultimately funny movie. Not brilliant, not garbage. Liv Tyler does a great job and you absolutely can not take her eyes off her. She is a woman with very strong decorating ideas ... Matt Dillon, a much underrated and underused actor, is wonderful as always. He always manages to overcome this delicate line between Scruff and Soul, and he pulls off the comedy wonderfully. Ditto John Goodman (though the religious overtones that are probably funny in the script really do not work). Paul Reiser is very good - definitely better than on TV. <br /> <br /> The normally unbearable Michael Douglas is really great in this role. Now for his hairstyle, see the movie. Between this and the "Wonder Boys", you are actually reminded that Douglas can act. The movie will make you laugh in part. Okay, not exactly belly laugh, but definitely in the category I am amused-I-very amused. If you rent this to see another "Pulp Fiction", forget it. But if you want to have some hip and somehow fun, this is a damn good choice.
