This is a great TV series that is sympathetic and, exceptionally, realistic! The portrayal of lesbian women is handled carefully and well done. In addition, the direction is wonderful and the settings lush and rich, a real treat. If you've missed it for the first time, I suggest you take care of BBC 2 at 9PM next week
