Well, it is time! Van Damme is back and performs in this action thriller that is his best movie of recent years. The plot is not too imaginative, but the whole issue of the border patrol is interesting and the ex-marines as drug smugglers are cool. What makes this movie so amazing is the fact that Van Damme is doing martial arts again. His latest films were more actor-oriented, but in "The Shepard" JCVD ​​left the bad guys behind and seems to be in excellent condition. There are some impressive fighting scenes and Van Damme shows he can still get the old, famous 360-rotating heel trigger. An action movie with a low budget offers good sets and great stunts. Van Damme says some humorous lines and shows that he is improving as an actor. I am glad that he has dealt with Van Damage again ... I have been disappointed because he has not fought in his last films. Scott Adkins is great in his role and Van Damme and he ends up with a 1-1 showdown. All in all, it's one of Van Damme's better films, and it will entertain you. A must for JCVD ​​fans. I keep my fingers crossed for another martial epic like "Bloodsport" or "Kickboxer". Nok Su Kow!
