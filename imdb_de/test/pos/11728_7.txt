Victor will let her go. <br /> <br /> With the Gassman syndicate, the corrupt police of Atlanta and the city government and the local Chinese mob, Sgt.

Both Billy Score and Sharky's machine member Arch encounter Billy's drug-induced invincibility, which conflicts with Arch's philosophy of al reality in a conflict between two cultures, the West and the East.
