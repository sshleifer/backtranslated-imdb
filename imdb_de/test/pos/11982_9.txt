I've just watched this movie over the weekend and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. As always, the 2 Italian-American actors are excellent (Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia). It is obvious that the director was influenced by two great films of the past that were filmed by Italians. First and foremost, he was influenced by Dino Risi and his film IL SORPASSO. It's the story of two young men who meet by chance and become friends. One is extroverted and the other is introverted. They enjoy the whole day together and at the end of the day the timid learns that life is more than his usual routine monotony. The same thing happens to Albert De Santi. Unfortunately, IL SORPASSO has a very similar ending, and this seems to have affected the director of ON THE RUN, because he uses the same technique, but with a twist. I had expected something but was surprised to see that it was the opposite. If you see both films, you will understand. The other film that influenced the director is AFTER HOURS, directed by the great Italian American Scorsese. I highly recommend all 3 movies !!
