One year after the release of the average "Frankenstein house," Universal released another monster mash in which all her famous characters would collide again. "House of Dracula" would reunite Dracula, the creation of the Frankenstein and the Wolfman for their last fight and would end an era for the studio. Re-staged by Erle C. Kenton, "House of Dracula" represents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and provides a better-constructed (albeit still flawed) story that is not perfect, but a more fitting conclusion than the previous film is <br /> <br /> The story ignores most of the events from the previous entry "House of Frankenstein" and introduces a new perspective in the story. Count Dracula (John Carradine), tired of hiding in the sunlight, asks the brilliant scientist Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a physician famous for his biological research. Edelman is fascinated by Dracula and soon begins an experimental treatment. Meanwhile, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), the Wolfman, visits Edelman with the goal of getting rid of his curse. Soon, Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that needs to be destroyed, but even when he's exposed to Dracula's blood, it causes illness. The discovery of the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) in a nearby catacomb will bring further unrest to the brilliant scientist. <br /> <br /> After the previous clash of monsters, it's good to see the series going to the roots and deliver an almost straightforward gothic horror that returns to the dark pessimistic nature of this type of movie and is different from the comics Reliefs of the previous entries removed. The story (by Edward T. Lowe, Jr.) has many interesting themes, such as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both looking for a cure, but with different purposes) and Edelman's growing madness. Probably one of the most interesting topics is the inclusion of the character of Nina, a beautiful but deformed woman, who Dr. Ing. Edelman helps to be cured of her condition. Director Erle C. Kenton is back this time, finally capturing the dark nature of these three characters, a nature that apparently went missing in the previous film. Despite the low budget, Kenton creates a gothic horror that is simple but very effective, and can even present old partners like these characters in a fresh way. While never at the level of the originals, "House of Dracula" recovers the charm of Universal Studios horror films, and Kenton ensures that the monsters get a chance to shine, at least for the last time. <br /> <br /> The cast is very good this time, and Carradine, Chaney and Strange have reworked their roles (although Strange's role is considerably lower) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film. The cast of Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll in the cast brings the tragedy and the drama back to the series, with Stevens being dr. Edelman does a great job. A small cameo by Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as a creepy Steinmuhl complete radius, one of the better cast horror films of recent years. <br /> <br /> "House of Dracula" is a nice addition to the series especially after the mediocre "Haus Frankenstein". It's nice to see Kenton back in shape in a somewhat serious horror movie, and although the plot is quite original, it suffers not only from the budget, but also from the fact that the film tries a lot in a very short run with poor success do results. It's true that the characters all have very imaginative storylines, but the film devotes very little time to development, and the film seems to be very hectic and incoherent. <br /> <br /> Even though he is not perfect, he is also by far not the worst in the series. "House of Dracula" is a fine end to one of the best times of the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed the misty nights and crazy scientists gave life to terrible monsters. Later, the monsters would be back in "Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a very different context. After the disappointing previous entries, it's easy to dismiss House of Dracula, but give it a shot and let the monster walk around for the last time. 10.7
