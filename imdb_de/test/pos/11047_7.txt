Anna Christie (1930) <br /> <br /> Anna Christie has some great parts and some amazing accomplishments, and yet it should be even better than it is. It has drama. Some scenes are really atmospheric, and when the interiors around the table are boring, other shots at night and at sea are really exciting. Then there's the almost historic, vivacious scenes in Coney Island (even a short, annoying rollercoaster ride) and the episode where two women are behind a net in separate beds, and the women (sparsely dressed) annoy the men on weird Way. Meanwhile, Garbo (at the front of the audience) is watching. <br /> <br /> Garbo of course makes this movie more than just another very good, early talkie. She plays all sides of her character. She is shy and skeptical and in a kind of inner fear. She laughs and cries, pulls back and pushes outward. In a way, this is a forward-looking, notable movie (directed by Clarence Brown, who has a number of major films from this pre-code sound era), it's the writing that struggles a bit, while the actors sometimes seem to take the steps. Marie Dressler is great in this exaggerated way, which she almost calls a trademark. And then there's Greta Garbo, who really has a natural presence, even if it looks like she sometimes excels a bit (but everyone else) too. Garbo is, of course, first known as a silent actress, and this is her debut in conversation. The audience loved her so much that she created a German-language version the following year.
