This movie needs to be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece, with a bizarre and grim movie about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden. The newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four strange stories about love or career. I would love to see all four as a movie, they can be so much longer. <br /> <br /> The unique break in the middle is something I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to get on the show (if she does one) or on the extended DVD. Apparently they had cut out a lot to fit only 3.5 hours.
