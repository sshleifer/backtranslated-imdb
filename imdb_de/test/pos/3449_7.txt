This movie has a lot to recommend. The pictures, the music and the naked butt of David Hewlett are all beautiful! The conspiracy, a story of salvation, forgiveness and courage in the face of adverse circumstances is also very interesting and touching - and it is unpredictable. But the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just weird. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was to be a parody of *. And if it is not a parody, it remains a movie with a great potential that it has not achieved.
