With the seizure of power by the Nazis in Eastern Europe in the late 1930s, Charles Chaplin turned his attention to responding. The catalyst could have been a propaganda publication referring to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin has created a total parody of Hitler, which is as funny as it is sometimes scary. The film traces Hitler's experiences in the German army from the First World War to the present day. At the same time Chaplin plays a Jewish barber who dresses like a tramp, who comes from a hospital after a long time to find out how different the world is under the rule of the Nazis. Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at Die Zeit, plays a young Jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie has a great Oscar-nominated supporting role as a Mussolini man (Benzini Napaloni) who lends many seizures to Chaplin Hitler's character Adenoid Hynkel. Henry Daniell is his usual self-esteem as Garbitsch, chief adviser to Adenoid Hynkel. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his screenplay and acting. The film was also nominated for the best picture. Chaplin, for obvious reasons, turned the film under enormous pressure and some that were not well known. He financed the entire film on the subject itself with great risk, and so far, no major films were filmed on Nazi Germany. The film spent about twenty-one months in production, while Chaplin even rebuilt a set and re-shot a scene to get things done. At the time of the film's release in October 1940, the war in Europe was already in full swing as Hitler conquered one country after another, making the film much more up-to-date at the time of its release than at the beginning of production. <br /> <br /> There is not much conspiracy when looking at the movie afterwards; The film seems to be more of a series of comedy sketches and / or glitches lining up to achieve a film-independent purpose. Some examples of this can be found in the last third of the film at the meeting between Hynkel and Napaloni. The scene is very funny, but it does not lead to the plot. Similarly, the escape of Barbier and Schultz simply leads to the false identity of the barber for Hynkel, to give Chaplin (by the barber character) at the end of the film the opportunity to bring the audience to pontificates. On the other hand, how could one confuse the misguided narcissism of Aryan superiority better than a Jewish barber with Hynkel? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film contains many high-profile moments, such as the rally speech, the new war developments (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the world of the dancing globe, the coin in the pudding scene, and the overall scenario between Hynkel and Napaloni (including the barber chair scene) to warmly recommend the film. Nor can one forget the risks Chaplin incurred when he made his first entertainment film, an anti-Nazi film, and the film itself. *** 1/2 out of 4 stars.
