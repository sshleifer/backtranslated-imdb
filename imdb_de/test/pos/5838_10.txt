I have seen a lot of television in my 51 years but have never had as much fun week after week as I have seen Oz. The spectacle of the entire cast was excellent. The writing was just perfect and each character remained constant throughout the six-year run. I also enjoyed the chaos and non-violence. It may sound strange, but sometimes it was funny to find out how one of the characters would eventually be dead. I especially enjoyed the true romance and love between Beecher and Keller. These two men really knew how to defeat them in every possible way. I really hope that HBO will continue to show us reruns of this great show. I've seen each episode at least four times, but I'm still looking forward to Tuesday and Thursday at 11pm. for an episode of this funny and very entertaining show.
