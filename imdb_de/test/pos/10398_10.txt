Here is another Antonioni, which is always rediscovered as soon as it appears on tape or DVD. I saw it a few months ago when it first ran (and even disappeared in the metropolitan metropolis of LA!) For a few weeks and then disappeared (art house audiences seem to have opted for their own specialty, where older favorites like Antonioni) and resnais are welcome only as occasional curios. <br /> <br /> At first I was disappointed, keeping the tempo unbearably boring and the man had lost a chance (Antonioni had found it hard for years to find him funding) at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon ; But when I knew Antonioni what he was and how I first reacted to blow-up and the passenger, I refused to pass judgment until I saw the movie again. The next day I went back, and I should not have been surprised that the movie drew me to and over and pointed out things that I had been thinking about all my life, and drove home for the first time Forty years ago in 'L'Aventurra', an environment of subtle moods that was so characteristic and intriguingly alienated (and actually quite funny) that I could not get enough. The scene in which Malkovich sat on the fantastic colored swings on the windswept beach and the weather was so beautiful silver skis, and the Eno / U2 track in the background, which was flowing in rhythm, had been my favorite. it was still, but now the whole movie was just as good! What a strange phenomenon, the complex simplicity or the invisible complex that Antonioni's eye alone seems to capture and communicate. The strange thing is, even if it looks like a softcore porno at first glance and there is a lot of sex and the irresistibly beautiful Sophie Marceau and the many international stars that distract you, this movie is unmistakable Antonionis, but you will not be up to such an extent, until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm. For example, it's a pretty funny movie with a deep sense of humor, something that I did not notice at first, but was addressed by another reviewer and was very pleased with further considerations (4, before they dropped it off and would say 'I'm for more decreased). If this film had been properly promoted and people had somehow informed themselves about how to handle the film, I would undoubtedly have had success on the Art House Circle, like most Antonioni films from the '60s. But the '60s are gone and the movie has to find its audience on the small screen, where half of its beauty is lost in a letterbox DVD version (when and when it's released). I urge all movie nuts, generally or esoterically, to watch 'Beyond the Clouds' and add something magical to the tragic.
