The Child's Play series is not my favorite, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls, Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go in search of an object. There are some interesting scenes in the movie, like the guy hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany, and the end that allows for another sequel. Was not really a straightforward horror, it had a lot of comedy and was a kind of parody of the horror genre. This made the movie better, as Comedy manages with many horror movies. All in all, even if you are not a child's play fan.
