If you're watching this movie because Michael Caine or Michael Gambon are there, do not worry, it's not their typical role, though I found Gambon fantastic. Instead of seeing it for Dylan Moran, I'm a fan of everything I've seen, and this is no exception. I did not know that he could even play only the characters he had to spend himself, because I was absolutely believable, which is impressive when the audience knows they are fake. <br /> <br /> The plot is awesome and although she does not laugh all the time, she has many other charms. A great movie for people with a sense of humor.
