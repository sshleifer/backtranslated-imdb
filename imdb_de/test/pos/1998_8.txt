Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema and it is much better than I expected. The people who say it's neither scary nor funny have a point, it's not that great. It's important to note, however, that those involved in the movie are more amateur, so basically a maiden voyage. And if you compare this film to Sinan Çetin's other films like the first class garbage "propaganda", this movie is damn good. <br /> <br /> One thing that must be said: It is the life of the students Turkey VERY realistic! That's exactly how it works! The scenes that are to scare are a bit cheap and hollywood. Most, if not all. But this religious education scene made me laugh in tears, and Emre Kýnay plays the best role as a religion teacher. <br /> <br /> It's NOT a waste of time, go and have a look! You'll find it quite amusing, especially if you know Turkey well enough to refer to the school life of Turkish youth.
