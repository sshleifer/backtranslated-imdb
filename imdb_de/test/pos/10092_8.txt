The idea is not original ... If you've ever seen such a story, you'll know what the end would look like after you've watched the first twenty minutes ... the script, the actors' positioning, and the show is the same Obviously ... If you have not seen such a story, this is definitely a good experience. You will enjoy the turn in the end. Do not forget to look at them again after you know the "truth", you will do even more enjoy the acts ... Although I have a right guess at the very beginning, I could still stand in my place until the end stay ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a must! ! This one from Korea is better than all the latest films of the genre from Japan ... forget about Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Do not miss it !!
