WESTERN UNION tells in a melodramatic way the lining up of telegraph lines between two points to the west. Siblings Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore work for Western Union and Randolph Scott and Robert Young for the Creightons. Indians and a few bad whites get in the way, but nothing can stop America's progress. This sense of manifested destiny is greatly enhanced by world-class sheet music and vivid color photography. Scott is a bank robber who wants to improve his behavior, and both he and engineer Young vie for the attention of cheeky Gilmore. Many great character actors contribute to the big production progress.
