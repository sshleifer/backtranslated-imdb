I saw this movie for the first time about 15 years ago and have been charmed by it ever since. It's such a feel-good experience that I could happily watch her every season. For me, however, this is the ultimate Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is B & W is irrelevant - although I often wonder what it would look like in color. You can just get a warm, radiant feeling as you watch the Christmas events. <br /> <br/> Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together, and Greenstreet is the counterpart to his usual character. Sakall is an exciting joy to watch. <br /> <br /> It is a slight relief that certainly does not tax the brain, but you are glad that you have seen it. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to get it on DVD in the UK. I'm sure I'll be at the top of the queue to buy it.
