There were a lot of stupid teenagers who got sex movies of the 80s, and a lot of Slasher movies, but there was only a handful that got thought out, made you laugh, and caught time properly; that was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, as is Forman, who has disappeared from the Hollywood limelight from her biological misfortune. I would love to release this on DVD with a special version with comments from Cage and Forman. Wishful thinking, I know. If you've always wanted to plan a real movie weekend of the 80s, rent this, Surah Thing and 16 Candles and Breakfast Club. It will take you back to a "Totally Rad" time that was seemingly a lot easier at the time. Note to the studios: time to release the DVD!
