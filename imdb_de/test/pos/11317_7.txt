Part of the film is a thriller and part public service announcement when you look at events from the perspective of politicians, terrorists and, of course, victims. Lessons on contamination and the survival of chaos are given in this intelligent drama, while behind-the-scenes glimpses of the way the crisis is managed cause viewers to distrust guardians and fear attackers. Originally broadcast on BBC, the film raises doubts about the official preparation. The performances are neat, unobtrusive, but never great. The streak is just a beginning, a provocative beginning that leads to a bigger discussion, but in my opinion he has to work, give the right thrill, and get the audience to speak out and ask questions.
