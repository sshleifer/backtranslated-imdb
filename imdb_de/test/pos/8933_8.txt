I wanted to see this movie for a long time. At some point I just bought it at E-Bay, because it's so hard to find state. But the wait was worth it. <br /> <br /> I can not say that the movie was great. And I can not say that the movie was hilarious. But it was good and has some pretty funny points. Apart from that, the shots in this movie are just beautiful. And the whole cast, especially Brenda Blethyn (someone I had never seen before, unfortunately) was excellent. In the end this is a romantic comedy that feels good I just had a family death. <br /> <br /> If anything, the last chapter is worth the money. >. <
