This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's about true love and friendship. To turn your life around and do something good to someone. Thomas Bo Larsen may be playing the same role he has played in so many other films, but lately we have seen him in other roles that he also makes great. But what if he plays the same role as in other movies? He is perfect for this role. Ulrich Thomsen is also doing a great job. These two criminal "low-lifes" are the best friends of all time. They share everything and do everything for each other, regardless of the cost. If they find out that Peter's daughter is being abused, they'll put everything on hold (things you can not put off unless you have more criminal acts to do) and take them to a better place. Do you do the best you can? These two men are not thought leaders, but they have their hearts in the right place. All I can say is that Peter and Carsten are also my greatest heroes.
