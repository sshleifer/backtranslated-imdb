"Duckman" is a great show. I saw it for the first time when I was 10 years old, and after school I stormed home and turned to Comedy Central. I saw a cartoon called "Duckman" and I loved it !! It's such a funny and cool show. It was created by Klasky-Csupo, who are great creators of cartoons. They have animated some of my favorite shows like The Simpsons and Rugrats. <br /> <br /> I have seen many episodes of this show and think that they are all really funny and sweet. The voice actors also did a great job in tuning the characters. <br /> <br /> I wish Comedy Central could bring back this show along with "The Critic" and "Dilbert". > But this is a great comedy central show. Great job, Klasky-Csupo!
