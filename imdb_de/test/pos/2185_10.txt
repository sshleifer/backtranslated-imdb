George Hearn really gave everything and exaggerated what was great in this case. I heard the Len Cariou version, but she was too tame. George was great in this character - very expressive. Angela Lansbury was perfect for the role. She did a great job. She gave Mrs. Lovett a great, unobtrusive and funny personality that balanced the dark story. <br /> <br /> I love the dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs, as well as her physical expression and the angry feelings of George Hearn in his songs of anger, revenge and hardship. <br /> <br /> I've seen this piece 20 times since 1985, when I saw it on PBS. I bought it on video (after copying it myself in 1985) when it came out in 1990, and I definitely bought a DVD when it came out in 2004.
