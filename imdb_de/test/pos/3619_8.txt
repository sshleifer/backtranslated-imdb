As so often, when you try to take a book of over 400 pages and stuff it into a two-hour movie, a lot is lost. Director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off. What we get is a charming and emotionally captivating film that somehow seems incomplete. <br /> <br /> There is much about this movie that is wonderful and fantastic. The cinematography of John Toll (cameraman for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winning Oscars for both) is great. When working with Madden, the choice of locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia is superb and the visual images that emerge from photographing these majestic places in varying degrees of light are lush and beautiful. Madden also uses many Greek actors as city dwellers to give the city an authentic atmosphere. The soundtrack is also great and the mandolin passages and vocals of the Italian soldiers are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Madden is doing an excellent job bringing us the Italian cast and romance that make up most of the movie. There are many sweet and funny moments in this segment. However, until the serious fight drama unfolds, there is not much movie left in the role, and this component is extremely hectic and abbreviated. While the combat scenes are well done, it is obvious that after the battle, more and more compromises are made to keep the movie from running too long. When we reach post-war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal. Another disadvantage is that the DVD is particularly sparse. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead role as the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army instead of fighting. If he has to fight, Cage seamlessly switches to a man of fierce principle and determined and somehow credible to both personas. <br/> <br /> Penelope Cruz, whom the camera loves, gives as Pelagia an uninspired performance. This is partly because Cage dominates the screen in such a way, but Cruz seems to be too relaxed in a part that should be emotionally torrent and dynamic. She admits that the character is objectified rather as a love interest of Corelli, than that she makes herself a powerful figure. John Hurt does a fantastic job as the old, wise doctor who knows humans as a medicine. Christian Bale, however, seems a bit overwhelmed and stiff as Pelagia's fianc√©. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 8/10. Despite some disadvantages, this is a touching film that is worth seeing. But photography is worth the price.
