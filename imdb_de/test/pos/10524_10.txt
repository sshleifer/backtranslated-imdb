Considering the fact that this movie was released eight years before my birth, I do not feel bad if I've missed it for so long. But in January 98, I attended the second annual Quentin Tarantino Film Festival in Austin, Texas. The special theme of the movies that night was "Neglected 70's Crime Films" and the boy was right. "The Gravy Train (or The Dion Brothers, as it appeared in this print) was an absolute gem. Wonderful performances, quirky characters, clever plot, funny comedy and just a great time. Rarely does one see a thriller movie that is so entertaining and fresh. Margot Kidder is also extremely sexy in one of her earliest film appearances. I hope some cable networks get their hands on this movie and see a lot more. In the meantime, visit an indie video store and hope they have it.
