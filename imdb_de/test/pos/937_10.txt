I feel at a loss, so brilliant is this movie. Kieslowski is a writer, philosopher; and though he is a brilliant filmmaker, his greatness lies in his writing. and "red" is his paradigm. This film is a metafictive study of the artist's judgment in creating his fictional world; How an artist can try to reshape life - including his own - through his art, even if he can not resist the realization that, no matter how he relates to his story, he is still fiction and still is being rediscovered outside of his world, still burdened with his unreality and the reality of life he has attempted to change artistically. And magically, all of this is not in the least at the expense of a wonderful story about the secrets of love and fate and the characters who live this story, this prejudiced fate. If I had to choose, I could nominate the biggest movie of all time.
