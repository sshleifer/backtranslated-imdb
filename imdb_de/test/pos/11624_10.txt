When I was a kid I saw All the Rivers on TV for the first time and loved it. It was great to see a mini-series shot and filmed at a location near home. I lived quite close to Echuca and loved going to the historic harbor to see the paddle steamer. The first one I ever went to was the Pevensy (Philadelphia in the movie). I love how it takes time to unfold the events. Nothing feels as rushed as most movies are today. The acting was fantastic. All the Rivers Run was perfectly staffed and I love the Philadelphia crew. Mac is always amusing to watch raw onion sandwiches after a long evening with its trademark. Easily earns a 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorite mini-series of all time alongside the Dirtwater dynasty.
