In Fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas were sometimes hampered by his ability to perform them. He has always been a great writer, but it took some time to put his style into camera work and storytelling. The Four Seasons merchant is one of Fassbinder's first films to use a lot of color, from the bright green pears in the dealer's car to the bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a Fassbinder movie? Who would have thought that) it still was pretty minimalist. The occasional zooms sometimes seem a bit uncomfortable and unnatural, but Fassbinder still came out of his purely avant-garde phase. That could be because Michael Ballhaus is not behind the camera, but the somewhat inferior Dietrich Lohmann. <br /> <br /> This is Fassbinder, and here's your problem. Broken dreams showed themselves so alive and unyielding that they alienate the audience and drive them into a depressed stupor. Exactly what the doctor ordered. An early classic, showing remarkable progress compared to his first films released 2 years earlier.
