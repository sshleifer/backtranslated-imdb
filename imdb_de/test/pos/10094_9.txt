For most of us, life is an evolving process of love. For others like Soo-mi, however, it is dominated by darkness and fear. Based on the Korean folk tales of Jangha and Hongryun, Kim Ji-woon creates a brilliant gothic horror story. A Tale of Two Sisters around two sisters, Soo-mi (Lim Su-jeong) and Soo-yeon (Mun Geon-yeong) are part of one dysfunctional family living together in a spooky Victorian mansion. They feel alienated from the world and cling to each other to survive, while the older Soo-mi obsessively protects the younger Soo-yeon from danger. For Soo-mi, however, it does not mean coping with the circumstances surrounding her mother's death. Mental illness and a mind that contradicts reality. <br /> <br /> We can detect staples like ghost houses with seeming sightings. Doors that open and close on their own, a cruel and presumptuous stepmother and other weirdly curious events. A Tale of Two Sisters explores excellently deeper psychological meanings, including the inability to unleash inner demons, and the misguided desire for revenge. Soo-mi says, "Do you know what's really scary? You want to forget something, wipe it completely out of your head, but you never can, it can not go away, you see, and ... and it follows you like a ghost around. " There is a timeline, but it is up to the viewer to unravel. The plot can not be summarized, only suggested, and the film keeps asking us whether what is happening on screen is objective or subjective. In the movie opening, the obviously disturbed young woman Soo-mi will be interviewed by a doctor in an environment that looks like a psychiatric facility. When the doctor asks her to describe what happened that day, the film flashes back when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon go to see their father Moo-hyeon (Kim Kap-su) and their stepmother Eun-joo ( Yum Jung-ah). The stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant, but it is obvious that it is soo-mi that really hurts. As the girls try to adapt, they are constantly startled by a presence in the house that can be nightmares or supernatural events. Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed, hovering above her and radiating black blood, a dinner scene in which the guest apparently hides a ghost under the sink and cramps, a monster between one of the legs Sisters appear, people mysteriously disappear from photographs and many other schizophrenic devices to hang the audience on the verge of madness. While we sense that much of the story is the projection of a mind, we do not know whose and the movie is constantly challenging us, at least until there is a significant hint in the second half of the movie. <br /> <br /> A Tale of Two Sisters was filmed in a beautiful low-light camera and offers a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that can overcome all the horrors and there is plenty. It is a haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images can stare you when you least expect or want it. While the film may not offer much light to the weary traveler, it shows us where to end when we choose darkness. In the words of a wise observer: "Guilt is never the answer - be it the guilt of oneself or others - but the answer is to completely abandon one's judgment - both oneself and others - forgiveness and understanding a great healing power. "
