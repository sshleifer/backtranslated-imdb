This is a great show full of freshness and innovation. That ordinary chair (couch for a woman), this obligatory band playing monotonous tunes, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the days of Nebuchadnezzzer ... probably the pattern of Johnny Carson, copied by all, Latterman , Leno, Conan ... Daly, this show does not seem to have one of them. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and will stick to it. Although it is too early to say, this show seems to have no intellectual claim. Most talk shows are so difficult to project, and I hope that makes the show stand out from the rest. I hope this show will last a long time. <br /> <br /> After months, I still love this show, and I love its self-deprecating humor (for example, its claim that only loners with potheads would belong to it) watch its show at midnight on Saturday and the Jokes are just funny for the stoned guys.) However, this does not include the usual monkey of Conan O'Brien (for example (I know it's a major sin being repelled by O '). Briens antics, but I like his Style and its repeatability really not. <br /> <br /> I saw it again with Tom Arnold the other day, Ferensen's spree of trading spouses (and nanny 911 in a previous episode) is hilarious, idiot paparazzi are fun, above all When a security guard warns them against taking pictures of people, and (if I'm not mistaken), they start shouting their pictures and shouting "Gary Coleman." <br /> <br /> Added on 16. April 2007: If I come back again, I am I am confused by the neighbor and her dog. I can not decide if it's a joke or a real thing. In any case, it was damn funny. <br /> <br /> I do not expect Spike Feresten to read these pages, but maybe he does. He's crazier than a bunch of monkeys, and I should write down my suggestion for him here: I want him to do a full 30-minute show with Crazy Gideon, the star of the late-night TV commercial. I want Crazy Gideon to do an interview on Spike's talk show, sing a song (and play guitar), do a sketch in the line of SNL, and also answer questions from the audience about his potential mayors in Los Angeles (I know Crazy Gideon is perhaps unaware of this, but there are websites that describe in detail why he could be the perfect candidate for the post of mayor of LA. <br /> <br /> God willing!> Return on July 14, 2007 : Someone wrote here that the people who praised Spike's talk show need to be bribed by Spike, I admit that Spike really bribed me, but I have to admit that Rockefeller named me by his will, and I last night had sex with Cindy Crowford.
