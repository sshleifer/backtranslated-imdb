I saw this movie for the first time last night. I thought about it all night and this morning. I can not say that it was my favorite movie, at least not yet. I have to see it again. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is breathtaking. Each recording has a lyrics that you would expect in a movie that bears the name Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> It is always tempting to see de Chirico in each picture of rows of orders disappearing in the darkness, but in this case, the analogy fits. In many ways, the figure of Malkovich, walking through the fog and wind of Ferarra, reflects the shadow of the statue outside the canvas haunting Milan in the main works of the Italo-Greek painter. He is something threatening, a presence that watches and, in his capacity as a director, has an influence on the entire story. <br /> <br /> The dedicated Wenders fan can not help thinking of Damiel and Cassiel strolling through the streets of Berlin, watching them interact directly with the locals. After the metaphor of Himmel Uber Berlin, the angel (or in this case Malkovich the director) can interact with one of the stories. <br /> <br /> At this point I have to fight back, to take this line of criticism too far. I have to see the movie again. I'm pretty sure this is the thread that will bring Malkovich's monologue together. <br /> <br /> Perhaps his reflections and pontifications are a presumptuous, empty dialogue that sounds good but can not possibly be broken down into real communication. Maybe that's the whole point. No one can make that judgment with any certainty or authority until he has done his homework. <br /> <br /> We have to be careful when we throw the word "overbearing". It is easy to write off everything that smells of presumptuousness as presumptuousness, but this leads to a frightening mental state in which the only conversation that is considered genuine, earthy, or authentic is the most banal. As we avoid all discussion of philosophy, God, existence, meaning, and all brain sugar, we set our culture to a slow, stupid, and ugly death. Maybe this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni give us. It's certainly not the only theme of the film, but I think it can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> The other (and most obvious) leitmotiv is satisfaction. There is a lot to do here, and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of developing this leitmotif would exceed the limit of 1000 words for this review. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch the movie. But I give a caveat: it is not an autonomous film (at least I do not believe it yet). Some films interact so much with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their time that the viewer must have a background in the zeitgeist before approaching the film. Par-dela les nuages ​​is one of those films.
