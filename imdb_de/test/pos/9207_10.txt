I think Josh Duhamel so much !! The rest of the show is fun, but I think it's the pretty and sexy Josh Duhamel who really makes the show "Las Vegas" fun !! In the days of "Magnum" I loved Tom Selleck, I thought he was the sexiest man on earth !! A hunk in a TV show is a must, so that women like to watch something, especially just for the purpose of harmless conversation! I would have done anything to "win a date with Tad Hamilton" !! Josh Duhamel is amazing and I will always be in love with him !! Josh is definitely a HUNK !! and I will see "Las Vegas" all the time, Josh Duhamel is also a big reason !!
