That's the only thing I can look back on in 2006 and now say it rocks. It rocked hard and yet it tasted delicious. Mr.MEATLOAF added a nice little note to this dish of a movie even before the opening credits were rolled. Well, that tells you something, this movie rocked even before it started! Now I do not want to betray too much or be a "spoiler", but this movie is ROCKED! If you've heard the new album and thought, "This seems to be a little stubborn stubborn material, it's like playing only badminton with Satan, then this movie will increase your appreciation for the music and you will become that steamy satanic For those who want it better, you do not know what they want, because it would not be better the D. This movie is the period D.!.
