After reviewing 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would do it now. Dad's Army is my beloved sitcom. It is not half hot. Mum is also a classic, as is You Rang M'Lord. I do not consider Hi De Hi a classic, but it's still funny. <br /> <br /> This is a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is run by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well-meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. Employees include amusing entertainment manager Ted, his buddy Spike (he was thrown into the pool almost every episode), Glady's yellow coat, the carefree maiden Peggy, who longed for a yellow coat, and the Punch & Judy man Mr Partridge, he hates children The situations mostly occurred around the swimming pool, where in each episode someone would be thrown (of course with clothes). <br /> <br /> No classic, but still funny. Jeffery Fairbrother went half way through, so that, a bit like Only Fools and Horses, had got over his welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat at Butlins. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Peggy's Big Chance, Series 2, Episode 2.
