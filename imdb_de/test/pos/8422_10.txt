This is a very touching movie. This is a story about a special connection between a child and his grandfather. A villager (Arun Nalawade) takes his grandson Parashuram into the city to have his eyes treated. However, it is learned that Parashuram (Aswin Chitale) has rare eye cancer and needs surgery and loses both eyes. The film is all about the emotions and turmoil that both go through and how they accept the whole thing. The film avoids every melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Although the film is in Marathi, the language is not an obstacle at all. It proves that you do not need item songs, superstars and usual masala for a good movie. Excellent services. This is India's contribution to the 2004 Academy Awards. Hopefully it will at least get the nomination. Would rate 10/10.
