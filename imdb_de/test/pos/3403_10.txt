I absolutely adored this movie as a kid and still do it as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I saw it with our grandparents during the Christmas holidays for a year. They had taken it from television. Our parents were glad we were busy one night, but they thought we were sick and ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We were fascinated. They could not have solved us if they tried. It became an appreciated annual tradition. We loved everything about it: the time, the romance, the fight scenes, the bad guys, etc. <br /> <br /> Come, who can refuse to hate this Psycho Bent with his permanent SIR? Classic! Who can resist cheering wildly when Justin falls off the balcony ?! What a triumphant moment! I always had a special place in my heart for Orry and Madelaine. They were so romantic. Only the title song can make me tear a little bit. This movie is incredibly moving and I urge everyone to stick to it until the very end. That's worth it !!
