I saw the end of the 70s a few times on television. It only played late at night (after midnight). <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre plays a friendly, happy man whose face is disfigured in a fire. He is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and in despair. He turns to a criminal life and eventually becomes very successful. He makes a mask to hide his disfigured features, and falls in love with a pretty girl (Evelyn Keyes) ... who is blind! He tries to approach her directly ... but he can not escape his crime or hatred for his scarred face. <br /> <br /> A no budget B movie. Very short (just over an hour), but well done and well played by Lorre. This has much more depth than you would expect from a quickie B image. Above all, Ankers takes on the thankless "girl" role and makes her character fresh and appealing. Unfortunately, this has disappeared from the TV and was (as far as I know) never put on video or DVD. TCM has shown it recently and it was great to see that the movie still holds. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
