Well, what do you know, I painted my house today and an Elton John song came on the radio, which immediately brought me to this movie that I saw in 1971. So long ago and so far away. Ten years later, I drove through France, and I would have loved to see Michelle. The film is probably not very refined by today's standards, a pity, but at the time he looked rather racy. A few years later, a sequel was made, in which Michelle lived in a skyscraper in Paris and Paul came back to meet her, as the life in which they had moved, the film was very depressed. Still, the original was fabulous, and if you can get a copy, just rent it. Remember to keep them and treat them gently. I find that Americans can be pretty prude. Therefore, keep in mind that it contains scenes and topics that may disturb Central America.
