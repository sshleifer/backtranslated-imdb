A remake of the silent movie of 1916, based on the 1909 novel by Maurice Leblanc. Over the years, the detective series has been used in numerous plays, films and TV series in the United Kingdom, the United States and France. This version of 1932 showed the crushing Barrymore brothers John (as Duke) and Lionel (as Detective Guerchard). Over the next few years, they also played together at the Grand Hotel, Dinner at Eight and a few others. Sonia (Karen Morley) appears in the Duke's bed during a party in this Pre-Hayes code movie. First the lights go out in the bedroom, then they go into the big ballroom, then the search for the crook and the missing jewelery as well as other missing valuables is searched for long, since they use subtitle maps several more times. Also, look for a new safe that does not require a combination. Thoughtful plot, no big holes, but also no big surprises here. Not bad for an early talkie movie. Clever ending.
