Note: I've tried not to give away any important twists (or the end) of the plot, but if you're worried about it, please consider watching the movie before you continue reading - thanks! <br /> <br /> This was obviously a pretty high budget production released by Paramount. The story follows the (allegedly true) exploits of Jack Shepard from the year 1700 in London. He was a locksmith who was blackmailed by the nefarious "thief-taker" to save his brother's life. After being crossed twice by the Thief Taker, we transform into a kind of Robin Hood figure and get the support of the ordinary people. He continues to make escape from several prisons (including the infamous Newgate), and also has time to "entertain" many noble ladies. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie, though the storyline was a bit predictable. The film was filmed in Glencree and Wicklow Ireland and the sets were very well made and seemed realistic. I think Clavell captured the busy London atmosphere in the 1700s very well and I really enjoyed his creative use of camera angles. And unlike many films that show that era, Clavell does not show how poorly the poor lived (in one scene, several people are fighting for a meat pie that has been rolled through the dirt on the street). <br /> All in all I liked this movie very much. I admit that it lacks the wonderful scenery and underlying political commentary that Clavell's next film The Last Valley (a parable of the Vietnam War) has, but it still deserves one or two viewers. It is unfortunate that it (to my knowledge) has never been released on video or DVD.
