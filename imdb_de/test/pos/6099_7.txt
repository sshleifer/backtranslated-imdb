"Hit and Run" is a shocking story with the ever-wonderful Margaret Colin as a socialite who has "everything" until she meets a child in her car and leaves the scene. Hence the title. The tragedy is that she asks for help and returns, but she is scared of angry passers-by who think the hitter was leaving town. This happened at a time when not everyone had a cell phone or there was no story. Colin's guilt and agony are palpable, causing her to behave so strangely that a detective comes to her way. Her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self-hating hole, aggravating a dire situation. <br /> <br /> This is a thought-provoking story and one can not help but feel this woman's pain while she wishes she would just come clean. <br /> <br /> As a TV movie thanks to Colin and a strong script this is a far above average television movie.
