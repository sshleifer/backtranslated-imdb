If you're thinking of a great Australian comedy, do not think about ski shows (although I'm quite partial to 80's and 90's full frontal) or even sitcoms - you think of SATIRE! Something we Australians can do really well. (Z. B .: Front Line, The Micallef Program) We know how to take pi $$, and The Chaser's War on Everything is a classic example of how to do it and how to do it really well. <br /> <br /> I've long been a big fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel. I remember hearing her in the afternoon show of Triple J. They were and remain two of the funniest comedians in the area. <br /> <br /> Although I was sad when they left Triple J, I was excited to find out what they spent so much time on, forcing them to leave. (They made CNNNN and Triple J at the same time, so I thought that was a lot bigger.) And what an amazing HILARIOUS show Chaser is. Biting political and social satire at its best. <br /> <br /> I am also pleased to say that she has recently had a much better time period than Friday night and was postponed for Wednesday nights just after spicks and bacon. THANK YOU ABC !! Finally I do not have to record it! :)
