I'm writing this after watching the latest episode aired in the UK, and for me it must be hard work to uphold the standard. The last episode called "Blink" has elements of Gothic horror that are all about statues that are not what they seem. The doctor and the Martha do not seem to be much, but that does not negatively affect a well-done episode. The general standard has reached a high level, and for me the last three episodes, the two-parter with "The Family" and the newest ones are the best that the current team has ever done. <br /> <br /> That's not it Only if David Tennant keeps it together, will the supportive occupation last the whole week. For those waiting for Serie 3 overseas, it's worth the wait.
