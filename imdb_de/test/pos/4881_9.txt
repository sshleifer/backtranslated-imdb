I'm not in reality, it shows so much, but this one is extraordinary, because at the end of the conversation, the audience will also get something useful out of it. I do not have kids, but SuperNanny's lessons will be of great help if (and if) I ever do! My only complaint is that the show has been watered down since she was in the US. I prefer the British version with the stricter nanny approach. Is it just me or does anyone find the US version soft ... now is it the "friendly, gentler" nanny? I think we need a spoon of sugar so that the medicine can go down ?! Nevertheless, there is nothing wrong with a happy ending, right?
