Chick movie? Of course .... have you ever done that? Many times .... predictable? Yes .... Worth seeing? You Bet I was very pleased with the portrayals of Sarandon and Portman of otherwise serial characters in a well-known storyline. I'm a big fan of mother / daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good and the weak is performance and character development. Although this is not the best of its genre, I'll buy it and watch it again. I found the characters believable and the acting superior.
