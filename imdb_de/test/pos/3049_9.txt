This movie banned me tonight. Many thanks to Fox Movie Classics for the uninterrupted show. John Voight, this cast of unknown black actresses and especially the kids, made this a dignified way to spend a Sunday night. How nice to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can not understand why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is wrong in the role of superintendent. Who would you have chosen? The shrill character actor Charles Lane? Although his career is praiseworthy, an actor like Lane would have cheapened the role. Cronyn was an excellent choice for the part. I will consider this film as a treasure that I can remember.
