This review may contain a spoiler if you never read the book or see the cover of the video box. So if you want to get to the movie without knowing anything about it, except that I like it a lot, stop here ... <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are not first class, but action between the two and they give the romance between them more lives than Shute in his novel (though I prefer the novel in general). My very weak objections to the film unlike the book are that the film silences some of the relationships with minor characters and between the main characters in a scene towards the end of the film, to make some unrealistic dramatic suspense and as a general plotter. All this is treated much better in the book, with the result that I find the end of the book much more touching than the end of the film.
