*** Spoiler Ahead *** My late childhood had two cinematographic icons: Star Wars and this film by the Czech genius Karel Zeman. An encyclopedia by Jules Verne, bringing 19th-century illustrations to life in exquisite black-and-white photography, combined with stop-motion and traditional animations. Verne's spirit of adventure is present throughout the film, as is a very modern survey of the moral boundaries of power and advanced technology. In fact, it brings atomic energy into the universe of Verne in a very elliptical and elegant way. Elliptical and elegant is also the downfall of the villain, in which a (probably atomic) explosion flies his hat over the sea. The resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfying, something very rare, when many films do not know how to end themselves. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to catch this gem in repetitions Local television in the late 70s: It has increased my enjoyment of Vernes fiction and the cinema. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for Karel Zeman, an undervalued master of fantasy.
