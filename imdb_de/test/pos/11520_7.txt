Remove any parts of the movie that were "present" and stick to the flashbacks. Then you would have had a great story. The story of Faith and Wolf and their relationship was the best part. Diaz and Eccleston were wonderful. Brewster was hard to sit up. Surprised to see Blythe Danner as a mother. She was great. Also look for Patrick Bergen as a dad, always like him (Sleeping with the Enemy). This is a very hip, saving world, a kind of movie. Do not bother so much, but I recommend seeing it only for Diaz's performance. It has an excellent range and more should be used. Eccleston is as convincing as ever. He is wonderful!
