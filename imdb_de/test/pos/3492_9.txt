The way I came out about this movie was when I saw American Pie 2. At the beginning it had a trailer for Ali G., I saw the trailer and only forced myself to buy the DVD, it looked incredibly funny! The next day I went to my local store and picked it up for Â£ 3.99 (bargain!). The film is about Ali G., a "gangster" of the massive crew of the West Patch, whose rivals are the massive East Patch crew. Ali has a children's "Cub Scout" package in which he teaches them how to survive in the "ghetto" by teaching them to swear and steal cars after Ali finds out that the government keeps the money from As the children, he runs for MP for spots and plunges another MP in his attempts, the leisure center get rid of space to create an airport in spots. There is a lot of laughter throughout the movie while Ali gets involved in crazy stuff! Borat also appears in the movie for a few seconds, this is a must-have movie for all the fans of Sacha Baron Cohen!
