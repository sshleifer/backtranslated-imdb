Humphrey Bogart looks very young in his first leading role, works well, but has a pronounced lisp, which is only hinted at later. Nevertheless, he is very good and appealing as an idealistic young inventor of a new aircraft engine. Dorothy Mackaill is the real star here and plays a once wealthy woman who is torn between her true love for Bogart (he is also broke) and the comfort and security of marrying an older man (Hale Hamilton). <br /> <br /> Astrid Allwyn, Bogart's Trampy Sister, Bradley Page, her potential producer Barbara Leonard as a beautician, Jack Kennedy as Gilligan, and Halliwell Hobbes as a faithful (and wise) butler. Both Mackaill (who had starred in silent films) and Bogart tried to band together in conversations in 1932. Bogart was a slow-rising actor from the Broadway stage; Mackaill slipped and would soon appear like PICTURE BRIDES in towing line production. But both are very good here. Mackaill was not even 30 when she appeared in this movie!
