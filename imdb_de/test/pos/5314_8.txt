I loved the catcher in the rye, it's my favorite book. JD Salinger, the author of The Catcher, has the rights to the book and has done so that no person with his permission can make a movie about it. <br /> <br /> Hereby the United States of Leland. "Nice movie with a lot of sense and depth in the emotion, but much reminded me of the catcher, almost too much of the catcher, the few stories that Leland told in the film, such as visiting New York and its adventures, were very similar to those of Holden's catcher, and the way Leland looks at people and emotions is similar to Holden's, both are simple and true to himself and others. "Superior acting credited to Don Cheadle and Kevin Spacy." Great editing, everything Concludes perfectly and loved the story all together.recommend as a buy or at least a rental.Good movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gets pulled in some places makes up for it in the long run - give yourself some time and effort appreciate a good movie.
