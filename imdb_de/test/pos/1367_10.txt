In the story, old demons are released in a small town on Halloween night. Never in my life have I seen such a cheesy movie, but it's so entertaining that you can forgive its bad acting, its effects, its direction and its script. This is the best movie that has been created for the Halloween season since the original Halloween. And when they first introduce Linnea Quigley's figure, she is naked in the shower for 5 minutes. Gosh, they just do not get better. Rush and buy this band right away. 5.10
