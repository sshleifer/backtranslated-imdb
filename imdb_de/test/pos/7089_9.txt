"One True Thing" is a kind of film in which the audience inspires highly inspired performances. I do not necessarily say that the movie is uplifting because it is not. In fact, the movie is depressed. I'm trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to produce emotional tears from a crowd in attendance. I cried in "One True Thing" enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotional powerful movies of 1998. The characters were perfectly cast. All appearances are guaranteed Oscar nominees, especially Meryl Streep, who portrays the dying Kate extremely well. Alone her acting was enough to excel the film to the recommendation point, and gives you a new perspective on her. I also thought Renée Zellweger is a realistic, freelance woman who has to take care of her own mother. The other actors like William Hurt and Tom Everett Scott were also outstanding. The script of this movie was really fantastic. It's kind of weird how the concept of the film is related to the controversial events in my environment. See, I live near Lansing, Michigan, and right now a big issue here is the assistant suicide physician Jack Kavorkians (excuse my misspellings, if any) who have just been banned. The public will vote in November according to their beliefs. After seeing "One True Thing," my perspective on this topic has really changed, though I've always believed it. Without pointing out the end of the film, I just want to say that suicide in this movie is a distant topic, and I think it fits into the beautiful story. Overall, this film is actually more emotional than "Titanic", "Saving Private Ryan" or other tearjackers that have been released in recent years. I think that's because the main idea of ​​this movie is that it happened every day, so it's better for an audience. And indeed that could happen to you.
