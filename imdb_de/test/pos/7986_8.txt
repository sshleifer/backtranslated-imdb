The best Batman movie of the 90s is no doubt. This movie is set in a city full of insecurity and nightmares. <br /> <br /> Although the bad guys are a bit cheesy, they are a perfect match for the colorful, but nightmarish cinematography. <br /> <br /> The performances are really great and the comic tone behind it really offers expectations. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the kitschy outfits, this is a Burton-style movie. That can not be described. Burton is a sui generis director who took the Batman franchise to another obscure level without forgetting the comic past. <br /> <br /> Recommended for action-action fans and especially when it comes to superheroes.
