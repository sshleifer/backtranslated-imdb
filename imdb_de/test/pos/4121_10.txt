This is at least very close to a perfect video publication. The Messianic Metal group, dinosaurs of rock n 'roll, the largest and most influential heavy band in the world plays their hit songs and remembers the band's past. What do we need more? <br /> <br /> and ending with "Paranoid" and in the middle are all the greatest and most significant classics of the original cast included: "Electric Funeral", "Sweet Leaf", "After Forever", "Iron Man", " Children of the serious "... and of course my personal favorite" Into the void ", I'm glad they did not miss it. Well, how could they? <br /> <br /> But this video is more than just music. Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward go through the colorful history of the group. The only thing that bothers me a bit is when a live song is interrupted with interviews. For example, is it necessary to inform about how the song "N.I.B." does it have its name, in the middle - on top of each other? I doubt. It's still a small mistake so it's not too big a deal. <br /> <br /> Band members are also lounging on chairs and chatting: pleasant material for a Sabbath fan! I admit I'm having trouble tracking what Ozzy Osbourne mumbles, but it's just amusing. I had the privilege to join in when "The last supper tour" arrived in Finland and for me personally, this video is an ideal way to remember this great show.
