Writing about something so wonderful is very difficult. Actually, it is almost impossible to describe the specifics of this film. This is a wonderful story about sex and sex, and it is almost unbelievable that we do not have to deal with obscene scenes of sex. The feeling this movie was made for people who want to feel and feel life in all its complexity in a simple and easy way. We look at it, and in our minds, even in our hearts, something begins to grow: it is a pure poem. I've watched some "gay" movies and I'm almost always really dissatisfied with unnecessary sex scenes, not because I do not like sex scenes, but in general they're so pornographic that I'm forced to believe the director or the producers or the scriptwriter that homosexuality means perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is totally different from these. Three are the main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and one girl in a special love triangle. Ito likes his best friend Yoshida, Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito. Imagine what could turn into unprepared hands? On the contrary, Hashiguchi tells a great story, deeply rooted in the philosophy of life, and adds a question in our mind that made me wonder at the end of the film: Why? And that's why it spread in several questions in my brain and in my heart. The scenes, which are sometimes boring, are moments of the most beautiful poem we can feel but completely unable to write down in words. And maybe we can not understand the question at the end of the film. I'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every bit of it. Some people want to understand a movie that almost disassembles it. Others are so used to ordinary "American gay" movies that they can not appreciate the real value of this masterpiece. Look at it, close your eyes in the credits and feel everything, feel yourself, feel the wonderful song. For all this and much more I give a Nine. I'm just not giving ten, because ten out of ten is perfection. But I confess I almost did it.
