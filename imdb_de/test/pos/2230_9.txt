I can not understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently available only through an Australian video company. However, this is the unfortunate obfuscation of this classic by Peter Sellers (Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide still gives him the same BOMB rating he gave in the '70s). With so many scene claws Sellers comes through with his perhaps funniest role. It all starts with the discovery of a patient who left at 11:15, but Sellers argues that the corpse still lives on the fact that the new day starts at noon! The last straw for the besieged hospital representative comes in this room, the DO NOT DISTURB sign is still on the door. As soon as he leaves the room (handkerchief is holding his nose), a short conversation is held with him - DOCTOR: "We can not save all of them! This man was at least 85 years old! COMMISSIONER:" How old was he when he died, 63? "Harold Gould plays an unkempt surgeon who closes his eyes as the knife digs in. Richard Lenz (whose reporter" pompous ass "in John Wayne's" The Shootist "was booted in the buttocks) plays the patient who exposes the fraud (He only came for a chest x-ray until she found out he owns a house.) Also on cast (and with outstanding rural music) is Keith Allison, former guitarist of Paul Revere and the Raiders, who also worked with Michael Nesmith on a few shots of Monkees (and along with Nesmith on "The Birds, the Bees and the Monkees" from 1968 "Auntie's Municipal Court") Unfortunately, in this print is missing some material, in addition to a topless sequence with Uschi Digard at the end, as well as a scene with the actress Kathleen Freeman (who wants to use the green stamp. t (finance her operation), who is being jailed by Sellers in his office to ni e (in the unabridged version, he returns to his office and notes that she has written in large letters on the wall: "UNFAIR PRICK"); His answer? "You wrote the price wrong!").
