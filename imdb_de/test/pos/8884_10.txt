Did he have it with the one who raised you since you were young? You just want her to disappear from your life? This woman is your mother. You should respect her, you should honor her, whether she is ill or healthy. But that can be annoying at times. Especially when she gets very overbearing. So Owen (Danny DeVito) had to cope in "Throw Momma Fron The Train". His momma (Anne Ramsey, 1929-88) is one of the worst. He tries his best to become a writer and she is anything but grateful. Call him an "awkward kack," "Larda $$," and "fat" and "fool." For his friend Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) he has his own problems, his ex-wife. She tries to discredit him. So what did Owen do? Push her overboard. What does he do? Help return the favor, get rid of Mrs. Lift! In the kitchen scene, I liked it, where Owen Larry called "Cousin Patty". And mom said, "You have no cousin Patty!" and Owen shouts, "You lied to me!" and El cabongs Larry with the frying pan. Then comes the fun part when they are on the train trying to kill Momma Lift. This is thwarted and she steps Larry off the train. Well, everything is back to normal, the ex-wife lives, but Momma kicked herself in the bucket. Maybe she should have seen the mistakes of her domineering way. A funny movie, and the cast is great. A classic! 5 Stars!
