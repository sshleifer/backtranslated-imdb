I watched Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was in love with Olivia and found Kevin very funny and the repertoire between them very good. Lately it's getting thinner for me due to many factors. First, my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, which displays 5 video clips you would find on a website like Youtube, which are generally funny, or by people who are accidentally (sometimes deliberately) hurt , Um, this when I've seen 4 or 5 times a week shows the same stuff over and over again. I have not seen anything so good and I can only laugh that people are likely to break their necks and be paralyzed so often. The show is like a late show that wants to be / Colbert report wants to be with its politics, if you're not living in a blue state and not an automatic liberal, that humor gets old too, McCain is old, yeah, yeah, whatever always. Libs have no guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that they have a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves. So we get the same old vids from people who get hurt, who we're supposed to keep laughing at, and then a political political humor that never laughs out of its own weakness. I'll keep watching as I watch work, and it's all hoping I'll be entertained, but it's getting old. I liked the hosts Chris and Alison, they really were a nice change. Maybe this show could be a rotating hosting thing. Olivia, whom I found really funny at first, has resorted to this constant pouting reaction and she is getting old, lol. 7 out of 10; It will keep you in a young mindset, which is good if you're a younger baby boomer like me (mid-40's). Maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do, there is a lot of material they could use.
