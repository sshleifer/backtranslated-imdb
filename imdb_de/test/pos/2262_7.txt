Everything Is Enlightened A young Jewish American is looking for the woman who helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while undertaking a Europe-wide tour with some unlikely colleagues. Liev Schreiber usually makes his directorial debut with a playful fear of his acting ethic. When successful actors decide to sit on the director's chair, we usually get a biographical insight into the souls under the spectacle mask - Check. We usually get a mish-mash of genres - check. What we do not usually get is a revealing, original movie that is believable, intelligent, and moving. Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, a curious boy who collects pieces of life throughout his life. He is on a mission to find a woman in a photo. The sepia image bears his grandfather (a sinister resemblance to him) and the woman. To facilitate his journey, he asks for the help of travel guides consisting of a hip-hop loving break dancer, Alex (Eugene Hutz), his apathetic and cunning grandfather (Boris Leskin), and his dog, Sammy Davis Junior. What follows is essentially a comedy. There is an easy easy introduction with voice-overs. Alex is especially funny because he raised his younger brother in 1969 to prove how popular he is with chicks and breakdancing, which makes him Jonathan's antithesis. Scribe begins to tear down the characters as they progress and the comedy serves as a deliberate veil to a story about three people who are associated with the Holocaust and do not really know each other. All three keep the film with tenderness and authenticity. Something that probably did not wrong writer. As magical and fantastic as the film itself is, the horrors that can break through, ie the past is presented in an almost savory tone (random music, cinematography), which makes it all the more disturbing. <br /> <br /> When the unlikely group finally finds the city they are looking for, they learn about the true atrocities and learn a lot about who they really are. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood is as authentic as usual and brings his usual innocence and strength to the screen. Formally a resident of Lord of the Rings and a Resident of Sin in Sin City. He plays Jonathan brilliantly while being bombarded with culture shocks and a search for the truth. Boris Leskin, as a grandfather, also expresses his fears and frustrations to the young people with great humor and conviction while enlightening his own past. However, it is Eugene Hutz as Alex who does the show. The director used this old trade in translation misunderstandings to create and sustain a humor that is actually witty and not tricky. <br /> <br /> Schreiber has delivered a charming debut that has heart and soul. The uninterrupted score and beautiful photography creates a fairy tale veil around a story about identity, truth and family. If there was a complaint, that would be the speed at which the movie changes direction. although this might have been intended, it may not sit well with everyone. Still, this is an incredible effort that delivers great comedies and bonds between an unlikely group, while analyzing another aspect of the horrors of World War II in a whole new way. <br /> <br /> -Chi & Ojo
