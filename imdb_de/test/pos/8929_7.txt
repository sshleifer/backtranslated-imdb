"Eighteen" (2004) tells the story of Pip Anders, a depressed and extremely cynical young man who sets himself apart from his dysfunctional middle-class family and lives on the streets of Vancouver. On his 18th birthday, he receives from his recently deceased grandfather a cassette and a player. He tells of his memories of his 18th birthday with the British army in France and tried to help a mortally wounded comrade prevent occupation by the crew. German While Pip is listening to the tape (Ian McKellen gave the tape) Voice of his grandfather), we see the scenes he describes as flashbacks that alternate with the daily scenes from Pip's life, as well as recent flashbacks that reveal the dark secret of why Pip left the apartment and finds it impossible to anyone to trust who is nice to him. <br /> <br /> An ambitious second film by writer / director Richard Bell ("Two Brothers"), with a polished look, excellent photography, well-developed non-film stereotypical characters (same-sex gay and heterosexual) and commendable Efforts in emotionally and physically demanding roles of some talented new actors (notably Paul Anthony as Pip and Brendan Fletcher as grandfather at 18). There is also a notable turn of Alan Cummings as a priest trying to help Pip, and a small supporting role played by Thea Gill ("Queer As Folk"). The complex story - in the director's own words in his DVD commentary - is intended to drive a "whirlwind of emotions" that will bring Pip to its breaking point, and will definitely do so. My only criticism is that the overall effect is too "slimy" or artificial to identify with a real audience. Much of the supportive dialogue (and ending) is too artificial and predictable, and the direction must be sharper to prevent careless overreaction some scenes. I recommend it, 7 out of 10 stars, including extra points for a remarkable mission.
