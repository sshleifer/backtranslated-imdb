If you cross Nami Matsushima (Meiko Kaji), Female Scorpion and a dangerous group of thugs (including their sadistic pimper and his equally repulsive wife) who operate a prostitution ring with an iron fist, you will have to pay for it. Hell has no fury like Scorpion, and a determined detective, Gondo (Mikio Narita), who seeks revenge for beheading his arm after tying her, will do anything to catch Nami. Nami finds an ally in hooker Yuki (Yayoi Watanabe), who grants her temporary protection. Yuki has a backward brother who suffered a brain injury during a job and has to take care of him (.. in a disconcerting revelation about incest, she also cares about his sexual needs!) .. She actually keeps him locked up in one room when working in the street! In the meantime, Nami is targeted by a vile neighbor as soon as she finds her own place (she works as a sewer) and threatens to turn her into the authorities (Nami was a fled convict facing a U -Bahn fled the cops) if she does not give him sexual favors. His wife pours a teapot of boiling water over his face and body, leading to death, and the prostitute clan is looking for Nami to pay the debts of a very important member of their organization. Katsu, Lee's lover and confidant, realizes that the one responsible for the loss of his loyal member is a former inmate, Scorpion. Katsu charges her with an injected liquid, puts her in a birdcage (!) And embellishes her captive. What ultimately fuels Nami's anger is the observation that a prostitute dies in front of her cell, a victim of a forced late abortion that has died to death. Nami finds a scalpel in his hand (.. from the operating room) and frees himself from the cage to free each member of the clan responsible for the death of the hooker. The series of scalpel murders offers Gondo the opportunity to catch Nami, and he will include them in the underground sewers below the city, but can he catch or kill them? Especially when Yuki comes to her aid? <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say that there are no shackles binding director Shunya Ito or his filmmaking team because FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE is another perverted, confused, and ultra-violent entry into the very entertaining series. Equipped with fine production values ​​and a visual stylistic talent to capture all the madness in an imaginative way, Ito draws you straight into the confused drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima appears on the screen. If you have a lengthy credo sequence in which your anti-heroine escapes through the city's crowded streets with the handcuffs of a man handcuffed to his arms, the onlooker must know what they're meant for! The incestuous negotiation is just bizarre (... and she was softly shot with the backward brother staring at his stunned, cold sister with dead eyes!), And the whole abortion sequence is pretty hard to get through. But the angle of abortion, as disturbing as it is, is a motivation for Nami's revenge. Although Nami's imperfect manner and her criminal nature, you'd rather see her take out these criminals than the other way round. Interesting angle also with Detective Gondo. Gondo is ready to break the rules, and he becomes a force of nature for anyone who stands in his way to catch his mortal enemy. His fate in the end, when he visits another enemy of Nami in an isolated cell, perfectly describes what makes these films so ridiculous and so entertaining. The scalpel murders is a montage of slumped filthy pieces in various locations, with the blades sticking out of flesh, with Nami leaving the crime scenes to wipe out the entire clan in memory of a fallen victim to unfortunate circumstances. While the movie is essentially a comic adventure, there is a sadness that permeates, and only a few characters get away without a mistake. I can imagine that many will turn away from this mockery, how unrealistic is FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE (... how Nami can escape the capture time and again, reach her revenge goals and pay back all those who have wronged her ). but I have seen it as a violent action cartoon, similar to the later '80s movies, and I liked what it was. As always, there are some beautiful Asian actresses and some colorful skies in this film. Meiko Kaji, almost always reserved / calm, but with violent intent, staring down her enemies, is in good shape (in more ways than one) and traveling Lee as her cross-eyed, obnoxious opponent runs away with the picture as perfectly realized abusive abusive Enemy worthy of psychological torment (if both are in jail, Nami's torture methods are sweet). My favorite scene has nothing to do with the storyline, but is so wonderfully wrong, as a dog discovers Gondo's rotted severed arm that goes down a street and eventually finds a resting place where he can chew!
