This movie made me a rugby and coach Larry Gelwix fanatic. The characters of the story slipped and fell before they began to grow as they fought through incredibly intense conflicts. That was understandable and absolutely believable. Like life, there were no easy answers to the problems that everyone was facing. Outstanding actors and a great script brought this true story to life. I wish there were more movies like this. Nowadays, I almost exclusively look at stories worthwhile, because they are usually far more interesting than fictions. Moreover, this is an inspiration and it teaches us not to give up anyone too fast.
