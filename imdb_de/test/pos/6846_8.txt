Loved this movie !! Great play by Carla Gugino. Interesting story about a kidnapping that goes terribly wrong (not all?). Some surprising twists and turns in the film and the plot were easy to follow without being so complicated that they were completely incomprehensible. It was a totally unexpected joy. More "Quentin-ish" than most movies try to be.
