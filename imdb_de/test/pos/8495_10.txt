This movie inspired me to be a better person. In life, you do not know who you will encounter, and sometimes our prejudices cause us to misjudge someone. I have learned to give a person the benefit of doubt through this film. I also learned that hard love can make a stronger person. Now I want to know where the soundtrack of the movie is. There are songs in this soundtrack that I've been trying to get for years. Can I briefly talk about acting? Jamie Fox was outstanding. The man has become an actor performer. The appearance of Regina King was great as well. If I can make a woman look at me the way she looked at Ray ... I can only dream. I plucked $ 18.00 for this movie and I do not have much money, but I'm ready to watch this movie again and again. This movie touched me.
