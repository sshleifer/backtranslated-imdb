I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was great in this movie when she played the role of Harry's girlfriend (Mike Wagner). Harry, a robber trying his luck to make another raid. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him away. If it does not work out on the trip, they put together mines to find the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang, with the help of Vittorio De Sica, decide to go to Mob from there. Be sure that the result is never the same, no matter what the gang does afterward, and you stay on the edge of your session. The rest of the outs have to be taken care of. As for Raquel, if you're a fan of this, then you need to watch this movie because he has never been better off with a ***** on the beach. I'm giving this movie 10 Raupel Welch Stars alone. No wonder she was the hottest actress in the sixties. It was the sex symbol everyone wanted and no one could. Not only does she look good, she can behave even better. If you want, Raquel Welch, then you will like this movie
