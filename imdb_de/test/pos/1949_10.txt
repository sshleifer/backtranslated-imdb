I did not expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies that I thought I would only watch because it was on TV. I certainly underestimated this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags about his friends. I was very happy with the acting, they had played the characters well. It was a particularly great scene when Feck (Dennis Hopper) and John (Daniel Roebuck) talked about why John killed Jamie. It is annoying to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel in control and therefore. But Feck had loved the girl he had killed. Feck felt remorse, while John felt nothing, he was proud of what he had done. It really makes you think of people. Keanu Reeves did a great job as Matt and Ione Skye was good. It's strange to see her as "Valedictorian" in "Say Anything" and she as Clarissa. Every actor has done a great job. It was really nice for a change. It was a great movie and I would definitely say that I can recommend it.
