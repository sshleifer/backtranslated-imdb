A close-knit musical family, a mercilessly-benevolent father, and four vivacious teenage daughters are rooted in firstly by the performance of Felix, a swift young composer, and secondly, and above all, by Mickey, his outrageously attractive Orchestrator friend. <br /> <br /> It takes a while for Michael Curtiz to get this piece of Americana going. The first part looks almost like a paraphernalia of a grain for commercial purposes, not without a curious, bourgeois charm, and then John Garfield enters the scene as the condemned Mickey, making his first appearance in moving pictures with mock-black curls , Sleepy, overhanging eyes, rude and disheveled, the complete opposite of Jeffrey Lynne's softly persuasive, incredibly charming Felix. Garfield is in full, and DIRELY needed a counterpoint to the rest of the household ("Nothing I would do would surprise me," he says), and suddenly the film gets interesting, though I agree with critics that the Action is not sufficiently motivated. <br /> <br /> The four sisters are more relaxed and seriously signed, but Claude Rains as a family man has his moments. <br /> <br /> Watch it for Garfield, though he's just really a permanent thing about it.
