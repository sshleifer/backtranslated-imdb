I saw it in the movies in the 80s and never forgot it, even though I did not see it anywhere. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it would look outdated now if I saw it now, but I remember the story and compare it to some of the horrible modern movies I've seen in Zone Horror get up very well. <br /> <br /> I can still remember his coffin slipping out and opening, reviving all the corpses, and the blue flash. After seeing hundreds of horror movies and remembering them, it must be good.
