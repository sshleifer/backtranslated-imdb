They love or hate movies like this thriller playing in a lonely asylum in a remote, lonely country. It's not so much a horror show, but a mix of frightening images and wackozoic mental patients. "Scream" is the best expression used in an apparently popular classic for unusual and evil behaviors. Notice the "judge" who will lay the ax behind the doctor! Brr-r-r-r !!! Except for a damn tasty goodness, not much else can be described here, but if you have a chance, remember the well-known old saying of the lady lady: "Out! Get out! And never come back!". Do not you wish that you did not look in the cellar?
