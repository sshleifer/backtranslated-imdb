Symbolism in abundance, great melodies, this film has destroyed the expectations of the target group "soon no more". These Monkees and the naturally selected members of the group were witnesses of a subtle, but in your face, kiss goodbye. The message sounds true today, the cage from which you are escaping, and the bridge from which you want to jump off is the next disappointment of the next generations. There will always be new kids on the block replacing those who break away from the chains. The film can sometimes be frustrating because the themes the film attacks are so obviously separate from the American way of life. A thinking and thinking person can not help but stare at himself in the scenes of Head and not only question their personal concerns, motives for the continuation of the insanity of American everyday life, but the motives of those who want to allow it for madness. The last scene, similar to Don Quixote's chivalric daring that the imprisoned Tiger should go to battle, shows how insane and impossible most dreams are.
