One of the better movies of the eighties. This fact-based film tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend, leaves her naked body on a riverbank, and later boasts with his friends. What's just as bad is their inability to feel anything against it. <br /> <br /> Disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic children who have no respect for their parents or any kind of authority and whom it seems almost to condemn Live a life of rebellion and recklessness. This drama strikes hard and is impossible to forget. The young cast does a good job - even Keanu Reeves, in one of his first roles, is better than usual. Of course, there's no reason that Layne's character (Crispin Glover) is as insane and unconventional as he is, but Glover is just him. Veteran Dennis Hopper has a particularly good role as a loner despite his dirty past is saddened by the attitude of this group of children. I would like to highlight the dissuasive performance of Daniel Roebuck as a young killer. He is an underrated actor and apart from Hopper he is probably the best performer in the movie. <br /> <br /> I first saw "River's Edge" a long time ago when it was first shown cable TV movie channels; But I did not catch it all; I saw it for the first time in its entirety a few years later, and now I have seen it again, probably at a definite time. <br /> <br /> Some potentially influential moments include Madeleins (Constance Forslund) A collapse in which she complains that perhaps she should leave her children as well as her worthless father. I also like the scenes in which Matt (Reeves) faces his distraught younger brother (Joshua Miller) and when the teacher, Mr. Burkewaite (Jim Metzler), regrets the fact that the girl has died and not one of his students seems interesting. <br /> <br /> I will never forget this movie while I live. It is too sad for that. <br /> <br /> 10/10
