If you really want to scare people, choose the devil as a theme. After all, many people believe that he is real. That's why you're stuck in a whole fleshy group of pre-existing religious and mythological images. And in your young audience there are some nightmares. <br /> <br /> This episode had the appearance of a Hollywood blockbuster. After watching, I switched to another channel that was playing a Bond movie, and frankly, I could not share the hair between the differences in SFX. With a minimal occupation, limited by his situation on a space station; With an overwhelming panoramic view of an imploding universe, it was as claustrophobic and intense as Alien or Event Horison. The black hole outside made it feel like the weight of the dark matter's black matter pressing the station onto the planet and whatever it contained. And as the horror becomes even more intense with the knowledge that Dr and Rose are stranded, the eerie Ood begins to direct a disembodied voice and then the characters are hanged one by one ... <br /> <br /> This has all the best features of the cream of this new Dr. Who strive; Girl in the fireplace and empty child. Emotionally captivating, scary and humorous, without looking cheesy. This is far scarier than any amount of flying Daleks. But it must be asked if this is really suitable for children. This is not a family friendly episode. Too bad that the poor parent has to put his children to bed after this child. I'm not sure if I want to see what happens next!
