Okay, I'm not sure if that counts as a spoiler, so I just ticked the box to avoid the trouble. <br /> <br /> I have noticed that the opinions on this film seem to be a fair break. Personally, I loved it, even though I have to say some of the cameos were there to have a cameo. Personally, I'm just thankful that it was not the show of Edward, Tubbs, and Papa Lazarou and that they chose the three best characters in the series to give the film the title. <br/> <br /> Actually, this is not a summary, but rather a pretty blunt, blog-like thing, but hey, the movie was awesome and I think that's all that counts.
