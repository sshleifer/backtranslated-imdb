This was an excellent show. At home in Chicago it came on PBS and I remember that Cindy Herron (from EnVogue) played the teenage daughter. The show covered topics such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. It was a middle-class black family that had a daughter and a teenage-aged son who moved from Oakland or somewhere to a middle-class neighborhood (I can not remember). I remember several episodes, but most of all I remembered when her cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I saw it for the first time and I was able to keep up with the program. That was a great show. I can not remember the name of the guy who played the son on the show, but I've always mistaken him for Kevin Hooks.
