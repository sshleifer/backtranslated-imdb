I recently received this movie on DVD as a gift and was not sure if it would appeal to me (although one of my favorite actors plays a major role). In fact, it is on the way to becoming a favorite. <br /> <br /> First of all, luckily it is * not * the same as the book, whose ending I think is overly melodramatic. Second, it's one of the best movies I've seen about the First World War. "What?" You can ask. "It's not a war movie!" Right: We see no battles or bombardments, no trenches, no gas. But it does show the cost of the war, the damage done to the lives of the men who fought in it, and the impact this had on the loved ones approaching them. a Baronet's widow waiting to be released from a mental hospital. All the women in the film seem to be widows: some from the war, but Helen's much older husband Sir Thomas (we'll see him later in a photo) got sick and died during a party, so blame the collapse she's lost and lonely. The wire around the hospital grounds is reminiscent of POW camps and trenches: Like many men in the outside world, Helen suffers from a kind of shock. Outside the hospital, she has to find her feet in the outside world again: a world we see through her eyes as somber, desolate and unfriendly. Your mother can not really support her. She is a widow herself and has her own emotional defense mechanisms behind which she hides so as not to cope with her daughter's plight. (How many people does she seem to be embarrassed at this time.) Ledbetter, the hired driver, becomes a supportive presence and Helen helps her get used to life again, but she does not realize he's becoming dangerously obsessed with her , This is an excellent performance by Robert Shaw. Ledbetter is a former regular soldier, a former sergeant major who runs a boxing club and builds his own car rental company. Superficially, he looks tough and strong, reliable, but there are cracks below the surface: he has not really gotten used to civilian life. He invents (for reasons he later explains) a family and family life he does not have; He has brutal outbursts with colleagues and sex without affection. Approaching Helen? a woman who, despite the greater social freedom of the postwar period, could not really hope to marry? reveals psychological turmoil that tears him apart. Today you could diagnose PTSD. <br /> <br /> The same goes for the other man in Helen's life, the aspiring politician Captain Hugh Cantrip (Peter Egan). He is ambitious, good looking but also very young. Amazingly, his girlfriend Connie (Caroline Mortimer) moms him, combing his hair and making sure he has a clean handkerchief before he runs out. He is known to both Ledbetter and Helen: the former had served under him during the war, and Helen had met him in political circles and considered him a "popinjay." He and Helen, however, begin a relationship with which Helen wants to support his political career financially and emotionally. Peter Egan, fresh from his stage performance as Stanhope in R C Sheriff's 'Journey's End', makes Hugh more than an immature Kad. Between Helen and Hugh, there is a revealing, restrained scene in the rear of the car citing Brooke's The Old Vicarage at Grantchester. She asks about his war experience: "Was it very bad?" He can not answer. She says, "Well, you're back now." But his quiet speech? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder?" ?? is the key to his character. As light and shadow flicker across his face, we know that there are some horrors that can not be put into words. The disproportionate losses suffered by young officers of his kind? directly from school or university and expected to lead from the front ?? are known. In a nervous speech (in which Helen calms him down) at a dinner party in front of local political people. He reveals that he will stand as an independent and no longer as a liberal (the party that led the country into the war). His emotional life is as damaged as that of Ledbetter. He can not easily rid himself of Connie, who is emotionally and financially dependent on him: reading between the lines, she's probably a war widow (maybe a former comrade?) With a kid whose drawings we see on the wall of her house. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> The crisis between the trio is slowly building up, with a frightening scene between Helen and Ledbetter in the car and Ledbetter listening to Hugh and Connie when he drives her when Hugh tries to convince Connie that his relationship with Helen can continue, even as she evolves. that he will continue to support her. Jealousy, obsession, and his belief that he must protect Helen from a double gold digger lead Ledbetter to confront her and Hugh by force in her house. The end is completely different from the novel, and is better for it: it is dramatic, but less melodramatic and maintains an unsentimental tone. We started with a character who recovered from a nervous breakdown. we end up with another sufferer. Helena, it seems, is now smarter and stronger than the two men who could not fully get used to the so-called "Land for Heroes", to which they returned from the nightmare of total war. The new end is open: one has the feeling that they will at least master what lies ahead without illusions. This reflects well the reality of the time when women (Helen, Connie and many others) had to pick up the parts of a world where too many men had died or had come home with different mentalities and physical harm. <br /> <br /> "Well, you're back now." ?? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder?"
