All I have to say is that this movie is the bomb. You will cry when you see that. I mean, this is a reminder to all of how hard and easy it is to fall in love. It reminds you of the days of your youth, when you were carefree and everything that was bad to you was washed away with a single kiss. Although I'm still a teenager, I live my life like that. When I am with this particular person, everything that was negative in my mind has been erased. So, I give this movie a 10 for his heartfelt message and touching action. Actors Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein I also give a 10 for a sweet face.
