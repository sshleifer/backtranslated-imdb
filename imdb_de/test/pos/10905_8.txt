This movie is extremely funny and enjoyable, with matching, witty and experienced occupations. I find this film pleasing not only by the elements of humor, but also by the music in different scenes. Kevin Kline, a good comedian, has done a great job in many parts of the film, along with Tom Selleck, who is amazingly different from many of his other films. The humor in this movie is stupid, which leads to exaggeration in many scenes, especially in the opening packs. Joan Cusack is also remarkably funny and over the top. and the same applies to all other occupations. This movie has many elements of silly humor and is pleasant if you want to laugh.
