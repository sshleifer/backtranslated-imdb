I have spent many years studying and admiring all the great directors like Kurosawa, Lean, Fulci, Lenzi, Deodato, Peckinpah and Kubrick. My favorite movie is Once Upon a Time in America. <br /> <br /> I've recently become a fan of D'Amato, and although he was not a horror master, his films were extreme, whether softcore or hardcore or extreme. <br /> <br /> Porn Holocaust is now one of my favorite movies, the way it's filmed is brilliant and the music is catchy. Joe D'Amato was not a horror master, he is not a fulci or a bava, but although he was a master of eroticism, no other director could make erotic films like him, he never tried to make films outside of those genres. <br /> <br /> Long live Joe D'Aamto master of porn and erotica!
