Another great Tom Wilkinson performance underlines the film "Separate Lies" (2005), which features Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, this is the story of a couple, James and Ann Manning, where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police with them. It's a hit and a run that killed her girl's husband Maggie Bassett. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett), when he sees a damage to his car. He confronts Bule, who admits he did and promises to go to the police the next day. When James comes home, Ann is angry that he makes such a big deal out of it and explains that she drove the car. Of course, James is not so eager to storm the police. She suggests that they call Bule and tell him her decision. "Oh, f___ Bule," says James. "Well, that's just it," says Ann. "I feel Bule." James's devastation is only the beginning of this well-made drama. Without giving up the plot, this is a good example of how gender switching changes a story. An example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car into a lake and her children drown. She gets life in prison. What if the father had done it? The chair. You would be surprised how often the result would be different. The same applies here: if James had had the matter and carried out the subsequent activities, the viewers could judge the story differently. If Ann were in James's place, that would be shocking. It is very sad. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson is as heartbreaking as a man blinded by the woman he loves, and Emily Watson does a great job as Ann relieving herself of her lies - your involvement in Accident and happy marriage - knows what she has to do. Rupert Everett as Bule is very effective - indolent, high quality and ultimately in need. Everyone here is very civilized in dealing with each other and no one is good or bad. <br /> <br /> There are separate lies - James, that his marriage is happy, Ann's as mentioned above - and there is a connective lie - the accident, about which all those involved are silent. It's enough for Ann, who knows Maggie. In the end, everyone has to deal with the separate lies that reveal the only lie. <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie.
