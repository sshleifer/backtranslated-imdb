I've seen a lot of documentary films that looked like the law was on the wrong side of the fence - the thin blue line and the lost paradise come to mind first and foremost. But this is the first movie that makes me angry after seeing him. From the evidence presented in this film, it seems to me that what happened at Waco was at least an unprofessional and sloppy mess of the FBI and the AFI, and in the worst case was a murder. Like most people, I assumed at the siege of Waco that David Koresh was a completely vicious madman who led a violent cult. Having seen this, I believe that Koresh was more of a somewhat unbalanced and confused type who, through his eccentric actions, unintentionally drew the attention of the US government. Sure, there were many weapons in the branch Davidian Compound. But none of it was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people on the grounds, all of whom seemed very nice and harmless. It was annoying to see the callous statements of the responsible men of the government forces in Waco, the unsuspecting testimony of Janet Reno, and the partisan defense of the attack on Waco, a defense led by some Democrats of the committee. In my opinion, the representative of NY and the current US Senator of NY Charles Schumer was the most important. I voted for the man when I lived in New York - I'm a Democrat and also pretty leaning to the left. After seeing his actions in this committee, I wish I could go back in time and vote for D'Amato instead! For anyone who is interested in the government remotely, this is a very important film that must be seen. I even think that this should be shown in class - that's so important.
