After seeing Big Fat Liar, I believe that Jason has learned a lot more. When he told the truth that Marty had stolen his story, it was like the boy calling Wolf. People heard him, but they did not believe him. Nobody did anything to help him. In addition, not only stink Marty's films, but also his advice. The truth is not overrated. I'm so glad he was exposed to what he really is. Everyone found out he had stolen this boy, including his parents. Not only did he steal and lie to this boy, he gave them the work of another and tried to call it his own, which is plagiarism. Does he not know that it is inadmissible to plagiarize someone's idea? Another reason why he was fired. He is untrustworthy. He is a liar, a cheater, a thief, a crook and a plagiarist. Do you have this Marty? You are a plagiarist. Besides, you have everything you deserve.
