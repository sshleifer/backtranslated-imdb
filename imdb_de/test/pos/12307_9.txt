I saw this film at the NFT in London, where it was shown as part of the BFI's John Huston season. I was not really sure what to expect, and the first few minutes of the movie gave way less. In fact, the rest of the movie continued to yield little! No real action, no action, no suspense, very little drama and, apart from a short section at the very end, no scenery wonderful movie. I do not quite understand why, but I think the movie is almost perfect because of its unobtrusive style. The acting, the script and above all the casting were perfect, and I can not remember how I felt away from a movie that feels so good. All I know is that I get the DVD (this is one of the movies that will surely be as good on the small screen as the movie experience, provided you can find a quiet place to watch!) And I'll see it again soon. I will also be interested to find out what my family and friends think about it. I am sure that it will not be everyone's choice, but I am convinced that a large number of people will agree with me. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
