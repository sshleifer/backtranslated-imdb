A chick movie that guys still like - yes! Wonderful Now I can have fun, enjoy my girl's company and not feel like I can not wait for the movie to end! Easy - but funny. Great stuff. Whatever you do not miss, the DVD extras. This is also a great "blind date" file. Will Smith does that well - though he seems light - he pulls everything off well. The movie is a bit slow - do not expect too much action - the laughter is there - and also the message - but the timing is a bit slow. Use the low moments to whisper or kiss. The end makes you feel worthy of good moments. Above all, they expect fun, carefree fare - and pay attention to some great productions by the supporting actors - they make the film. The plot twists are predictable - but it's a date change, so get the popcorn refills out of the kitchen - and do not let them pause. Count on more dates after this movie - she wants to see what's next. Remember Hitch's advice !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy it.
