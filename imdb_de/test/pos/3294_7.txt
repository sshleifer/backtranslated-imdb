Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett. Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie. This seems quite ironic to me, because it is actually one of the first films I remember. My mother took me and my little brother to see this movie at the Garland Theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid-70s, and I remember it. This step is a trapper, the one Was accused of crimes he did not commit, and the law is persecuting him. I believe it plays in 19th century Alaska. A narrator tells the story of the Trapper by Mike Mazurki. Really, this is a very good movie with a great backdrop. It could be compared with the 1981 movie Death Hunt with Charles Bronson. The two films have a very similar plot. The main difference between the two is that Death Hunt is a movie for adults, while Challenge is a family friendly movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both quite old when this movie was made, which I find quite impressive given that this movie was shot on location in the Alaskan wilderness. This was the last movie Tay Garnett shot before he died, which was only a few years later. They had both been traveling since the quiet time.
