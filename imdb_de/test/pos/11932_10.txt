Sean Astin shows another amazing performance in "Toy Soldiers". He plays the highly intelligent rogue Billy Tepper, along with Wil Wheaton and Keith Coogan, who play his best friends, Joey Trotta and Jonathan "Snuffy" Bradberry. On a normal day at Saint Anselm's boys' school, a group of dangerous terrorists take all the boys and teachers hostage and threaten to blow up the school if the leader, Luis Cali (father of Andrew Divoff), is not released from the American prison but these are not just ordinary boys who are taken hostage. Most of these children are sons of very powerful people in America, and half of them were expelled from other schools before they came to Saint Anselm. They are mouths and deeds can only kill them. When the government is desperately trying to find a way to help, Billy, Joey, Snuffy, and several other boys decide to take matters into their own hands.
