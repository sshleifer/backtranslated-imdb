Glenn Close is back as Sarah Plain and Tall, a woman who keeps a family together in good and bad times. Acting is awesome - Christopher Walken (not uncannily scary), as her husband again delivers a first-class performance. It's nice to see the young Christopher Bell grow up. Too bad we do not see much of Anna (Lexi Randall, also a few years older), but the new Witting family member (played by Emily Osment) was very welcome. And finally, Jack Palance, as the long-lost Witting patriarch, is as good as ever.
