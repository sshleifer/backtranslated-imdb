Kate Gulden, played by one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century, and also one of the most talented actresses Meryl Streep (Out of Africa). She is wonderful, every part she plays. The Yale graduate is the pride and joy of American cinema. Kate's health is deteriorating, and her husband George, a role played by brilliant actor and Academy Award winner William Hurt (Smoke, Kiss of the Spider Woman), is having a hard time with the deteriorating health of his one true thing and seeking the help of his daughter. Poor daughter Ellen Gulden, Ren√©e Zellweger (Jerry Maguire), has expected far too much from her. No breaks! The story takes a very realistic look at a parent's illness. In this movie, the only daughter has to put her life back to take care of the needs of others. In every family there is always one who is confronted with this kind of responsibility. Ellen is furious at the beginning of the film, but over time she understands that she understands her mother's lifetime for her family. She even asks her mother: how do you get him in and out every day and nobody notices? That's what women do, many that I call invisible work. Besides, we clean, repair, repair, stretch, celebrate, we are the best friends, we are confidants, lovers, outreachers, disciplinary, sensitive. Some of us, as well as both women in this film, have the perfect education, are the psychological pillar for the whole family and also do this invisible work! This is Kate Ellen and many women in our society. Many of us have already passed through this stage of life when our parents grew old and died. I was there. They were just too young. I gave my thanks to my parents, but I never understood them as well as if I had to play their roles and walk in their shoes. This film reflects the reality of life. Maybe it's sad, but sometimes life is like that. George, a professor at Harvard, is a complicated person who seems to think his work is more important than anyone else, and has a very "master / servant" mentality toward the women in his life. He is not strong enough to handle it. If you want to see good acting and the reality of life, do not miss this movie. Favorite scenes: The restaurant comes to Kate, violins and all. The production of a table of broken porcelain. That I am so symbolic! We are all broken vessels! Favorite quotes: George: "Only when you go uphill, you realize that you really go downhill." George "You have training at Harvard, but where is your heart?" <br /> <br />
