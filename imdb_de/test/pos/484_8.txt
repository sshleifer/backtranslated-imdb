I enjoy this special production of "The Mikado". The producers added a few touches to make it more entertaining for the modern audience - for example "As Some Day It May Happen" (the "little list song") is completely overworked and some lines are available throughout the library. Freedoms were also taken with the attitude. The costumes are not Japanese, but rather 1920s English (though some of the "Tittipudlian" ladies wear 20s-inspired kimonos), which is well choreographed with some dance styles from the 1920s, and there are additional dance girls and bellboys If you're a Gilbert & Sullivan purist, these changes can bother you, but I think they're fine - and I love the costumes! <br /> < br /> Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely funny, all of her scenes make me laugh (one of my favorite add-ons is when she makes her first appearance - the dancing Bellhops annoy her with her antics, so she screams loudly, "STOP IT !!"). All the other main characters are also doing good work, I like Mark Richardson especially as Pish-Tush (this Toupet!) and Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yum. <br /> <br /> You have to remember that this is a stage productio n is filmed, and set your expectations accordingly. There is no change in attitude, though the filmmakers used some of the filming techniques of the 1930s to arouse interest. If this production has a drawback, the stage make-up was not changed for close-up with a camera. Baseline are often visible and there seems to be an excess of eyeliner, lipstick and blush everywhere. I've seen this happen with movie films before, and it's a bit angry at first. However, I hope you get used to it and enjoy "The Mikado", which is worth it - a thoroughly enjoyable reproduction of a classic!
