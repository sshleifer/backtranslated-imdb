Haines is excellent, because the brazen cadet who believes West Point will really mean something now that he has arrived now. Haines shows his uncomplicated, funny personality as he grapples with West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And surprisingly touching, after Haines' character goes too far, he is almost shunned by other cadets. The new humble Haines will soon be able to play in the Bill Football game against the Navy, and despite an arm fracture, the game wins. Great, rousing entertainment from MGM in this Haines formula movie shows Billy at his best. William Bakewell scores as a slim follower. The handsome but devilish character would be played in later decades by Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and others. West Point is a winner!
