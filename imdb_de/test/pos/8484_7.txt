Ray is partly interesting and technically very well done, but Ray is often lazy and forgets some important details about Ray's life. The film shows us everything in parts, in which he is in bloom and is most successful, which is good. I just wanted to see a few things about his older life. Jamie Fox mimics Ray Charles to a point, sometimes it's absolutely scary. I have to say, Jamie is the reason why I came through this movie. The first half is much better than the second half. It's more interesting, it has more oomph, and it's not nearly as sluggish as the second. To be honest, at first I was not a big fan of Ray Charles, so I really had no expectations for the movie. Ray's biggest problem was the excess length. This could have been very easy to cut, with more relevant scenes than the ones they used. I found the early part of Ray's life most interesting when he was about to become successful. At that time he was modest and a gentleman. And although the film may have exaggerated his actions, he is a little too full for himself to interest me. <br /> <br /> Performance. Jamie Fox gives a performance for eternity as Ray. He looks like Ray, speaks like Ray, looks like Ray. He even sings like Ray! That's much more than an impression, I really believed that he was, Ray Charles. He was the heart of the film, and without his presence this movie would have been a complete and boring movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion. Ray is interesting sometimes, and terribly boring with others. All in all, I was disappointed with how routine it sometimes looked. Just because it's a bibliographic film, Doesen does not mean he's automatically Oscar-worthy. Jamie Fox earned his Oscar, but the film is at best above average. Worth a watch, but if I were you, I would keep my expectations at a fairly comfortable level. <br /> <br /> 7/10
