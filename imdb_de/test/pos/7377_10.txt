I want to say that I absolutely loved Campfire Tales! For me it was one of the original horror movies with a twisted ending. As if the content of the movie was not scary or funny enough, you have the end. It's a very great movie and I am so happy that it will be released on DVD on August 30th. I will not hesitate to get my copy that day. I do not think that the film has received all the recognition or recognition it should have. All these other films came out shortly afterwards and were confirmed, but if my brother had not told me about the film, I would not have known. What stinks because I think it's way better than any "scream," "I know what you did last summer," or any other horror for that time. So I hope you can see the movie yourself and at least see the difference. I loved it and as a horror movie junkie, Campfire Tales was like a dessert for me!
