Imaginative, fast, satirical! Americans do 'crazy' but the British do 'funny' - and they love to make fun of themselves (er: unsightly teeth, big lips / nose, 'veddy' common or 'veddy' snobby, obsession with that) 'gahden'). Insider jokes for the elders in the audience, lots of action for the little ones. Discreet use of devices from other classic movies (watch Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, Harvey, Tremors, etc.). Also a nice "buddy" movie (Gromit is a quiet but resourceful buddy). Add brilliant vocal work by Bonham-Carter and Fiennes (is it true that the best acting is done in animations today) - have fun! I saw it with the grandchildren. Fun for everyone. - can be read
