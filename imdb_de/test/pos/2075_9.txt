If you want to see Shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, I recommend you to find this BBC version. It's four and a half hours too long, but Jacoby's performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart as Claudius is worth the effort. <br /> <br /> It always surprises how clear "Hamlet" is when you see it in its length and order, as determined by the Bard. Each film version of "Hamlet" has tinkered with its structure. Olivier focused on Hamlet's indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacoby is able to bring all these aspects of Hamlet's character together using Shakespeare's script. <br /> <br /> Why does not Hamlet kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says, "I am very proud, vindictive, ambitious ..." Hamlet is extremely angry not only for the death of his father (and the alleged murder) or his mother's marriage to his uncle, but also and above all because Claudius usurped the throne of Hamlet. He is furious with his mother because he married Claudius (marriages between royal relatives are not unknown, this is for political reasons), but their marriage strengthened Claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to return it to claim. He is therefore unable to do anything about it. And that's also true, after he heard the ghost force of the father. He can not just kill the king, otherwise he loses the throne. He must "get out" the king's secret and here is the tragedy! At the moment, Hamlet has managed to publicize Claudius's guilt, he has the opportunity to kill him, and he does not. WHY? He wants it ALL! He wants revenge, the throne AND the damnation of Claudius soul in hell. Hamlet comes in a classic tragic form. His own HUBRIS is his ruin. He kills Polonius thinking it's Claudius, and the rest of the game revolves around the death of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius, and Hamlet himself.
