This is a beautiful, short, lifelong film about a guy (Peter Coyote) who lives a perfect life in the suburban middle class when police suddenly invade his house one night and arrest him for killing a man 27 years ago. <br /> In his prison cell, Coyote tells his wife the fate of 27 years ago and how he came into contact with Wayne Kennedy, the man he allegedly killed. From here, the story is told in a flashback way, and the more you learn about Wayne and Coyote and how they came about, and what happened when they did, the more you arouse interest. <br /> <br /> Acting is nothing special The guy who plays Wayne Kennedy is pretty scary enough. The real strength of the film is the mystery of what actually happened on the mountain. The woman spends the movie searching around to find clues to the puzzle, and every time something new turns up, we're treated to another flashback that reveals more about the mystery. It's actually pretty good. <br /> <br /> So when it comes to Lifetime TV movies, this little movie is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
