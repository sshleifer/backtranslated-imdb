The plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done anything but direct in movies and is looking for his first big opportunity. He discovers Molly in one piece and instantly knows she's going to be a big movie star. He signs her a contract with the condition that he must impose. The producer agrees and her big career is in full swing. What follows is a reproduction of the silent movie era and the early sound films with a great emphasis on the comedy. And oh yes, there is romance and also a bit of sadness. The performances of Don Ameche and Alice Fay are first class. The music is a real plus when listening to some old familiar tunes. Many DVD extras in this restored version from 2008. It must be emphasized that this film is the first story, not just a tribute to silent films. Later years brought similar films such as Singin 'in the Rain (1952) and Dick Van Dyke- Carl Reiner's, The Comic (1969). The special feature of this film, however, is the reproduction of silent films from 1939. We see parts of it like the movie audience in this past time (though some sound effects are included) in gorgeous black and white, while the rest of the film is in the background untouched color. Buster Keaton, one of the biggest in the silent film era, was on a rise at this time, he is excellently modeled on two silent film scenes and is at the top of his game! It is said that he also contributed something to his scenes. But the real reason to watch the movie is, if you're a fan of movie history, Hollywood Cavalcade about anything but the heritage of Mack Sennett. It is not a genius to realize that this film is a "positive" rewrite of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand's life. The character Michael "Linnett" Connors is Mack Sennett, whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And of course Molly is Mabel. Sennett had the cake rolls, the bathing beauties and keystone cops. He collaborated with Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin (cameo) and Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle (body double), and fell in love with his lead actress. Not only that, but Sennett was the technical advisor for this film and also appears in it. Since most movie viewers today prefer sound features, those associated with short motives and mutes are left on the pasture. When Mack Sennett fell into that category, it's fortunate that Hollywood Cavalcade exists! Of course, Sennett was very important to the development of comedy in movies. His career began in 1908 as an actor, then as an author, director and producer. He retired in 1935 with about 500 films. He had collaborated with the best, including Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, W.C. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle and even Roy Rogers (in Way Up Thar). As a comedy film, it is extremely difficult to continue a career long. Mack played it wisely and worked selectively only for the next 25 years. In 1931 he received an Academy Award in the category of short topics and 1937 another award for lifelong work. In the 1940s, his presence was still noticeable, z. Here comes the Co-Eds (1945), where the oyster soup is recreated after Mack's Wandering Willies (1926). In 1947, The Road to Hollywood used some of Sennett's Crosby films. Two years later, the movie Down Memory Lane, in which he participated, brought some nostalgia. With a talent for keeping in touch with the right people, a guest role later this year came with the ever-popular Lawrence Welk and his radio show. In 1950 Tillies Punctured Romance (1914) brought his greatest triumph with sound. In 1952 he was honored on television, This Is Your Life, then published his autobiography, The King of Comedy (1954), which is a great companion to Hollywood Cavalcade. In 1955, Abbott & Costello brought a more concrete connection, as he had a cameo appearance in A & C Meet the Keystone Kops. Finally in 1957 another tribute with the compilation movie The Golden Age of Comedy. If you see Hollywood Cavalcade, this is the legacy of a movie pioneer. In the film of the banquet scene, the camera pans over the guests at a long table. When we come to the silver-haired Mack, he turns his head alone to the camera, as if to say: "Here I am!". When he rises a short time later to make a speech, he is most depressed and underestimates the words given to him as if he were mentally conveying, "I know that my influence on the comedy will never end, but the people Mack Forget Sennett, maybe this movie will help. "
