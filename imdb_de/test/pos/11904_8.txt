This movie is the Latin godfather. An unlikely gangster closes the gap to unlikely alliances and forms an empire. I enjoyed the action and shootings along with the bold and colorful characters. This movie is not an Oscar winner, but definitely entertaining. Hey, who needs an Oscar at all? <br /> <br /> Chapa has some balls to conduct this movie (I think he also made it?). Reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do everything, Robert Rodrigez. Keep it up, is there a sequel to work? There are a number of threads that need to be tied. Son comes back and avenges Father's death?
