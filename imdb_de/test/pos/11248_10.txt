Keys to the VIP is one of the most entertaining, informative and fun shows currently on television. The idea is original and well implemented, as it maintains the reality aspect, yet remains entertaining. All judges have a razor joke. They are not always the most beautiful, but if you are looking for comfort, look at a chick movie. Say what you like about the show's validity, but it's absolutely real. I know people who participated in the show, and they confirmed it. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh, have a look at this show. It's one of the best comedy shows ever.
