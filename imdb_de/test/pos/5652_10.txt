The main achievement of this film is that, despite its racist unipolarity, the film still manages to draw a series of war portraits that leave a lasting identification with the one who sees it and the one who was present at that time. Although good films can have the ability to universalize their motives, this is often difficult. Great films have the ability to universalize their unipolar motives. This is what this movie does. Rather than creating a context of unity, the film shows the Japanese in the ill-fated finality of the Philippines war front in February 1945, signs of pacifism or war, but rather signs of feelings, death, destruction, victory and illness of war with bloody hands the vanquished. Different and superior to films like Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, both of which needed a satirical methodology to trivialize and depersonalize American troops, and use all races as a struggle to mediate and show the horrors of war as it really is. <br /> <br /> The main character makes it through this movie to the end, being sick and therefore inedible. Through this character, through his illness, his saving face, we see the end of World War II in the Philippines in February 1945, and the way Americans, Japanese, and Phillipines came together in bloody warfare where they die to die. <br /> <br /> The film is obviously influenced by a neo-realistic style of cinematic presentation that is original and beneficial to the viewer, whether now or now, for the neo-realist techniques he uses convey all the horrors of the war Pictures form, whether a showcase for pacifism or "militaristic responsibility". Like the Germania Anno Zero by Roberto Rossellini, a story emerges from the environment and the associated conditions. The opening of the film, with the mutual discussion between the two Japanese soldiers, shows the prejudices events. Through this opening we feel that the struggle is human and human with man; It shows that they have relied on each other in the past battles to face the enemy, but now, in this opening or "pivot" of the Japanese people's experience in the Philippines, new information is being relayed to the main character, Tamura a reproach of a cannibal trust on each other if they want to survive. <br /> <br /> The jungle is gritty, wet and thick and the sky is often cloudy and pours. We waded with the latecomers through puddles and swamps, as sick as the land around them. Nameless bodies are scattered everywhere. Now and then you can not say whether it is body, stone or corn. Apparently there is no difference here, everything is dead and sick. Everything dies. All they have to feed themselves are rare monkeys and dead bodies of fallen comrades and / or nameless enemies. <br /> <br /> Tamura often meets another who died near death. Although they are crushed in spirit and crush his, some offer their bodies for him to eat, but he refuses; like Hiroshi Kawaguchi as Nishi in Giants and Toys, he still will not fall into the dignity of death and Japanese morality; because this is all he really needs to sustain for his survival, a dignity of the self. Therefore, when Nagamatsu dissects a soldier for consumption, he shoots him. Tamura may be used to killing, but he can not decipher the disease of killing and looting. He is neither a good nor a bad man. He wants to survive but will achieve no more than a simple war killing effect. His self was dead on the battlefield, he is not happy to wade here and wipe out the weak for his survival. <br /> <br /> He sees the disease he carries everywhere, in every one; and, sadly, he lacks the ethical justification of thinking either of completely thinking of others, because he can not give up his body because of his infectious disease or can think of himself, seeing the disease in everyone, even though he still kills her even if they do not hurt. Seen in his attack on the two Philippians in the hut. He can not see anyone. Nobody can see anyone. The only ones who see an aversion to nausea and aversion to health, the heart of survival instincts. <br /> <br /> Often, an arm that points to the left of the screen, towards what hope must be so far, is Thule's freedom. However, it is blocked by American soldiers, so that the Japanese stragglers in this desolate dirt must die slowly. Even a church tower appears, reflecting the light of an invisible sun. But on closer inspection crows flutter about wildly; Religion is also a hint of poison. <br /> <br /> Nobi, the film's Japanese title, gives more evidence of the film's themes or feelings: the bondage of fate, the heaviness of existence among leaders and lives controlled by others. Its actual Anglophone translation is heavily debated by historians, as non-Koreans translate it as "slave" and "slavery", while many Koreans believe Nobi is not a slave system but a servant class system that does not meet criteria for slavery. A way to escape poverty. This improves the war theme and the symbolism of the soldiers. <br /> <br /> Is not it important to ask yourself at this time what is the purpose of what will become our gained story? Should we feel comfortable rolling it around without conscious effort? Is not it the question we are fighting against, this age old historical question, but why are we fighting? Fire on the plane is at Eiji Funakoshi, Osamu Takizawa and Mickey Curtis; based on a novel by Shohei Ooka. Japanese with subtitles.
