I saw it last week and the sketch about the Korean cities was funny. Very funny and suitable for the political climate. Full points for the authors and Spike for that. The part in getting the translator to pull a rickshaw and throw Korean words could only have been deducted by Spike. This is a brave attempt by Fox. This is a brilliant show and I hope it works out. My wife and I have done it regularly and although it collides with some other programs, we are now watching it on MySpace. I hope Fox dedicates all the resources to the show and does it daily. I can not wait to see Bobby Lee on his show. With people like Bernard Abedalla behind the show, this is on the right track. Even Mary Mae as a woman looks beautiful.
