Mel Brooks really excelled in this movie. Nobody can deny that Blazing Saddles was a classic and a breakthrough in this kind of comedy movie, but Men In Tights became the apex of his creative genius. This movie is an absolute must. If you like this movie, I would also recommend Space Balls and History Of The World. The same is the other way around. If you've seen any of these movies, Men In Tights should be next on your list.
