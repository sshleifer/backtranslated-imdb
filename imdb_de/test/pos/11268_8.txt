This must be one of the most beautiful morbid movies I have ever seen. Merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with terrible violence, sex and a minimalist retelling of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and the thick grain layer make you wonder what you sometimes see. The use of texture in combination with the extreme contrast creates an incredible viewing experience. This movie is not for everyone. I think you have to be open-minded and not condemn this movie so quickly because of its content, which is extremely crude but makes a pretty important statement about creation, God and humanity. Whether this film is a work of art or a shock is open for discussion.
