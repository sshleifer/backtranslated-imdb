As someone who usually despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I saw it, I was hysterical. Yes, it is sexist, rude and extremely rude and I loved it. Since some comedies have only one or two funny scenes, this movie was made to laugh. I have never seen such an original comedy as Ali G Indahouse. For a comedy with Ali G this would be an 8 out of 10 points. Absolutely brilliant.
