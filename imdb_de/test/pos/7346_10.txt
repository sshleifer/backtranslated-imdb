The relationship between the main characters that I thought was very realistic. It's believable how the two end up together. There is not all the "oh yes" that most Hollywood movies have. Also do not mention how they capture the sexy, beautiful and painful side of the harness. I am a trapeze student and I love that they have shown how hard it is on the body, on the hands and yes, these substance burns are brutal! Definitely a must for the relationship and the art that is made in the film. I loved it! I'm happy with the end of the movie, but I really wanted to see more. Be sure you keep the credits for a special treat. Great scene!
