Oh the outer limits. I love this show. It was terribly scary or puzzling to the right. I loved all genres in the show, from horror to thriller to mystery. No matter which genre, it was good. I guess I must have started well after the cancellation, when Sci-Fi showed it as a replay or played marathons. It was a really good show, I do not know all about the seasons and everything, but I remember every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV said, "There's nothing wrong with your TV Not trying to adjust the picture "I would squeal with joy. It was a good show and I like to watch it when it comes. I give him a healthy 8 out of 10 points.
