The Brysomme Mannen is one of the best films of all time, about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses, no feelings, no love, no truth, and definitely no freedom. A world in which people are afraid when someone expresses their opinion, expresses or shows affection, a world in which no one is free and no one knows what the meaning of any of this is. Like the world we live in, the world in Den Brysomme Mannen is a world of lost souls who seek to fulfill, but focus on the complete opposite of what it fills, materialism, social acceptance and mediocre contentment. > The Brysomme man deserves the full attention of every human soul, for we could all use a new wake up call.
