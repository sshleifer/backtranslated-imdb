What do you get if you have a stubborn, experienced French police inspector named Maurice Martineau to solve a murder case? Well, just a very entertaining, funny movie. The revised black-and-white film "Quai des Orfevres" delivers the goods, despite romance, jealousy and marriage, seemingly to the truth, "Who has it?" Be in the way. <br /> <br /> Inch by inch, technology for technology, such as experience and intuition, the patience of this master inspector is tapping into the truth - but of course with the help of a bag of dirty police questioning tricks. <br /> <br /> Martineau is the heart of this movie. The use of rough background music by director Henri-Georges Clouzot to intensify the drama in the big film noir style is a wonderful cover for the visual experience. Martineau finally solves the mystery and arrests the culprit. Hey, he is good !! But even Martineau can keep a dark secret in his past. Who is the boy who may not be his son? <br /> <br /> Some things can never be solved - even beyond the credits.
