A film that reveals the discomfort of modern men and women in life when confronted with death. We are beyond the simple religious belief in life after death and beyond in some kind of hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. But man is obsessed with death more than ever, especially since we can push him away for a long time. The scientific and technological development of our societies makes us believe that we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. That was pretty typical of the end of the 20th century. Things are changing today, especially when US President Barack Obama speaks publicly in a public speech to journalists about their quest for truth, classifying that truth as relative, because it's more of a search than a final one End acts. Goal or achievement. The film shows the end of good old metaphysical thinking, which has gradually become an obsession with the truth, an obsessive idea that the truth is unique and irreversibly achievable. Hollywood had not yet reached postmodernism, even though it seems to have reached the White House today. Thus, some young doctors and medical students decide for death and return. Technically it is possible, but the result is not surprising. It reactivates old feelings of guilt and frustration buried in the subconscious. It has to do with a drug-addicted father of a Vietnamese veteran committing suicide, another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some other death row candidates, another with a young black girl who falls prey to elementary school and was bullied out of racism, sexism and hate, if not afraid of their shyness. It's so na√Øve that you could scream out of shame for these young adults who are highly skilled and behave like babies who have cooked around their bottles of fruit juice. The movie is interesting, but in something completely different. The setting and the shoot and every detail or detail is baroque, morbid, decadent, in the style of "Death in Venice" or Greenaway, or some other artwork that makes love to the fundamental enemy of death. Of course that does not save the movie, but at least it's worth to look at it. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles Saint Quentin and Yvelines, CEGID
