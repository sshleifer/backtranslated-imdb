Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most imaginative (and funniest) of all silent movie comedians. Why is he completely forgotten? Unfortunately, the original negatives of most of his films were lost when the Fox warehouse burned in the early 1930s. Hamilton was not pretty or graceful like Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd; He was not as elegant as Raymond Griffith. And unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton did not seek the sympathy of the audience. <br /> <br /> However, his films were very popular at the time of their original release and remain funny even today. Oscar Levant once claimed that he had asked Chaplin if there was another comedian he had ever envied, and Chaplin immediately named Lloyd Hamilton. The character, most often portrayed by Hamilton on screen - a flat-topped Naff with sophisticated hand movements and a duck-like gait - was later adapted by veteran vaudeville comedian Eddie Garr (Teri Garr's father) and adapted by Jackie Gleason to be TV Character 'The Poor Soul' from the 50s. <br /> <br /> 'The Movies', pseudonymed by Roscoe Arbuckle, is one of Hamilton's most innovative shorts, and she's hilarious. We first see him as a country boy and say goodbye to his family outside their homey country house on the way to the big city. Then he steps away from the hut and we see that it is IN the big city and the traffic around it is booming! <br /> <br /> Finally, our hero ends up in a restaurant (not in the credits, but it's the Montmartre Cafe in downtown LA), where all the movie actors eat between takes. It's an amusing gag when Hamilton's bumpkin character meets three actors in costume and make-up as Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt: this gag would have been funnier if the cheaters were more like the originals. Finally, our guy sits down at a table and hopes to meet a celebrity. Sure, entering the restaurant and sitting at the next table is a great movie star ... none other than Lloyd Hamilton! There is a very well done double exposure - the connection is almost invisible - when Lloyd Hamilton welcomes himself as Lloyd Hamilton as Country Boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hamilton's peak of creativity was very short. He began his film career in gross slapstick films as one half of a double act (Ham and Bud, opposite Bud Duncan) and had a short and exciting time in stars during the late silence period. Sound films were not friendly to Hamilton, and he was quickly pushed off the cast list in some raw early conversations. Then he died young. Fortunately, "The Movies" is pretty funny and a great introduction to this unique comedian style. I rate it with 7 out of 10 points.
