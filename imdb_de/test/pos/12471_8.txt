If you're looking for a modern-day movie version of Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismuller that overcomes the machinations of unscrupulous white guidebooks or cunning black tribesmen while saving the animal kingdom, this is NOT the movie for you. This is a recount of the "legend" of Tarzan from the beginning in an intelligent, adult way. It's beautifully filmed and faithful to the Edgar Rice Burroughs stories. <br /> <br /> Tarzan is not an action hero, but a man torn between two worlds - the natural and the civilized. In an impressive performance, Christopher Lambert portrays this fear with absolute realism. If it only slides up once, the cat is no longer in the bag: the audience (especially the adult audience targeted by the movie) will laugh, and the movie completely loses its hold. It will fall into the cheesy depths. But Lambert never allows it. (Forget what you might think about him in other films, when I saw the movie on its original release in the theater, I thought it deserved a prize for the academy.) <br /> <br /> The minor cast is uniformly outstanding other commentators have noticed. I disagree with most of them because I did not find anything wrong with Andie McDowell's performance. I would not have nominated her for an Academy Award - the role is too modest - but she is fully capable as she is. I also do not know why her voice was overemphasized. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of the African part of the story is absolutely beautiful. It captures both the beauty of the African wilderness and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The landscape is lush and exotic and the colors are alive. <br /> <br /> But this is also a "historical" movie, and the cinematography also shows Victorian England - country, city and interior. The costumes are outstanding. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or obtrusive. <br /> <br /> There are some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more annoying than some scenes in dances with wolves. This is an outstanding film about the conflict between civilization and nature, embodied in the young Lord Greystoke and convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.
