After the great success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, the CBS television allowed Barbra to make her second special an even more elaborate follow-up. Streisand cleverly knew that to follow the groundbreaking success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, her second special would actually raise the bar of ingenuity and spectacle. Not surprisingly, she did it again. Even more impressively, Streisand has managed to build up this great production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME IS BARBRA. <br /> <br /> Once again the special is divided into three different acts. The shooting on location in Bergdorf Goodman's department store was so successful in the first special that Streisand and his company decided to film again for the first act of this second special on location. The decided place this time was the Philadelphia Art Museum, where Barbra had endless opportunities to "enter" various works of art that matched the songs sung. In addition to the many artistic possibilities that made this place possible, the museum provided the perfect opportunity to film in color. English: emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/art...2934 & lang = en In the opening credits, Barbra plunges into a maid costume to Kern and Harbachs "Yesterday". She stops to admire various paintings and statues, often becomes the figure and sings a thematic song. Streisand plays a bittersweet interpretation of Hammerstein and Romberg's "One Kiss", while Thomas Eakin's CONCERT SINGER delivers a hilarious performance of Chopin's "Minute Waltz" while Marie Antoinette performs abstract art with the frenetic rhythm of Peter Matz's "Gotta Move" and embrace a bad interpretation of "Non C'est Rien" as a desperate Modigliani girl. The climax of Act I, however, is when Streisand compares his profiles with the bust of the Egyptian Queen Nefertiti while singing a tour de force interpretation of Roger and Hart's "Where or When". With the Act II Circus Medley, Streisand can interact with various farm and circus animals while singing various farm / circus / animal songs. Some highlights included Barbra singing "Were Thine That Special Face" to a baby elephant and saying "I've gotten used to that face" as a serenade for a piglet that Campy "Sam, You Made the Pants to Long" sang a group of baby Penguins and Barbra compare profiles with an anteater while saying "We have so much in common". Streisand also swings on a trapeze and jumps from a trampoline to the chorus of "Spring Again". Then he slows down by performing a haunting version of "I Stayed Too Long at the show" alone on stage. Barbra also has the chance to showcase her favorite poodle Sadie in this segment and even speak a little bit of French. <br /> <br /> The Act III concert is once again the highlight of the hour. Dressed in a slimmer white woolen dress, the concert piece is carried on a uniquely designed stage with a partial staircase that leads nowhere. Streisand opens the act with a hot interpretation of Harold Arlen's "Anyplace I Hang My Hat Is Home" before going on to savory versions of the well-known "It had to be you" standard and the rarely heard "C'est Si Bon" (Es So good). "Streisand really amazes the audience with a breathtakingly powerful, octave-high performance of the Sweet Charity ballad" Where Am I Going ", from which Streisand delivers the final interpretation.Streisand also presents the then rewritten Richard Maltby, Jr. -David Shire's ballad "Starting Here, Starting Now" featuring a passionate Streisand song that is one of the best vocal performances of her long career. <br /> <More than anything else, Color Me Barbra was a showcase for Streisands all the time Growing mega-watt star power, Streisand itself is still the main attraction, though even more visual spotlight is blended in. Her voice sounds as beautiful as ever, and d This special was the first to show how conspicuously she photographed in color. As with MY NAME IS BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA was another rating smash and produced another top-five, gold-selling soundtrack album. Simply put, COLOR ME BARBRA defies tradition and appears as a sequel that is almost equivalent to a classic original.
