I was a projectionist when I was in the USA. and remember this movie well. We had just been equipped with stereo sound !! o-o-o-o-o !! Well, it was a big deal in 1959. Instructions came with the roles. The overture was played while the projected curtain was closed, and I followed suit with the curtain closed. At break, the theater curtain was closed, and after five minutes, the film was restarted with the projection screen closed while music was used as a curtain for the second part. Since I was the first stereo movie I've ever seen, and so was a huge musical production, I certainly enjoyed seeing it every time I showed it for the run.
