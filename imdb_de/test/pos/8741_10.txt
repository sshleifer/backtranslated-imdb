From about 1965, American films began to choose the shocking and the iconoclastic, which was great for the time - a kind of seed that would pave the way for bolder, bold dramas. Since the decade these films were made was so much determined by their own beliefs, most of the films released at that time are dated. CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. Even the title suggests a "sunny" romantic comedy that occasionally gets into risk. This does not mean that this is a bad thing: on the contrary, films about risky issues have to start somewhere, and America must be a culture that is rooted in certain traditions that have themselves fallen into deep hypocrisy, and shocked themselves, when they see an indirect reflection of the customs of the time. Meanwhile, European films are dealing with the same situations, running out like a million dollars and having a longer shelf life, because what we consider scandalous is shaking them off, saying "Next" and going on. <br /> <br /> Toni Simmons (Goldie Hawn in her breakout role), a young, very young, very young thing, goes on to deal with a much older dentist named Julian Winston (Walter Matthau) , He can not marry her: he is already married. Toni decides, instead of withering, that she actually wants to meet his wife and "put things right." In the picture comes his assistant Stephanie Dickinson (a luminous Ingrid Bergman, who returns to American cinema after a twenty-year absence), a woman of his own age, pretending that she and he have the perfect marriage and household. There is a reason for this: she has kept calm feelings for Julian, feelings he does not know, even when he asks her to play his wife to keep Toni from continuing her relationship. And then he climbs one step higher as Toni's blissful innocent actions drive the action into the unexpected and he introduces Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston) as Stephen's "lover". Incidentally, Harvey is also an elderly gentleman who has an affair with a much younger woman (Eve Bruce), whom he lied to in a very funny scene. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the person we search for is the one who has always been there. What an ungrateful role for Rick Lenz, who plays Igor Sullivan, Toni's neighbor, becomes a man who not only sees the true beauty of the outcast comrade Stephanie, but also the person who saves Toni in the beginning to kill yourself. (Not the stuff of comedy, suicide.) Then, this is not your average comedy.) And needless to say, Ingrid Bergman's subtle, poignant portrayal of a woman who somehow missed her love choices, which has become prickly due to a comedy lie to one other lie, she becomes the real person she should always be. I can not imagine anyone in this quiet but deep role. <br /> <br /> Films like these can be enjoyed at face value and seen as escapist fun - a product of their time - or seen for their deep symbolism, which, like its title, is deeply ingrained. It's a tricky movie, just as Hawn and Bergman's performance is equally tricky, because when they seem so simple, without flower and pose, they do not come out and announce what it's all about. Her acting becomes "not really acting", but playing real people, warts and everything. CACTUS FLOWER is a story that never seems too serious but turns out to be deep and very human.
