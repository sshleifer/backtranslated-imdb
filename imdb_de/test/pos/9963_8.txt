Venice in 1596.Jews is separated from the good Christians.Bassanio, a young but poor Venetian, loves beautiful Portia, who is a wealthy heiress. So he approaches his friend, a merchant called Antonio, for three thousand ducats to travel to Belmont I suggest Portia. All ships and goods of Antonio are employed on the high seas. So he turns to the money-lender Shylock, the Jewish faith. Shylock does not like Antonio because he spat in his face. He gives Antonio a three-month loan of no interest, but if he does not pay the money during that time he will own a pound of his flesh. Shylock's daughter Jessica also flees with the Christian Lorenzo. The Merchant of Venice is based on William Shakespeare's play, which was probably written between 1596 and 1598. I read the play last summer and now I have seen the movie made in 2004 by Michael Radford. I liked the piece, and I agree with the allegations that it is anti-Semitic, not quite The Jewish character does not even appear as an inhuman monster, even though he is willing to cut a piece of Antonio Meat. His character is very deep, which is all expressed in his speech, where he asks: "If you sting us, do not we bleed?" and so on. There are many more people in Shylock's character than in one of Antonio spitting on the good Jews. Al Pacino is unbeatable as a Shylock. He gives such a strong performance. Jeremy Irons is as great as Antonio.Lynn Collins Most beautiful and brilliant in the role of Portia.Zuleikha Robinson does an excellent job as Jessica, and Charlie Cox as Lorenzo is also very good. Krris Marshall plays Gratiano and he does a good job. In the role of Nerissa we see Heather Goldenhersh. Mackenzie Crook plays Launcelot Gobbo. As usually played in Shakespeare, this one also contains a most brilliant dialogue. The film draws a fantastic representation of the era. He treats some great Shakespear-style topics.
