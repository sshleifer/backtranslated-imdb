I think it's the kind of movie you either love or hate, and I'm not really the guy that's interested in arty movies. My mother recently rented "mullhuland DR" and I almost ran out of the room, ha. But I love this movie. <br /> <br /> We recorded "The Beat" one night while we were running the tape and by chance got a great movie. The tape saved and much viewed. Finally, I got the VHS to add to my collection. I have looked at it many times and written off the poems at some point. I even tried to prepare a scene for my high school acting class. She had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words. She refused to allow me. If it could upset my drama teacher so much that it has to be good :) Honestly, she never treated me like that after that. <br /> <br /> I really liked the acting, which became very honest and honest. It was not clean and polished, but it was better than that. It was lifelike, as someone would really behave and show emotions, not like Hollywood. It was great to act, especially by the guy who played Rex. <br /> <br /> The story was original. The characters are not only drawn into his world, but you as well. Not your typical person meets children from the city center and saves them through knowledge films. Just caring and friendly make things a bit better. The only thing is that even in the 80s there was more gun violence and less basic things like throwing stones, but that little bit of innocence did not matter. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must. You either love it or hate it, but either way it makes an impression and that makes a good movie that you will remember later.
