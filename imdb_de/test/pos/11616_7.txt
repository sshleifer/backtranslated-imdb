Well, one can say for sure that subconscious cruelty is a funny movie! Subconscious Cruelty, an alleged glimpse of the human mind, includes four macabre and bizarre tales of the extreme. The first segment called 'Ovarian Eyeball' is really just a warm-up, but it's good that it gives the viewer an idea of ​​what he expects from the next three segments. It just looks like a naked woman is lying on a table while another woman is cutting her belly and pulling out a human eyeball! I have no idea what it is about, but it is certainly suitable for visceral vision. The following story is the best of the bunch and picks up on the "old favorite" problem of Inzest's sick movie. The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. He is repelled by her pregnancy - yet he still wants to have sex with her and he understands it, of course. This story is characterized by the monotonous and factual narrative as well as by the end, which does not fail the shocks. This segment is well played, well filmed and easily the highlight of the subconscious mind. <br /> <br /> Of course the next two sections are not as good as the second; So the only way out of there is down, but director Karim Hussain still manages to pull something out of the bag before the movie ends. However, he does not do it right away because the third segment is the weakest of the movie and many people just have sex with the floor. It is very surreal and therefore memorable for the same reason; But it does not seem to make much sense, and after the second part I felt like something more morbid. However, the movie ends with a high, because I am not sure what it was about - the last segment contains the best images of the film. This segment focuses on religion and certainly not for those who appreciate it! Director Karim Hussain has achieved something here. Since this collection of four "extreme" stories does not come together to form a whole, the film feels almost tasteless as it is filmed in such an eloquent and eye-catching way. The director seemed to have imitated the highly respected surreal director Luis Buñuel, albeit with bits and pieces, rape and incest; And if you ask me, he has not done a bad job at all. Not for everyone, but definitely worth a look for extreme fanatics!
