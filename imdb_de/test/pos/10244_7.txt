I think those who have previously been in a one-sided relationship will be able to identify with the main character Minako (Yuko Tanaka), a 50-year-old woman who is still in good health as her daily routine reveals the grinding routine Waking up extremely early in the morning to prepare for her milk delivery, where she has to haul megam bottles in a bag in a route through her city like a clockwork, exchange empty bottles for full and collect must issue payment and receipt. And there is always a delivery stop that is at the top and has to climb up a long flight of stairs to achieve customer satisfaction. And actually enough that this stop was a delivery stop, a man she fell in love with almost all her teenage years into adult life and did not appreciate the product, but poured down the sink. After going to the same school, we see that they do not talk to each other and are physically so close in their daily lives, but so far away. There is no eye contact, except for casual glances and little acknowledgment of the other's existence. We learn that they share a past that was likely to destroy all the notions of being together, and that the attraction between the two was clearly hampered by the previous generation. <br /> <br /> While I thought Minako was an interesting woman in herself, who had suppressed her feelings for so long, one can only wonder what damage he would do. If I've read that the Japanese original title means "At some times the days when you read books," and it's right, I felt the film had a wonderful finale with this recording of their well-stocked bookshelf, which probably alluding to her not being alone after that - they all probably retired on their crutches to cope with the pain of being alone and back to a lifestyle she'd been used to for 50 years. In addition to immersing herself in two jobs, she has those books that serve as a kind of escapism, and occasionally keeps small, sweet things to song dedication shows on the radio. <br /> <br /> Yuko Tanaka did a commendable job as an Emotional Powerful woman dedicated herself to her destiny and her decision to love no other, her object of affection, Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), was a more interesting character more facets. True to the marriage vows, he spends much of his time caring for his sick, bedridden wife (played by Akiko Nishina) while juggling his job as a social worker in the Department of Children's Affairs at City Hall. I felt that the childless couple's job provided him with a means to look after his own, not his own, but the children of others, the cares that are neglected and left to themselves. In a rare moment of anger, we see him scolding insanely miserable parents who do not appreciate and waste the lives of their children. <br /> <br /> The Story of Kenji Aoki Delivers Quirks to Address and Address Their Characters They have successfully tried to give them further insights and dimensions, such as: For example, how Takanashi is a hopeless haiku poet, even though he is a member of the haiku club, and minor characters like the old Minagawa couple whom Masao (Koichi Ueda) lent to. Some funny, though sad, moments as he slowly became senile while Ms. Toshiko (Misako Watanabe), 50 years old, tells the story of a single woman's love story. Even Akiko Nishina's appearance as a bedridden woman with her character was a capture enlightened state of knowing her husband's past and making unselfish and painful decisions in her ailing state. <br /> <br /> It's what you can expect from a typical Japanese romantic movie, without young devotees posing as star-cros lovers, but with all the other elements like romantic setups, love songs and content-wise restrained ones but loving behavior. I thought the story was in danger of leaving the beaten track behind when an unrequited love was performed, but director Akira Ogata managed to avoid the usual melodramatic moments in such stories, though the story is an obvious evolution of the storyline That's what you can predict in the final act, especially if you're way beyond your Romance Movie 101. <br /> <br /> Since this is not your average love story, I thought the Milkmaid was telling a strong story with unrequited love as a central theme. And frankly, a recommended romance (albeit narrated at a measured pace) if you are in the mood to have bittersweet love, to remember and live without regret.
