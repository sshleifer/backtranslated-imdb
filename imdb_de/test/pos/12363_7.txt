I have just watched this movie for the first time and have to say that I am very impressed. <br /> <br /> How dark. How desperate. Like nightmarish. Incredible. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, several scenes are anchored in my mind ... the first appearance of the phantom car ... the soul of David Holm as he rises from his dead body ... continues to plead his spirit to his knees , <br /> <br /> This film tells a simple story - that of the ghostly driver of the Phantom Carriage, who is condemned to collect the souls of the dead for a year, and then uses flashbacks to explain how David Holm in his Predicament device. <br /> <br /> I would love it if it were released on DVD so it could see more. Everyone should.
