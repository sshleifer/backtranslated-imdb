In many ways, the cinematic career of independent filmmaker John Cassavetes is the exact opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock, the absolute studio director. While Hitchcock treated his actors infamously as cattle, Cassavetes tried to improvise with them. Where each element is flawlessly composed in a Hitchcock shot, Cassavetes cares less about the way a scene is composed figuratively than about the feeling or what it emotionally conveys. Hitchcock's stories were always first actions, with the human element being depicted in the background. Cassavetes puts the human experience in each of his films in the foreground. If some things do not make much sense logically, then so be it. <br /> <br /> You can already see that from his first movie, 1959's Shadows, shot on a shoe-sized budget of $ 40,000 in Manhattan, at Cassavetes' Acting Workshop, using a 16mm handheld camera Repertory Company and touted as improvisational film. The story is rather simple as it traces the lives of three black siblings of Manhattanites - Benny (Ben Carruthers) - a trumpeter and no, Hugh (Hugh Hurd) - a washed-up singer and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) - the younger sister of both. The film's three main arcs are about Hugh's failures as a night-beater and his friendship with his manager Rupert (Rupert Crosse); Benny's stories about Manhattan with his two unfriendly colleagues; and Lelia's love life - first with a white boy Tony (Anthony Ray), who does not recognize the race with fair-skinned Lelia, even after putting her to bed; then with the stiff and neat Davey (Davey Jones), who may be a misogynist. <br /> <br /> Not much happens in the first sheet, except dark-skinned Hugh has to write about how dejected he feels singing in lower-class nightclubs and opening shows for girls. He dreams of making it big in New York or even in Paris, but it's fair to say he's the guy who continues to be fooled by his meager abilities. Once, when we actually hear him sing, he shows that he is a marginal talent at best. The fact that Rupert always encourages him gives us insight into how destructive friendships work. But that's the least important of the three bows. While this movie is generally better than Martin Scorsese's first film, a decade later, Who's That Knocking At My Door? - another story about failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers -, he has neither the brilliant moments that speak in terms of acting or the cinematography - that has the film. Nor is it naturalistic, for naturalism in art is a very difficult undertaking, especially in film, although the exterior facades of 1950's Manhattan at ground level are a jewel that one can relive. Although Shadows may indeed be an important film in the history of the independent film cycle, he is by no means near a great movie. Parts of it are preaching, badly played, scenes end arbitrarily, almost like dimming sketches, and sometimes they seem to be cut off in the middle. All in all, it's a very sloppy job - especially the gruesome jazz score, which often does not match the rest of the movie, because Cassavetes has proved that as a director, at least in his first movie, he was a good actor. The only reason for anyone to see Shadows is that Cassavetes eventually got better with later movies. This gives an indication of his later working style. The National Film Registry rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as 'culturally significant'. This is consistent with the creed of art that Cassavetes had long claimed, as this quote makes clear: "I have never seen an exploding helicopter. I've never seen anyone who has gone and blown someone's head off. Why should I make films about it? But I've seen people destroy themselves in the least possible way. I saw people withdraw. I've seen people hiding behind political ideas, behind drugs, behind the sexual revolution, behind fascism, behind hypocrisy, and I've done all these things myself. So I can understand you. What we say is so gentle. It is meekness. We have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems. That this film is "culturally significant" is true, but this truth is not synonymous with being "artistically significant." In the difference between these two definitions, great art really thrives.
