Running Out of Time is somewhere in the middle of the gun of Johnny To in the category "solid good". As a thriller, it's not particularly original or overwhelming, and the action scenes will not blow you away, but it has something else to offer. It's a Johnny To movie that does exist. Andy Lau has 72 hours to live. He decides to play a strange cat-and-mouse game with a HK police hostage negotiator, played by Lau Ching Wan. That's the plot in a nutshell. In addition, layers of turns and phrases pile up, which make the process consistently interesting. It sometimes becomes too cumbersome for its own sake, but never lets it make the most of it. Just as Johnny To is about to deliver a sleek and well-made crime film (which, let's face it, a dozen dozen), he breaks into pieces that bring Running Out of Time to life. Emotional experience, the soul and heart for that well oiled skeleton offers. <br /> <br /> The concepts of synchronism and minimalism (staple foods in his work) are explored here with great effect. Always subtle, letting the pictures speak for themselves, giving them time to develop with long takes and slow tracking shots, exemplary cutting to the score, everything is here. A little love story in a bus between Andy Lau and a girl is one of the highlights of the movie and part of the "heart" I'm talking about. So simple and yet so powerful. The same applies to the car scenes of Lau and Lau Ching Wan and the showdown of the bowling room. <br /> <br /> However, something prevents me from claiming that Out of Time is a masterpiece. All has all the skills and craftsmanship to get to the point, but sometimes it can be too hardworking or bland. When he is well, he is really good. There are even isolated moments of pure brilliance that are just too good for themselves and leave a bittersweet aftertaste on the rest of the movie. I'm convinced he can make a really great movie if he puts his heart on it. This is another of his films that is flawed but fun. Under the smooth HK style it is the black humor and the intimate drama that makes this film a captivating film. Worth seeing, definitely.
