A short and entertaining noir set in Vienna shortly after W.W.11. Donald Buka is a refugee who finds no legal work because he has no papers. No papers mean no work permit, ie no passport. He survives by driving a friend's taxi at night. If he gets caught, that means three months in jail. One night, he picks up a ticket at a large hotel and drives the man to an airline office. Buka picks up the man's luggage and returns to the car. There he finds out that his customer has acquired an unneeded hole in the back of his mind. What should I do? Call the police? Without a work permit, they will quickly grasp it. No, he needs time to think about it. He drives to a remote spot, emptying the man's pockets and hiding the body. He now has an American passport and a lot of cash! He passes an Underworld contact to change the passport photo. Now all he has to do is go to the man's hotel and pick up the man's plane ticket. His ticket to freedom! That would be too easy, of course. In the hotel awaits the lover of the dead Joan Camden. Camden is on the run from her rather unpleasant husband Francis Lederer, Lederer is of course the pig who had shot down the man in Buka's taxi. Camden calls the police because she thinks Buka robbed her lover. Buka shows his new passport and manages to get out of the mess. Camden collapses when his husband Lederer turns up at the police station. Lederer is convinced that Camden has suffered a nervous breakdown and is being released to him. She escapes again, finds Buka and the two decide to leave the country together. Lederer reappears and Buka has to decide if Camden is worth his freedom. This movie is much better than letting it sound. Buka is best known as the murderous police murderer in the 1950s "Between Midnight and Dawn". The film was produced by actor Turhan Bey.
