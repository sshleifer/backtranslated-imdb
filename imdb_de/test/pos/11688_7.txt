If you enjoyed this movie, you should look at other Hrebejk directors - you will do something good. Unfortunately this is not his best, but still a million times better than an average movie from mainstream cinema. It explores relationships, especially the abusive, has both strong and sweet moments and good acting. Some discrepancies, clich√©s and hollow moments affect the overall effect. To the previous reviewer and his comments on the Czech psyche: an interesting approach, but I do not see that this film becomes a Czech blockbuster. These people are pretty spoiled by their filmmakers (look at the stuff of Sverak, Gedeon) and they are a bit retarded.
