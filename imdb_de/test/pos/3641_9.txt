If you're looking for a fake Hollywood action movie, this is not for you. If you are looking for the truth, hire or buy them. From a true story, the film attempts to capture the heart of what happened in South Africa (and many other places), pianist, "Schindler's List" or "Nuremberg". Millions of people today have no idea what apartheid is or even exist. This film can help them learn and they can even dig deeper.
