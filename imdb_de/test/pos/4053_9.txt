Like so many modern US movies, the storyline has to contain a supernatural element, but if you just let it go, it's a story of great charm and a friendly heart in a crab shell. <br /> <We see a scene in a city in an economically depressed area, trying to find something to look forward to. Beau Bridges's character is on the rise of a family, a zero-balance and a brother-in-law sold to a big business chain he secretly hates, but who is ready to rub Beau's nose. D'Onofrio finds his superficial Bubba lifestyle tense as he has to take care of his "blessed" little brother Joey, and he itches to escape the shackles of this dead city. Her boss's business closes (much against his will) for lack of new customers and he is haunted by memories of his father as he builds the suspense to his own attempt at self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Joey, who seemed to embody the curse in her life, died at sea - presumably drowned - in an unusual accident. His miraculous restoration by the Portuguese trawler people whose boat they had just built and launched (perhaps a symbol of an angelic garrison) is the sign they have been waiting for, and they all decide to throw one last litter. <br /> In this work, there is a beautiful, brooding mood that stands out, keeping our attention as brilliant as 'The Shipping News'. There are also other parallels to the later works, which give the impression of a remake. I like 'Signs of Life' for its simpler, less-invented story and star performances by actors who work on their craft instead of being seen as stars.
