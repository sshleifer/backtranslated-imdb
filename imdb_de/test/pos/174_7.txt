I can not believe that I have seldom seen this title of all the horror horrors of the eighties, and I definitely will not be present to all my reviewers to say that 'Bloody Birthday' is terrible. On the contrary, I really liked it and was pleasantly surprised at how awesome and surprising it is. Do not call this movie "another 80s butcher" because the victims here are unlikely and the killers too. We are introduced to three Cherubian-looking teenagers, all of whom were born during a solar eclipse. The moment they were delivered, the planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon, and therefore the children are emotionless and seemingly without conscience. This really starts to go around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless back and forth. <br /> <br /> Granted, this stuff is incredibly far-fetched and even offensive, but seriously, who cares? Unlike many other horror movies from this period, it tries to bring at least something original and imaginative. For once the children's play is good and the entire movie has a scary atmosphere and grizzly music. The killing sequences are bleak and tense, and it's always scary to see them being committed by angel faces. I do not know who hired the three kids, but they did a good job. Especially the girl and the child with glasses are very memorable. The bleak images of the heartless trio are reminiscent of classic highlights such as "Village of the Damned", "The Bad Seed" and "Children of the Damned". This movie is not nearly as memorable as these milestones, but great fun and no horror lover will regret seeing it. <br /> <br /> Bloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not the greatest genius in the cinema, but a pleasantly confused guy who brought us incredibly entertaining cheesefests like The Brain and Starship Invasions. If all that is not enough to convince you, Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not some nudity, but a topless dance act by MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh, and keep your eyes open for a totally unnecessary cameo by Joe Penny, later star of the TV series "Jake and the Fatman." Listen!!
