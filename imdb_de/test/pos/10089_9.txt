Disguised as an Asian horror, "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is actually a complex psychological drama that immerses the viewer in the problems of a seemingly normal family. I was really surprised at the depth of this movie. Director Ji-woon Kim's decision to focus more on storytelling than on cheap horrors has proved to be the right one. The creation of one of the most ingenious new horror films. <br /> <br /> "A Tale Of Two Sisters" tells the story, as the name suggests, two sisters Su-mi and the younger Su-yeon, who spent time after lingering In a psychiatric ward you return to her father and seemingly abusive stepmother back. From then on, we observe how the sisters handle the gradual aggression and erratic behavior of their stepmother. To say what would happen next would be to spoil the whole experience. So I'll just leave it at that. <br /> <br /> The story is very close. Beautifully painted with the characters. Ji-woon Kim's focus on a small cast provides a much more detailed view of her and her relationships. In addition, each of the four leading actors has a very different role and type of character. From the protective Su-mi, the weaker Su-yeon, the visibly uninterested father to the angry and later deadly behavior of the stepmother. There is a great mystery in which many acts have not been revealed to the very end, and even then the film leaves much room for interpretation. Even if he has looked at it all, the viewer will be forced to revisit it at least once to gain a better understanding of it. The actors fit perfectly with their roles. It is especially difficult to create strong, emotional scenes in psychological films, but it is a great pleasure to be able to create them. This is a prime example of such a feat. Ji-woon Kim's direction is slow and enthralling, building up suspense for the film's horrific scenes. While few of them are strong and frankly terrifying moments. Cinematography and film music are first-rate and help to create an atmosphere that matches that of a psychological film. <br /> <br /> "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is a demonstration in which the horror genre is actually so much more than just a simple driving pleasure. With its strong focus on character and mystery, this is a complex movie that can easily tempt you to watch it again and again just so you can understand it better.
