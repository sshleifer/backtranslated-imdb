Ok, when I rented that a few years ago, I had the worst expectations. Yes, the acting is not great and the picture itself seems outdated, but when I sat there, something strange happened. I started to like it. The action is great and there are some scenes that make you jump. Brion James, along with Bruce Campbell, perhaps one of the best B-class actors, is great as always. The story is not bad either. Now I would not hurry and buy it, but you will not waste your time, at least to watch this good b-grade post apocalyptic western.
