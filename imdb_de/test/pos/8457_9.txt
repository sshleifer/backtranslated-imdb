The first thing you see in this movie is a static angle (one that will be repeated later in the movie) that represents the chaos that takes place (unseen for the audience) in a studio broadcasting news. Soon after, the typical story of Fonda is shown in the same perspective. Do not be misled. The film is not about a reporter, a woman who strives to succeed in a male-dominated profession. This is just an introduction, a way to start the movie (though it will be used later). The actual point of this production is gradually revealed, and the first we see of it is in a deliberately long scene at an early stage. The entire movie has that pace; not slow or tedious, but deliberate. It's never really fast, even in the few sequences you would normally expect. This pace (especially because it appears to slow down further when the plot is revealed as the disturbing, disturbing nature of the film is unclear) is strong and almost painful to the viewer. It inspires you to jump into the screen when you can, to grab those responsible by the collar and yell at them to do something about it to improve the situation. I never once felt like getting up or taking my eyes off the screen for a moment. The theme is extremely important to know, and it is treated perfectly here. No over-dramatization (well ... at least little), just a precise representation of the problem. The direction is amazing. The empathy for Lemmons character is profound. The cut is masterful ... a scene at the end shows that perfectly. The editor is, according to his filmography to judge, greatly underestimated. The writing was excellent. The show was great, especially by Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas (who also produced it). The lack of a score is perfect. No music is needed to improve. The end is sublime and effective. The film has a few negative points ... among them, part of the dialogue is obviously and undeniably mainly exposure, a certain part of the film, while dramatically does not seem to be something that follows something that follows it. Not everyone will see the movie because of two characteristics that are usually (and rightly so) attributed to bad movies. the tempo (which can be understood as a slow error) and the (missing) score. It could be argued that this is a negative thing, since everyone should take into account the points he brings, but perhaps it is better that way; Dealing with the heavy topic with intelligence and respect (for both the subject and the viewer) ... something like that, maybe it should not be fed with a spoon. I was intrigued by the movie and was very surprised. I recommend it to anyone who thinks they are strong enough to deal with it. 9.10
