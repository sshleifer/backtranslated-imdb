What's your damn problem? Do not you have anything better to do than sit on your big ass and blog about how you find something in bad taste? Here's an idea: Get out. That's right: go out of your mother's basement where you've been living for 13 years, and GO OUT. "But I can not leave Star Trek running in 30 minutes and I still have not married this avatar on World Of Warcraft!" Oh my god, stay inside! Okay, I might have gone overboard there. I mean, Star Trek is okay, but I do not watch it that much anymore. In any case, you really have to write crap about Mind of Mencia. It's a good show. Maybe you're just dropping your anger because this girl threw you on World of Warcraft. Or you are constipated. Try fiber in your diet.
