George Barry's "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is basically a dark fairy tale told through a horror movie frame. It's one of the best films of the '70s in my opinion, and it's downright criminal that the image was essentially stolen and distributed without Barry's knowledge (those responsible for this theft should be put to bed as soon as possible). If you're looking for some open blood or rabid action, "Death Bed" is not the movie for you. "Death Bed" is a gentler, shrill drive-in image; it's like a completely strange dream that he only half remembers. I recommend reading Stephen Thrower's summary of "Death Bed" in Thrower's FAB Press book "Nightmare USA" (he describes the atmosphere of the movie perfectly). Whether intentional or not, I have noticed everything from "phantasm" films, from Michele Soavi's "Cemetery Man" to magical realism / slipstream fiction by authors like Kelly Link, Shadow of the "Death Bed". Barry is an original and in a fair world, I'm sure he was following Death Bed with a series of fantastically bizarre films.
