Warning: If the Coen Brothers or David Lynch define your taste in the movie, ignore this review and move on. <br /> <br /> Yes. This film, among other virtues, emphasizes the role that character plays in the lives of honorable people. This movie is full of honest, decent people, and they have integrity to protect. In short, they have "character". <br /> <br /> A little nitpick: If you do not know the history of World War II, you probably do not know that, from Captain Correlli's arrival on the island to the fall of Mussolini, three and a half years have passed. The average viewer might think that the romance was a whirlwind. It's not like this. The romance develops slowly, giving it dignity and meaning. The intentional pace of the film may be the way the director sets the time. Some reviews have criticized Cage's Italian accent. The Italian-speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The story was just right. Yes, the Germans turned against their Italian allies, who for the most part were hesitant allies from the start. If you find that shocking, remember that the French Mediterranean fleet was blown up by the British in 1940 shortly after the capitulation of France, so that it would not fall into the hands of the Vichy government or even the Nazis Being educated and cultivated was a compliment to an educated and civilized civilization. <br /> <br /> This movie was beautifully photographed and its story was lyrical. The script was not thought-provoking or wise, but here was a situation where confusion and prudence were not needed and were not appropriate. <br /> <br /> The story is tender and the message uplifting. The characters are honest, courageous, serious, sympathetic and personable. It's a nice little movie. 8.10. <br /> <br /> <br />
