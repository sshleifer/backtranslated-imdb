I work in a movie theater and every Thursday night we have a co-worker showing a movie that comes out the next day ... Today it was The Guardian. I've seen the trailers and the commercial and never expected much, and I did not expect to see this movie in any way. It turned out that this movie was much more than I thought. It was a great story at first. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner have done amazing acting in this film. Since I'm a big fan of That 70's show, it's always been hard for me to think of Kutcher as anyone but Kelso, despite his great acting in The Butterfly Effect. But after seeing this movie, I might consider it a serious actor. <br /> <br /> It was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the US Coast Guard.
