- A band of bandits robbing a train of the gold shipment it carries. During their escape, the bandits separated. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he can speak. Three men have another part of the "clue" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit and the bounty hunter work together to find the missing loot? Or are they killing themselves first? - The plot is an obvious start of Leone's good, evil and ugly. Various scenes in the film were also taken from other films by Leone, Corbucci and others. But for me, this is done in a way that shows no disrespect for the original work. Instead, Any Gun Can Play lovingly parodies some of the biggest movies in Western spaghetti history. The opening scene, in which three men ride into the city, and the last meeting of the three main stars are a wonderful homage to the SWs that had come before - the reflection in the spilled wine, the stranger's entrance with the bright red background and the playful Way in which the gold is discovered in the end. Although incredible, many fight scenes are well staged and directed. Especially two fight scenes (the market fight and the bathing fight) are very well done. He is also not afraid to try different things with his camera. Tight close-ups, overhead shots and shots around corners are common in Any Gun Can Play. <br /> <br /> - Another asset is the cast that Castellari had to work with. George Hilton is always good at these movies. Gilbert Roland literally plays Gilbert Roland. And SW newcomer Edd Byrnes asserts himself with the two SW veterans. Supporting performers include SW director Gerard Herter. <br /> <br /> - Every litter can not be taken too seriously. You will find nice humor throughout the movie. If this is possible with a SW, it is more of a feel-good movie - reminiscent of some of the Terence Hill / Bud Spencer films.
