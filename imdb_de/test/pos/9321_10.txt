I really enjoyed this movie. I found it very entertaining to capture the romance of turn-of-the-century Irish-American culture. There are no messages. There is no violence and no overt sex, just healthy 1947-style entertainment and Dennis Morgan had the opportunity to sing some really good songs. A really good movie.
