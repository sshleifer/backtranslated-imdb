A pretty silly little movie that you can just love. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a bit cheesy and clich√©, it still works and makes it tidy. Five teams are involved in the scavenger hunt, fighting each other and with their brains to win the All-Night contest - just for the sheer pleasure of "knowing that your team is the best." David Naughton's first feature film after Dr. Pepper "Be a Pepper" and before his big 1981 hit "American Werewolf in London". Paul Ruebens is also featured in the film, which I believe has made his first Pee Wee Herman-esquire role a year before he was known. And last but not least, Mr. Spin City and Alex Keaton himself, Michael J. Fox, gets his first movie role here. Fans will remember Stephen Furst as the Flounder in Animal House. Apart from no names, but all the funny characters. <br /> <br /> No doubt it has ever made a DVD, but there are likely to be a few more VHS copies that are on a late, late show at some point. If you do, it's worth your watch. You may hate it, but it could also be a quirky little movie you'll love.
