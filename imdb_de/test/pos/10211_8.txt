I doubt that the true story of Western Union's development ever reached a true audience. Instead of talking about building the telegraph system in the West, it was the story of boardrooms dominated by one of the most interesting (and not beloved) of the big "robber barons": Jay Gould. Gould picked up the fighting company and turned it into a communication giant - and part of his attempt at a national rail system that could compete with Vanderbilt. This is interesting, but not as exciting as the story of laying the telegraph lines. At least that's what the audience would think. Jay Gould died in 1892. Had he lived in modern times and invested in Hollywood, he probably would have agreed with this assessment. <br /> <br /> The film is about endangering the laying of the Telegraph system of Indians, fueled by a Jack Slade (Barton MacLane). Slade, a desperado, is not satisfied with the development of a communication system that will certainly limit his ability to bypass police in the territories. He stands in front of the man responsible for laying the telegraph lines, Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Creighton's associate Richard Blake (Robert Young) and a quasi-lawyer Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), who is Slade's brother. Blake, an Easterner with little understanding of the West, spends Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but finds it hard to get used to his new environment. But he has become a close friend of Shaw, especially when he tries to confront Slade. <br /> <br /> By the way, Slade was a real Western criminal and the subject of a section of Mark Twain's ROUGHING IT. He was hanged in the 1870s. However, he was not involved in raising Indians against railways or telegraph companies. MacLane, however, makes him a memorable evil and totally evil guy. His murder of one of the main characters happens suddenly and from behind - and he sees the corpse as if it had just been released from a hassle. But Lang is just as responsible as other touches. Check out the sequence with Chill Wills, where he's on a telegraph pole to fix it. He spits tobacco juice several times as he talks to Young, who is a little spattered. Then there is an Indian attack that we observe from the ground. Finally, Young is suddenly spattered again, but it's not brown, it's red. He looks up to the top of the pole, and there's Wills with an Indian arrow through him. <br /> <br /> It's an exciting movie that you can see and worth a visit.
