Okay, I'll say it. This movie made me laugh so much that it hurt. This statement may offend some of you who think that this movie is nothing but a waste of film. But most people do not know that this movie should be bad and cheerful. I mean, did people actually think a movie about a killer snowman should be a masterpiece? Look at the "scary" hologram on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer. Instead, the movie turned out to be like the original Jack Frost (which I found just as funny) as an exciting journey into the depths of the grainy dialogues, bad deposits and terrible special effects. And it's all done to make us viewers laugh. It certainly worked for me. <br /> <br /> For example: Anne Tiler (to her troubled husband): What makes you so cumbersome when you frown? <br /> <br /> If this dialogue is not right make you laugh, then you have serious problems. Who would pronounce these words in real life? Of course nobody, because it should sound ridiculous! Take a movie with an open mind and low expectations, and hopefully you'll see what's so funny about Jack Frost 2.
