I stumbled on this movie during the canal surfing and was blown away. It was aired in a lesser known short film program here in Australia. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I was so impressed with a movie, especially so short. <br /> <br /> The power of history, the quality of acting and the breathtaking cinematography ... wow. If available, this would be a very valuable addition to my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> I'm certainly impressed and looking forward to Joshua Leonard's next film. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary experience 10/10
