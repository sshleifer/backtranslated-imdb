This DVD is usually sold for around $ 20. I would not pay so much for the DVD if I had known what I would get, but still this is a pretty good disc. It shows the knot in all its glory, with footage from their concerts ... and surfacing, among others , Wait and Bleed and Scissors, including the "Spit It Out" music video that was apparently banned by MTV. <br /> <br /> For those who do not know, Slipknot is essentially a symphony of the damned: nine masked men who show total chaos on stage, with machine-gun drums, squeaky guitar and vocals that tear your face off and on You will want to leave more. For those who have never seen Slipknot, I can not recommend enough that you get this DVD ... probably from eBay or Amazon, so you can get a better deal. <br /> <br /> A short but well-done show of knots. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten.
