This was one of those movies I would always come across (be it on TV or on a cheap DVD), but I never felt like trying because I thought I did not miss much. It was one night and I thought, well? why not. A good decision, because I would blame myself for taking so long to get there. For me it has impressed me as it is with the best features of Burt Reynold ('Deliverance', 'White Lightning' and 'Boogie Nights') up there and back to those 70s / 80s that are not afraid to be clueless to be obscure and to pave the way, to build up characters, to pack with realistic brutal power and effectively involve the local places (here Atlanta is the case) with grounded photography. In certain colors it somehow reminded me of 'Dirty Harry', but that's easy. However, it's a cheeky blues score with boiling kicks, funky shifts, and unadorned sounds. I had to think of Lalo Schifrin's pulsing score, which he orchestrated for 'Dirty Harry'. The music soundtrack, on the other hand, is a hit or a failure. <br /> <br /> Sgt. Tom Sharky was an Atlantic narcotic before he slipped during a bust when he was demoted to truck work. Together with his new cadre, they come across a prostitution ring that arouses their interest because he is in possession of a hard-to-prosecute man responsible for prosecuting criminals. What they are digging up concerns a prominent government figure and a call girl who can give them some important names, but they need to contact her before she sets herself. Burt Reynold's deeds, as well as directors A relentlessly solid and muscular fashion that would fit in with his laconically hard-hitting performance and Gerald Di Pego's thematically hard-nosed and tense script (taken from William Diehl's novel). Well, he's showing some heartfelt / insightful thoughts in this armor in the scenes involving British Brit Rachel Ward, whether it's the staking scenes when he's watching her (and slowly falling in love with her) from another building coming finally together, but these latter interactions slow the momentum, but give a hit like blows. The performances are pretty accurate as Reynold has formulated a great relationship with the extraordinary actors Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Brian Keith, Richard Libertini and Bernie Casey. The crushing profanity and the funny dialogues between these guys were a great time. As for the corrupt bad guys, Vittorio Gassman builds impressive strength and power, but it's Henry Silva (who seems to have been born for those roles) who is icy, cunning, and unstoppable. Where his appearance seems to describe the things that will come and help them to assemble. In addition, his adrenaline-filled and violent cat and mouse climax with Sharky and his team has done extremely well. <br /> <br /> The exciting action passages may be quick and dry, yet deadly violent, like an immense series of interrogations. Some practical, old-fashioned film techniques add to the excitement. The intriguing material makes the character seem pretty tactical, but if we think that sailing is going smoothly, it offers one or two dull surprises and fierce confrontations.
