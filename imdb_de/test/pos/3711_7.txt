This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to the small town of Tennessee in December 1941, a big collector's item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and older brother Pete decide to sign up. He gives his little brother, Willie, his prize egg and sets off to show his little acolyte more emotion and tenderness. Well, Willie does not care if Pete can be a soldier. He goes to Memphis and shows his persistence and determination as he leads the way in the lead of several adults. After finding the convocation center in Memphis, he asks to see his brother pulling a knife at a lieutenant and injuring him. We experience the devotion and love of a little brother (Jonathan Furr). He has shown impeccable performance as a stubborn, strong-willed boy in the gentler days of yesteryear. The film tries to show, and most of the time, how brothers can show devotion and how important family ties are in youth. When the two brothers reunite briefly, the film gives a cathartic cry, while fraternal love surrounds us all. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a cold bottle of water. Maybe Dasani or Aquafina, good, clear water with an aromatic mineral pack, but no pure natural spring water like Evian. Yet it quenches your thirst and you do not doubt purity and extinction. It is more mill running and less expensive than others, but does the work and leaves a refreshment and detoxification. 10.7
