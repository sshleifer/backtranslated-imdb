The wealthy businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick) accidentally kills his daughter's hippie friend after a quarrel. In a panic, he retreats to a bar and meets Joe Curran (played by Peter Boyle): a furious bigot bitter about how his beloved country has become. Unintentionally, Bill lets Joe find out he's just killed a hippie. And thats just the beginning. "Joe" is a classic film of an unusual friendship. A link between two men, one with a white background, the other with a blue background. Bill and Joe have one thing in common: they are embarrassed about how crazy the world has become. Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle have both portrayed their characters very realistically. Director John G. Avidsen uses this "Pre-Rocky" approach to lead this gem with the same finesse as a movie with a budget of $ 100 million. The script is equipped with an outstanding character development and a very fast, realistic dialogue. Despite its strengths, this film has its weaknesses. The script sleeps about 3/4 of the way, but wakes up just in time for the shocking climax. This film also features a very early and boring performance of a 24-year-old Susan Sarandon as Bill's daughter Melissa, along with her hippie friend Frank, who is played very gently by Patrick McDermott. One could only be thankful that he was killed early in the film. Despite its few shortcomings, this is one of the forgotten films of the 70s that should not be. Although "Joe" is very much modeled on today's standards, the chemistry between Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle is completely relevant today, and it's the glue that holds the whole movie together.
