Opera begins with a close-up view of the constantly observing eye of a bird and thus begins one of the most bizarre and enjoyable features of Argento (my second favorite behind Deep Red). Granted, sometimes the movie is pretty absurd (the lack of real worries about killing, the bird attack, the burnt dummy, the end ??), but this is the fantastic world of Argento, and if you accept it, you'll find it , that it works. However, I do not want to completely reject these mistakes, but rather that the art of the film more than makes up for them. For example, the aforementioned bird attack is theoretically completely exaggerated, but look at the wonderful execution; Crows flying in chaos, adding their furious shrieks to the impulsive rock beat, the crowd in a panic, seen through the circling camera work from a bird's eye view, and then the focused attack; Aria of terror indeed. Argento's astonishing, flowing cinematography is completely on display in Opera and clearly a highlight of the film. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of opera and rock music, a nice contrast between the music and anyone who uses it effectively (the rock hits the murders in perfect timing and gives the scenes a very insane feeling). The sound effects also deserve a nod, stitches, scissors, beaks and all. Inspector Alan Santini: "I've seen a lot of films Yes, you're really an expert I'd be very happy to hear your opinion." <br /> <br / Marco: "I find it unwise to use films as a guide not Inspector? "<br /> <br /> Inspector Alan Santini:" Depends on what you mean by reality. " <br /> <br /> Since this is a giallo, stylish murders are a must and Dario will not let you down (the "bullet through the door") is probably one of the biggest deaths ever shot Pun. The black-gloved, deep-voiced, throbbing killer (cool shots!) Is cold and brutal, and it was a nice touch to stick it under our heroine's eyes so she was forced to watch the murders. As a giallo, Opera has anything but a mystery as it should. The killer will be kept secret from the onlookers well enough, but there is little effort in the film to deal with the killings. This and the strange end could have needed more work. Despite these problems, Opera still manages to be a rewarding and satisfying horror movie. One final note: It was nice to see a movie showing the right view through binoculars (just one circle), not two circles together! Nice eye for detail, Dario!
