Repeat the 1992 Oscars, and this film could be nominated or even won. It was so good to capture its era and dual culture that it belongs in American and Japanese time capsules. If you want to know what lived here or there, this movie will show you. As an American, you feel like you've been taken for a lengthy Japanese vacation, and at the end of the movie you'll be a hard-core Dragons fan as you accept the inclusion of Japanese tradition and culture in your baseball our own game. <br /> <br /> Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is a rundown, aging Detroit Tigers bat traded on the Dragons Dynasty Yomuri Giants, Japan's response to the Yankees. The giants are admired for their success, but this success also surpasses all that is rarely done. The Dragons manager recruits Jack as the final piece of the pennant contest, and we have what Gung Ho could have been on a baseball field, but instead there was much more. <br /> <br /> The casting was outstanding: Selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suits him, he can wear a movie as well as his TV show, and the Japanese line-up was just as good, except for Mr. Takagi from Die Hard back image-conscious owner. The other actors, including the one who plays the love interest (including the manager's daughter), are strong and independent, but at the same time believe in Japanese traditions, beyond what forced them. She is a real and supportive friend for Jack. Even her father never tells her not to see him, almost sympathizing with Jack for what he endures, and a little relieved that he at least knows the man she has chosen to love. The baseball scenes are great, immensely strengthened by Dennis Haysbert as an American and Jack's Western mentor. The usual elements of fish-out-water are there, and you can almost feel like you're stumbling with Jack to fit in a country that does not speak our language and does not practice our ways, including our national pastime. One of the funniest scenes is when Jack, holding a magazine, informs his manager that he has learned about Japan's tradition of getting drunk and betraying his boss, and that this will not be used against you can and that he exercises this right very humorously. The actions and negotiations are neatly tied in the end, but not too neat, and nothing concludes unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Calling a comedy is misguided: it's a pure comedy drama or even a drama with good humor. The plot is too deep to deny it as it was attempted by critics as actors from its league trying to wear a light film. The situations were amusing, but in their place in front of a much more serious, profound and detailed backdrop that leads to one of the best films I have ever seen. The baseball cinematography is inferior to Real Love by For Love Of The Game. <br /> <br /> Some say the movie is about baseball or Japan, but it seems to be about the workplace and the people. They come from different backgrounds with different agendas to work and somehow have to balance their differences Set aside the good of the company or team. <br /> <br /> A really great movie that never had to apologize for itself the way it was when it was in the theaters.
