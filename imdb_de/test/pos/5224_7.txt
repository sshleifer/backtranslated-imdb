Let's look at three films with a similar theme, this is the one from 1930, 'The Covered Wagon' from 1923 and 'Wagon Master' from 1950, the gap between 'The Big Trail' and 'The Covered Wagon' is only 7 years, while the distance between 'The Big Trail' and 'Wagon Master' is 20 years. This is amazing, because it shows how many films have developed in these 7 years and how the changes in the next 20 years are slow. 'The Big Trail is technically close to' Wagon Master ', but different from' The Covered Wagon '. The story is about pioneers traveling from the Missouri to the west of Oregon. Tyrone Power Senior is the man who leads the caravan, he's a rough and mean guy. John Wayne is the good guy, and the movie puts too much emphasis on his good looks without giving him the chance to be the Wayne we're used to. Marguerite Churchill is such a proud woman that you wonder why Wayne does not forget her. Raoul Walsh was a master at exhibiting caravans and cattle moving through the West. In 1955 he directed 'The Tall Men', which has a lot to do with 'The Big Trail'.
