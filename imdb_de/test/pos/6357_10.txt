First, I have to say that I do not speak Spanish and I do not usually like Spanish-language films ... BUT Two Coyotes is an extraordinary movie. There's enough action and hard drama that it does not matter that it's a Spanish-speaking movie. The subtitles were easy to read and did not block the action - OR the drama! <br /> <br /> I would advise fans of Spanish-language films and non-fans of Spanish-language films to watch this movie. The action and the drama are worth every penny. <br /> <br />
