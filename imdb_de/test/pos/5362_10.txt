That's the kind of movie they did, amusing, heartwarming, disturbing, authentic, with convincing performances by people without nose, chest and eye professions, in other words real people. Shauna Macdonald plays the female love interest, and she is so real that you at least want to give her a cuddle. Imagine, a real girl in a movie, anyway? Hollywood would hate her because her freshness blames every fake star in Tinseltown. This story has the same strange feeling as Sandy Mackendrick's classic "Whiskey Galore". The gnomish humor of out-of-the-way Scottish islanders enforces the claims of intruders from the outside and from time to time enjoys a little drama (the actual distances between these times are often quite different.). Director Stephen Whittaker shows a rare ability to get it right, and it is shocking to discover that he died before the release of his film at the age of only 56, which is clearly a significant loss for the screen. Ulrich Thomsen plays very well a German rocket scientist who travels to Scarp on the island of Harris in the late 1930s to build a small rocket there to transport postal parcels between the islands. There he falls in love with the seductive Macdonald girl, and she reciprocates the affection. Some wonderfully colorful characters from the region decorate the story, and the movie is a real treat. Of course, an imminent war with Hitler threatens, and we learn that Hitler executed 1,000 rocket scientists who refused to build war weapons, which is a shocking statistic. Tragic love is never far away, but the lips must remain sealed, which in the end happens. This film is a great example of the kind of films people in the UK should make. But are they released properly? In a nation whose taste has been so corrupted by reality television shows that repulsive non-beings have become national heroes, is there still a market for a film like this? After all, there is no grunting sex, no close-ups of purulent wounds or genitals, no drugs, no insane celebrities looking around, and wonder if there's anything so decadent and rundown as to interest audiences, that only the most extreme sensations can briefly alleviate the boredom of their meaningless existence. Anyone looking for an antidote to the emptiness of today's Britain can retreat into this refreshing and honest film.
