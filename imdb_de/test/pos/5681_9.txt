I'm assuming that this movie does not expect much, except for a B-movie gore festival. Luckily, I was presented with a very well made film that built up the tension and kept it going throughout the run. This was an impressive achievement. The drama was solid and created characters that you cared and interacted with. and although some may find the movie slow, it has forced you to think about what you would have done in the same situation. There was also a good camera work, and the directors have everything together wonderfully. An excellent effort, which is worthwhile if you prefer development and excitement rather than Gore.
