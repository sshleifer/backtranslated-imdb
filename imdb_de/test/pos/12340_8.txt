ONE DARK NIGHT is a highly overlooked and little known movie from the early '80s that deserves an audience that I fear will never come, and that's a damn shame. I've seen this movie compared to others that have gotten a bigger name over the years, especially PHANTASM, HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM. This is a different movie than that, and I see no other comparisons than the mausoleum, which is similar to the one in PHANTASM, but not enough to make real comparisons. I am not sure how this has slipped without wider acceptance. Maybe everything is in marketing, I do not know. Maybe a remake would breathe new life, unless Raymar drained his life from it. I'm not too big at the remakes that are abundant these days, but I think they work well with lesser-known movies (except the awful GHOST SHIP remake that was absolutely blatant except for the opening scene and Mudvayne's Not Falling blaring). So, when a remake of ONE DARK NIGHT falls into the right hands, I think many people would see the original. I know I do that when there's a remake of a movie I've never seen before. Anything but a remake, I'm afraid, would not bring this movie back to life. Unless Raymar had his eyes on it, of course. Anyway, ONE DARK NIGHT is a must for horror fans, especially for horror fans of the 80's (because we all know they were the best horror movies back then). Creepy attitude Pretty good acting. Very good story. Campy What do you want from a horror movie of the early 80's? What's that ... nudity and gore? Okay sorry. No nudity or blood in the movie, but still great! A solid 8 out of 10 points.
