A wonderful little production. <br /> <br /> The film technique is very inconspicuous - very old BBC fashion and gives the whole piece a soothing and sometimes uncomfortable sense of realism. <br /> <br /> The actors are very well chosen - Michael Sheen "not only has all polari", he also has all the voices! You can really see the seamless editing based on the references to William's diary entries, and it's not only worth watching, it's also a wonderfully written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life. <br /> <br /> Realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard, which does not use the traditional "dream" techniques, remains solid and disappears. It plays with our knowledge and our senses, especially with the scenes that affect Orton and Halliwell, and the sets (especially in their apartment with Halliwells murals that adorn every surface) are terribly well done.
