The end of Suburbia brings many concerns together with the upcoming "peak" of global oil supply. As the world's population grows, so does the demand for oil and electricity. When we gain oil and energy, we come to a "peak" in production. More oil is needed, less oil is produced. The inevitable result is a conflict and a big change. <br /> <br /> This film is disturbing and alarming if you have not dealt with the subject yet. You can react with anger and rejection first because the consequences are so grim. It should be considered. Beyond politics, beyond optimism, mathematics is indisputable. <br /> <br /> Suburbia is at the center of attention as our local neighborhoods will be the hardest hit communities when the energy price skyrockets. The intuitive logic would tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid in times of crisis, but the spread of the suburbs will make it difficult or even impossible to get an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us. <br /> <br /> Peak Oil is no longer an issue for survivors and backwoodsmen. This issue will be on our doorstep faster than we think. This movie is a clear, coherent look at it.
