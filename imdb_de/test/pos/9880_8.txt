I loved this movie when I was younger and I was actually looking for it !! I would like to see it again !! The information is correct, but the cover does not look like it fits - but I can not say for sure. As far as I can remember, the film was about these children (Alyssa Milano, Tina Yothers, etc.) in an hour's drive, and it also shows the mischief they get outside the classroom. Edie McClurg was the mother of Alyssa Milano in the movie. I remember that I really liked it. So if anyone knows where I can get a copy (preferably DVD) of the above mentioned movie (with these stars), I would like to know. Many Thanks :)
