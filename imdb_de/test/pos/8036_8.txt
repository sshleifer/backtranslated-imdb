I will not comment on the story as such. I agree with the comments of most peoples that this is a good all-around action movie with a well told story and good acting. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves 100% for the cinematography for the opening sequence. The opening shot is stunning and I have not yet figured out how they did it. The movie is worth it for this recording alone! Too bad that the DVD that is just coming out is just the movie and no information is given about the making of the movie. Let's hope someone presents the special edition. <br /> <br /> And even better: The opening sequence will also end and let you guess completely! Great stuff. A must for a collector of classic movie moments.
