And what is the genre? The backstage reveal the story. What the theatrical life behind these curtains on Broadway really looks like. It certainly has a lot of competition: Singin 'in the Rain both I and II (1929 and 1952), 42nd Street, Golddiggers of (you name the year); Dames from 1934; Noises Off (1992) from the absurd side and A Star is Born I and II from the 1930s and 1950s from the tragic side: Not to mention Summer Stock from 1950: The list goes on. What makes this movie so special? And why are there so few comments on this amazingly great movie? Did so few people actually see it? How nice to see a 30-year-old Frank Langella in front of Drakula and Frost-Nixon! How nice to see the fresh and talented Tom Hulce in front of Amadeus! And another excellent Stiller! What a wonderful team of talented people at their best! And such a script! Who was this David Shaber? So full of realistic disillusionment and pathos compared to the usual sentimentality and feel-good comedy! This is particularly evident in the Star-Is-Born episode, in which the heroine reaches Broadway, while the Langella character has to content herself with another provincial trip. <br /> <br /> Langella's subsequent hysterical and sadistic strike against the star The Latin American teacher and his granddaughter, in which he leaves out his anger and frustration, is just one of many fantastic and psychologically real moments of the film. (The Latin American teacher and his backstage love affair are certainly an echo of Marlene Dietrich and her seduced 1929 professor The Blue Angel.) Another of a series of mercenaries and cold-hearted agents like Kevin McCarthy, the Burt Lancaster in The Sweet was preceded by Riech of Success (1957) and replaced by Alan Alda in Clubland (2001) in film history. The sexual liberation of the Hulce character recalls similar incidents in O'Neill's great comedy Ah, Wilderness. <br /> <br /> And what a tribute to the long-lost operettas: The Red Mill by Victor Herbert; Rose Marie and the Vagabond King of Rudolf Friml; The Desert Song by Sigmund Romberg, etc. What satirical insertions of pieces from the great plays like Romeo and Juliet. Honors to the theater itself, as shown by Star Langella. The richness and depth of this movie are just endless. And to be saddled up with such a title! Who could guess what this great movie is about, from such a ridiculous and unspeakable title? But on the other hand, what title could one have for such a grandiose drama that could have fulfilled his rousing, emotional content? PS: I've just seen (2009) Frank Langella in his latest movie spectacular: as Richard Nixon in Frost-Nixon. How this great actor goes from triumph to triumph after 30 years!
