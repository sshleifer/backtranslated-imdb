They do not rate James Bond films, they rate them, then rate how well they live up to expectations. There are certain things to expect, even the demand for a Bond movie, and each effort will either or not deliver. Here are ten elements that make a Bond movie a Bond movie. And although NEVER NEVER AGAIN re-enter the Official Bond filmography again and again, the mere presence of Sean Connery, who returns as 007, makes something more than just an honorary member of the show. Anyway, it's rated as on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Title: NEVER SAY NEVER WEVER: The clever title has no obvious connection with the actual plot, but is a joke reference Sean Connery's vow never to play OO7 again, having previously been lured to DIAMONDS. In any case, it's a catchy title. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Pre-Credit Teaser: You may be trying to avoid obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films. There is no teaser. The opening scenes are only displayed after the credits. And that too is disappointing: another "oh no, Bond was killed" fakeout. 4 points. <br /> <br /> Opening credits: Apart from a screen full of tiny 007 scenes, they have not even bothered to refresh the credits with graphics, split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 point. <br /> <br /> Theme song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall, "Never Say Never Again" would make a particularly enjoyable part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's just okay. 6 points. <br /> <br /> "Bond, James Bond": Since Connery is lured back to service in this film after ten years as Bond, the story begins with 007 before asking if Bond / Connery is still at the job , Fortunately, Connery proves more than ready for bondage. Although he is a bit grayer, wearing a little more belt and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble getting back into action. All in all, it's one of Connery's best and most relaxed turns as a character. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Babes: Even in the best Bond movies, the female characters do not get a big dimension. They exist largely as necessary props for the use of Bond. Future Oscar winner Kim Basinger will have plenty of scope to create her character of Domino Petachi. The movie benefits from it. She does a good job - and she's not too bad to look at. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Villain: The reports of his death are obviously overdone, Blofeld has returned - at least for now - and shows he has more lives than his beloved Pussycat. Max von Sydow, the former Jesus-Portrayer, became a stereotypical villain, has not much to do, but is still a silky presence. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a series of banal Bond villains, Brandauer is so refreshed to give a subtle as well as colorful performance. Funny without being campy, reckless without caring; His Largo is one of Bond's best villains with Auric Goldfinger. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? Barbara Carrera, played with the brave style of a particularly extravagant drag queen, blows through the film, showing a mixture of self-indulgent evil and more than a touch of sheer psychotic madness. Bond has crossed with a variety of Femmes Fatales, most of which have been so easily eliminated that they existed more as a fun eye candy than as a character. But few dared to show such an outburst for the dramatic or so violent determination. Even her premature death is spectacular, even for Bondian standards. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Sinister plot: As a remake of THUNDERBALL, the movie seems to have been there a bit: nuclear missiles are being stolen and big real estate will kaboom, if all The countries of the world do not pay ransom of billions of dollars. At least, producer Kevin McClory was fortunate enough to redone one of Bond's weakest adventures. By comparison, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the lack of many Bondian brands, the movie is a success. 9 points. Production values: The film begins with a restless style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. However, as the story progresses, the movie gains momentum and meaning, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bonus Points: There are some strange changes that differentiate this Bond movie from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly recognized; As played by Edward Fox, "M" is a moody old nagging with no respect for the "Double Os", a premonition of how Judi Dench would later play the role; and "Q" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all a buddy with Bond. And there's a weird sense of nostalgia throughout the movie, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with an old Packard and a tango dance number that is neatly inserted into the story. A great escape towards the end is on horseback, a tribute to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which itself was a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points. <br /> <br /> Summary: NEVER SAY AGAIN Is a mixed bag. In the really important areas she keeps on thanks to hero Connery, villain Brandauer, assassin Carrera and the needy Basingerin more than. But the devil is in the detail; As unimportant as the opening credits, the theme song and the like may be, the film is missing due to its absence. It all happens as a faux bond film; A very good replacement, but still a replacement. <br /> <br /> Bond O Meter Rating: 78 out of 100.
