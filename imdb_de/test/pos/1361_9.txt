Golden Boy is, in my opinion, one of the sleeping / lost treasures out there. A sexy comedy about a young man looking for a niche in life, and he stumbles into all sorts of strange jobs that somehow has this pretty sexy girl who eventually falls in love with him, but he does not really know! It's really something you can easily miss when you see the name, but once you look at it, it falls into the comedy / stupidity that lies inside. Truly a crime that only produced 6 OVA episodes and a pilot. As unique as it is. I am surprised that it has survived to produce so many. If you want a good laugh with high-quality animes (100% CGI-free), you should take a look at this anime. Boy, who one day can save the world ... or maybe not.
