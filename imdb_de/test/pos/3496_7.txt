The Ali G character works great within the confines of a comedy show, but as a movie, it does not work in the same way. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong - this is a very funny movie, full of snappy, witty dialogues that wonderfully caricatures the modern British while offering the viewer a witty, if unrealistic, story. <br /> <br /> One problem with this movie is that the script or content is either fantastically brilliant or it's embarrassing to watch. When I say embarrassing, I do not mean to be embarrassed by an office or extras, but you wish they had not included it in the final cut. An example of this is the recording of a music video after the end of the movie titled "That's how we do it". Whenever I look at the movie, I stop the DVD when it says the end and leave it at that. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ali G. Indahouse is a good movie that pays off a few times. The script is pleasant to a certain extent and there are no problems in terms of action. Refinement, however, is the keyword. <br /> <br /> Ali G is a better TV program. Borat is a better movie.
