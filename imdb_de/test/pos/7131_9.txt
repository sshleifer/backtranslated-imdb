Dead Gentlemen Productions has put together a movie with amazing production values ​​for your budget. Anyone who has ever played a role-playing game, especially a fantasy role-playing game (dungeons and dragons in the movie), will love this movie. All-round brilliant performance - especially in terms of the dual nature of the principles by playing their players and their characters. Anyone who has ever shot or played in a student film will appreciate the work and love he has in this project. This movie (and its prequel) is for fantasy movies and role-playing games, which is blazing saddles for westerns - a parody of the highest order. I have just a few minor complaints about the movie itself, and none of this will stop me from buying the DVD as soon as it's available (only six weeks left - counting the days): <br /> <br /> 1 When Lodge talks to Joanna about joining the game group, he gives her a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook and says "this tells you everything you need to know." The camera floats too long on a view of the book, and the moment really seemed to be a commercial. <br /> <br /> 2. The jokes are funny, but they seem to be unevenly distributed throughout the movie. The last third of the film slows down somewhat, as if the narrative is catching up with the jokes, following the almost uninterrupted jumble of visual and verbal humor. Strange, but Blazing Saddles always hit me like that. , , and I love this movie too. <br /> <br /> One of the narrative strengths of the story is the unsolved nature of the romantic subplot. Will Joanna become GM's girlfriend? Will she go back to Cass? Or will the three maintain a platonic friendship deepened by the fellowship of role-playing? (Yeah, that sounds juicy, but there are a few saccharine moments, especially when Cass and Lodge "make up" in the end.) The film spans a week: In terms of human relationships, these questions could not be answered Week. The fact that the characters' relationships remain undefined seems to me to be better than the more classic choices you see in most movies. The girl gets her prince and moves to the castle or the prince sinks after three things in the North Atlantic, boring and predictable hours. The authors seem to really understand the psychology of the characters, and you can see that the characters (both the players and the characters of the player) change in the course of the film, but not suddenly and not unbelievably. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear more wisdom from Brother Silence. "The man who stands out in the dark is ... fluorescent."
