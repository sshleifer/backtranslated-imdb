This is a funny movie and I like it a lot. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood at a discount. This, of course, is the common good against evil with Robin against the evil sheriff of Nottingham. The humor is for the most part in your face, but still works well. A comedy for a night, if you do not have to think much, it's worth a rent!
