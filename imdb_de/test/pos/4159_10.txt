THE GOLDEN DOOR (NUOVOMONDO) is the best movie of the year for this viewer. It is a masterpiece of concept, writing, directing, acting and cinematography. More importantly, this radiantly beautiful film is a much-needed reflection mirror for us to see the story of the immigration of "foreigners" in America, at a time when the word "borders" is just a political safeguard. Not only did author / director Emanuele Crialese tell us a deeply moving story, he also provided a touchstone for the audience to revisit the story of our origins: with the exception of the Native Americans, we all came as foreigners in America ' a certain time in our history, and it is humble to see this movie in light of this fact. <br /> <br /> The movie opens at the turn of the century in Sicily as impoverished widower Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) His brother Angelo (Francesco Casisa) climbs a rocky hill to introduce his markers to the cross and make a sign ask if they should continue to fight on the island for survival or travel to America, the land of dreams. Mancuso's deaf and dumb son Pietro (Filippo Pucillo) runs up the hill with postcards he found with pictures of America (money growing on trees, fruits and vegetables bigger than humans, etc.), and Salvatore accepts this as a sign his family should follow Draw America. After persuading his reluctant mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and his sisters Rita (Federica De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) to make the trip, he sells his only possessions (two donkeys, goats and rabbits) and the husband By boat, they arrange their journey and give the family shoes, appropriate clothing and instructions to board a ocean liner as third-class passengers. As the Mancuso family prepares for boarding, they are asked for a photo, and as they pose behind a painted set, an Englishwoman Lucy / Luce (Charlotte Gainsbourg) enters the photo as if she were part of that peasant family. Lucy can not go aboard without a male escort. <br /> <br /> The journey begins and Luce gently identifies with the Mancuso family and finally consolidates their safe passage by proposing to Salvatore to marry her. not for love when they arrive in America. Due to a heavy storm and terrifying living conditions in poor conditions, the multitude of third-class passengers survives Ellis Island and eventually reach Ellis Island. They believe that their dream of America has come true. But everyone has to pass tough physical tests, perform detlousing and even intelligence tests to see if they can enter America: officials let them know that America does not want genetically inferior people entering the New World! Each woman must be selected by a man to marry on Ellis Island before she is admitted. The way in which the Mancuso family remains united to a surprising end is the end of the story. Few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment that immigrants are facing (or at least at the end of the turn of the century) on Ellis Island, and if we do so, we have decided to sink that information. THE GOLDEN DOOR presents the case for migration struggles in a way that not only touches our hearts, but also challenges the acceptance of applicable immigration laws. Apart from the political issues, THE GOLDEN DOOR is first and foremost a film of enormous beauty, exquisite photography, deeply felt performances of a huge cast and a very sensitively written and staged story. This is a movie that deserves a wide distribution, a film that is a must for everyone. Highly recommended. Grady harp
