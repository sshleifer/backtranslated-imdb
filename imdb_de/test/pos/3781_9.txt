Chaplin enters the trenches of World War I in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are there, but Chaplin seems to forget them all strangely. He is in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with incredible success. <br /> <br /> It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - then a very funny one - until the last minute when it rises to a new level of sharpness and everything makes sense. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's what all the soldiers dream of before the war starts.
