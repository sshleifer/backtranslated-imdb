I saw this on DVD with subtitles, which made it a bit frustrating to get through the length of the movie. But I was annoyed through and through. That I was fascinated by the characters and was always immersed in the story despite the subtitles, testifies to the power of the film. It is an amazing job. I have it on my list of ten favorite films of all time. It's by far the best foreign movie I've seen in the last twenty years. I would like to know the whole story behind the movie. It took a very long time and needed hundreds of locations. Some hardcore scenes (on the TV in the motel room) may cause some people not to see it, but if you do not care, you'll be deeply moved by all the stories in this scene!
