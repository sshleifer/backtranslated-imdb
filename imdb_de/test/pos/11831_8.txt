This early Warner Brothers talk "Son of the Gods" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance Anglo-Saxon Americans show to the Chinese. Chinese Americans are treated like second-class citizens, and the whites only hold them in contempt. <br /> <br /> The British scenarist Bradley King based his screenplay on Rex Beach's novel about a young and impressive Chinaman, Sam Lee (Richard) Barthelmess of "Only Angels Have Wings", who experiences racial prejudice at first hand Girls who bring their college mates for a party, reveal their racial feelings about Sam as soon as they learn about his inheritance. Sam goes to see his father, Lee Ying, who is a wealthy Chinaman and has offices not only in New York but also in San Francisco. Sam feels very hurt by the racist quarrels and wants to leave New York and go where he can not be hurt by Americans. His patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and tolerance is the only solution to racism. Sam has not learned this lesson yet. He refuses to take more money from his father and goes by ship to London, England, while peeling potatoes on board. <br /> <br /> During the trip, he meets the British dramatist Bathurst (Claude King of London) "Arrowsmith", who needs help writing a play about the Chinese and Sam makes a friendship and Sam provides him with cultural Information about Asians. While relaxing in France, Sam meets a beautiful young woman, Allana Wagner (Constance Bennett of "Two-Face-Woman"), who falls in love with him. It seems that Allana and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel. Everyone in the motel knows that Sam is a Chinaman, with the exception of Allana. Sam is sensitive to his racial heritage and keeps Allana at arm's length until she convinces him that nothing can change her mind about him. They fall in love immortally together. Allana's father drops the bomb as he reveals that Sam is a Chinaman and all the memories of living in San Francisco and fighting coolies that flood Allana's mind. She storms into the motel's dining room and publicly beats Sam with a riding crop in front of a room full of onlookers. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events. He thought Allana loved him, but she did not. Around this time, Sam's father Lee Ying falls ill and Ying's art secretary Eileen (Mildred Van Dorn of "Iron Man") sends Sam a telegram about Ying's illness. Predictably, Sam rushes to New York to be with his father. Since his public humiliation, Sam has vowed to show no kindness to the Anglo-Saxon Americans. Eileen is Irish Catholic and probably one of his few white friends. Lee Ying dies and Sam takes control of the business and he practices his anti-white racism until he learns that he was an Anglo-Saxon finder who gave a San Francisco policeman an upbringing to Lee Ying and his wife. The policeman forgot until two white-haired social worker types wanted to get Sam off the Yings. Sam experiences this revelation at about the same time Allana comes to New York and falls ill. During her illness, she repeatedly pronounces her name in her sleep, and her father goes to Sam and asks him to visit Sam to help her recover. Without knowing Allana, Sam visits her and she improves, but she has no memory of his visit, just a vague idea. After all, Allana learns the truth that Sam is not a Chinaman, and they marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> This socially responsible Warner Brothers / First National Pictures release is openly and relentlessly contesting the racial issue for the first one an hour before the revelation that Sam is running no Chinese blood in his veins surprises both him and also the audience. The reconciliation between Allana and Sam draws credibility, despite their selfless immortal love for one another. In the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that had previously come before, they end up in the arms. <br /> <br /> The surrender of the race problem with the revelation that Sam is not Chinese is damaging part of the film's moral power. Incredibly, "Son of the Gods" is a pre-code movie that seems almost prudish. For example, Sam is an American, not a Chinese! Constance Bennett gives a wonderful performance as a terrible beauty and she keeps her attention when she lashes Sam with her riding crop. Claude King is good as Bathurst and E. Alyn Warren convinces as Lee Ying. Interestingly, Warren's career was to portray Asian characters. Richard Barthelmess is as flawless as Sam. he delivers a highly differentiated performance. "Son of the Gods" is, despite his age, a son of a good movie!
