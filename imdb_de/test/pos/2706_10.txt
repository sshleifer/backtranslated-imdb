As an avid Carpenter fan I really loved this movie (though the wigs left a lot to be desired!) And agree with many comments that certain areas of their lives were absent or unaffected. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity good and really unsatisfied, so I went in search of more. I have to recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and is different from the movie "real" and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her time in Fame and Gypsy. She is herself a singer (as well as a dancer) and I think that was the advantage of creating the character. Some other actresses may have struggled with it. It's a hunch the movie did not go deeper into its story. After all this is the movie title, but I felt like we learned more about Richard, but I think like any actor worthy of his salt, you should always wish them more!
