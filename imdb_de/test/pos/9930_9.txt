Horror Genius Dario Argento is one of my personal favorite directors and his films "Suspiria", "Phenomena" and "Profondo Rosso" are among my personal favorites. "Opera" from 1987 is another exciting and brilliant film that no horror lover can miss and that keeps you on the edge of the chair from beginning to end. This stunning and ultra-violent Giallo can be described as the Master's worst film, which is well known given that Argento's films are not known for their violence. The violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes Opera a nightmare of film censorship. <br /> <br /> - Attention! SPOILERS ahead! - <br /> <br /> Only when Betty (Christina Marsillach), a young opera singer, succeeds, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath begins to follow her ... The murders are really brutal and especially sadistic. The killer attaches the bound Betty's eyelids with needles so she has to keep them open and watch him brutally murder people in a vile manner near her. When the butcher is done, the killer lets go of Betty and leaves just to return for his friends ... <br /> <br /> As usual with Argentos films, the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized. "Opera" is really a brutal movie and a stylish and atmospheric movie. This movie is absolutely enticing and pure tension from beginning to end. The performances are very good, especially Christina Marsillach is brilliant at the top. Marsillach is a stunning beauty and a great actress. She fits perfectly into her role as a talented singer, whose fear and terrible experiences are driving her crazy. Other great performances include Ian Charleston's horror director, who directs an opera, and real-life girlfriend Daria Nicolodi, who plays a role in many of his films. The camera work is superb, as in all Argento films, and the huge opera house is an outstanding backdrop that adds to the beauty of the movie as well as its permanently creepy atmosphere. The film music, which is partly classical music and sometimes heavy metal, is also great, though I've missed something about Goblins brilliant Progressive Rock soundtracks, which are such a characteristic element of most other Argento films. "Opera" is really a scary and absolutely breathtaking Giallo experience. This is an absolute must for any horror lover, and I recommend it to any other movie fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely enticing!
