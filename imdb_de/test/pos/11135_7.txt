In 2023, Bob (Bobbie Phillips) is a human hybrid and IBI agent in a world dominated by the economic interests of large corporations (and not by the will of the people or politicians). It is called Sub (Sub-Human) and its genetic makeup is 80% human and 20% animal. She has a combination of Puma genes that gives her strength and flexibility; Hawk, which gives her an increased ability to see and hear; and chameleon, that gives her the power of camouflage. In the first film she was a very seductive and amoral woman who used sex to get information. I have not seen the second one yet, but in this third one the story is full of action. A group of scientists has been developing a new and dangerous form of power generation for fifteen years. The research is not yet complete when one of them betrays the other and steals the research. The problem is that due to its molecular instability, a black hole is created that sucks the entire planet. Kam rescues Tess Adkins (Teal Redman), the survival of the team of scientists, trying to get the dangerous inventor out of the hands of the 'bad guys'. There is a very strong "sub" in this gang, which causes Kam many difficulties. This action and sci-fi TV movie is better than the first, reminiscent of "The Terminator" in some parts of the storyline. Bobbie Phillips is a very beautiful actress and her outfit is very cool. I will be a fan of this good conversation. Fans of sci-fi movies will not be disappointed. Now I am trying to buy Chameleon 2. My voice is seven.
