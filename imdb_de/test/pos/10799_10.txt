From the offset, I knew this would be a great movie, the tempo, the cinematography, personalities based in the Dallas area, the diversification of the characters, not to mention the director Oliver Stone and of course Eric Bogasian ... The Film Starts on a Friday (hinted at occult) and starts with a radio station in Dallas hosting their talk show number one, The Barry Champlain Show (based on Talk Radio presenter Alan Berg). ... Barry (Eric Bogasian) is the presenter of the radio show and his job is to pontify all the sensational nuances of the radio audience that streams into his show ... He tries to come up with a bunch of social divergences that are lonely and vulnerable To honor Barry Champlain, obscene telephone callers who have the masochistic desire to be publicly denigrated, is effective in overcoming this precarious situation by degrading them socially, rather than merely submitting them to mere admonition ... New techno-logies serve one stigmatic purpose for the Dallas radio audience, and towering concepts are behind perversion, talking about "Baseball Scores, Orgasms, and People's Pets !!". <br/> <br /> The whole thing is a cacophony of drug-induced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia !! This high-profile cannon fodder thrives Barry Champlain !!! The kinky pathos, the confused passions that distract from pornography's infidelities and pornography and pop-pop failures, serve as fugitive ammo for Barry Champlain's stilted battlefield! a two thousand feet lower in terms of ideology. In the center of Dallas, cosmopolitan consciousness reigns, with a significant section of the Ku Klux Klant residing 20 miles away !! ... The piece is located in Denver Here plays the real story, other small plays show the cities of Louisville, Atlanta and Cleveland. Dallas is the city where the movie plays. I thought it would be an excellent choice !! ... This film shows how people have a terrible, erroneous and deadly misconception of the Jewish population in America, which makes them control the banks and their agenda is different from everyone else and their intellectual literature leads to perversion !! These preconceptions reinforce the general dilemma of Barry Champlain !!! Barry Champlain's personal doom is that he is irascible and does not respond to his alcoholism, and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate ruin, which makes the movie so believable! The characters in The Movie was well portrayed, Dan, the tailor-made man for the middle man of management (played by Alec Baldwin), who was constantly watching Barry Champlain's every move !! .. Laura, his girlfriend, also his producer, will always feel that Barry is someone who is always misunderstood !! Ellen, his ex-wife, is a recipient of Barry's fear and selfishness, but can not quite give up her feelings for Barry, regardless of the path of personal destruction he relies on !! The radio crowd in Dallas is a melting pot of socially misguided retro bates amused about their own real flaws !!! ... Part of every hang-up, including Barry Champlain's own hang-up, is where Barry Champlain is! ! His listeners embrace corruption, encourage improvement, and eventually become a favorite project of Barry Champlain for ordained sinners! Social cultural conflicts will Barry Champlain's fall !! <br /> <br /> This movie is great !! In my opinion, Oliver is Stones best picture, including Platoon and Natural Born Killers .. This statement already tells you how great a movie Talk Radio is ... The story Eric Bogosian advises, plays and co-produces is simply captivating! ! The camera angles, the dialogue, the haunting character depictions, all top notch. The cinematography of the Dallas skyline at the end of the film is great !! Dallas has the dubious distinction of being considered a mega metropolis ... So, just like in Los Angeles and New York, there are too many baby falls too numerous to count, cheap neighborhoods in hell and budget cuts that will mean that there will be a considerable number of people who will be dead by this time next year !!!! ... Dallas claims it's status as a metropolitan area in the precarious way that human debauchery reigns !! The city has listening radio listeners who make the wonder of nationwide communication with the airwave pejorative !! These are the culprits in the movie !! The terrible tabloid fails to hit the big bad wolf, and its decadent curiosity has morally erased the "last quarter in America."
