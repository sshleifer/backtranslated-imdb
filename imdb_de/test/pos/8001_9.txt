Batman Returns is a really dark movie featuring the capped crusader battling the penguin and the sexy catwoman (I'll talk about that later). Michael Keaton acts as Bruce Wayne, showing that he is a good actor. Tim Burton steers this picture well and the filming locations are impressive. The bad guys: Danny deVito is threatening as a penguin. A cruel but disturbed man who had a really difficult childhood. But Michelle Pfeiffer steals the picture. She is the best catwoman of all time! She is threatening and extremely sexy. There is a scene where she kisses Batman for the cat that just heats up the movie. The action scenes are also good and the end is dramatic and tragic, probably the best ending of a Batman movie. Tim Burton shows that he can manage a Batman movie very well (he demonstrated this with the first Batman) and also gives Batman a dark nature. As much as he.
