As a SCUBA diver, I can appreciate the incredible physical stress the cameramen had to endure to get the shots underwater. However, this series is MUCH more than that. The narrative is perfect, the scenes are bordering on unbelievable and the subject fascinates. The daily struggle for life that takes place from the perspective of our rural inhabitants is overwhelming. This DVD set has opened my eyes to another planet on earth. I urge everyone to watch this series.
