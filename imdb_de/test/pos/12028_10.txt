Watching an hour of how brilliant Dan Finnerty and his "Dan Band" performed their special on Bravo is the finest hour I've ever spent watching TV. This young man (Dan) is an incredible talent, as a singer, performer and even dancer. He can go from the kitschy ballad pop songs sung only by women to hip-hop, rock, and even songs written for women. This guy can do it all. I've seen him live at least eleven times, so I did not expect how well his show would adapt to a TV or movie format, but all the reservations immediately went away when the show started doing Dan's overwhelming star quality and take a look or, better still, buy it.
