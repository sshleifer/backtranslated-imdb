I liked this comedy so much. Will Smith does not do anything slow. With the best scripts and the best comedy that makes you laugh and is involved in the plot, you are always right. You see a talented comedian who plays all his roles well. You firmly believe who he is. I loved him and Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black. This comedy can compete with this movie. The humor moves fast and Will Smith is as sure of himself as he is in Men in Black. He is quick to understand and has the ability to make others score points every time, but in a tasteful way and with finesse. Will Smith seems to have honed his comedy routine well. He was so damn funny. I loved the part where he was allergic to something he ate and his face swelled and he looked after Cassius Clay after a fight more than he did himself. Then he saw him sipping the Benadryl bottle and trying to get his head back to the right size. I laughed so hard. He knows how to make us all laugh.
