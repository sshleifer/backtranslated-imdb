Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, what a team. While Rene Russo, William Shanter and the guy from the Everyday video are there. This is a funny and great movie. Not only that, but it's a good buddy. <br /> <br /> Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) directs this hellish movie. From beginning to end it was a masterpiece. No slapstick humor here. But good old days laugh. Make fun of all the other police films (just to name a few Lethal Weapons, Beverly Hills Cop, fifteen minutes, and so on). You will love it. It has a wonderful cast and crew. So, get off the TV from "COPS" and watch "Showtime" for a police movie. And remember, they'll kill your neighbor for um ... um ... oh! Fridays at 8:00 (man, I'm a bad writer).
