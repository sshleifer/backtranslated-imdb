Rififi is rightly mentioned for the famous raid scene, and indeed, this scene deserves all the recognition it gets. It is a masterful piece of tension, character interaction and photography. But Rififi is not just this one scene - every scene in the movie is so masterfully composed, and overall the film is not only taught with excitement, plot and character, but with a neatly told moral story that determines the film Noire's future scene years. <br /> <br /> Cinematic and technical, the heist sequence may be the film's most impressive scene, but for me it's the last scene that has the most power - driving Tony le St√©phanois' hallucinogen to salvation.
