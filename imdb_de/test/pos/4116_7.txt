I thought the movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this film. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a woman who has fallen in love with Richard Greico's character from head to toe. They marry in the end and everything seems to be perfect, except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, but it's hard to understand. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy and will take extreme measures to make her happy. I found the acting in this movie great and just lets you guess. It shows how naive you can be when you fall in love. Yasmine Bleeth is a good actress and I wonder why she never made it in her career. Richard Greico is very impressive as a deceitful husband and plays the evil role very well. I wonder why certain actors make it and do not. All in all a great movie that I would recommend.
