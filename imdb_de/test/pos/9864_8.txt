I'm a big M-Lillard fan, that's why I saw this movie. Honestly, I doubt he would have liked it if he had not been in the movie or even saw it, but when I saw it, I realized that the story was pretty decent. I have to say a bad ending, but I saw it coming. It's a low budget movie and some of the actors were not really good but overall I rated this movie 7/10. <br /> <br /> The tension of wondering what Lillard was up to really kept me interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good rent! <br /> <br /> 7/10
