I found this little gem on my DVD of Vampire-The Dream of Allen Gray as an added feature and did not expect much from him. It looked like it was an interesting little short film, so I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did it. It was really incredible! Although the animation was made more than 70 years ago, it was, in my opinion, better than some of today's computer-based effects and experiences. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple The newly assembled toy dog ​​hears its owner's lamentations that he can not afford an orange and goes looking for them. It gets into the underworld of a toy with all sorts of nefarious creatures and toys that are not overseen by any other than the Devil himself, who all want the orange of the dog for themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie goes ahead, but does it remind me a lot about Mad Monster Party? (1969, Jules Bass) - a movie I've always enjoyed a lot - and to a lesser extent, some animated works by Tim Burton - The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993, Henry Selick) and Corpse Bride (2005, Tim Burton). Fans of these films will surely love The Mascot as well. All in all, an incredible short animation worth seeing.
