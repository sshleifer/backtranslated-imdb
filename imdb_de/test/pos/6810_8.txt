I saw this movie from 1997 because I'm a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and his father, the late Fernando Lamas). In my opinion, Lorenzo looked best in this film, mainly because of his hairdo and neat wardrobe that flattered him. <br /> <br /> As the story unfolded, I realized that the movie was more than just entertainment. A reason to see a favorite actor. The story was about a ring of serial killers and law enforcement attempts to investigate the ring and bring the members to justice. There was enough tension, and I think the violence was necessary to connect the story with the viewer. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I was shocked to learn that the movie is the true portrayal of horrific murders in Utah. In addition, Lorenzo and his protagonists portrayed real FBI agents who solved the disappearance of many young women and contributed to the arrest of the ring. I think the movie is worth it because it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.
