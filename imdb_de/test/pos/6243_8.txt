"Tourist Trap" is a bizarre, great horror movie from the 70s. The film is about a group of young adults, Becky, Jerry and Molly traveling through a desert area in a jeep. Her two other friends, Eileen and her friend Woody, are sitting in a separate car. When a wheel gets empty, Woody takes it to a nearby gas station - and experiences a terrible fate for a bizarre telekinetic chaos and some scary mannequins. The friends are tired of waiting for Woody and go to a local "tourist trap" mannequins / wax museum. In front of the entrance, the car collapses by accident, and the girls find an oasis area for swimming in which they are approached by Mr. Slausen, who runs the attraction on the roadside, which is now closed. He takes her to the old Western Wax Museum and the girls stay behind while he and Jerry fix their car. Eileen, the curiosity of the two, wanders to an old house nearby, where she also falls into the hands of a mysterious masked murderer and a pile of lives like mannequins. After waiting for Eileen, Becky and Molly search for her. Then the real horror begins, and the telekinetic (object-moving object), Mr. Slausen's masked brother, begins to gradually kill the teens while controlling his large number of polished mannequins. <br /> <Sound like the 2005 "House of Wax" remake? Well, it is. I had heard about this film but had never seen it when I saw "House of Wax", but now I see the striking similarities between the two movie friends - "Tourist Trap" obviously made a big contribution to the remake "House of Wax" , The mannequins in this movie are scary at first, some with moving eyeballs, some with no eyes, and some with mouths falling, singing too. The vocals were extremely scary, if you ask me, and the mannequins were scary. Mannequins are scary at first, they are so lifelike, but they really are not. The film combines elements of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (the masks that the killer resembles those of Leatherface) closely with the original "House of Wax" and the telekinetic powers displayed in "Carrie". The result is very satisfactory. The telekinesis was a nice touch to the movie and made the killer all the more threatening and inevitable. The masks were scary, and the plastering scene was really disturbing. <br /> <br /> The movie soundtrack for the movie was really well done, although in some scenes it was not overstretched. The drama may not be very important, but it was not that bad. Chuck Connors, as a shadowy Mr. Slauston, was really good and gave the character a shady but friendly feeling. A young Tanya Roberts is also in the film, she is best known for her role in "Charlie's Angels" and recently for the sitcom "That '70s Show" that Donna's mother plays. Robert A. Burns works as an art director, has done phenomenal work on the original Texas Chainsaw, and is doing a good job here too, creating a cluttered, musty atmosphere for both the rundown museum and the old mannequin house. I found it a bit strange that the original rating for the film was PG, it seems a bit too scary to get such a tame rating, but the movie really is not too violent. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Tourist Trap" is an incredibly unique, fast-paced, extremely undervalued horror classic. Full Moon gave him a decent DVD release for his 20th birthday, the comment was interesting and the picture was mostly clear and sharp, better than the video versions. If you enjoy older Slasher horror films of the 70s, "Tourist Trap" is an underrated retro gem. 8.10.
