(WARNING: SPOILERS!) <br /> <br /> Five young people ignore the warnings of Ranger George Kennedy and walk to the misty mountains of Oregon, where they are stolen and slaughtered by a pair of large, deformed inbred hillbilly twins. With only two left, Warren and his girl Connie, they resort to their animal instincts to stay alive. The movie ends with Connie pushing half an arm into one of the killer's throat and choking him to death. A very powerful, if slightly overvalued, Backwoods Slasher movie that uses light, sound, and photography effectively makes it one step higher than usual. Led by an attractive, sympathetic cast, especially Deborah Benson (where is she now?) And Gregg Henry, this chic companion to Jeff Lieberman's director SQUIRM (1976) and BLUE SUNSHINE (1977) should not be missed.
