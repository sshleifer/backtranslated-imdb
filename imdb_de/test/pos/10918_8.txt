I saw that because my cousin is extra in one of the wedding scenes. I read somewhere that Oz and Rudnick wanted to make fun of liberal message movies, but the climax ends right out of one of those movies. Partly the humor is a bit miserable, Joan Cusack was too over the top for me and someone has a weird timeline regarding the Oscars. Still, there were more than enough fun moments, such as the kissing scene, the wedding that does not exist, and the scene with the headmaster to enjoy it. Kline is good as always, but for me the real surprise was Selleck, of whom I'm not a big fan, but who makes fun of it here.
