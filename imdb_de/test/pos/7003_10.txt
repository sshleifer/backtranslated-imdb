As a zombie fan, I love this kind of conspiracy where people end up in strange places, surrounded by evil monsters! PB is also an excellent link to Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The gang must run away from the darkness as fast as possible. There are so many metaphors in history! Riddick is this evil, but he is also the hero trying to save the slow people. The Muslim type Imam relies on the position of the sun five times a day, but sits in a land of darkness. Overall, I recommend this movie to all science fiction fans. You will not be disappointed.
