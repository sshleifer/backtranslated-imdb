In a Truffaut interview with Hitchcock that talks the full length of the film, it's obvious that Big Al's fear of the police goes back to his childhood. His father sent him with a note to the police station. The note said, "He was naughty, arresting him for an hour." The police were required and since then Hitchcock has been deeply afraid of being wrongly accused and kidnapped by the police. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on the train" is probably one of the best in his series "Unfairly Accused". The film is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith. This is the same author who wrote the Ripley series. She has always been fascinated by clever criminals. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's opening is very strong and immediately brings you to the protagonists: Guy Haines, a famous tennis player, and Bruno Anthony, the emerging criminal. The two men share a chemistry that was probably much more than what the audience could chew on that day and age. Bruno tries to convince Guy that they could commit the perfect murder (leaving no clues) when they change the victim. Bruno will kill Guy's wife, who would not divorce, and Guy would kill Bruno's father. The motives are love and money. <br/> <br/> Bruno's performance should be seductive and homoerotic. This was not done by accident. In fact, Hitchcock has edited two versions of the movie: a US, a UK. In the US version, the scope of Bruno's seduction was reduced somewhat. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is a very deep movie, but more importantly, this is another great Hitchcock thriller. An excellent example of an exciting scene is when Guy climbs the stairs to the room of Bruno's father. Hitchcock argued that the audience's attention must be diverted at this point so they can not figure out what Guy will find in the room. Hitch pampers us with a HUGE, threatening dog on top of the stairs, which provided the necessary distraction. <br /> <br /> The most famous setting in the movie occurs during a tennis match. Bruno has been persecuting Guy for Guy to fulfill his end of the agreement (to kill his father). When Guy looks at the audience, everyone heads back and forth. All but one - Bruno. He looks at Guy with a "I'll get you" smile right on. <br /> <br /> The end is another example of suspense. Both men are fighting for an important piece of evidence in a carousel that is spinning at breakneck speed. A worker crawls underneath to get to the controls. When we finally leave and the film shows Guy proving his innocence, we are completely exhausted and nail-free (for those who are still biting their noses!). "Strangers on a Train" is easily one of Hitchcock's best "false accused" films. Some also attribute him to one of the best villains (Bruno). All in all, the movie may seem a bit dated, but that's a lesson the thriller does itself. I will not refuse Leonardo if he wanted to teach me Renaissance painting, so you should not do it. <br /> <br /> << Review posted on FilmDailies.com >>
