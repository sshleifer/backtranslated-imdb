Romanian cinema is little known outside Romania. No directors from Romania were brought to the attention of the international public, as some other Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Czekoslowakia or Yugoslavia have done. One of the few great directors in Romanian cinema is Lucian Pintilie, who 35 years ago made a great film "Reconstituirea" - which was quickly taken out of circulation by communist censorship. After this film, which is still a reference for Romanian cinema, Pintilie was allowed to work freely in Romania only after the fall of communist rule in 1989. The movie Furia reminds me of Pintilie's movie 35 years ago. The title means "The Rage" and I can not imagine why the dealers have translated it differently. It's about a lost generation. While in Pintilie's classic the root of evil lies in the oppression and lies of the communist regime, the young people here have to grapple with the emergence of subculture and the moral filth that fills the emptiness of the totalitarian. The end is tragic and is painfully awaited. <br /> <br /> The film is well directed and the acting is good. Without too much complexity, it is possible to create an emotional connection between the characters and the viewer. You could say that some situations look similar to "8 Miles" or "The Fast and the Furious" - but look at the date of production! This film was shot at the same time, if not in front of the western peers. If this is actually the first movie by director Dan Munteanu, as IMDB says, it's an excellent debut. In any case, a good movie can keep up and sell well in the Western market. <br /> <br /> There is hope for a new generation of Romanian films that, with luck and good distribution, will make their place in the world. International Cinema scene. <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale.
