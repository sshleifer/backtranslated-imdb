To award the Franklin's is the best movie I have seen in years. The acting was fantastic ... especially Mari Blackwell, who was really remarkable in the role of Peggy Lester. She brought Peggy to life with incredible abilities and made her as real as my neighbor. I also enjoyed Robertson Dean in the role of the father ... he is a true professional and has managed to show even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace. The performances of the entire cast were very good, excellent, in fact, but Peggy's role, as played by Blackwell, made the film. The cinematography was very nice and was very impressive. The only criticism I have to offer is a slight weakness of the final scenes, which were overly boring, repetitive, and a bit too false at the wrong character. I would have liked it to end up with a pardon ... but despite this little mistake, it is worth considering and applauding all those involved.
