Five Fingers of Death: Although previous episodes of Shaw Martial Arts had exposed the influence of the American cowboy genre, no one, especially in the salon combat scene, paid such an open tribute as this one. And although Shaw Bros. films were previously borrowed from the Japanese Chambara genre (swordplay), this was unsuccessful. I suppose some of it had to do with the fact that the director was from Korea and brought such bonds with a non-Chinese perspective, which certainly raises some interesting questions about culture. In any case, the film in Hong Kong action films presented real innovations in technology and technology. For the first time in Hong Kong, the camera has been given access to all sets, ie recordings from many different angles, such as For example, the low-angle interior view that showed the ceiling of a room (their original American innovation usually attributed to John Ford) or the wide-angle wide-angle that made it possible to visualize a large floor area, or the frontal tracking shot. <br /> <br /> It is true that this was not the first hand-to-hand experience of real cinematic substance - this remains Wang Yu's 'Chinese Boxer'; But on a commercial level, Shaw Bros. rightly chose "Five Fingers" as the first major release to the West, because it could be said that they were the "least Chinese" of their action films, that is, the least dependent purely Chinese theatrical traditions. Although this did not impress the American critics of the time (who universally destroyed the image), it was not lost to the American public, especially African-Americans, whose culture was always necessarily a versatile patchwork of borrowed elements of innovation. In 'Five Fingers' they were given the opportunity to discover the essence of the story. The serious young man had to make additional efforts to overcome social barriers and betrayals so that his merit could be recognized. This seems to be a theme that is universal to modernity, but every culture has its own way of expressing and solving it. "Five Fingers" presented it in a way many Americans could relate to as well as Chinese. Is the movie only of historical value? Certainly not. First, this problem has not disappeared. Second, some new features leave much of the film as fresh today as they did on the first release. The action is also well staged, and the performances are a bit too serious, but crisp. The movie may be overly long, but the story is very complex. And there are wonderful standards like the confrontation in the salon, the fight on the way to the contest, the strange double final. <br /> <br /> looks definitely better on a theater screen, but still impressive for the home: recommended.
