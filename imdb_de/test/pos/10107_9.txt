I love horror movies, but I think they work a lot better if they hide a dramatic influence (eg The Devil's Backbone, The Exorcist). This is that kind of movie, and it's not just scary and scary, if you have to, it's really beautiful too. A story of two sisters starts very slowly. So, if you want to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes, you will be disappointed. Actually, this is not a ghost story, though there are some. It's a bit more complex and it's made to knock Ringu and The Grudge out of the ring without sweating. A story?? is a much smarter movie than these great cultural hits, because he really cares about his characters and the direction is flawless. Every detail in this movie will make you breathless if you are the person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie. The show is great, especially by the stepmother and the main girl. These two are worth the price of the ticket alone. Do yourself a favor and watch this great movie.
