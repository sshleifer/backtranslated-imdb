This is one of the films that are very underrated. I vote again for an underrated movie. This movie has a good story, maybe a bit far-fetched, but it could happen. Sean Astin (one of my favorite actors) shows us a good performance again. The man does a great job in acting, but is never recognized for his roles. He has done a good job since the Goonies. Not only he, but Louis Gosset JR. makes a buoyancy. I thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters, but who cares? All in all, this is a good movie that will sometimes bring you to the edge of your seat and the plot keeps the movie moving. I enjoyed this movie and hopefully the rest of you too.
