I loved that. It starts out as a pretty normal, somewhat cumbersome French art film, and then, halfway, it's turned upside down. This part is brilliant because you realize that you have not seen 2 plots. Unfortunately, the end does not make much sense, which is a pity. Oh, and it's brilliantly filmed.
