About 12 minutes after the song, in the scene where Daryl Hannah and JFK Jr first hug, a really nice song is played ... What's that song ?! And from whom is it sung? It's a song that sounds very romantic, and it's a singer, pianist, etc. I've tried everything in the world to look up the music on Google and iTunes, and so forth, but it just does not get on even lyrics websites. So if you hear it, I'd like to know enough about it so I can try to either get the CD with this song or find it in iTunes. I do not know if my email is clapping, I'm new on this topic ... but I'll look back here.
