I saw this movie for the first time at IFC. Which is a great network to watch underground movies. I saw this movie and I thought it was a pure drama and a story that does not contain water. But it's really worth it to see it. The main character is in such a harsh condition and you hate it when you see that he refuses help, but no matter what you just do not hate. His devotion to the Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the movie is great too. Sometimes you feel like you can see what he sees, feel what he feels in certain situations. This movie does not let you know or reject a gap in the storyline. There are NO gaps (in my opinion). I've always been a fan of foreign films, especially now because movies were so bad in America. I really enjoy the foreign attitudes because I think it can take you on a journey and sometimes understand another culture. This movie did all these things to me and more. Watch this movie and if you do not know any foreign movies, this is a great start.
