This is a great movie! It's fun for everyone, including adults. We have Jason Voorhees / Leatherface as a murderer along with other crazy characters. Very funny movie for kids of all ages. Does this have to be rented every time we went to the video store! Buster and Babs are a good couple, and I have to love the duck. He is probably my favorite character! I've never been big in the TV series, but this movie brings back so many great memories. Must be seen for families, fans of the show or anyone else! Nice, no matter how small or old you are! RENT NOW IN YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE! <br /> <br /> P.S. NEED A DVD RELEASE!
