(Spoiler?) <br /> <br /> I heard something about the special effects. But that should distract from the movie. The movie is an exciting movie. And that is very good. From this point of view, this film rocks. Franke rocks. Enjoy the hearts of plastic to your heart's content. So no complaints for this movie. Unless you look at English dub, which is a total farce. It creates the illusion that it is a B-movie. <br /> <br /> One complaint I have is the music video on the DVD. It does not say who sings it. I would like to know. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Repeatable: 5/10
