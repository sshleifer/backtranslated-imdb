In "Checking Out," Peter Falk plays an elderly New Yorker who calls his children home so they can be with him before planning suicide. As the film progresses, we see the shortcomings of all the others and other issues. While some people interpret this as a "heartwarming" movie, I enjoyed it the most because Peter Falk's character did not let him down, and sometimes even worn out a bit. <br /> <br /> So maybe not the best movie ever, but still worth seeing. I've long thought that Peter Falk has the perfect look to play that kind of role, what with his glass eye and everything else. Including Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold and Shera Danese (the real wife of Falk).
