Impressive! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost glam rock movie of the 70s. This movie guarantees a simple look to see what can be achieved with almost no budget, but with a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film seems too obvious, but it is saved by its eccentricities. The chance to take a look at how Glam Rock manifests itself in Australia will thrill fans of the genre. This movie used to be seen twice in the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the kind of movie that Oz is. Although it's not as frivolous or well-built as RHPS, having fun with Oz is hard. <br /> <br /> Amazingly enough, Oz has aged well - perhaps a byproduct of how determined it is in real Australia in 1976. The course of the story shows that many of the researched ideas would eventually enter the mainstream. The film's willingness to prioritize gay characters is remarkable, especially because it is in the "revolution" period for the Australian gay rights boom. The direction lacks sophistication, and much of the dialogue could have benefited from one or two additional designs. Somehow, these flaws increase the appeal of the movie, which is graciously unpretentious. Similar to Australia in the 70s, this film has a certain naive charm. <br /> <br /> There are several connections to the original Australian productions of the Rocky Horror Show that keep the obsessive busy. <br /> <br /> Oz is certainly a little classic and a potential cult favorite worth reviewing. Laugh at the nasty fashion of the 70s, swing with the AusRock soundtrack, drop EVERY expectation at the door and Oz will probably be thrilled.
