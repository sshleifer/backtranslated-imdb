"Hollywood Cavalcade" is a mildly entertaining film from 1939, in which the two leading actors of the 20th Century Fox, Don Ameche and Alice Faye, play the lead role and contain a few jokes. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a Max Sennett guy. Michael Connors (Ameche), who brings an actress, Molly Adair (Faye), to Hollywood, makes her a great, silent comedian who eventually brings her into more dramatic roles. He becomes extremely successful with her as a star. Obsessed with his work, he is absolutely shocked when she and her lead man (Alan Curtis) run away and marry. He is so shocked that he drops her. She and her husband go on and on, and Connor's studio loses money at an alarming price. Before you know it, he's done. Molly wants to help and asks Connors to stage her next movie. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of Keystone Kop footage, which is pretty funny, and some fantastic slapsticks from Buster Keaton, which is wonderful. The film also has a scene from "The Jazz Singer" when the talkies take over. The joke, of course, has to do with Rin Tin-Tin, for whom Zanuck wrote earlier. In a scene, Rinnys coach brings him as a potential contract player for Connors Studio. Connors throws both out of his office. A few scenes later, it is revealed that Rin-Tin-Tin is # 1 at the box office. The role of the famous German Shepherd in this film is by Rin Tin-Tin jr. Played, whose father died in 1932, a month before his 14th birthday, in Jean Harlow's arms. Fortune smiled at him in the end. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye is very pretty and doing a good job, just like Ameche who delivers an energetic performance. J. Edward Bromberg and Stuart Erwin offer very good support. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not sure what it is - history, comedy, romance or drama. However, "Hollywood Cavalcade" is still good to watch.
