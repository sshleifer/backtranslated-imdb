This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one. "THE HOLLOW" is a great Hercule Poirot novel, and the twist at the end belies most people. I'm overjoyed that this film has remained absolutely faithful to the novel. There was no major difference I could see. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced earlier in the story than in the novel. The acting was great and the music was as always of amazing quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles. In no other movie I've seen so far, Poirot has been portrayed so brilliantly! Hats off to the producers - they have made a film that I will long cherish along with many others!
