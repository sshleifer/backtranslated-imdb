Greystoke is without doubt the best Tarzan movie I have ever seen. Christopher Lambert portrays a very believable man trying to return to the world of humanity alongside the fantastic Ian Holm. The fight of John to leave the jungle and the monkeys that raised him is quite moving. Some very memorable scenes, under which Lambert creates the jungle sounds for the romantic interest, and the scene in which he witnesses the death of his monkey father. Tarzan's feelings for both worlds are well developed and you really feel for him. <br /> <br /> An excellent and underrated movie.
