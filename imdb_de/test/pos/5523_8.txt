Haha, what a great little movie! Wayne Crawford strikes again, or rather, it was his first big punch, an insanely entertaining little ball of manic kitsch energy disguised as a psycho-killer movie. It is indeed a brilliant satire about the post-Hippy American culture in the transfer country, though the film was actually filmed independently in Miami. It resists any kind of studio-oriented convention or plot device I can think of: SOMETIMES AUNT MARTHA DREADFUL THINGS may not be a very tech savvy movie, but it's a wonderful little piece of Americana made by people who are cheap were honest, ambitious, resourceful and had bullets of steel. It took guts, nerves, and malice to make this film, which surprisingly passed the test of time. This movie is fresh, lively, vivid, memorable and sexy enough to appeal to just about anyone with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I dug in a time last year when I was fascinated by "Star" Wayne Crawford (here billed under his pseudonym Scott Lawrence), a maestro of what is only referred to as a regional filmmaking can, mostly in the B-class. He's a writer, producer, director and actor in one, probably best known for the 1980's' 80s apocalyptic favorite, NIGHT OF THE COMET. Here he plays Stanley, the pants that carry half of a pair of truly wonderful characters, apparently gay Spree killers on the Lam after knocking off an old lady in Baltimore for her jewelry. Unsung screen legend Abe Zwick is absolutely convinced that Paul, posing as Stanley's aunt Martha, is the crossdressing brains of the outfit that made Stanley believe he was murdering to ensure his loyalty. Martha looks as feminine as the sailors of the SOUTH PACIFIC Accompaniment Choir in her coconut bikini tops, but somehow nobody seems to notice - or does not care? - that she is a He, has no visible income opportunities, to annoy all day long where Stanley is, and whirls around in her neighborhood with a butcher knife in the neighborhood. Only in America ... <br /> <br /> When the movie opens, the two have just arrived in Florida and settled in an old Ward Cleaver home, a harshly lit and designed TV house, that's clich√© as surreal. In a memorable scene, Martha and an unwelcome housemate are sitting on the couch talking problems and drinking Budweiser cans in one of the most intriguing, subversive sequences I've ever seen outside of a John Waters movie. Then there's Stanley, who always gets into trouble because he's a mop-hippie with an STP patch on his waistcoat driving a psychedelic van that's as subtle as the Batmobile. He drinks his milk directly from the box, sniffs with blond bombshells and hoards donuts in an old cigar box for a quick snack. I think opposites attract. <br /> <br /> But Stanley also objected that he does not like it when the young ladies with whom he is stoned are trying to take off his pants, and it seems always to be Aunt Martha's job to take him out the trouble that inevitably arises. The corpses pile up, a curious junkie blackmails her to use her house as a flop, Stanley's birthday cake is crushed, and all meet at the local pizza shop before heading to the woodshed in the backyard for a hookah hash, where the girls dance in her underwear. Things get out of control when one of the neighbors tries to become a bit too chummy with Martha, who of course prefers keeping people at arm's length when they invite themselves to a nice chat. And this is a woman who wears not only a butcher's knife, but also a loaded 38 in her panties. Eventually, the weird duo find themselves with a corpse, a baby and no place to go, and eventually flee to an abandoned movie studio where the technical crew has undoubtedly borrowed the equipment used for film production. I just hope that they first politely asked for permission and were cleaned up after themselves. <br /> <br /> Of course, a word has to be said about Stanley and Martha / Paul's relationship, since the fact that they are at least the two is dancing around As a gay couple, the main content of the conspiracy was suggested to overlook. We never see the two getting intimate, and although Stanley mockingly speaks of "balling" in one scene, their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. It is certainly not a "gay" film, with plenty of female nudity and a hint of misogyny in the 70s, which can not be denied either. Stanley & Paul have never done their implied sexuality on screen, even though the film would certainly have had the courage to do so if it was important. It's not about the story is not about their sex, it's about the bond they share and how strange it is. Not that they are gay, but that they are the individuals they are, two of the strangest film creations my TV has ever inhabited. <br /> <br /> The film is unique. It was done for a few thousand dollars, which looked like rented studiosets, occasional local work, and a few public places where a camera crew could sneak in when no one was looking. The dialogue is completely bizarre, worldly and gloriously esoteric. Not everyone will like it, but for those who have a sense of cheap American horror / thriller like THE NIGHT GOD SCREAMED, HELP ME! I'm obsessed, blood and blood and children should not play with dead things, you have a winner here. <br /> <br /> 8/10: Normally I would say, "deserves a DVD restoration," but somehow I think that would ruin the stuffy atmosphere of the movie. And Wayne Crawford, you rule.
