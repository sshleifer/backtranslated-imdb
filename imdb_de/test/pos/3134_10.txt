Along with the still undervalued The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It's a Western of extraordinary beauty and narrative purity, well executed by members of the Ford corporation, including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond and Harry Carey Freedom and community. It is also notable for a much more positive depiction of Indians than in most of Ford's films. Despite all the mistakes, Ford remains the highest poet of American democracy.
