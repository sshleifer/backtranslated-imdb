This sequel proves that Tim Burton was the best choice in any respect to ever make a Batman movie. The story centers on Baman attacking three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (the creeping Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the eminent Christopher Walken). Maybe the best entry in the series has it all: complex themes, complex characters, and a dark tone that really stands out. The cast is just wonderful, though DeVito is eye-catching as a multi-layered penguin. Here is a guy who is angry, pathetic, funny and, above all, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's picture consultants still makes me shudder. In other words, the cast is just a pleasure to see and everyone turns in first-rate performances. <br /> <br /> I do not hesitate to say that "Batman Returns" is my favorite of all published Batmans (sorry, Dark Knight fans). If you want a superhero movie that has a lot more to offer in addition to eye-catching effects and action on a grand scale, then watch this highly underrated movie. <br /> <br /> At least the best movie Tim Burton ever made.
