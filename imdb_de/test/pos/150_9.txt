The best thing about Thirst, the latest movie from Chanwook Park, is the Anti-Twilight. Some of you may take that as a minus, but in reality it is a big advantage. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously and the violent love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts between the two characters - Sang-hyeon is a priest undergoing a medical experiment that turns him, unknowingly, into a sickly but truly blue vampire, and Tae-joo with her mother and her " Idiot "brother The latter is killed by Sang-as in a very strong melodrama. The story and the characters are nowhere terribly weepy and bland and the consequences that religion brought early (Sang, for example, is considered a healer, because, thanks to his vampirism, he's even risen from the dead.) He just can not be and do not know. Anyone who goes beyond good versus evil can push it kinematically into another plane. <br /> <br /> That thirst also rises to the ingenious standard of park art along with Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and the underrated I am a cyborg, but that's OK, should be considered given. Durst is a movie with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters, shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is partly satirical, partly romantic / erotic, sometimes dramatic and ultimately fantastic. And it does not always treat vampire sim as a kind of simple horror movie set-up (though the horror movie park has more than a part of the scary scenes). It's more akin to the movie Near Dark, in which the word vampire was never mentioned, but you know it was that, and treated it with sincerity and a sort of lucid trail of attention, and that the disease itself and its impact on The existence of a person may be more frightening than the killings or bloodshed. Once you see a vampire jump up or heal his wounds, you've seen them all. Thirst also has a bad sense of humor, much like Oldboy, only here with a bite (pun) intended to emphasize bizarre physical states of being. An example of this is the priest's preference to suck blood from people in comas by sucking their blood tubing to the floor. Or the way Tae-Joo clings to a fraction of humanity by keeping her mother alive, even if she had something like a stroke, and can only blink with her eyes and touch a finger to catch the bloodsucking I have brought pain and horror to her home. But these moments are like icing to make it a complete experience. What thirst finally holds in mind is the coming together of elements, of drama and existential pain, of a Buman-surreal sense of Catholicism (I especially loved the dynamism between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who wants to give up his arm for bloodsucking but also really a vampire) and of the eroticism: The scenes, in which the priest finally surrenders to Tae-Joo, are incredible in their speed and their shot length and how real it becomes. Not in a pornographic way, but in the sense of the liberation and flight of these characters, which does not go far beyond the scope of the story. <br /> <br /> If it's not as good as Oldboy, there's nothing to pick. Not all the films Chanwook Park conducts will reach the size of his masterpiece (and at least he is always referred to as the man who made the film). But Thrist is an excellent addition to his work and, in general, to the serious consequences of vampire movies. The movie is crisp and exciting and even dangerous (and in which white space for "daylight" the characters live!), The humor is dark and funny, the acting is intense and moody - especially through subtle beatings by Song Kang. ho and the quirky, evil and surprising vulnerability of Kim OK-vin, and the end when it's finally here is one of the really great vampire movie-makers you'll talk about for years. In a battle between Thirst and Twilight Thirst takes over in the first round the knock-out. It's harder to call between Let the Right In or Near Dark. 9.5 / 10
