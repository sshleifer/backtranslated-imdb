This movie was great! Tangi Miller and Flex have done a great job. They both look good and both made it. Tasha Smith was as funny as the cousin, and she could not stay out of business. Essence held it down for her girl when she needed her. Aloma was cute and played a lovely grandmother whom she really reminded me of my grandmother revealing his sexiness on the big screen. Damn! he was fine! Tangi looked flawless and sexy and has been one step up since Felicity. Overall, the film had many "A" lists, actors and actresses. It was funny, sexy, crazy, touching, loving, emotional and wonderful. This movie is a must! Go to DVD now if you do not have it!
