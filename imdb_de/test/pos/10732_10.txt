I've seen a lot of Dustin Hoffman's films, like Straw Dogs or Rain Man, and I liked them, but all too often his characters are quiet or even shy. I expected him to be the same in this movie as he would in Straw Dogs, but I saw a completely different person. He was much more energetic in this movie, somehow reminding me of Al Pacino in Serpico. The film was very interesting from beginning to end. I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was prepared to stay close to his son. This movie is also revealing. Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to compromise without questioning other people.
