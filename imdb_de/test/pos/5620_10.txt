The story itself is routine: a boy runs away from home and ends up in a fighting music school for children. He convinces a famous violinist to sponsor the school. The film is a splinter of shootings over 11 weeks and leaves many funny gaps that the attentive viewer can find for themselves. <br /> <br /> Even if the whiskers of the plot may already have been, the movie is entitled to its music and acting. There is a lot of music with classical works by Heifetz and The Meremblum Orchestra, one of the leading youth symphonies of the day, and the music is excellent. Alone, makes the picture worth seeing. Conducting and scoring were in the best hands: those of Alfred Neumann. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is a study of contrasts. The children in the orchestra, most of whom had little or no acting experience, must have driven director Archie Mayo to madness, gazing into the camera, overreacting the parts they owned and following the instructions given to them , But the spontaneity that results from a lack of training adds an interesting charm to the picture. The experienced actors were wonderful with the material they had to work with. Walter Brennan was perfectly cast in his role, one he imitated in real life. Joel McCrea and Andrea Leeds fit perfectly for their parts. And the supporting role was a true who's who of the character actors: Marjorie Main, Arthur Hollow, Paul Harvey, Charles Coleman, Perry Ivins and Porter Hall in his typical role of the Heavy - all ideally cast. And the snappy players: Jessie Arnold, John Hamilton, Marjorie Wood, Jimmy Flavin, Dulcie Day, the gritty Lee Phelps in his usual role as a cop and many, many more. If you're a fan of character actors, this movie will bring back many memories. Overall, the picture is very enjoyable and is recommended, even if you are not a classical music fan. <br /> <br /> tvcat
