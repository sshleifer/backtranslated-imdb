I had the pleasure of seeing Saltimbanco live before watching the video version of the show. Nothing compares to actually being there, but the people behind the video did an amazing job of capturing the taste, the feeling, the feeling, and more. The wonderful performances of Saltimbanco's amazingly amazing troupe are beautifully captured throughout. The video flows as smoothly and artfully as the production itself. A wonderful experience.
