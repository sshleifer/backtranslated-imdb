Rent this from my local, because it was the only new British movie available this week. I have never heard of the filmmaker or his other films (thanks IMDB). Eventually, somebody made a good, young British comedy that neither Hugh Grant nor Forty Something was playing. The story is a moral story, but never preaching, thoroughly pleasing to a young and fresh cast. Luke Goss' cameo was surprisingly good, but he surprised me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'. Loved the color correction, especially in the nightclub sequences. Great music and a really original voice at work. Nine out of ten and worth the rent.
