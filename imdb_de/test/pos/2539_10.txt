The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva just eight years after the completion of this film only adds to the fact that the outstanding message of Dierector BAbenco is even more important. The film is split in half - the first in a reformatory in which a group of teenagers are abused and injured by violent law enforcement and guardians. The second background is the city, where instead they are limited by their own actions and morals. This includes attacking, holding, and killing various characters who enter their lives for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people. Particularly interesting is the character of Lalica, a transvestite who is the mother and lover of some children. Her reaction to the arrival of Sueli, a prostitute, is both poignant and tragic. <br /> <br /> There is no happy end to this story, and I recommend that you watch it with care, as there are some very uncomfortable scenes, especially in the first twenty minutes. However, it is important to know that this is not just a fictional story. The actors are not trained professionals, but boys selected from the streets of Sao Paulo. In fact, they have lived this life that is so vividly portrayed on screen, and in the case of da Silva, they died in the hands of the brutalized police. A documentation? A piece of fiction. Both are bordering on both, but are certainly a heart-licking substance and is a movie that makes you really breathless and thinks long after you look. <br /> <br /> 10/10
