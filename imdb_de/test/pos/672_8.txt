A great B-function. A virtual two-hander that is spread over the day (you can see how the stages were created and how it has to be played as a radio). Although it was only 77 minutes long, it was played in sequences that were something of a real time. Robert Ryan is the psychopath who imprisons Ida Lupino in her own home. Both are outstanding, especially the undervalued Lupino, whose initial independence and self-control soon breaks apart from Ryan's blatant intruder. Of course, this would all be bravery and nerves today, but the restraint shown by director Harry Horner (better known as Art Director) only adds to the excitement that is sometimes worthy of Hitchcock.
