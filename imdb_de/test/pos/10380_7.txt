NVA combines ostalgia humor, military comedy and teen movie. Although it's kind of typically German-cinematic-sentimental, I think it's a great and very funny movie. Not only will you laugh in NVA, but you will also get an insight into the East German armed forces of the late 1980s and learn how young recruits and professional soldiers experienced the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the German Democratic Party Republic. <br /> <br /> You'll enjoy NVA if you like Sonnenallee (another movie by Leander Hau√ümann), but not necessarily if you like Good Bye Lenin, who is much more serious and less obviously funny <br /> The action is acceptable. But look out for former boy band singer Kim Frank, who has only two facial expressions: natural and shocked saucer eyes!
