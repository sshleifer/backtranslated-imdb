And somewhere else a hard place. I have not seen this movie since I was young, maybe 12 or 13 years old, who knows. But I know that this is the movie where I taught masturbating. That's no joke. I have no idea if it is good by today's standards, but for me it was everything then. <br /> <br /> The only reason I feel so good about writing is that I'm sure no one will ever be able to read it. I mean, really, who is going to look up this movie these days? <br /> <br /> I have just discovered that I have not exhausted the minimum of ten lines for the length of the length I take most in a review. I had no idea that there was such a minimal length, but there I am, like a student trying to replenish a page in a diary, my ten lines. many thanks.
