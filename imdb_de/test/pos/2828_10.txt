The film had no help whatsoever when it came to advertising: if there was an advertisement on TV or radio, I did not see / hear it. The only newspaper ad I saw was on the opening weekend: a grubby, muddy B & W photo of Andy as Val-Com behind the prison bars with the headline: "WANTED! Runaway Robot!" (That was also the poster in front of the three cinemas that I saw on - NOT - NOT the nice little color poster on this page, with headshots of all the actors and Crimebuster's cartoon - which was really not that good - - she wanted an action A poster intended to help a potential audience decide whether to watch the movie - there were so many people who could not do it I did not come to theirs sold out choice and wanted to know what Heartbeeps is all about - and this poster did not help! This grubby image and the only other photos provided to the newspapers were so indistinguishable in B & W that they were worthless. ) There was NO trailer for the movie: just a slide at a theater, consisting of the word Heartbeeps in a heart shape, with a cupid arrow, and one that was a totally black image ar: just Andy and Bernadette's voices say, "Val-Com! My amusement center is not working! "" In my opinion, we should tell our owners about this? "This is no help for people who did not know the movie, and while filming, Andy told reporters that he could not eat once his plastic lips were attached were so that he would "load" breakfast and shoot fast "during the day. I do not know WHAT Bernadette did: At the time, though, I had wondered why they did not just sip protein drinks through long straws or eat astronaut puree over tubes. <br /> <br /> Phil-Co, the baby robot, seemed to have been the forerunner of Johnny-Five of Short Circuit, with the same eyes and a similar face. I tried to find out if they had the same designer, but no help. I've got vintage magazine articles about the movie, and the design team was immensely proud of their work and wanted to get a special prize for their innovative device to give Catzkill's cigars a steely "smoke." Shortly thereafter, LucasFilm did NOT use this device even though they had permission to return the Jedi scenes with Jabba the Hut: A man "steamed" around Jabba by blowing cigar smoke into a tube and joking that he needed everything he needed was a glass of brandy, and he would be a happy man. I thought that the use of LucasFilm's genuine tobacco products is insensitive to people who are disturbed by smoke. <br /> <br /> John Williams, who had recently replaced the late, great Arthur Fielder as the Boston Pops' Maestro (which became a rating hit), never recovered from Fielder's death and is now a shadow of his former glory ) used the show to promote films with which he supplied the music. He premiered "The Empire Strikes Back" there. and you think he helped Heartbeeps play some numbers there? The only thing critics liked about this movie was Williams' score - but it was NOT available! In 1982 I saw a vinyl album with half Heartbeeps and another movie - but it has disappeared. I have just seen and ordered the CD on this website tonight. If I ever get a scanner and have time to type in the articles, I want to create a Heartbeeps tribute site. I liked the movie and I do not care what dissenters say! <br /> <br /> The only problem with the film was that, in the end, it was logically dirty: the robots ran away from the factory to have the freedom to choose their own destiny, to make their own Decisions; But when the owners of the junkyard tell them that Phil has to go to the factory to program a "purpose," they do not even ask him; They just look at each other meaningfully and leave. On the way, each adult loses battery power and "dies." They are NOT REALLY dead because they are robots and only need new batteries, but it is treated as "death", with little Phil weeping and rolling over it. So, what was the point of it? Phil never comes back to the factory and gets "a purpose!" AND, of course, the junkyard owners could drive them with backup batteries or get all the battery charges; But the real point was to have this poignant scene where the robots all wore out and Phil just had to cry. <br /> <br /> In the end, Val-Com is a golf teacher and Aqua-Com is - I'm not sure what. Catskill is an ENTERTAINER - what else should he be? I am not sure if they made that clear. The junkyard owners seem to have it easy to lie on loungers and drink lemonade from Phil, their "bartender". Vals and Aquas new "daughter" Philsia - I think the name is - maybe it's Sylvania - does not seem to be much more than a table lamp. <br /> <br /> It's missing movie, which is sad - from photos I assume that the missing stuff is a sweet scene in which Phil celebrates Christmas and Val presents him with the steering wheel of a car; Aqua delivers a horn; Catskill has taken the fire-helmet to give Phil, as we saw; and they have Christmas trees. I do not know if missing footage provides better logic or if the authors simply can not imagine a better crisis / solution. The film was cut to 72 to 75 minutes to combine with other flawed films. No reason other than that. For a DVD, I'd love to be part of the build as I want to see cast crew interviews and John Williams and the interview with Merv Griffin. The making-of material; and edit and restore the missing material again to improve it.
