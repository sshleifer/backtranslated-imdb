A man is falsely accused of killing his friend in an aircraft factory fire, and he has to travel across the country to avoid the police and discover the real weird nature of the situation. Saboteur is a plotline that was later used as fuel for Hitchcock's classic North by Northwest. Saboteur benefits from some very good performances as well as masterful suspense sequences from the master himself. <br /> <br /> For any Hitchcock fan, this plot is a bit too familiar, but he could always share the story with his own memorable side characters and Penetrate Charades. Here is the sympathetic and charming Robert Cummings starring, and soon he visits many foreign and quirky characters, without resisting a troupe of circus artists, a rich businessman with hidden motives and a blind loner who shows him the best way to someone <br /> <br /> In terms of originality and quality, this is lacking in some areas, in particular the antagonist motif. Between Cummings and his leading actress, however, there is a beautiful chemistry, the often underrated Priscilla Lane and a really moving performance as a blind man by Vaughn Glaser. The best part is the last sequence that perfectly reflects what Hitchcock would later use in North by Northwest, only this time the highlight is on a statue in New York. Certainly not his best, but the master of suspense gives us some great moments to wait for.
