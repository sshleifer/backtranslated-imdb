I am really surprised that at the time of my review, this film has only a rating of 6.4. Although it's not a great movie, I think it's one of the best movies Dietrich has done, and it's a shame he's not considered high-profile anymore. I think the reason why I liked the movie so much is that Dietrich's usual stupid personality is not present as an "over-vamp" and her role forced her to actually act. I just hate watching film by film in the early days of her career, where she looked more like a cartoon or a clich√© than a real woman. I do not necessarily blame Dietrich for the stupid vampic films she shot in the 1930s - the audience loved her and made her famous. But here she showed that she really could act. After all, if I only looked at her in movies like MOROCCO, BLONDE VENUS and THE BLUE ANGEL, who would have guessed that she was well-placed to play a Gypsy! I was quite ready to hate the movie because of this casting decision, but it worked - it was pretty believable and it's fun to watch it! The film is essentially a vehicle only for Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich - the other minor characters are very subordinate to the film. Milland is a sought-after spy in Germany before World War II, and in his efforts to escape he encounters a rather playful lonely Gypsy (Dietrich) who immediately sees him as fulfilling the prophecy - in other words, her new lover! Milland is quite stuffy, but reluctantly agrees to travel in her car - he even wears body paint and pierces his ears to make him look like a gypsy (hence the title of the movie). Over time, he slowly begins to realize that under her very neglected appearance, a woman and romance is slowly unfolding. <br /> <br /> The movie in one word is "charming". A beautiful romance with a good dose of comedy and fun - just the picture you want when Hollywood is still made. Also note the power of Murvyn Vye as "Zoltan". He was very magnetic in the short time he was in the movie, and I loved his deep and beautiful voice. <br /> <br /> Finally a sad remark. While the film is set in Germany, the forthcoming Gypsy Holocaust is not mentioned. During the war, the Nazis have exterminated a large percentage of Gypsies throughout Germany, and the finale of the film is a little far-fetched.
