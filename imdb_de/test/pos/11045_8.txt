The simultaneous display of both films is not a bad idea to get a feel for the early film production and to act for the camera styles. I give Garbo (but not much), as far as their naturalness is concerned. Robeson is majestic. His appearance, however, is aimed at a large proscenium theater. What struck me was the film's themes for empowering women and minorities. There had not been any Hollywood movies out there that put the voices of fringe characters like Anna and Brutus to the fore. These were very progressive films for their time. It's likely that O'Neill saw the writing on the wall before anyone else talked about the future of America.
