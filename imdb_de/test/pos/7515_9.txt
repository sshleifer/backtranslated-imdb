Read a biography of the late George C. Scott and you'll discover why he was so talented. He was asked by an interviewer what his secret was when he made every character he played his own. Scott answered that he had a burning fire in him that drove him. In one of his last interviewers, he sadly declared that he had lost the ride. This was not the case when he starred in The Hospital. In this offer, he plays the talented doctor Bock, the medical director of one of the best hospitals in the country. However, life has caused him some debilitating problems, such as losing his wife through divorce, estranging himself from both his promising children and from all who are far worse, and holding himself physically powerless. At this point, he now becomes complacent, grumpy, and often fantasizes about various ways to commit suicide. His hospital was run by students and protesters from the neighborhood, incompetent physicians such as Drs. Welbeck (Richard Dysart) and a mysterious MD added to his list. who kills both patients and doctors because he believes he is "the wrath of the Lamb". (Barnard Hughes). Bock has few options. One is the promising doctor Brubaker (Robert Walden), whom he confides to himself by saying, "If there was a stove here, I would put my head in it." The second is a young woman named Barbara, who is attracted to Bock because he behaves like a wounded bear. Paddy Chayefsky has written the script and Arthur Hiller has staged this dramatically interesting, dark story very well, but still a vehicle that was lit by the fire of George C. Scott. ****
