SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love the Simpsons and have seen every single episode that ever came out. I have to admit, the first season is by far the most underrated season. This is the most underrated first season episode. The episode begins with the family playing a scrabble game to prepare Bart for an intelligence test he has to do at school. He says the game is stupid and he does not want to play it, but he has to do it. He writes a word that annoys Homer, and he tracks Bart in the house. The next day, Ms. Krabappel assures the class that the test is not part of her grade, just a test that would tell them what their future would look like. Bart can not answer a question. He thinks fast. He quickly changes the test with Martin Prince, the smartest in the class. Later that day, Marge and Homer are called to the director's office to discuss Barts behavior. Suddenly the school psychologist comes out of nowhere and tells Skinner, Homer and Marge that Bart is a genius and should go to a special school for the gifted. Bart agrees because he does not have to do any homework. The next day, Homer Bart drives to the new school. He is presented to everyone and everything. Unfortunately, his day is not very good. The clever students take their lunch smartly, he can not read comic books, but he does anyway and is criticized by his fellow students. Fortunately for Bart, he and Homer have a great time together, but Marge bought tickets for an opera. They go to the opera and make fun of it. The next day he goes to his old school, but is mocked by his friends. They call him a dot woman. In his new school Bart is to do a chemistry experiment. He does it wrong and blows up the school and gets green. The psychologist tells Bart to tell him why he did it. Instead, Bart says that he wants to go undercover and goes back to his old school to watch other kids. The psychologist is fascinated and asks Bart to explain it on a sheet of paper. He thinks it's too hard and instead writes a confession that he really is not a genius. He gives it to the psychologist. All he cares about is that he misspelled the word confession. That night, Homer bathes beard and Bart tells him that he really is not a genius and that he has cheated on the test. Homer gets angry and chases Bart around the house, while Lisa and Marge casually look at her. Overall, this is a very underrated first season episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
