It does not matter if draw or leelee are totally babes, but there are many girls who are so pretty and hot, but they seem so nerdy. This movie is not an Oscar-like movie, but at least it has a good stance on how life is for young people or for "real" people. It made us laugh and learned to accept others as they truly are. This film represents the real world and what matters.
