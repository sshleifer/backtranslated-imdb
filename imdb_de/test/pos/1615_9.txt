Brett Piper makes again a very good movie, which is thrown away by the so-called "film experts". The budget is low, but it's fun, and the lead actress is very sexy. I wish I could see more of Irene Joseph. Have fun watching. I bought the DVD and I liked it. The special effects are stop-motion animations and much better than the computer-generated crap they call effects today. I always like Brett Piper movies, and if you liked them I would recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead, and everything he did. I look forward to seeing more of his work and more of Ms Joseph. I just can not understand why this woman was not in movies anymore because her acting is excellent.
