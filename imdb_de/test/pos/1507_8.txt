In the late eighties and early nineties, the demise and death of independent video companies such as Vestron and Media turned off Italian horror films for much of the American public. Simultaneously (?) Italian genre films also decreased in quality and profitability. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, films such as Primal Rage, "sequels" such as Beyond The Door III, Troll 2 and some Dario Argento movies were screened but most remained unpublished in the US for almost a decade or more. Films from these lost years were very much sought after and talked among the horror fans. Of these films, due to the legions of Lucio Fulci fans and probably one of the most hyped of all, Cat In The Brain is the fact that it was headed not only by director but also in their idol, Fulci. <br /> <br /> Although Fulci is not the best, it is still better than most of his later efforts. His rabid fanbase will probably love it. Italian horror and giallo fans like it too, depending on their tastes, but I'm not sure of anybody else. People who only look at Hollywood stuff may not want to hear the many glowing reviews here. <br /> <br /> One thing that intrigued me personally was the scenes in which Benito Mussolini was probably Italy's only lasting contribution, Cinecitta Studios. The name is immediately recognizable for every fan of Italian films. Until I saw it here, I could only imagine what it looked like.
