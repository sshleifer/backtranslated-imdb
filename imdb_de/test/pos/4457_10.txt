The name "Lucio Fulci" evokes images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of Mai fans. With films such as "Zombi 2," "City of the Living Dead," "The Beyond," and "The New York Ripper," Fulci is known for being one of history's craziest directors. And although many of his later films certainly justify his reputation, Fulci's films did not contain nearly as much blood and courage until the release of "Zombi 2" in 1979 that he was known for doing so. Rather, they were mostly blood-free at work on more traditional shocks and resorting to disturbing images. "Do not Torture a Duckling" hardly contains Gore, but is one of his best. <br /> <br /> "Do not Torture a Duckling" is located in a small Sicilian town where superstition reigns instead of logic. Citizens are suspicious of outsiders and others who often avoid them. After a series of child murders, many people dive into the city, including Andrea Martelli (Thomas Milan), who tries to expose the truth about the murders as they go on. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable movie. It is very well done with an excellent cast, filled with many favorites of Italian exploitation cinema. It also contains a solid score as well as many creative camera moves or Lucio Fulci. But the real attraction of "Do not Torture a Duckling" is the disturbing nature of the movie. Little children, who are around 12 years old, mock the way they mock disabled people, visit prostitutes, and suggest sex with older women. It also contains some snappy comments about the middle class and the Catholic Church. For such reasons, "Do not Torture a Duckling" was blacklisted across Europe when it was first published. It has never been shown in the United States. Nevertheless, "Do not Torture a Duckling" is an outstanding performance in the Giallo cinema as well as the best work of Lucio Fulci. I really can not recommend it enough, check it out.
