I have to admit, thanks to this movie I am now afraid of mannequins. hahaha. <br /> <br /> but yes, at first the acting in this movie is pretty loud, at least by my standards. Most actors are pretty decent in their roles. the script also seems to be pretty good, certainly some cheesy stuff in it, but also a decently written character and some damn scary scenes. I'll still shudder to think of this one scene with the guy and the mannequins. brrr. <br /> <br /> Yes, I say you should check this movie, it is pretty good and very entertaining. a good 8/10
