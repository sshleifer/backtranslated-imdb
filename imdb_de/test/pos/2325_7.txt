This is a very underrated movie, to say the least. As noted in previous posts, this film has a somewhat casual and highly implausible script, but you say, "Who cares?" when shooting milk (or a drink of your choice here) through the nose. It was indeed a rare mix of actors who were in sync. While Kelsey Grammar is obviously a talented actor (reference 'Frasier', this movie), the supporting actors / actresses perform their roles pretty well. I found it interesting, as they threw in the section on Duane Martin, who blew the shot in the "big game" for the Navy's basketball team; If any of you are a basketball fan you will remember Martin's 'White Men Can not Jump' and 'Above the Rim', and you know that Martin had a short stay in the NBA with the Knicks. Nice, as they have credible characteristics such as these introduced. Rob Schneider's anal-restrained character was the perfect match for Grammar's calm stance. Lauren Holly played the brave sexpot with a brain good enough to make you successful. This is a movie that makes you laugh, even though you've seen it many times ... the comic pieces in this movie are definitely going to last. I still laugh 12 years later. <br /> <br /> "Is that one of my chickens?" "Uh ... no, that's a parrot ... from the Caribbean." "Well, do not let it fly away ... this is dinner." "Arrrrr ..... arr."
