I was very touched by the young life experiences of a man who has risen so far in the academic world. A hard life, surrounded by the love of a close family and an extended family of companions, created a person who can be successful in the world. Mostly the Hispanic culture is shown, as I have always observed and admired them - diligent, optimistic and really family-oriented. The points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the Catholic Church. Undoubtedly, the actress who played the mother deserves an Oscar. Her prayers for her missing son moved me to tears. I will recommend this amazingly thoughtful movie to my friends and family.
