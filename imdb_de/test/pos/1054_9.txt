I just got this movie for Christmas and have already added it to my favorites list. A cute and simple story that makes a nice movie. Who could not love Uncle Felix or have no mouth water at the sound of all these dishes? Certain points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance by Alexander Yardley and also to Reginald Gardiner, who played John Sloane, the incredibly boring fiancee. Really a gem that you can see every Christmas.
