This is certainly a quality film with a classic cast. As for movies about Carlos the Jackal, this movie beats Bruce Willis' feeble efforts in 'The Jackal' to a bloody pulp, then spits it on. I'm a bit surprised that this film has not gotten more votes, which is obviously a "sleeper". Too bad, because this movie is definitely worth a watch. It's smart and never boring. See it 7/10
