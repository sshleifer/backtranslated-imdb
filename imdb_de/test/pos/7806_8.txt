It's a parody, it's an intelligent comedy, it has a pathetic action and choreography (and this is deliberately intentional), good vocal songs, good performances of the entire cast, brilliant by Amir, Salman and Paresh, and above all a script that is im Indian cinema is so rare, even in the comedy (David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra, etc.). The story is about two deserts whose only purpose is to become rich and famous by which means. They come across such a way when they find out that a rich NRI is coming to India to marry. The rest of the story is about Oneupmanship and how these Wastels try to understand each other. The entire cast is perfect from Deven Verma to Viju Khote. Songs are rightly placed and funny. The surprise package is Salman, who acts with perfect timing, and this particular act gave him his style of comedy. <br /> <br /> All a fiddly movie you should not ignore if you like Indian cinema.
