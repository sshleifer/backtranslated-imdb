This is one of the most satisfying in the book about TV customizations. The actress, who makes us believe that a Borg could be sexy, makes us believe that a spy and traitor can have some redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> The TV plot line does not follow the story of Cornwell, but is exciting and rewarding as a retelling of a damn good yarn. If you have a romantic yen in uniform, a lot of sexual energy is created between our husband Sharpe and the lying bitch. I wish her role were closer to that in the books. But no matter, there are enough heroes who have wronged, the hero is redeemed, the hero is in rage, the hero in flight and the hero in combat, so you are clear about your DVD game.
