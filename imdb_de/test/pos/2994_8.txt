First love. Puppy Love. We all experienced it, even if it was not as sweet as the ones sharing the protagonists. "Friends" is an adaptation of the classic "The Blue Lagoon" from 1949 and his remakes from 1980 (the most popular with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While "The Blue Lagoon" brings the two young lovers to a deserted island with no contact to civilization, "Friends" goes the other way and it will certainly sound much truer and be a harder film for the contemporary audience. Paul and Michelle, who turn their backs on the family and the adult world for a variety of reasons, to live together in a small cottage in southern France. Since she is innocent only with each other and in her childhood, her friendship is slowly becoming much more as she struggles to fight this sweet coming age story. This movie is still controversial as the actors are teenagers and they certainly see the age of the movie (15 and 14 1/2). The film contains a touch of child abuse, nudity, teenage sex and teenage pregnancy. However, the actual controversy is not the issue, but the fact that the love of Paul and Michelle is portrayed as a natural and healthy relationship. While this worked well for stranded lovers in another time and on a desert island, in a modern environment she poses some very difficult moral issues. Legislation prohibiting sex between minors is in effect in almost all countries, and the lack of sexual education among teenagers is considered to be one of the causes of the increase in unwanted pregnancies and teenage abortions. Is a film like this just child pornography or a slap in the face to confront our own hypocrisy about a modern society that is not aimed at adolescent parents and laws that clearly contradict human nature and hormonal development? but are necessary to prevent child abuse? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are no easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them. As an artistic piece, this movie is truly a forgotten and raw gem. The script is advanced with the utmost simplicity, albeit somewhat sappiness, but never draws any punches to formulate its message, though it's a bit slow by today's standards. The photography is beautiful and there are scenes of great beauty. The acting of the two protagonists varies in some scenes from really terrible to wonderfully innocent and believable in others. Pop music, unlike most productions, is now tastefully used, and sometimes the lyrics speak the minds of the protagonists. All in all, this is a wonderful piece, even if the moral values ​​do not agree with your own.
