I'm a new convert you might as well say. I borrowed the DVDs from my local library. I have been interested in Samurai since I saw 'The Last Samurai'. My dad told me he saw Shintaro as a child. He said that it was pretty good. We are up to the 3rd series. I absolutely love it. It takes a bit of getting used to the synchronized English voices of the characters who speak Japanese, but I still like it very much. It's a bit strange to watch the easy pauses when the ninja stars are thrown at characters and they stick to a tree or a wall. I was not used to that, but now it's me. But I think that's the technology they had in the 60s. I noticed that Shintaro is friendly, friendly and helpful. He is very modest. Most of the time he does not make any big comments to himself (he just says he's better than the enemy Ninja). I admire Shintaro for these qualities. It is really interesting to see the sword art of Koichi Ose. It's amazing This series is for anyone interested in samurai.
