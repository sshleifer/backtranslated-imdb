At the opening I was excited to hear part of "Chevaliers De Sangreal", but wanted more and bought the said Hans Zimmer piece. Perhaps the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written! This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece, even without religious considerations. You can visit the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent camera. The opening at CERN, where the "God Particle" or the largest amount of antimatter is created with STUNNING images, is an immediate indication that predicts the excellence of this film. Who does not love Hanks? The plot and twists in this movie are just great and well thought-out to the amazingly twisted climax. This film proposes a satisfactory compromise between science and religion, although there are many closed minds on both sides. "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind." A. Einstein
