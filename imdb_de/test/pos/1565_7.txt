At the first glance of this film, the camera's perspective immediately gives the impression that it's a low-budget movie that can make you bored or press the stop button. Surprisingly, the storyline occurs and is played through the screen in a way that I think is the most related. I've reached this movie at 7, but like most would, he would have thought that it should be a 10, you will understand it, if you see him, because it is a rarity that a movie with the feelings of a person in Contact comes and how life should be shown by a TV set. Most films try to amaze you by their special effects, twists and turns, etc., this movie was a real hand, showed a good movie that is accompanied by an Alabama plot, the most as a waste of a few Would feel hours. Wish I had made the popcorn maker good!
