I read the comment above and can not believe it! Of course it's a children's movie, it's an adaptation of a children's book !! This movie is easy to get, try play.com or amazon and it's very easy to get a copy! The jokes are funny for kids and adults alike, and the adventure is clean and without violence! It is perfect for kids of all ages! The songs are fabulous and yes, a bit repetitive, but that's what kids need, and as I watched them, my little ones heard "hi hi cocalorum" all night! They loved it, a story of innocence and friendship! Very nice and worth it for children and adults of all ages!
