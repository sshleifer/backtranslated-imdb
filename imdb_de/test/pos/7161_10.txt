I have just returned from the GLBT Film Festival at AMC Loews 34th in NY. A friend told me about this movie. The response of the audience was very positive! Many good, solid laughs and some quiet moments of realization. First class in all areas. A film that makes you think and then realizes how happy we all would be if we could turn back time and live without shame or guilt. I can imagine that this will come close to the Audience Award, if not win! What surprised most was the fact that the film seemed to begin as a satire and then slowly becomes a real commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the group in which it satirized. It's not mean humor at the expense of a group, just a slow realization that we would all fare better if we just returned to the gentle innocence we all started with.
