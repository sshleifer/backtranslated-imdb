"Here On Earth" is a surprisingly beautiful romantic story about Samantha that has both boy problems and health issues. As her love for her current boyfriend, Jasper, subsides, her love for Kelley blossoms like a new spring flower. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very touching, very warm, very romantic and touching. I enjoyed every part of this movie ... and that's pretty rare! I highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers! This is a movie you do not want to miss !!! : D <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you're a very sentimental person who cries when watching movies, BRING FABRIC !!! On the other hand, it was a really good movie !!! Very romantic ... and surprisingly good !!! : D <br /> <br />
