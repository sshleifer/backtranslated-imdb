Could contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> This is just a good movie. Lots of good stupid things to laugh about. However, do not look at the TV version, they cut off too much. Dom Deluise is pretty impressive as the Mafia Don, who was hired to kill Robin. All I can say about his ten minutes is a long drive from Jersey. They'll love it too, as they check the script to make sure Robin gets another shot. Also: 12th Century Fox. <br /> <br /> Anything bad? The rappers at the beginning and end seem rather outdated. The songs were rather lame. Once, while watching this movie, I could think twice about when to throw another joke or a second joke. A must for comedy fans.
