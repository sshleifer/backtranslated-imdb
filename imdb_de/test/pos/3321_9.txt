A classic movie of the late 50s. The super-featured headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50s sense (which I love). <br /> <br /> The look and feel of the artistic (over-artsy?) contemporary film "Far from Heaven" reflects this very kind of movie (and I suspect this movie might be one of the models). A stupid act of course (hey, it's 1959!), But as a movie - gorgeous! As a reflection of the company extremely interesting. And as a witness to how Hollywood dissolves from the idealistic portrayal of American sexual customs, fascinating.
