This was the movie that started the cinematic love affair between the crew of Jaundiced Eye and Matthew Ferguson. His <br /> <br /> ability to portray RELATIVELY normal characters like Birkoff in <br /> <br /> "La Femme Nikita" is compensated by his equally skillful <br /> <br/> manipulation of madmen "Kane". One wishes to be given only more roles, larger roles and other, even more complex roles to explore the limits of his abilities. There were four or five memorable scenes in this film, and Matthew Ferguson had stolen two from far more experienced actors. This movie <br /> <br /> itself is good, and it is worth to look at its own merits, but Ferguson makes it special. His * ouevre * can finally <br /> <br /> show what Anthony Perkins' career might look like <br /> <br />, if he had not been typed as "Norman Bates" for so long. <Br / before <br />. "Kane" is not as freaky as Norman, and far fewer people saw "Love and Human Remains" than "Psycho", so we can hope that Ferguson will give us an indication of what Perkins POSSIBLE <br /> <br /> could have done if he had allowed it.
