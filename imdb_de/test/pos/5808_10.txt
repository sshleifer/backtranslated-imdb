This is a spectacular production! I saw the show live twice in Chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that I could only hear fragments of what was going on. The stage was made up of three giant catwalks and the platform, and as the action moves from one stage to the next, sometimes you lose track of what's going on no matter where you are. As always, this is a sensual overload that was recorded with 15 cameras in high definition! The material was masterfully edited, in my opinion the best concert DVD ever! I hope and wish only that they will publish this on Blu-Ray of HD-DVD, so we can experience this extravaganz again and again.
