I'm watching "The Big Chill" on DVD. One of his actors is Meg Tilly. I looked up at IMDb, which made me read Meg's biography, which mentioned me and reminded me of Meg's sister, Jennifer Tilly, whose filmography included "Key West", one of my wife's shows and my favorite shows. I then read this whole thread of reviews. <br /> <br /> Wow, I really loved this show and I agree with all the feelings about the bizarre and uniqueness of the characters and situations. <br /> <br /> Like almost everyone else, I wish it was available on DVD or otherwise. <br /> <br /> The last reviewer says he looks at iterations. <br /> <br /> So if anyone knows how we can see "Key West" episodes, please let us know.
