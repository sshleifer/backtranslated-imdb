"Wallace & Gromit in the Were Rabbit's Curse" is the same kind of animation and comes from the same creators of "Chicken Run," but the story is now different: Wallace, an inventor, the cheese, and his beloved A sly dog Gromit, who always helps Wallace with his problems, tries to keep the rabbits away from anyone's vegetables as their town hosts an annual giant vegetable competition. But when Wallace strives for an invention he has made to keep the rabbits away from vegetables, he is the one who is being cursed. Before I saw this movie, I did not know that these two characters already existed and were famous. I loved Gromit, and I think he's one of the coolest dogs I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> aka "Wallace & Gromit." -A Batalha dos Vegetais "- Brazil
