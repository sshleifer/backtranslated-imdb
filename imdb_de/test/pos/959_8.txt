Well, it could be a kiddie movie ... maybe, but I'm not letting my kids down at 9, so the one who says it's a kids movie, hmm ?! But back to the movie is about a boy who can lie very well. So good that in the end nobody nods the truth or lies. Anyway, it's a nice movie to watch nice screen games. I think the writers correct a little lesson with ... "" The truth is never exaggerated ".
