I had the opportunity to see this independent film, and was impressed despite the lack of excitement in the plot. The spectacle was very good by all participants. Amy Madigan played the role of a guilty mother who is tired but good-natured and determined to make up for the condition of her younger daughter. However, she has neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her sibling Savant syndrome and living in a world of escape their supporting roles. Christopher Lloyd shows in a very restrained role why he is so versatile. He plays a teacher dedicated to his profession and literature research, yet hungry for a meaningful relationship. He and Madigan are very well connected in their scenes, but both know that nothing can come of their friendship. Her wordless farewell is just brilliant, an acting lesson for aspiring artists. <br /> <br /> And in a small role, Fred Savage enjoys watching him. The film is based on a play and is probably very good on stage. It's not particularly exciting on screen, but it's very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.
