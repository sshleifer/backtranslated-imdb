I'm an avid fan of Julie Andrews and I've just seen it on DVD for the first time - the Director's Cut version. I was very surprised that it was rated G. How did you put bedroom scenes, a seduction story, two striptease acts and war / shoot / blood into a G rating? Strange. I would rate it PG-13. <br /> <br /> Apart from that I really liked the movie. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The acting was great. The plot was a bit weak and left gaps that could be filled with some good dialogues. There were too many scenes in which I would not talk but just walk ... I would have liked to blossom the relationship between Julie and Rock so that intense love would be more credible.
