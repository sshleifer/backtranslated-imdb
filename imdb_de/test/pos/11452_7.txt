This is not the unpleasant night of the demon, as there is more than one. Actually, there is only one, but it multiplies. <br /> <br /> After she has lived in Suzanne (Scream Queen Linnea Quigley), she gives her a nice long kiss to Girl Angela (Amelia Kinkade). Next we see Linnea join us showing her quigleys in the bathroom. It shows much more than Jay (Lance Fenton) thinks he has fun. <br /> <br /> Soon, everything literally goes to hell when the bodies fall and get possessed one by one. Judy (Cathy Podewell) and Max (Philip Tanzini) are the last two trying to escape. Max is not much help and leaves Judy to find a way out. <br /> <br /> The make-up was absolutely fantastic, and the only thing that could not stop it was the extremely long build action. <br /> <br /> The old man (Harold Ayer), who appears at the beginning, will come back and get his just desserts. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley may be the Scream Queen, but Cathy Podewell has definitely shown the biggest lungs in this movie.
