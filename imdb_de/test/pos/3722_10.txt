I'm a longtime fan of Luc Besson's work, and as long as I know his name, I've searched for this movie too. I've spent over four years trying to find this movie all over California. this last summer i made a trip to europe. one of my tasks was to at least see this movie. long story short, I have bought it and seen in France! I was blown away, it made my trip complete and I'm finally happy that I saw Luc Besson's first work. absolutely amazing character development, very thoughtful, great acting and the ultimate concept movie. If you're a concept movie fan, this is one of the most original and classic. I think it's a rare pleasure to see a movie like this, its risk, its unorthodox movie, and ultimately its unique. If you're a fan of Luc Besson, it's indeed a must, whether you're a Besson fan or not, it's definitely an important work, overall a great contribution to the immortal art of cinema.
