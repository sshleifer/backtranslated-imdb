This movie brings back so many memories! I was very young when it came out, but I remember the first time I saw it! My dad and I always watched the "Ernest Movies". We had not seen any of them for several years, and I found some of them really cheap. We watched them and could not stop laughing. I love all "Ernest Movies", but this is my favorite. <br /> <br /> spoiler part! <br /> <br /> The part that I remember the most is the "magnet part". My dad is still doing the electric chair scene! <br /> <br /> End spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is a very cheesy movie ... but a great one! It's perfect for families (it's not a lot of garbage out there), but at the same time adults can laugh too! If you like physical humor (such as facial expressions and the way people move), this is the movie for you!
