When Wallace and Gromit entered the stage in their award-winning short film "A Grand Day Out," they created a new look at Claymation. After two more short films Aardman's dynamic duo returned for this thoroughly entertaining movie. It has an excellent voice cast, humorous jokes and good animation just like Aardman could! <br /> <br /> In this film, Wallace and Gromit are running "Anti-Pesto", a rabbit moving company. When talking about a "was rabbit" who eats all the vegetables in the city, there is a rush. Of course, Victor Quartermaine, the city's pretty, cocky-skittered hunter, wants to take the rabbit in hand to impress the beautiful Lady Tottington ... but can our favorite Aardman duo save the day from chaos? The jokes, I should say, were funny. One point, the villain of Victor Quartermaine, showed a lure of crackers that prompted a character to scream: "ATTENTION ... THE MOON !!!" Vintage Aardman! <br /> <br /> The characters are crisp and funny. Our Aardman favorite Man and Dog team entertains us the way they can and earns their second Oscar (remember "A Grand Day Out?"). Helena Bonham Carter was great as the lovable Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. Ralph Fiennes was especially funny and grim as the cunning hunter Victor Quartermaine. The one who really stole the show was the priest whose antics turned out to be a strange relief. <br /> <br /> Hats off to Aardman, who created another masterpiece by Wallace and Gromit!
