I loved this movie. You can not buy, rent or find it ... but it's a goaltender. <br /> <br /> Wonderful chemistry between Braccho and Walken ... and Ferrar .... <br /> <br /> Great non-stop action and reactions .... I loved it. <br /> <br /> I've looked at my pirated copy maybe 6 times in the last decade ... every time I showed it to someone that has never had it before. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and have a look at it. <br /> <br /> So many movies are always on TV - without the joke and style of this little movie. <br /> <br /> I did not know that it was made for television. .. my copy is an 8-track that I robbed years ago ... I hope it takes.
