* Spoiler * * Spoiler * * Spoiler * I found the movie amusing. It was strange and I enjoyed it a lot, I laughed a lot, so the bottom line is that I recommend the movie. However, I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say The plot is very simple. (Renee Zellweger), a hard-living housewife who watches her husband's murder, and while he has forgotten everything she had seen, she follows her "true love" for a soap figure, dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough, but not enough to shoot a 95-minute movie. And here comes the big question. What's the film about? The reference to "The Wizard of Oz" is obvious. Both are from Kansas, while Dorothy concludes at the end of the film that "there is no place like home", but Betty does not come to any conclusion and at the end of the movie we will wonder what she has learned from her experiences and the answer is just nothing. It does not seem to affect her at all. <br /> <br /> Then the film about the differences between the movies is reality and fantasy? It could be, but the scenes dealing with this theme are short and serve no more than a joke and not a serious act that can take the film to other locations (and by the way, "The Truman Show") covered this topic a much better way). <br /> <br /> The movie could be about obsession. Betty is obsessed with the soap series and Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty.LaBute shows two sides of obsession and he seems to forget that obsession in any form is dangerous and should be condemned. He seems to have Bettys obsession with him because he thinks he's harmless. <br /> <br /> Anything a long movie in itself could have been a theme for an entire movie, but it's up to us to think that they will affect the characters. <br /> <br /> The end is just a make-up that has nothing to offer. Get on with what we saw before. It's a shame, because the film could have been sharper if it had focused on one or two motifs a lot, but actually say nothing. <br /> <br /> What remains is the feeling of watching a small movie, amusing and funny, that could have been much more.
