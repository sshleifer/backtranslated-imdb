Aside from the plane, I do not think I've laughed so much about a movie in my entire life. <br /> <br /> I love football like crazy, but I hate almost every song or movie about football as you tend to be unrealistic. That was not. <br /> <br /> I took a look at it, it was over 2 years ago and it was great. Everyone I know loves it. I remember the gay physio, the inclination at an angle of about 45 degrees, and 'shoes' (a player so called because he once trained in a new pair of shoes). Brillant, that's the way it is in park football. <br /> <br /> A definite 10/10. If anyone in the TV industry reads this, considering all the crap that is repeated in the English telephoto, then you have the sense to show it again (and the Muppets, while you're at it). Besides, somebody knows if this was shown on BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so it's worth asking if they want to show it again. You should do it.
