Homegrown is one of those movies that somehow fell through the cracks, but deserved better. When I saw it for the first time, I had a lukewarm reaction. But over time, I'm really grown - no pun intended ;-). The more I see it, the more I appreciate it. The writing is first class, as well as the acting. Take some surprising cameos and a good direction, and you'll get a great little movie. <br /> <br /> It's also good to see that Hank Azaria finally has a chance to shine in a lead role. And Thornton delivers its usual quality performance. Even the relatively young Ryan Phillippe is a friendly innocent with wit and subtlety. <br /> <br /> By the way, Homegrown is simply a "must" if you're a fan of Billy Bob Thornton. It seems Stephen Gyllenhaal has been influenced by previous Thornton projects such as One False Move and Sling Blade (though Homegrown is certainly much more than just one of them). And Thornton's role as a refined and down-to-earth character fits in perfectly with the actor.
