I absolutely loved this movie ... so many emotions in such a short time. I loved the beginning and how it totally upsets you. I love the story and taking in deer. I know when I think of deer, I think of innocence and prosperity. Psalm 42: 2 also states in the Bible, "When the deer craves for the waters, So thirsts my soul for you, God." That might even connect the last moment when the woman says it will be okay. As if she knows she is walking with God. Maybe I think way too much. But sometimes it's interesting to see what's going on in people's minds. Thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers everywhere. I live in Texas and played it by cable ... I immediately went to the computer to learn more about this movie and this great director! I really liked the music in the background. Music can sometimes make a movie or break. It definitely set the mood perfectly. Very nice choice! <br /> <br /> Thanks again. <br /> <br /> Laetitia
