The story of Tom Garner begins with his great funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks told by his faithful partner Henry. Henry and his wife are debating whether Tom is a great man and a genius or a completely worthless rogue. The film is beautifully written, played and staged, and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Tom was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a major railroad that dominated his board and competitors and terrorized his employees. Battles of strikers. Tom's ambitious wife Sally was responsible for Tom's overall success. When he met her, he was illiterate and completely satisfied with his work as a trackwalker for the railroad. Sally teaches him to read and does his job as a trackwalker while Tom goes to school. He begins to rise step by step through the railroad hierarchy until he finally takes over the office of president. <br /> <br /> But when Tom becomes an economic tycoon, his marriage to Sally gradually breaks down. His spoiled son loathes him, and he accepts a much younger woman (who appeals to Eva) with predictable catastrophic consequences. Tom is a complete success in his business life; a catastrophic failure in his personal life. Like the Hearst figure in Citizen Kane, Tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system. Spencer Tracy is great in the role of Tom Garner and the business scenes sound authentic. Colleen Moore is also awarded as Sally; Both age very well in the intergenerational story. The film was written by Preston Sturges, but is nothing compared to the screwball comedies for which Sturges became famous.
