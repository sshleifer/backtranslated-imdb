Well, we definitely saw it and I and many other people actually expected worse. It also had some good aspects that I did not expect to fail in other areas anyway. <br /> <br /> At first, trading was above average. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie and I liked Tom Hanks. Hoffman was the glue for this movie. If he were not, this movie would have collapsed and dropped to its lowest point. His appearance was by no means breathtaking, but absolutely necessary. He gave a good, funny, cynical performance, in which most other actors had easily made his character a clich√©. Tom Hanks has really shown a nice loose performance and did not disappoint, but he did not impress. What I did not like was that Julia Roberts was involved in this movie. It was as big as an abuse I've ever seen. For one thing, she's a bad actress, at least to me she was too young for her character and too wrong even for the character she played. <br /> <br /> The direction was average for me. I'm not really a big fan of recent Mike Nichols movies and I'm not really impressed with this. It was made with such a hollywood, cartoon-like touch hat I did not like. The worst part was that he wanted to make a really meaningful movie in the end. I love meaningful movies, but not when a movie tries to end up rushing through a scene or two and trying to justify the rest of the garbage scattered throughout the movie. This has apparently done a lot to Mike Nichols in his recent track record. <br /> <br /> The most impressive part of this movie was writing. The dialogue was very well put together and could let the story play. The writing was what could really bring this film to an above-average level. In so many scenes, I laughed in part by writing. <br /> <br /> Well, that's something we've at least seen. Many scenes were good in the movie, if you understand what I mean, but not much else. I thought it was good that this movie does not glorify everything that America has done. It is obvious that throughout this war in Afghanistan, the US has given weapons to people who are now against us. We are to blame for this film. It shows that what looks good in the short term can terribly prove wrong in the future. This film had a good original message, but it just did not deliver it properly. All in all, it was entertaining.
