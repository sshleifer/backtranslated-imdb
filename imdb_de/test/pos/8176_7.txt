The history of pre-united China must be popular. Jet Li's hero popularized the king's assassination. <br /> <br /> This is another story made a few years ago. The incredibly beautiful Li Gon (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2046, Miami Vice) becomes the lover of the king, who should recruit a murderer for the king to defeat him. She recruits Fengyi Zhang, but falls in love with him. Anyway, he can not complete the mission anyway, since the king knew about him before. I had the suspicion that he knew it too, but went anyway. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful story with massive military operations and of course another chance to see Li Gong.
