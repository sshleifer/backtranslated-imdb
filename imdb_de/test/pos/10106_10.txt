This review is long overdue, as I think A Tale of Two Sisters is the biggest movie ever made. I will compare this gem with any film in terms of script, cinematography, drama, post-production, editing, directing or other aspects of filmmaking. It's practically perfect in all? a true masterpiece in a sea of ​​spurious "masterpieces". <br /> <br /> The structure of this film is by far the closest in the history of cinema. I can not imagine another film in which every minute a vital thing occurs. In the truest sense of the word, Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a film that practically taunts the viewer to analyze it on the most detailed levels. A seemingly insignificant object can be shown? a clothes rack, two diaries, a drop of blood from a crack in the floor, a bottle of pills, etc.? but after meticulous inspection, so much more turns out? A clue that helps to understand the particular scene (or perhaps the entire movie), which almost always leads to a rousing reflection of the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the intelligence of the viewer makes them step into the foreground , Such an event can become a handful during another movie. However, in A Tale of Two Sisters, such events occur so quickly and relentlessly that the viewer must watch the film in an eternal state of alertness so as not to miss something important. In other words, the content in this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films. How can someone who is wise ask for more of a movie than this? It is simply the highest, most imaginable form of cinema. <br /> <br /> The most cited criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is well summarized by Zaphod B Goode, who falsely claims the story is incoherent. an unresolved mess that uses confusion to convey a false sense of intelligence, as it provides no conclusive facts underlying the intriguing questions. He suspects that Ji-woon Kim made and left a dozen possible explanations. In reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth. A tale of two sisters provides a set of objective facts that help the viewer identify the EXACT events of each film scene. If our good friend Zaphod had paid attention, would he have noticed? for example ?? the series of obvious flashbacks that provide enough information to understand the movie. These flashbacks convincingly contradict Zaphod's claim of complete subjectivity. The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone who wants to see them that mere assertion of objectivity can only challenge the patience of a viewer who does not seem to want the slightest effort to see you. Can Ji-woon Kim really be to blame for the impatience of the spectators, who lack the desire to understand his film? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Please note that I will not insult the intelligence of critics like Zaphod, who can not "get A Tale of Two Sisters" because they really have nothing to do with lack of intelligence as well lack of persistence. The film is so effectively worded that the only possible explanation for the confusion is that the viewer makes no effort. Yes, this movie requires a lot of puzzles, but the parts fit together to create a beautiful picture. You just have to put them together. Remember, the script was written by someone who already had the picture in mind? he simply separated the pieces and skillfully placed them to provide a great brain exercise that ?? when completed ?? gives an ultimate form of contentment and awe. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. There are films that seem to start with an incomplete image and try to create a puzzle that is intrinsically unsolvable. Perfect examples of this are Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001). A story of two sisters is not. It is ironic that Zaphod claims that Darko is masterfully constructed as A Tale of Two Sisters, especially considering that Darko not only delivers almost objective facts, but also a twist-end that echoes the quintessential cliché of Deus machina is that could end up falling Any film ever shot to provide ultimate faux intelligence. I am ashamed that I mentioned the two films in the same sentence, but the contrast is important. Although it is astonishing that Zaphod would cite a film that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort to criticize a film that can only be recognized by a considerable application of intellectual effort. Apparently he likes his "intelligent" films in as superficial a form as possible. This becomes clear when he asks 17 consecutive questions in his review, which are convincingly answered by the film itself. Just read Opiemar's threads in the IMDb A Tale of the Two Sisters Discussion Forum. Anyone who reads these threads carefully and still claims the lack of objective solutions to this movie can also stop watching intelligent movies altogether because the answers are so damn OBVIOUS. <br /> <br /> I would like to say more: but I have reached my limit of 1,000 words. Everything that was said here had to be said. So be it now!
