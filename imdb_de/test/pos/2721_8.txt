After Mrs and Mr Iyer this is another very good movie by Aparna Sen (mostly in English). In the earlier film, she addressed a contemporary political environment and its impact on the individual. This film is about the impact of a mentally disabled family member and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub-topic, she treats a philosophical concept of "reality". It's a thought-provoking movie after watching the movie. Mithee, the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen), suffers from schizophrenia, which is cared for by the dominant older sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi). Mithee after marrying Jojo and separating from him believes that she is still with JOJO and her five children at 15 Park Avenue in Kolkotta (there is no such address in Kolkotta - there is probably one in New York) and she is intense in their beliefs. It's almost like an intense religious belief. What is the reality in the end? In one scene, she tells Anjali, "When I tell you that you are not a professor, just imagine that you are a professor." The open end reflects this reality. Mithee is lost in a supposed search for her home on Park Avenue. The penultimate scene is Mithee, who looks at a group of five playing children and looks at them with joy to return to their family, and then she is lost. This concept of reality is reminiscent of another fifties film called HARRY by James Stewart. The protagonist believes that a big rabbit (?), Called Harry, is always with him and he always talks to him. In the end, even the doctor may think that Harry exists. What is the reality? Is that what the protagonist believes, or what others believe, that Shabhna Azmi dominates the movie with her great performance as a strong older sister who is frustrated? Konkana Sen Sharma gives just as adequate a performance as the schizophrenic. <br /> <br /> The film is not as tight as Frau and Herr Iyer. There seems to be some loose ends. And maybe there are too many characters. Those who want a closed end will not appreciate the open end here. But the ending fits the theme of the film. <br /> <br /> Another good movie by Aparana Sen.
