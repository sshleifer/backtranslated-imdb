Certainly one of the hottest movies ever. Excellent original music, smart, intoxicating ... it's hard to talk about such a good thing. There is no character you do not love instantly - Myronex "Putney, in the black room there is trouble!" "My name is Rufus." The lines that are thrown to the left and right are themselves classics and are reminiscent of Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialogue does not consist of the formulaic headline. "Putney, Myronex has called you tasteless!" "My organization is for integration ..." "Where is Lopez?" He is in my head. "" They do not sound brilliant until you hear them in the context of the scene. ... This movie will eat your brain, it's too good. I read reviews that described this film as racist, which could not be further from the truth. Every scene is gold, from the promotion of Etherial Cereal to the Brothers In the Black Room meeting to the haunting trumpet in the final scene. One word - genius.
