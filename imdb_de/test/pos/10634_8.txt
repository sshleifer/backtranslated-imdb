In the first twenty minutes we are carried away by some powerfully described emotions: A stifling and overbearing mother has fierce arguments with her 40-year-old daughter. the love of a piano teacher (and music professor) for their students, expressed in an unshakable critical judgment; the joy that music can inspire both the listener and the performer. In this short time, our senses were convincingly attacked with very real characters. We are also carried away by powerfully played music and show the difference between great and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to nuance. This material alone would have been the basis for an outstanding film with far-reaching appeal. However, the trend in French cinema is the way it is. He goes deeper and explores the teacher's repressed sexuality, the expression of sexual freedom and the subsequent collapse in the context of passionate attraction and the inevitable cycle of genuine abuse. We are attracted by her suffering, and we first ask ourselves how much suffering can be connected with the achievement of genius, especially among the composers she admires. The piano teacher contains graphic dialogues and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people would rather not see. The scenes are essential to the dilemma that the film seeks to raise, and therefore can hardly be called unfounded. It may be a great movie, but mainstream viewing is not.
