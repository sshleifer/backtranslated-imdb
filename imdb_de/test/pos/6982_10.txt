(Very slightly confused) <br /> <br /> I have to start by saying that science fiction usually does not impress me. Therefore, Pitch Black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. It had fascinated me from the beginning with rhythm, intensity and visual outbursts and fascinated me and glued me to my seat. I'm very happy to say that this movie was the best (okay, at least * one of the best) science fiction song I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The plot In short, that sounds easy - a (space) ship crashes on a supposedly deserted planet and captain Caroline Fry (impressive Radha Mitchell) must bring the survivors to safety. At first glance, a cold-blooded murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays the role with a very credible backup style), seems to be the group's biggest problem, but as dusk creeps in, the creatures of the night awake ... This leads to one a desperate attempt to escape the bloodthirsty predators, which, as we all can not imagine, does not lead to a happy family picnic. <br /> <br /> Not the plot itself makes the movie worth seeing - - Let's face it, if you cut it down to the basics, it's not the original, it's the ability to tell it. The story flowed forward, did not make me yawn (at least not much). The direction was a great work. This was a very visual, even beautiful movie; The purple night vision was a real treat. Although "beautiful" may not be the right word; Yes, the pictures shown were a treat to the eye, but they also added a hint of vague grotesque, eeriness, as if something was just breaking out beneath the silent surface. (Not to mention that the monsters were done really well, they looked realistic, which seems rare these days (maybe people just can not bother to make them look real ...)) <br / > <br /> I enjoyed not only the visual side of the movie, but also the psychological aspect of the story as we watch the characters dissolve - some fall, others rise - but the thing that fascinated me most was the development Riddick's character, I enjoyed seeing the change in him throughout the movie, and to go further, the other thing I enjoyed with Riddick was the unbelievably good and originally executed UST Tension between Fry and him, the "not" (you'll get what I mean as soon as you see it) [You can not deny they had chemistry, do not even try it or I'll pick you and let youhear me play chopsticks until you scream * grin *] It was fresh. As Radha Mitchell once put it (a modified quote), "Pitch Black is a really sexy movie without sex," which makes it even more interesting. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, I recommend this movie - even if you really are not a fan of "space stories". The tension was maintained until the end and, importantly, we (or at least I) had what we wanted for more. If you do not bother thinking about psychology, subtext, and the like (as my bad habit is), you'll still find Pitch Black very entertaining. Just kick off your shoes and enjoy it.
