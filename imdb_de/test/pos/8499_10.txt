My wife wanted to watch this movie, and I reluctantly went along. I've never been a big fan of biopics - believing that cinema is more exciting if it's not structured in non-fiction. Besides, although I like Ray Charles' music very well, I do not consider myself a fan of him or his music. <br /> <br /> I was expecting to either suffer or chill through this movie. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is a gripping story told in a classic movie style. The realism lies in the nuances - the tilt of the head of a figure after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes as they sing. I discovered myself literally when I was involved in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jaime Foxx, of which much has been said, manages a cast of immaculate regroupers, not just one time, but an ERA, a LIFE that has never existed for those under forty. This movie takes the audience through time without the gimmicks and grand panoramas of the Titanic or other historical pieces of this sort. In this movie, you are not shown with the music scene of the 50s and 60s, but you come there. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about Ray Charles, but your appreciation should not be limited to his story life. This is the kind of movie, like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List, that does what a movie should do - take you to another place, another time.
