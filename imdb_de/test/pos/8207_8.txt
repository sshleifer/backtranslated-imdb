This is a solid, underrated little thriller that is rousing - with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is great! All the characters are great and I was surprised at how unpredictable it was, as there were only a few predictable moments, and Sandra Bullock is just amazing! Jeremy Northam was a great villain, and I know what Bullock is all about, because I'm somehow the same guy (I rarely go out), and that's pretty well done and written for the most part. This should be above 5.5 in my opinion, plus Denis Miller was surprisingly better than expected in his small role. The scene in which Northam Bullock terrorized on his boat was quite exciting and was one of my favorite moments. I also liked the carnival tracking scene. Also, I liked the end too, because it was pretty well done, even though I did, I think Northam was defeated too fast. There are also many other good chases, and sometimes it is wise, and there are also some shocking moments. This is a solid, underrated little thriller that has a lot of enthusiasm for a cool story. Sandra Bullock is great, I highly recommend her! The direction is great! Irwin Winkler is doing a great job! Job here with excellent camera work, good atmosphere, good angles and very fast film. The spectacle is fantastic! Sandra Bullock is amazing as always and is amazing, she is very personable, tough as a nails, but quite vulnerable, and I could feel her, because as I said, I'm a bit like Angela, I hardly go out, I have hers Really enjoyed work in this movie! (Bullock rules !!!!!!!). Jeremy Northam is excellent as a villain, he was deceitful, unpredictable and very threatening. He was great. Dennis Miller is in his small role surprisingly okay and not annoying and has managed to bring some comic relief. The rest of the cast is fine. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel. *** 1/2 out of 5
