This movie was very cute and totally little girl. My nieces have been watching it continuously since they got it, and as a result I've seen it nearly four times all the way. I can not get enough of it. The CGI images are great to look at, the humor is good and the ballet imagery is excellent. Although the plot has some holes, no little girl will pick it up, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that you barely notice it. Keep in mind that this is a Barbie movie, and although I find it sometimes cheesy in my experience, this film lives up to the high standards that the other Barbie Princess films have set for it. I would recommend it to anyone who has a little girl who always wanted to be a princess. There is also a good lesson. Everyone is special and different in their own way, and everyone can make a difference.
