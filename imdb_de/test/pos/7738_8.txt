I love this movie, even though it's just great. It is an adult entertainment, full of problems that can affect an adult person. The spectacle is great. It's fun to see John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands as a feudal middle-aged couple. Who knows how much of it comes from their own marriage? Susan Sarandon has never been as sexy or appealing as her revealing Aretha. Raul Julia is a scream as a lustful goat herder. The landscape in Greece is spectacular; The New York attitudes make me wind up because of many attitudes of the World Trade Center. Fantastic score from Stomu Yamashta. Why is not this movie so good because there are so many options? It's a bit far and wide, unfocused and uncomfortably unbalanced between humor and drama. Nevertheless, it is appealing, entertaining and deeply thoughtful.
