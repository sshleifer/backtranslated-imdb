Tight and organic, Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is an unmistakable suspense thriller, an unusual "message" movie that uses the looks and gadgets of the Noir Cycle to hang out in bars. Three of them end up in a strange apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and bellicose, slays her host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be a Jew. The policeman Robert Young determined with the help of Robert Mitchum, who is responsible for Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has disappeared. Ryan kills the third buddy (Steve Brodie) to assure his silence before Young enters. <br /> <br /> Dmytryk is replaced by a superior script by John Paxton and is characterized by its three main roles. Ryan, of course, does his prototypical Angry White Male (and the Grip), while Mitchum is accompanied by his characteristic Alch Nonchalance (his role is not central though); Boy may never have been better. Gloria Grahame returns her first full-fledged interpretation of the smart, vulnerable hitchhiker, and as a sad sack that has invaded her life, Paul Kelly follows us in a small, peripheral role that makes him memorable. <br /> <The politically engaged Dmytryk may inevitably succumb to the sermon, but he's pretty much limited to remembering how his Irish grandfather died of the bigots a century ago (which, incidentally, pushes the chronology to the limit ). At least there is no attempt to explain why Ryan hates Jews (and Hillbillies and ...). Curious, Crossfire himself survives the great change that was exerted on it - the novel is based on (Richard Brooks The Brick Foxhole), which dealt with a murder of homosexuals. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. However, the news of the Holocaust had emerged from the ashes of Europe, so that Hollywood felt encouraged to report its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios have always been tormented by the prospect of a potential ticket buyer). <br /> But while the shift from homophobia to anti-Semitism generally works, the peculiarities do not fit so smoothly. The victim is chatting with a lonely, drunken young soldier who invites him to his home, looks strange, although (or mainly because) a friend is in tow. The question is whether this scenario was mistakenly retained or left as a discrete reminder of the original engine producing Ryan's murderous rage.
