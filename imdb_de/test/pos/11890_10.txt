I've seen this movie more than once. Actually, El Padrino was one of the best feature films I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> There was a big cast, Jennifer Tilly, Faye Duanway, Brad Dourif and Damian Chapa, who really shone a real star in this part of Kilo. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie was filmed for less than $ 2 million. I have seen films for 33 million films that are incomparable to quality and production value. Damian Chapa, why do not you get any offers and more film work !!! EXCELLENT WORK !!!!!!!!!! I can not wait to see the sequel, and I hope it has the same action. Jennifer Tilly has made a cult classic with Sabeva. Damian Chapa moves cool in every scene, much like the movie stars of the '40s and' 50s It's so bad to see these non-charismatic actors like Ben Stiller getting all those movies, if there are those talents with something to show. a great movie. <br /> GO GO GO KICK SOME BUT ON SALE EL PADRINO !!!
