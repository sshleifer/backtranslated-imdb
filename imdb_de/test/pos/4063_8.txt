"Showtime" is a bit north of what some critics have said, and just south of what I expected months ago, when I first heard that Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro had teamed up for a comedy. All in all it was pretty good! As a "real" crime or policeman - and plot for that matter - it's pretty illogical, but DUH - that's a comedy. Although the special effects, car chases, aerial photography, and skyscraper jumps were there, but lower than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and exaggerated. Aside from the sensitivities of 9/11, everything related to pyro-techno-hyper effects had become very old in recent years. It seemed like a lame substitute for characterization, history, and emotions. I hope the smaller amount of it in "Showtime" is an indicator of a trend in Hollywood. A downward trend, less use of the fool, less use of the exploding building. <br /> <br /> Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. Her screen presence and her charisma - and even her depth of character - have been "a pleasure to see" for many years. This is not to be rejected here - they are dedicated actors and entertaining and engaging in this film. I can not put my finger on it, but maybe the explosions, the excessive FX and all that has diminished the final product ??? Maybe, or maybe it was something else or a combination of factors that make you feel that the movie has not reached its highest potential. Whatever it was, "Showtime" was entertaining - I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out - but I was in the mood that it was not all it could have been. At least not everything I had hoped for. <br /> <br /> Very good movie, but not a great movie. I gave 8 out of 10 points.
