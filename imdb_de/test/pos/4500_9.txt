This is a movie that made me breathless ... and wants to learn more about Afghan history and traditions. It was inspiring to experience the beauty of people and their beliefs with today's "evil doers" mantra, which blurred reality. <br /> <br /> The casting was impeccable, the scenery just wonderful. Acting was first-rate and the fact that the Academy (except the music) overlooked this is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful and such an emotional journey. Make an "ugly cry" from this observer. <br /> <br /> A movie worth seeing for a second and third time.
