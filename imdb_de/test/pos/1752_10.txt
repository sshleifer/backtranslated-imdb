"Mr. Bug Goes To Town" was the last major achievement produced by Fleischer Studios. The quality of the simultaneously produced Superman series is shown in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with the support of Flieshcer veteran Sammy Timberg) are pretty good, but not so much the score of the image of Leigh Harline, who is also Snow White received for Disney: The "atmospheric music" of Harline is excellent and a treat for the ears. <br /> <br /> The layout and staging of the image was perfect years before its time, and once again the Fleischer-background artists have outdone themselves. The technically charged beauty of the film can not be denied, and while Hoppity, the grasshopper, is the star, the characters of Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito steal the image The voices of Jack Mercer (by Popeye Fame) are invaluable. Kenny Gardner (brother-in-law) of Guy Lombardo ... and an outstanding singer of his band ... does his usual pleasant work in the role of Dick Dickinsen. The film was criticized for all the wrong reasons ons. The Fleischer Studios were animation experts par excellence and this is very clear on the finished product. The movie is atmospheric, the story is awesome for all ages, and the final scenes of the bugs crawling around their lives on a rising skyscraper are some of the best stunts and animations of all the animated films of the past and present. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this wonderful hand-drawn movie. Do not forget the title sequence for the most detailed example of Max Fleischer's remarkable 3D stereoprocessing, which took four months to build and deploy 16,000 small pieces of glass in Manhattan's "electrified" buildings. <br /> <br /> Do not miss Mr. Bug in town ... aka Hoppity Goes To Town. I bet you will be eyed with the results!
