The first half of the movie really scared me and I'm not usually scary, but the second half of this thriller did not work that well, but it's still very scary! A good thriller, then use easy ways to make a good horror. Low budget, set in Russia, unknown cast and Made in Europe. but still a lot of fun, and yes, there are also a few laughs for goodies!
