Marigold is by far Bollywood's best "outsider" approach I've ever seen. (I did not grow up with Bollywood, but I've seen a few hundreds of them now.) I'd say that Gurinder Chadha, Mira Nair, and even Merchant and Ivory (from Bombay Talkie) are almost left in the dust. Willard Carroll, the director, really loves Bollywood, and he has the confidence to let us know - there's humor, but no bow, no ironic distancing, no, "I do not really mean that". As Jerry Lee Lewis would say, "he gets it," and so he can let us - the joy of a Bollywood movie experience, along with touches that a Western citizen takes on as the storyteller /> <br /> It's a story about a caustic, sloppy, beautiful American B-movie actress (she was only in movies with numbers in her titles like Fatal Attraction 3) who finds herself in another Bollywood movie from where she went Being India (Kama Sutra 3 has folded his tents while on the road, apparently because the producers are now in jail). Salman Khan, in real life a Bollywood mega-megastar, is the dancing master of the adorable movie she's now drawn into ("is that before or after he goes blind?") And through the sweetness of his slightly mentally gifted character, she learns more than just to find her inner ecstatic dance skills. <br /> <br /> The strong start gives you both Bollywood - a super energetic troupe of dancers in front of the Taj Mahal (both funny and familiar to the western viewer, as well as the high-speed thrill that we love in a Hindi movie) and Salman on the canvas from the beginning - no 20 minutes Bollywoods are waiting for the hero. He has an Indian costume with a western film strip Kit Carson (all in white) decorated. Ali Larter's actress likes the western viewer - she's blonde, what a "traditional" is "white" person in a Bollywood movie and visually understandable casting - but she's a sturdy girl, not the ethereal blonde we normally face and she is a more or less three-dimensional bitch that makes mundane and abusive cell phone conversations with a friend and agent in the US. <br /> <br /> We also have scenes with women who have problems with each other and go to a bar to deal with them - the ability to not get people living together and emotional conversations are traditional in Hindi films, however We rarely see anything between women (except the discussion between mother and daughter about the choice of the groom by the daughter), let alone "strangers" - unrelated people - let alone bar-going. So the ghost is the same, the details are fresh and I was thrilled. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once, in a preview where the director, a good speaker and a questioner - he and Salman became "good friends" in terms of making, he loves India He plans to shoot a Wizard of Oz movie in India. I can not get too detailed unless I have seen them once, unless I liked them all. They range from a cheery parody of the Bollywood number in the film within the film - the ladies' costumes, with leghorn caps and seashell bodice (it's a beach scene) on flowing dresses - are worth the cost of a ticket alone - a beautiful one , reflecting romantic song with many scenes in a sadder and more serious part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Mix of Hindi and English in the music, and it works. <br /> <br Salman Khan owes my great appreciation for the openness for unusual projects - this and Jaan-e-man - and for a good judgment on which projects he is in. Carroll said he was completely alright (ie not at all narcissistic) along the way, full of suggestions and ideas, whether Carroll accepted or declined her - clearly just a pro who loves to be involved and work together.
