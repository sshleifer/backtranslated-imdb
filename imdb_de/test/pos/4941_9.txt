When I played the first Soul Calibur in the Dreamcast, I thought it was great. When I played the second one, I was addicted. And finally, when Soul Calibur III was released, I bought a Playstation 2 and the game. <br /> <br /> This can really stop you for hours, with a huge number of characters, a lot of unlockable content and not to mention a BIG combat system. This is really the best fighting game ever. <br /> <br /> The strengths of the game are primarily vs-gameplay, where two human players compete against each other, either as one of the main characters or as a specially developed character. The Create Character option is extensive, allowing the player to create thousands of different combinations. <br /> <br /> The only thing that bothers me is when you create a character using the "Grieve Edge" fighting style (just having to wear those ridiculous shoes.) This is absolutely the best fighting game you can get I just hope that the planned movie will not be a crap.
