The 2002 Bourne identity is one of my favorite films of all time. However, many fans of the book have complained that the film had very little to do with the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> The task is the real deal. It's strange that no one in the Bourne Identity threads ever mentioned this movie. (Well, I did not.) <br /> <br /> Apart from the great plot, I found this movie as good as any other spy film I've ever seen, with the possible exception of The Bourne> <br /> Identity itself. <br /> <br /> The action is all completely realistic. I particularly liked the training program of the protagonists, which was very resourceful. <br /> <br /> The feeling is dark and somber. There are a few surprising twists. The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> If you like this genre, I highly recommend this movie.
