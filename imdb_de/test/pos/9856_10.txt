I loved this movie! So worth the long term. Although I need help at the end .... <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The last shot of Marie at the end - Is this an indication that she is still looking for Renaud? ? or maybe she was the one who wanted to revive the 13? (She seemed to have been the first to convey the first letter to Colin.) I do not quite understand, but I know that I really liked it. So, if someone saw this and remembered or just saw it, please explain the end. <br /> <br /> Thank you
