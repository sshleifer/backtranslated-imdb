This movie seems to have been overlooked by everyone. Someone should release it on VHS and DVD. It's an excellent movie and far beyond that with Brooke Shields, who was terrible. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons earns more credit than she gets for days. It would be nice if all their films were offered on VHS or DVD. Jean Simmons was and is a very good actress. She was certainly a beauty. In fact, she is still a beauty. She has also done well on TV. She is so much better than many of today's actors.
