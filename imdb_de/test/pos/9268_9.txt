I saw this documentary at the 2005 Slamdance Independent Film Festival. This documentary is filmed, staged and edited by a son (Craig) of his mother's years of struggle against cancer. Turned Over a Year "The Closer she Comes" is a documentary film in its truest form, giving you a glimpse into the struggle of a family with the fight against cancer. The viewer gets an insight into the effects of cancer on both the family and the individual throughout the process. I have never seen such an honest movie, this is a powerful and raw movie, and since it was not filmed by an outsider, you will experience the true emotions of all involved. Many documentary films are shot by an outsider, but that story the son tells adds another emotional level to the film, unlike anything I've seen on any of the other topics. This is a touching story everyone should see and relate to. I would highly recommend it.
