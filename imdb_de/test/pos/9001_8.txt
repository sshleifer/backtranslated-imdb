Forever Strong is a kind of movie that we have seen many times, only in different genres. Still, I thought it was a great movie. Sean Faris shows the potential with which actors usually enjoy great fame. Apparently, this movie got a limited release because I did not know it, but I saw it in the video library and decided to grab a chance after I remember Sean's performance in Never Back Down. I made a great decision in the end. I'm not a rugby fan, but the movie is not really all about rugby. It's about surviving in your life, challenging yourself, achieving your goals is much more than the simple act suggests. For the first time, we do not care what happened to Rick, he's open-mouthed, full of himself and totally arrogant. We believe that he has completely sealed his fate as a troublemaker. Along the way, we see the changes in his character, he starts to meet better people, he begins to improve himself, we learn how much negative impact his father had in his life, it's just a big joke and the movie It made a great job Turning Rick from a cocky guy to a kind-hearted person <br /> <br /> The rugby action itself is not that bad at all, unlike the things I've played and watched in high school and choreographed beautifully. A great young cast, combined with some veteran experience, has helped this film immensely. He simply did a fabulous job of avoiding what the mill-type could have done to a poignant and effective drama. I also liked the contradictory contrast between The Coach | Garry Cole | and Rick | Sean Faris | that was a very interesting story, and I loved it when he helped Rick while being both emotional and heartwarming. This is a real hidden gem. I am really glad that I discovered that I had to think about my life and often I need something like that. <br /> <br /> The Performances. Sean Faris is excellent as Rick Penning. He reminded me very much of a young Tom Cruise, who was nevertheless very charismatic and talented. It was a difficult role to move from a musty teenager to a kind-hearted young man, but Sean succeeded with sheer perfection. He has clearly put his heart and soul into this film, a big compliment to Sean that he put so much effort into this great movie. Gary Cole is an excellent preacher, but also a sympathetic trainer who wants to help the children. I've always found him sympathetic, he always has some kind of presence he carries in his films. Neal McDonough is fantastic as Rick's selfish, yet pressurized father. For most of the movie, the script makes you think he's nothing more than a selfish, bitter man who wants Rick to be just like him, but in the end, you see he really comes out, and I'm sorry little. Julie Warner is a good character actress and plays the good-hearted but unsuspecting mother well. Penn Badgley has to play a real jerk, and boy ever does it well. On numerous occasions, I wanted to kick him out, so I have to say it's a great achievement. Arielle Kebbel did not really enjoy the love interest, she did OK. Nathan West plays a somewhat mysterious character, he has done quite well. Sean Astin is billed as a major player for the film, but he hardly does anything, he has done well what he had to do. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Forever Strong is a great movie that feels good Let's definitely stop and think about how your life was so much better than you thought. Do not miss this, you will not regret it. <br /> <br /> 8 1/2/10
