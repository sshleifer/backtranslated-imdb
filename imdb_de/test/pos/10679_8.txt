This lesser known movie with Roy Thinnes (From TV's Invaders) is actually what I consider a lost gem. It was done at a time when the story was more important than the special effects (though the effect is pretty good for its time). A scientist suspects that there is another world in orbit of the earth, just behind the sun. Since the sun always blocks it from us, we can never see it from Earth. Roy Thinnes was chosen to go on a mission to enter this world. I do not want to say the rest of the story, because that's what gives the rest of the movie away. Let's just say there are some real surprises. <br /> <br /> The film is British and has the good British character of acting, which has been played in television series such as The Avengers.
