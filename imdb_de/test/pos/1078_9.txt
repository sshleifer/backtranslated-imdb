Business vs. personal conviction. Profit against art. <br /> <br /> As with any documentary that addresses major corporations against the small producer, the viewer will invariably have to be the side of one or the other, based on their own beliefs. This is also a documentary about the new standardized practices that globalization brings us, as opposed to the old traditional ways in which the character and art of creating things is almost paramount to selling the product. <br /> <br /> If you have to remember something from this movie, the masses can not decide for themselves. They simply follow the tastes of one or more critics who equalize and standardize taste in the same way as MacDonald's do for the quick bite (something that Parker himself admits in the film against the backdrop of a Burger King character). "It's about image" versus content, as another interviewer says. That's the easy way, the standardized way. Easier than taking the time for a nice wine, easier than forging your own taste by trying and trying again. Controlled brand taste is easier. <br /> <br /> There is a glimmer of hope if even some of our cousins ​​on the other side of the ocean agree that some people "smooth out" the taste of wines to maximize profits and maximize profits of it is sold to the "gray masses". Individuality and differentiation are sacrificed for the additional price. It's nice to see that not everything or everyone gives in to standardization, not even at sea. <br /> <br /> As in many other areas of today's world, the dominance of a few and the limited freedom of choice affect us all ... let everyone decide and decide what you want. Too much standardization kills mind and taste. Difference brings innovation and healthy competition and makes the choice - and not just vacuum-packed "more of the same". Standardization sells easily and much and brings everyone to the same level - the lower one. <br /> <br /> I will open a nice bottle and wish you a warm "sante".
