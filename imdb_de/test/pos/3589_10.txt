This is without a doubt the most impressive and amazing documentation I have ever seen! The pictures shown are absolutely breathtaking and breathtaking. In addition, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not a documentary, but it grabs you and does not let you go to the end. You will be so fascinated and excited by what you see that you forget it when watching TV at home. This series is available on DVD and I recommend HIGHLY to pick it up here! With all the evil and death in this world, this documentary series gives us proof that life is beautiful and worth saving and receiving.
