MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific movie that is both predictable and unpredictable. They know that once the characters find out that the so-called "gift from God" was actually a loan, repay the money, and that everyone will end up happy, but how they get there is not so obvious. The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters assess their lives and goals. The cast of experienced actors is more than just a journey to nostalgia. Frank Gorshin, Shirley Jones and Cloris Leachman prove that they can do more than Riddler, Mother Partridge or Mary's friend Phyllis, while Jill Eikenberry and Wendie Malick play different characters than in their TV series. Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is touching and witty at the same time, without making fun of nuns or the church. If you're looking for a movie with a great cast, good music (including Shirley Jones's "The Way You Look Tonight") and an uplifting end, give it a try. I do not think you will be disappointed.
