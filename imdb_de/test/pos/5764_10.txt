It can not be an Oscar material, but it was a very funny movie. I have always been a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) & Richie (Mayall). "Bottom" and "Young Ones" were legendary TV series, and it was time they made a movie. Some of what they do is brilliant, from the pencil is the stern, to the rubber sex pants, also the infamous line that Richie says when he falls and gets a candle he wears in his eye , He says to Eddie "Candle In The Eye," and Eddie was the crap he is. He puts the candle he carries in his eye. I can not forget when Eddie is on his bike and he has to urinate ... It was a great comedy that should not be taken seriously at all, but the movie had a ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> All in all an excellent comedy full of laughs and lots of fake green vomit. A 9/10. <br /> <br />
