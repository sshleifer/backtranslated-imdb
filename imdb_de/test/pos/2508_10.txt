While not popular in cinemas, it soon became a popular feature on cable TV and on VHS / DVD. In a port city in the good old US (I forget the exact location) is a mysterious, passionately written love letter that triggers emotions and confusion among the main characters, each of whom thinks the letter is addressed to them personally. At the end of the movie, we do not know who the lover or the lover is, but the power of the letter has changed the lives of almost everyone in the small town. The cast consists of wonderful actors who have done well on television and in the film, including Kate Capshaw in the lead role of middle-aged Helen, a bookstore owner, Comedienne Ellen DeGeneres as her friend / employee Janet Hall, the young hot Tom Everett Scott as Johnny, the young man of 20, who falls in love with the older Hellen and the older Tom Selleck as firefighter George Matthias, who has to fight Johnny for Helen's affection. There are cameo roles of the old Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, known to the modern public above all as the older rose in "Titanic" (1997) and as the cameo of Kate Capshaw's own daughter (with husband Steven Spielberg) Jessica Capshaw. The love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an elderly man, and a young man, each of whom is as passionate about Helen as the author of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Will she choose the right person? Which man has the most to offer you? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl of his age who loves him with a passion of his own and is indeed a sort of reminder of how Helen was at her age. George is just getting divorced from his wife and has led a worldly and eventful life. As a cultured intellectual, he takes Helen on an opera date, where the tragic death of Puccini's ultra-Italian heroine Tosca Helen brings to bursting tears. There are many beautiful views of the charming coastal town, beautifully presented by cinematographer Tami Reiker. The score is a paradise for romantic and beautiful songs - "I've never been in love", "I'm in the mood for love" and "Only The Lonely". Ellen DeGeneres as Janet Hall, late in her job at Helen's bookstore and meeting endless men without finding the right man, is just wonderful. She has not lost her comedic flair, though she did not appear much on television or film at this time in her career because only about two years before her hit mid-90s TV series "Ellen" was canceled because of her "coming out". as lesbian and the new lesbian theme of the show. Even the comedian Jack Black can be found in the small part of a fisherman long before he made it big. This is a moving film about human emotions and important choices, about people's need for a passionate, consuming love, and the general love of escapism conveyed not only through books, letters, and music, but through a truly loving and secure relationship , This is a great movie with wonderful moments and a contagious romantic spirit.
