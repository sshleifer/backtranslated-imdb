This TV adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel has been made so loving that I can barely find the words to appreciate them. Not since "Tipping the Velvet" (also highly recommended) have I seen such a performance by the leading actresses, this time by Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy. They have dealt with their souls, and that is what conveys to the public! The supporting actors were also well chosen and formed a great ensemble. <br /> <br /> For those who think the story is a lesbian relationship - no, that's only part of it. The other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love. And the plot has some more surprising twists. The movie should be interesting for both people and people.
