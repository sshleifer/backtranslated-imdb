If this film is not chosen for at least one Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Film, I will not stop watching the event at night. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson has proven that money is not the key to a good movie, but originality. From a cold land comes a warm but thought provoking film about a mentally ill man and his fight against a crazy world. After such an insight one wonders whether the man is crazy or not, in which world he lives.
