This is the kind of movie people will say at a certain age of "I did not think they would make such movies anymore". Walter Matthau gives his usual, outstanding performance, but leaves no traces of teeth in the entire scenery, but leaves grease stains. He's like that great uncle we all know he still wears plaid polyester and embarrasses anyone, but we still love it. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's performance reminds us why he has more Golden Globe nominations than anyone else (22). , He gives a life-like performance of the essentially "good, ordinary man," even in the milieu of a farce. <br /> <br /> This movie is unlikely to appeal to people who prefer a dull sense of humor that opposes confronting or insulting, but will appeal to people who value a broad farce played with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is outstanding in its ability to play such absurd characters while preserving the reality of each character /> <br /> Brent Spiner offers an outstanding performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard , Anyone who has known professional real-life hosts will immediately recognize what type he plays. He nails the guy perfectly. His interpretation of "mucus" deserves a study that is a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather an uncomplicated topic "Let's get rich", which has the usual results. Just because an action theme has been made a thousand times does not mean that it is outdated, but that it is a timeless theme. <br /> <br /> The rest of the understaffing shows what can happen when professionals show their works skills in the roles written for them, rather than fighting for the spotlight. In this film, even the actors of the second series shine. It is also obvious that they enjoyed making this movie. <br /> <br /> The action may be normal and thin, but it allows the performers to shine. <br /> <br /> This film is a real treat for people who want to see professional actors in their craft. The action falls away and the actors shine.
