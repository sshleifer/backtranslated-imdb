This is an excellent, exciting murder mystery movie. The plot was not only full of suspense and intrigue, but also saw the beautiful Ryan Gosling for a few hours, which is not to love! Sandra Bullock is also good in this movie - I've always been a fan of her (I just wish she had not chosen The Lake House, which was horrible, but that's a different story). Since there are thousands of other murder / horror films, it is obvious that there are similarities between them and that it is not necessary to beat this movie because it has some similarities with at least some already existing ones. Anyway, this is a great movie for those of you who actually enjoy "scary" movies, it's a bit dark and twisted, but overall a great movie !!!
