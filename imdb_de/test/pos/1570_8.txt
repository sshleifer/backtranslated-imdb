It's a sad state in Hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking any routes you've seen in movie house since the first day. I literally had no idea how this movie would end because it went to the left as I expected it to run right, jiggled when I expected a zag, etc. This could easily have turned into a generic suspense thriller to transform a depressing white trash drama. but it remained a very own course until the end. However, it is a sad story. Not because of what's happening to Alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her along this path. <br /> <br /> The plot has a calm form, which is usually reserved for theaters, but the tempo could attract it a bit. Anyway, it's a very good movie, and for some reason, I suspect sour grapes from those who have rated it low.
