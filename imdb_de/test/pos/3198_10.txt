I saw this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland and it was awesome; the saving grace of what another wise way was to just forget about bad groupings of movies. <br /> <br /> A perfect use of deep black and pure white with excellent but simple animations Cat hunts the moon. Funny, charming and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics and anyone else who cares how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your city, look at it. This short is worth the entrance fee.
