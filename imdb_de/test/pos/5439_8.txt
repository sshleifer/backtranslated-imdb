Over the years, I've become a fan of director / writer Barry Levinson and he has not let me down with this very funny look at politics. The well-known television comedian Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) has enlightened the nation with its devastating jokes about the state of the country and elected the responsible politicians. Night after night, his fans roll on the islands; then the question is proposed that Dobbs himself runs for the president. His manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken) says, go ahead. Dobb's fleeting rushes flare a grassroots movement that puts him on the ballot. Comedian to the elected president. In the meantime, a young woman (Laura Linney) finds a flaw in the computer system that will count coast to coast. My favorite sequence is Linney's melt in the cafe. Williams is absolutely hysterical with his quick jokes. Other important in the cast: Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black and Rick Roberts.
