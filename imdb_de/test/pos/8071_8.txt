Some would argue that Argentine director Esteban Sapir's La Antena is an exercise in anachronistic futility; Although the silent films, to which Sapir's homage was paid, were at the top of the cinema in their creation, they are outdated today, making La Antena a pointless strangeness. I would not agree. Fervently. La Antena merges the conventions of silent film with 21st century technology, making it the ultimate exercise in postmodern filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The film plays in the timeless "The City without Voice". so called because the citizens were made speechless by Mr. TV, a dictator / media mogul with painted hair. The city resembles the title in Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), perhaps 100 years before this film. They are all expressionist skyscrapers, television antennas and animated billboards. <br /> <br /> The citizens of the city are appeased by La Voz (The Voice), the only person with the gift of language. Her face, which is always wrapped in a hood (even if she is naked), forces La Voz to sing on Mr. TV's TV channel. However, when Mr. TV devises a plan to steal the written word, La Voz and her eyeless son join forces with a renegade family to try to give people back the freedom of speech. <br /> <br /> La Antena is nothing but pure cinema. Sapir is burdened with the concepts of silent film and has to rely on images to tell his story. The sound can be heard in the almost continuous score by Leo Sujatovich. It reminds of the best of silent film music and is imaginatively incorporated into the Diegesis of the movie, such as the beeping of car horns or the rhythmic Ra-Ta-Tat-act of shots. The whole movie is based on a familiar whirring, as if it were shown on an ancient projector. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of dialogue. Instead of using subtitles, Sapir displays the words of the characters in the frame. They are bigger or smaller and fill the screen or float in the air, depending on what is said. Think of a more ingenious version of subtitles in Night Watch (2004). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the words do not distract from the pictures. This is really lucky, because La Antena has some of the most creative and original images we've seen in a long time, all captured by Cristian Cottet's gorgeous black and white photographs. There are the expressionist urban landscapes. The singer with hood and her eyeless son. There is the abandoned antenna of the city, which looks like the dilapidated remains of a giant spider. And there is the sinister Dr. Y, whose mouth is displayed on a TV screen attached to his face. La Antena has been criticized because he relies too much on his imagery, undermining the allegorical depth. But I would not agree with that. It is true that the sudden appearance of a machine shaped like a swastika, or the eyeless boy who seems to be crucified on a star of David, does not feel right, a little bit beyond that in an otherwise well-made fairy tale. <br /> <br /> But the lack of open symbols (the two previous examples aside) is in favor of the film. It allows us to get an idea of ​​ourselves: to decide whether to attach political importance to La Antena as an allegory for fascism, the danger of capitalist monopolies and the power and responsibility of the media; or, to look at the movie as a face value, as a visually stunning adventure through a world that is both unique and familiar. <br /> <br /> The victim of explicit depth in favor of unique images may seem like a compromise. But when a movie looks so good, it's hard to take care of. Every frame of La Antena has more imagination and craftsmanship than Hollywood with a derivative stick. Movies almost 100 years old may be in vain, but Sapir may show us what is missing in today's films. He could tell us that it's time for another artistic revolution. And he can be right.
