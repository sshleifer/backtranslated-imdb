The action of Crispin Glovers (and not just his) is enormous. You really want to believe him because his body language and performance fits perfectly with the person. He gives Layne this extraordinary personality that makes this film a cult. Like Feck, which role Dennis Hopper plays very well. It's about choosing the right or wrong side without thinking logically about the scene. Friendship is more imported, and that's what makes decisions so difficult in my opinion. With Rivers Edge you can experience this with serious tones and family mathematicians. I really enjoyed watching. I first saw it a month ago, but if you have a good feeling for the 80s, this is what you need to see. It's the same thing that I did not know before.
