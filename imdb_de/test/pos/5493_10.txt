IN THE LINE OF FIRE is in my opinion an excellent, exciting action and drama / thriller! I thought Agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Agent Raines (Rene Russo) looked good in the clothes they were wearing at the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man and loved to play with Frank on the phone. He looked good in the tuxedo he wore at the end of the movie. What surprised me was the growing appeal between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. Before I summarize, I would like to say that the entire cast and crew have done an excellent job. I loved the scenery and could not get enough of it. Finally, I warmly recommend to all Clint Eastwood fans who have not seen this excellent, exciting action and drama thriller.
