Since I do not know much about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, I can only treat it as entertainment. I watched it too late in the evening (recorded by BBC2 earlier this year), but when I started, I had to watch until the end. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage is that it is indeed a court drama - never my favorite genre - but it is stunningly photographed (mostly in oversaturated ochres) and well executed. I could not take it off like a good novel. All the way through I wished I could see it in a movie theater to do justice to music and photography. What happened to the release in theaters? I'm an admirer of Chiwetel Ejiofor since I saw him in Dirty Pretty Things, and Hilary Swank looks great in it. <br /> <br /> This picture deserves a wider audience than it seems.
