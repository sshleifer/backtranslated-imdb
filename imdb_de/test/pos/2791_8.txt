I was allowed to see this film in my French lessons as part of "French Culture". I loved the way it was filmed, and the cut was really good, but most of all it was entertaining, especially the guy who played Wendy's brother. The plot was also really good and believable and adventurous. <br /> <br /> Favorite part: When does William wonder about the German who is studying and when he reproduces the flies? :) <br /> <br /> My French is not that good, but with the subtitles I could pretty well understand what was going on. <br /> <br /> SEE IT!
