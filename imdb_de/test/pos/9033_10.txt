I'm not a Faulkner fan (which is considered sacrilegious, especially since I grew up near the author's hometown); However, I think that this is a great movie. At the level of the movie "To Kill a Mocking Bird". If you have not seen it, buy it anyway. It pays off in your permanent collection. TCM recently starred in the film as part of the Race on Film series. I wish they would play more often. Very touching. <br /> <br /> By the way, people from Oxford, Mississippi, also like to see footage from the 1940s town square. The courthouse, the town hall, etc .: they are all on the screen. I never knew that the movie was shot there until I noticed the familiarity of the buildings. When I saw the arch in front of the town hall, I became suspicious. Look closely at the pennants on Chick's wall: you'll see two for Ole Miss!
