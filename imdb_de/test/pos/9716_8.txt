It would be a shame if you have not seen Speed ​​Racer yet, be it dubbed or submerged (I prefer the dubbed version (which is rare) because it was funny ... in a good way). The best thing about Speed ​​Racer is that you are never too old to look at it. go red and yellow !! I saw this for the first time when I was about seven and enjoyed the catchy opening. it disappeared for a while, then I saw it again a few months ago (I'm 19). Imagine the feeling of nostalgia rushing in and singing "here he comes, here comes Speedracer! He's a demon on wheels ~~~" over and over again. In any case, the concept of making 5 so many "ultra-multifunctional special cars" produced that none of his engineering geniuses could excel. The other cars just seemed too much. and it was not just the races or the fight against different bosses that made it interesting for me. it was the racial personality of racer-x and how the world of the speed racer "happened" to turn, so to speak. They have adapted some stories from the manga, but it turned out that all this was pretty good. Although I can not remember if the show actually showed racer-x in the manga, they did.
