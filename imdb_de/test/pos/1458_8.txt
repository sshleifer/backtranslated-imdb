We have moved far beyond this cautious push into a forbidden area - drug addiction - for the 1950s. Therefore, the movie may appear dated. The Golden Arm man functioned as a detachment of a layer of the bottom of society that opened the eyes of a southern country boy in 1955 when I first saw this movie in the theater. After thinking seriously about being too young, I was allowed to leave. It was powerful and poignant at the time and sustains some sharp, painful moments of the naked soul. As a film that depicts loneliness at the core of being, he succeeds. Frightened, Frank Sinatra, in his best role, creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer. He communicates his helplessness and ineffectiveness in a nice restrained performance. Kim Novak as Molly is a common sense voice in the urban jungle. She is compassionate and still stands on solid ground. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays a slimy character and does it very well. Eleanor Parker, in her role as the wretched zosch, the crippled wife of Sinatra, is extremely irritating and painfully uncertain. Arnold Stang is another unlikely survivor of the road. His character Sparrow is regarded as pathetic and despicable and offers harsh comedic moments. <br /> <br /> The music is almost the star of this movie, which is brutal, frenetic, moody and poignant. Elmer Bernstein's score highlights the tensions of Frankie Machine's mental weakness and physical heroin needs. Molly's theme is bittersweet and captures acoustically what the film visually depicts. I do not know any other soundtrack that complements the tension and defeat of a man as effectively as this one.
