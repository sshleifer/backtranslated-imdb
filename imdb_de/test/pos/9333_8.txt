Although I'm not a Michael Jackson fanatic, I like some of his early songs and some of Jackson 5. 'Thriller' is one of his great songs and comes from the best-selling album ever released with the same title. As for the video, it's awesome, one of Michael's best, but also very eccentric and weird. <br /> <br /> There is a story behind this video, but it's so complex that even I can not fully understand it. It freaked out. The craziest things are Jackson's transformation into a werewolf, his evil red eyes in the end (like a werewolf) and those dead people dancing. <br /> <br /> The video is very dark, exciting, cool and original. There are great landscapes and settings. The music itself is full of life and rhythm, characteristic of the good old pop of the 80s. <br /> <br /> I like Vincent Price 'Monologues. He makes a great story with his unique and unique voice and his bad laughter in the end is great! My favorite videos of "King of Pop" are "Billie Jean" and "Do not stop until you get enough" (both of his best songs).
