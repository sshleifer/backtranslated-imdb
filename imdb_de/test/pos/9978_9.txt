If you want your sports movies to talk about dignity and the best values, this will be a great thing for you. Overconscious in places? Of course it is clear - and proud of it. It is the biggest and best ride in carnival and should be enjoyed as such. <br /> <br /> Great production values, easy to say, with creative settings: It's not complex, it's a very beautiful and remarkably sweet movie. It really feels like a love work by Bill Paxton; and I bet his son gets that. <br /> <br /> The build is slow enough to be enjoyed, the stubbornness of the conflicts, and the British vs. the British. Two main transatlantic actors are always in the foreground. I have minor problems: The score wants to be James Horner, but too over-the-top and there are too many close-ups and panoramic shots for 2005, but if you want a straight, decent, and good-looking sports movie, then this is the case. <br/> < br /> So here's the thing, and I think I know my movie, but I actually liked it more than Seabiscuit: What's a better movie, but Greatest Story is just Disney at its core and hugely enjoyable! Thanks, Bill.
