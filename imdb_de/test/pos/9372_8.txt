"Crossfire" is not so much reminiscent of the fact that its three stars all had the name "Robert", but as one of the first Hollywood films that deal with anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the murder in Silhouette of a man we later learn is a Jewish man named Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene). The pipe smoking police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) is assigned to the case. A former soldier, Montgomery (Robert Ryan), encounters the scene of the murder and we learn through flashback that he had met Samuels in a bar with other soldiers who were taken out of service just after the Second World War. According to Montgomery, he and his buddy Floyd Bowers had followed Samuels and Cpl. Arthur Mitchell (George Cooper) to Samuels' apartment for drinks. Montgomery tells Finlay that Mitchell left the apartment first, and that he and Floyd soon followed with Samuels still alive and well. Can not find Mitchell, suspects him of Finlay's murder. He asks Sgt. Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) helps him find Mitchell. Mitchell has now wondered in a dazed condition on the streets. He meets prostitute Ginny (Gloria Grahame) in a bar and makes a friendship. She gives him a key to her apartment and he goes there to rest. Unexpectedly, a man (Paul Kelly) appears looking for Ginny. Mitchell, who is still dazed, goes and goes back to meet Keeley and his friends. Keeley manages to keep him from the police and hides him in a movie house where there is only the night. <br /> <br /> From Mitchell's point of view, we learn that Montgomery hates Jews and is probably the killer. Finlay begins to focus his investigation on Montgomery, who is trying to prove his guilt. He arranges one of the soldiers, a kid named Leroy (William Phipps) who sets a trap for Mongomery. <br /> <br /> "Crossfire" is considered one of the best of the Noire films. In fact, several Oscar nominations, including Ryan and Grahame, have been honored for the Best Supporting Actor. It was created on a modest budget in about three weeks. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements of the classic "Film Noire", the shadows, the restrained lighting and the history that usually takes place at night. The necessary "Femme Fatale" of the piece is Graham Ginny, who plays a subordinate role but is still her classic "Femme Fatale". The unnamed character, played by Paul Kelly (in a superb bit), was chiseled and spit out by Ginny. Was she going to do the same to Mitchell? Robert Ryan steals the picture as a brutal Montgomery, although he would write him in similar roles over the next few years. Robert Young makes a good, unobtrusive detective, but Robert Mitchum has little to do except the Mitchell character. Others in the cast are Jacqueline White as Mitchell's wife, Lex Barker (who was to play "Tarzan" the following year) as one of Mitchum's soldiers, and Richard Powers (who was previously Tom Keene) as assistant to Finlay. <Director Edward Dmytryk would soon be separated from Communist Party committees and spent several years in prison.
