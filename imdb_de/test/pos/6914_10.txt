That's speculation. This movie could be inspired by Paramount Pictures to film the movie The Core. Both films have something in common. The only improvement for Inferno is a better cast. Inferno's cast is still good. Excellent movie 8 of 10. This is worth a look. This movie has the truth that heat waves are real. Another part of the truth are heat failures. Where I live, I actually heard transformers. Heat rest is possible because people who want to cool off may row. There is a lot of teamwork in this film. Another movie worth seeing. The film has a good cast. The movie has no slow spots.
