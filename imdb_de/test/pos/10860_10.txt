I have nothing but praise for this miniseries. It's only about a year and a half old, but I've seen it twice before; with greater enjoyment the second time than the first. I'm seriously considering seeing it again soon as I find it spiritually uplifting. <br /> <br /> It's a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful performances, sets, costumes, music and scenes that it resonates, it almost blends into a league of its own among the mini-series. Some others have described the difficulties in the 1890s as lesbians in the UK. Nothing particularly difficult; Only male homosexuality was against the law when poor Oscar Wilde learned of its high cost and as a great loss to the literary world. Anyway, I digress. <br /> <br /> In my view, this is an essential television. It is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas since Romeo and Juliet, albeit not in the traditional sense. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 points from me. <br /> <br /> JMV
