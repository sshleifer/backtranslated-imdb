This work is pretty atmospheric, with a few surprises and some really spooky elements. I found this work more rewarding than I expected, given the bad reviews they receive here at IMDb. The dialogue appears natural and honest (under the circumstances), even though the entire filming process goes from a predictable cliche, with the heroines falling when they're about to run, and exploring strange sounds as they lock their doors. Typical horror movie fare. <br /> <br /> The local characters are among the worst clich√©s and portray the native people of the Appalachians as indigenous developmental freaks. The characters of the kids and the headmasters are great! The development is appropriate, and Scout Taylor-Compton seems to be developing her talents pretty well. Well, I'm not going to say that this is totally original or the best thing ever since bread was cut (which is not that great, by the way), but that's interesting and I'm back in 107 minutes. I would not say that this is a great movie, but there are some really good horror elements. But there are also some really slow spots where the plot / character development seems to be superfluous to the whim of the director (or the film editor). All in all, this is good for a rainy night, but not so good for a Friday / Saturday night. <br /> <br /> There is a 7.6 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> Fiends: rated.
