Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) has committed an indescribable crime, the stabbed younger brother of his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone). No one, least of all Leland himself, can explain why he did what he did, whether the act was done intentionally or spontaneously, out of hatred or love. <br /> <br /> In the detention center, Leland meets Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle), a once-novel novelist who sees Leland's second chance. Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivation and takes him as a confidant in prison under his wing. <br /> <br /> The film jumps several times from the past to the present and often makes the past appear as a context to the present and vice versa. Author / director Matthew Ryan Hodge shows how Leland's crimes - and the events that led to them - affect people in his life, from Becky, through her family, to Leland's mother (Lena Olin) and a strange father (Kevin Spacey) to Allen (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with Becky's family after the death of his own mother. <br /> <br /> The main advantage of the film is Gosling, who is perfectly populated as a 15-year-old pseudo-psychopath. Like Bartleby the Creator, Gosling's Leland just exists; He shows little emotion during the film, but instead his expressions believe in a sea of ​​guilt, sadness, love and anger. Each of the leading actor may have been doing his best work yet, except Spacey (who is that?) Not exactly a freshman). Special praise goes to Malone and Klein, two young artists known for lighthearted comedies, as the heavy drama of this film is flawless; No one is a hero to save the day. This is simply not a black and white film.
