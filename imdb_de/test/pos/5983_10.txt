In Belarus of 1942 two Soviet soldiers are arrested by Nazi-friendly Belarusians. In captivity, the attitude of the two men to their fate differs greatly. One of the soldiers succeeds in finding an inner strength and spirituality incomprehensible to the other man. Larisa Shepitko's last film is one of the most beautiful war films in cinematic history. The cinematography of Vladimir Chuchnov is incredible - especially in the opening sequence, in which long, slow tracking shots showing the loneliness and almost desperate nature of the winter landscape in rural Belarus perfectly set the mood. It's easy to compare Tarkovsky's films, even more so when Anatoli Solonitsyn, Tarkovsky's alter ego, plays a small but important role in The Ascent. The acting is brilliant overall, especially by Boris Plotnikov, in the role of Sotnikov. The film reveals an old-fashioned belief in the power of religious passion associated with characters like Dostoevsky's Prince Myshkin or Tarkovsky's Stalker. However, this is not a weakness of the film, but one of its greatest strengths. The religious content seems so honest and human that it is impossible not to be moved. The emotional richness of the film can not be overstated; The answer is not as simple as a brief summary of the plot. The slow development of the characters and the emphasis on their intricate relationships are reminiscent of The Commissar, another great Soviet film. The climb deserves a second look as well as a third and a tenth. It also offers interesting ideas, beautiful pictures and emotional complexity.
