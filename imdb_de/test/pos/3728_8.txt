I still can not describe what I should feel when I receive this from the Fnac site. Such a rare film, so little spoken and known, is hard to find, even for fans, but the contrast between past and present is devastating: Now I have a DVD of the film in the best quality. Like in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought on the internet, I saw this at home, all the lights on my DVD and TV were off and amazed at the experience. I did not know what to expect. I was always looking for a kind of disappointment when I saw a movie by Luc Besson that I had never seen before. But it never came. This movie was no exception. I understood from the beginning that the person who makes a film like this first film will be big in the future. And that's how it happened. This has won several awards (including the highest price at a film festival in my country, which makes me proud) and it shows that this film is preparing many bigger things. This could be the most original post-war movie I have ever seen, beating Mad Max in originality and artistic feeling. There is no problem with this movie: The cinematography is awesome and the performance of the actors. I am also proud that I have finally seen all the films of my favorite director and almost all of them have a copy (Joan of Arc is still waiting for me to buy the DVD). Above all, this film is a work of style and devotion, which makes it clear why Luc Besson is a director of my choice: good taste, beautiful framing, excellent use of music (I also admired Eric Serra 's first full - length movie score) and the promise of great successes. Gaumont did well to bet on his boy genius, the man who would later change the face of France and Europe's relationship between film and audience. Let's hope Besson is working on a new direction project. I will be the first to rejoice Until then, I recommend this movie to anyone who needs to learn how to make good movies with little money. I loved the atmosphere of the film, which, through its black-and-white post-Holocaust cinematography, suggests an even more depressing picture of the world. This film works through the magic of the films: in pictures, we show what we can not explain in words. And I am with all the people who wrote comments on this film and liked it: good choice! A big hug for those who see this and feel that their life has changed a little.
