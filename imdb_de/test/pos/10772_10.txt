When it comes to movies, I can not just tell the difference between crap, sheer crap and masterpieces. I think this movie is an absolute masterpiece and I find it hard to talk for more than 90 minutes. This movie was slower than Mystic River and Harry Potter 3, and I still managed to stay nailed in place. For me it was the passion that Eric Bogosian put into his performance. It is extremely difficult to reach such a stunt and to get a positive effect from it. Bogosian has probably met one of the toughest one-man performances of modern cinema. I had no respect for Bogosian until the end of the movie. The entire monologue minutes before the inexorable climax was the turning point, it was the key that turned me around. This man reached a point so low he could never recover from it. The corporate guys congratulated him on the performance. His bubbly prose made even the slenderest in the cavalcade shake his head. I realized that personal integrity and hypocrisy do not matter in the world of talk radio, even in the corporate world. Stone may have pushed an extremely liberal agenda, but it was the actual movie and the actual production that caught my attention. Oliver Stone is a little master of whims. The last third of the movie probably had the best lighting and cinematography I've ever seen. Stone artfully makes the DJ booth look like a five by seven cell cell in a 19th century prison. Visually, Bogosian's only friend seems to be the black foam that absorbs his normal vitriol. He speaks and it does not speak back. It's a sad metaphor, considering how he treats the people who brought him his success. Stone and Bogosian carved a stunning film about a man who is trapped by himself in a prison with walls as well as in a prison. This man is limited to his own will and he can never escape. The scene where I knew his riddle did not want to go back to his ex-wife. He preferred to prefer his own prison instead of the outside world. Every story has a conflict and it was about the simplest of all conflicts: man against himself. "Talk Radio" presents this conflict in an intelligent, enthralling and artistic way. There are no hidden messages in this movie and the progress of events should be expected by any attentive viewer. I leaned back and let my mind be captured by this movie, and I loved it. It is unannounced, unseen and will never receive the due recognition. Let's hope it stays that way, because gems deserve to be found and hidden again. It's a gem because I found it in the disc-disc in my Wal-Mart store. For $ 5.50 it was worth the half hour I had spent finding them. I made it and I'm worth more than my money. This is one of the best movies ever made and worth ten reasons alone. Ten reasons give ten points. <br /> <br /> Here ends my screaming!
