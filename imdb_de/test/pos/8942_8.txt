Wales seems to be producing some bizarre films lately. In fact, Wales seems to be developing its own small film industry. I recently saw Very Annie Mary, which I thought was very good. Plots with a View is not only quirky, it laughs loud, it's funny, has a bunch of wonderfully talented actors (Brenda Blethyn is amazing) and an action that is not entirely original, but is written so skilfully that you can always Happy is what could be almost like throwaway lines. It was the kind of movie I wanted to see right away when it was over, and one of the very few I really wanted to have. Although many of the characters are cartoons and you must have been in a Welsh village to appreciate that, they are also very human, and the relationship between Blethyn and Molina is a joy you can look at.
