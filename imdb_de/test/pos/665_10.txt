It's in the 80s and the teens are ready to celebrate it in a fearsome old house allegedly haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee. After accidentally summoning the dead through an unfinished conversation on a Ouija board, the children are forced to fight to the death by fighting a vengeful ghost who owns and kills all their friends one at a time. Sounds familiar? It should be. It is clearly marketed to pay tribute to the classic 80s slashers with the slogan: "Excessive violence, unnecessary nudity, no budget." <br /> <br /> Can not get enough; It is pure entertainment! I enjoyed the humor and the way it was fun with all the horror clich√©s, but at the same time, I appreciate what was fun about movies of that time. There's something you get with this movie that you never got with the old Slasher movies of the 80's: good acting. The entire cast was very talented and you do not see that in low-budget movies, the latest or any other. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I've been entertained throughout the movie, and I'm convinced that the writer / director and cast will go a long way in their own careers. The script was very well written and the dialogue was natural. <br /> <br /> The effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not well lit, but the fact that this movie is known on its cover there was practically NO BUDGET I already know how to do it. This movie makes it easy to politely ignore your mistakes and just sit back and enjoy. Although this is not an Oscar-winning opus, he never claims to be, and relies on it. It makes a lot of fun. If you like slashers, you will really appreciate this movie. If you like blood and boobies, you will appreciate it too.
