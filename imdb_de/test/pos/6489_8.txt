I bought it some time ago in a phase of martial arts. While this is certainly not the best, I love this kind of filmmaking, and there was a lot to talk about in this movie. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars. I always appreciate that while he had a formal martial arts training, he usually did more than capable combat. He also has a good beard. This movie has him in a good, heroic role and although he does not kick as much as in his other movies, he still does well. Early appearances by Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are also nice to see, especially because of the fact that Chow Yun Fat plays the bad guys without his well-known gun game. He may not be a great fighter, but he is doing well. Eddy Ko is as great as ever, performing the same scoundrels as in many of his other films, making it great as ever. The guy who plays Bu is fine too, I can not remember his name, but he's also in Magnificent Butcher. Although the fight is not as good as in other films of the time, The Postman Fight Back makes up for it with a lot of imagination, high-quality cinematography and a nice, quirky ambience. There are some very nice scenes, good characters and a good mix of Hong Kong talents, all of which come together to create a decent effect. All in all, I would recommend the Kung Fu and general Hong Kong action fans. It's not a stylized classic like the Shaw Brothers movies or as attractive as Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it's an absolutely solid entertainment.
