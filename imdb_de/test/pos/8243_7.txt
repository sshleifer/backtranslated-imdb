We went to the cinema, expected a big budget release and got an art-house movie. The film was digitally projected onto about two-thirds of the screen area with sloping edges of the classic projection and had a limited stereo soundtrack that was wasted on the cinema experience. The content of the movie was the same old historical content that we've all seen before, but heavily sanitized to keep the audience from getting sick. Live-action scenes, of which there were only a few, were constantly reused in classic documentary style, which became annoying after a while. The rest knew something we did not. <br /> <br /> I suspect the producers made the film to honor the ninetieth anniversary of Gallipoli. I have to ask if they should have bothered. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten for the trial and out of respect for the ANZACs.
