Lou Gossett, Jr. is awesome as "Chappy Sinclair," a US Air Force super pilot, who joins a nice but undisciplined "Doug Masters" (Jason Gedrick), the son of a captured pilot who is determined to make one Borrowing money, a pair of F-16 fighters are being rescued, who are to be used to rescue his father from a dictator (David Suchet) of a hostile overseas country. <br /> <br /> Better than "Top Gun", this aviation aviation movie is exciting and loads of explosions - you know, all the cool stuff you would expect from a contemporary military adventure movie. <br /> <br /> Cool music, including Twisted Sister's Dee Snider, The "We Will not Take It" and King Cobra's Superb Never Say Die. <br /> <br /> Aim High! Air force!
