*** SPOILERS *** Even though the movie "They Made Me A Criminal" is nowhere better than the later John Garfield classics like "Body & Soul" (1947), "Force of Evil" (1948) and its last and Very Underrated "He Ran All The Way" in 1951, it was the film that shaped his career from that time until his untimely death on May 21, 1952, at the age of 39. Garfiled plays the role Lightweight champion Johnnie Bradfield and later the refugee from the law Jack Dorney, who is innocent of the murder he has indicted, although he was officially declared dead. Jonnie's Manager Doc Ward, Robert "Doc" Gleckler, who killed the reporter Charles McGee, John Ridgely, during a drunken victory party, who would show the public his fighter Johnnie Bradfield is a single woman human and does not drink Mama's boy. Doc Gleckler smashed a bottle over McGee's head and killed him when Jonnie was almost dead and celebrating some women in his hotel suite. <br /> <br /> Doc was later killed in a car crash with Johnnie's girlfriend Goldie, Ann Sheridan, but Doc was burning hot and with Johnnie's guard on him he was considered Johnnie. He is said to be dead and buried by his attorney Malvin, Robert Strange, who took $ 9,750.00 from Johnnie's $ 10,000 of money for this great piece of advice. Malvin told Johnnie to adopt a new identity and from now on call himself Jack Dorney and bring hell out of the state of New York. talk about sloppy shyster. Johnnie now drives Jack Dorney the rails from New York to Arizona and lands on the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm, on which plays the largest part of the film. <br /> <br /> If John Garfield was not in the lead Both Jonnie Bradfield and Jack Dorney had long lost and forgotten the movie. Garfield, who was only 26 years old at the time, made the most of the entire movie. Even the transported Dead End Kids, I think we can call them The Arizona Kids. Acting was a bit higher than what was expected of them, and they looked like real and sensitive people, not like a bunch of baton clowns like in almost all their movies. All of this because he was on stage or filming with John Garfield. <br /> <br /> "They made me a criminal" is a good story that the undercover champion behaves like, but does not attract attention and ends up in the electric chair, not just behind bars. In the end, Jack showed what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and going against all the adversities that have won dramatically at the last moment, but by completing four brutal rounds to find the money for his new found Family at the Dattelfarm including his girl Peggy, Gloria Dickson, to open a gas station. <br /> <br /> Frank Riggi, the European champion of Gaspar Rutchek, getting the fight of his life and $ 2,000.00, that's $ 500.00 per round. Jack showed everyone who stayed with him like the "Arizona Kids" Sometimes it's much bolder and braver to throw a punch than to throw one. The fact that Jack Rutched could easily have been beaten, but not exposed to the police, like the loose murderer Johnnie Bradfield. Instead, he went as far as he could to take anything that Rutchek could throw at him to help his friends show more than any of the fights he had won in the boxing ring. <br /> <br /> I did not think the end of the movie was quite fitting, but fit into the story. Policeman Morty Phelam, Claude Rains, who came to Arizona from New York to arrest Jack, had to live for years with the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. We learned all that right at the beginning of the film. Knowing that Jack / Johnnie was innocent of the murder he was being charged with and not sure if he is found innocent in court, would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? I can easily see that this happens in real life, then why not in the movies.
