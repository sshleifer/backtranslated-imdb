If you look at home on DVD or Blu-Ray! Make sure you have an excellent sound system. The musical score is what moves you through the movie. I watched the movie several times and thought it was great, but having just upgraded my home theater sound system, what a difference. I will see this movie many, many times. <br /> <br /> if you do not have a great sound system. Find a friend who does it, and watch the video. <br /> <br /> Also look at the additional stories and the extras behind them (BR or DVD). The interview with Quimet in the 1960s talks about his scholarship money ... but for those days, only guys got it. today I hope that some of it goes to girls .......
