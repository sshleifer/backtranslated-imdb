The theme is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hired as a craftsman. She is a war widow. <br /> <br /> The set is limited, but acting makes up for it. Robert Ryan has come into conflict: in one moment he seems to be nice, then confused where he lives. First, Lupino tries to help him. He seems worried, but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know that? The tension builds up. I really like movies like these that rely on the human element. What can this man do? There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying boy who sees that something is wrong. We keep believing that she's being helped, then Ryan's personality turns again. He becomes like a Jekyll / Hyde character and finally chases Lupino with a knife. 10.9.
