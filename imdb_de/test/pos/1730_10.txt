I looked at all the doctors who played episodes played by my local PBS station during their adulthood (introduced to the doctor by John Pertwee) and "camera copies" of doctors sent to the United States by British fans , I had a great time with the show, but it never seemed to take it seriously - I mean, as seriously as a science-fiction show about a time traveler. I went to the CONs, made the costume (Doctor No. 5.6 and Tegan were my costume characters), loved it. then everything came to a sudden stop. Program policy and lack of interest and funding transformed the doctor into a 25-year-old antiquity that went into the ethos. When I heard that the sci-fi channel had found the new doctor, my first thought was "cool, now my 11-year-old son can see what I've been talking about all these years, and he knows what the hell a TARDIS "I have several phone booths and TARDISes in different sizes in the house" I did not expect the excellent story quality, character development and f / x. I should say it least of all - pleased. For the first time I found a doctor who was not a curmudgeon, a clown, a fop, a trip-head, a pussy or a ass. Christopher Eccleston is by far the most credible doctor. Now calm down, baker fans! Do not get me wrong, I loved almost every doctor and his quirks, but Christopher gave the doctor something he'd never had - real credibility. I'm just sad that he has decided against another season. I'll try David Tennant like any other doctor, but now the bar has gone up ... bad wolf rules !!!!! <br /> <br /> Update 2008 - I love David Tennant! His "mod" persona is something my generation remembers, my son's generation can handle it, and fashion gestapo can relax! he is a bit more human than christopher, but not as humas as other former doctors. I miss Rose, I dig Martha, and what did they think with Donna Nobel!?!? It's still the best ride on TV
