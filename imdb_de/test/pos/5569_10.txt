If you watch this series, you will probably feel that our parents felt the first time they watched Star Trek. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. The kind of stories that make you forget how you blink, the kind of characters that make you want to jump into the TV to take part in the action, and the kind of atmosphere that arouses your hair in awe and more endlessly Admiration sinks. <br /> <br /> In short, let's start with John Chrichton, an astronaut who is shot in a wormhole and arrives at a group of prisoners fleeing from the black bathguys, ironically referred to as Peacekeepers Others colorful characters are D'argo, a tall guy with a short temper and a sword / laser rifle. Aerun Sun, former Peacekeeper and PhD Buttkicking. Zotoh Zhan, who is a plant. No, she really is. She is also a priestess, but with a mean track. There is also Dominar Rygel XVI, a fat, lazy bastard who fears helium and generally does more harm than good. Later in the series, we meet the sexy alien that has ever been on television, Chiana. A young and apparently chronically horny Nebari. It's played by Gigi Edgley, a name you should remember. <br /> <br /> One of the many things I love about this series is that John Chrichton has accidentally landed in this part of the galaxy, giving hints to "real life". If John finds it hard to accept the fact that he's been frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaints is that Buffy The Vampire Slayer will be dead on his return. <br /> <br Frell all other series, get your dren together and spend an ancestor for one of these episodes. I can assure you that Sci / Fi, as you know it, will change forever. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. It's sexy It's action-packed. It's incredible. It's Farscape
