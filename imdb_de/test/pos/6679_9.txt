This is a movie that makes you think, or not? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, the audience has room to think and interpret based on the signs. This is my interpretation and theory, and I believe that it is very solid. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot first. One day Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the middle of a busy train station. After attempting to help a woman of street robbers, he is arrested and sent to Bellevue. Later he will be taken to the hospital of dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) brought. Prot speaks freely about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to report about the earth. Of course, he is classified as a money killer and detained in a low-security department. He befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. In fact, he tells them that he can take a person with him. Soon Dr. To challenge Powell, Prot's madness, and as the plot progresses, proving Prot as false is becoming more difficult. <br /> <br /> Dr. Powell that Prot is Robert Porter, a smart man who worked in a slaughterhouse in New Mexico when his wife and daughter were murdered. Prot claims that he intends to leave for K-Pax at a certain time on the fifth anniversary of the killings. Time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and will never be found again. <br /> <br /> To my theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of Prot. On a previous visit to Prot on Earth, Robert was a child and got to know the constellations of his father. Prot and Robert became best friends. After the death of his family and after Robert killed the murderer, Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is at K-Pax at this time, but he runs back (in multiples of the speed of light) to stop Robert. So Prot takes over Robert's thinking, his body, so to speak. A while later, Prot (who still lives in Robert's body) comes to New York and is imprisoned. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him but has to leave Robert's body behind. Therefore, we now have the catatonic Robert. <br /> <br /> Explanations or Notes: <br /> <br /> PROTS KNOW ABOUT THE LIBRA PLANETS: As Prot says, every child knows its own system. Few people on Earth had any idea of ​​the system, and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter was clever and knows his constellations, but he was not an astrophysicist. <br /> <br /> DR POWELL FEELS THROUGH PROT: It's true. Prot would have been able to leave the institute at any time, but did not opt ​​for it. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell says, "Now you've found Robert. Take care of him." Prot probably stayed there to secure Robert's place as he left. <br /> <br /> SUPER HUMAN ABILITIES: It was a proven fact that Prot had a much higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot returns his usual K-Pax reason, but no earthly reason was given. It was also mentioned that Prot was administered extremely high doses of medication. <br /> <br /> HELP PATIENTS: Throughout the film you can see how Prot is helping the other patients (or the patients discussing Prot's suggestions) help a better, healthy world. While the psychologist eludes Prot's help, Dr. Powell at the end of the film about the new lives that lead the patients. <br /> <br /> THE SPRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is connected to Porter's house in New Mexico (which is ironic where Roswell is). Does Porter connect the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is she trying to protect Powell's daughter from this terrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is believed that Porter committed suicide in a river. In fact, Prot (under hypnosis) is very worried about Robert. I think Prot connects the danger with the water, not with the sprinkler. He tries to protect the girl from the watery death, as he did to Robert. <br /> <br /> HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell believes he can discover the true identity of Prot under hypnosis, but although Prot provides much information, he never has information on his Prot persona and claimed the home of K-Pax. <br /> <br /> THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera spend for no apparent reason? MYSTERIOUS DISTINCTIONS: First, Prot disappeared for a few days on his journey north. Funny, the patients are not alarmed at all. In fact, they try to calm the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand it better than the staff. Of course, the most meaningful disappearance of Bess, the winner of the essay competition. Not only does she disappear at about the same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay. This is just my modest theory. You can complete what you want. You can Dr. Powell's theory is that Prot was just a person taken over by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would give up too many plotholes.
