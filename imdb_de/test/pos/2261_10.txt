If you have ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely funny. From teenagers wearing gold chains, listening to hip hop and dancing side by side, to jokes about airbags in cars and waitresses shocked by a vegetarian, this movie really captures parts of Ukraine that you would never know if you did not go would be there. I nodded off most of the film and thought, "Yes, that's just right." It's a lot of fun if you also understand Russian, because the subtitles do not always justify it. The actors are so credible and Elijah Wood does a great job as a socially disabled Jewish child. My favorite character is definitely Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., the grandfather's "seeing eye dog," who is really a psychopathic Border Collie. The characters are so versatile and sympathetic that you believe they are real people.
