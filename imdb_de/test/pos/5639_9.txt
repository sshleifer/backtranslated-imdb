Okay, I'm a fan of a good documentary, especially when he's telling a modern Don Quixote story. One drawback: I met Mark Borchardt in the winter of 1995/96 when he was still working on Coven. But I will keep this story for later. American Movie, who started production shortly after, portrays the exact person I know, even though he is deeper than I expected or believed. This is also a very funny and very sad movie that is brilliantly performed. Mark appears as his worse enemy: his childish ambition and optimism - which I admire - are undermined by his apparent artistic incompetence and bizarre fiscal expectations. But he is also a charismatic guy. His loyal Sancho Panza buddy is just as likable: loyal, if baffled, to the core. Like Don Quixote, American Movie is an often ignored inefficient aspect of freedom - people are attracted to jobs for which they are not particularly suited, despite repeated failures. It's a great movie.
