"L'Auberge Espagnole" gathered the audience wherever it was shown. It has won audience awards at numerous film festivals around the world. And it's not strange. We have the ability to see a happy and amazing work of art. And it's wise, by the way. "L'Auberge Espagnole" is a very funny comedy about youth and adulthood. Above all, it is about the lights and shadows of life in the European Union. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is a French economics student Xavier. He will be sent to Barcelona for a year for his future career. In Spain it turns out that the lectures are held in Catalan. That probably does not contribute to the increase of knowledge. However, it helps to consolidate relationships within the group of exchange students. Especially if they rent a large apartment together. There are 3 girls: English, Belgian and Spanish and three boys: German, Danish and Italian. Our Frenchman will be there too. One year is a very long time. Long enough to get closer and make friends. And get to know some European stereotypes as you try to break them apart. <br /> <br /> Klapisch treats this particular case of a process of uniting Europe with humor and palatability. It comes from the idea that young people are the same everywhere. They like jokes. They like to make irresponsible relationships. But they do not neglect their wishes. The most interesting is the sum of the experiences of this small community. They live together in the fire of everyday tasks and fight with the surrounding reality. They are full of unusual life ideas. Young Europeans return to their countries to live an adult life on their own. They are Europe's hope to fight the many problems of the Union. For example, the frightening administration system. In the end, they prove that, despite the many differences, they can not only communicate and make friends. But now also how to live life fully. And they will not allow them to take their lives full of life.
