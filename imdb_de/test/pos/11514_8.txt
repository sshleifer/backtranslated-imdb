As far as I know, this was my first experience with Icelandic films. It's such a relief to see something other than your normal Hollywood movie. Too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world. I can only hope that people see this by accident, by recommendation or by other means ... <br /> <br /> Because it's really worth it. I really left the cinema sad. I could not get the tragic fate of the characters out of my head. And it impressed me even more than I thought about the complexity of the movie. Not only was it a tragic story, it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack. It really made me think and I thought about it a lot. <br /> <br />
