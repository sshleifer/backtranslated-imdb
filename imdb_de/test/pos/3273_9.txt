spoiler-- <br /> <br /> In 1993, African-American director / actor Mario Van Peebles followed with "Posse", the hugely popular city movie New Jack City. The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also plays as the main character Jessie Lee. Plot: The movie begins at the turn of the 20th century when the United States was involved in the Spanish-American War. Apparently Jessie Lee was apparently at a time when the US justice system was able to send convicts to military service, and is an unwilling man serving a purely black cavalry force in Cuba. His compatriots include Little J (Stephen Baldwin), the fast-talking Weezie (Charles Lane) and the aspiring but simple Obobo (Tiny Lister). They find a hidden gold box on a reconnaissance trip and decide to keep it. The ambitious, bigoted Colonel Graham (Zane) finds out the gold and is apparently ready to kill Jessie Lee and his company for it. A shootout between Graham and Jessie Lee's troops leaves the Colonel blind in one eye and his troops retreat. Jessie Lee's ragged crew manages to smuggle itself back (and the gold) to New Orleans, but it turns out Graham is not far behind. Jessie Lee and her allies are forced to flee west to a town called Freemanville. Apparently, Freemanville was founded in the years following the Civil War by blacks. Jessie Lee's father, "King David," was the charismatic preacher who co-founded the city. However, as the intermittent flashbacks show, King David was soon brutally murdered by a white mob, in parallel with the Ku Klux Klan terrorist actions that began at the same time. Jessie Lee and his company finally find their way to Freemanville, only to find that the citizens are not happy to see him? Especially when Sheriff Bates (Richard Jordan) of a nearby white township clarifies that he wants Jessie Lee and his partner to be dead or alive. Carver (Blair Underwood) is the sheriff and de facto mayor of Freemanville and his own agenda may not be reconcilable with Jessie Lee. <br /> <br /> Analysis The action sequences are all very believable and Mario Van Peebles is doing well as a brooding hero. After the success of New Jack City, it was almost expected that Van Peebles would lead a sequel, or at least a similar follow-up action in the city. Instead, Van Peebles looked back 100 years, creating a predominantly black western (which virtually "renewed" the Western Westerns of the 1970s) and continued the legacy of largely forgotten black cowboy films of the early 20th century. Unlike New Jack City, the film was independently funded and originally released by Gramercy / Polygram Entertainment. Allegedly, those responsible in the big studios refused when Van Peebles introduced them to "Posse". Among the more "curious" castings of the time were the rapper Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc as Father Time or Angel. In certain interviews, Mario Van Peebles has said that he often acts against guys. In recent years, the trend to play rap singers in non-musical films has become almost commonplace. Enthusiastic audiences will notice various cameos from various entertainment personalities: black action movie veterans such as Isaac Hayes ("Truck Turner"), Pam Grier ("Foxy Brown") and Larry Cook ("The Haunted Man Sitting at the Door") appear Like stand-up legend Nipsey Russell, not to mention television producer Stephen J. Cannell (who starred as the younger Van Peebles as "Sonny Spoon" years ago). The film is bundled with Woody Strode ("Spartacus") in a key role.
