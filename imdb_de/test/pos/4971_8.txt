This is a great Italian Haifilm, which may not be a full action shark movie, but it has a great story about a Killer Shark native American attacking a small beach community. The movie has real scenes of real sharks and some not, but how they did it is pretty good. The actors are not great at acting in this Haifilm, but it shows better in some other Italian shark movies like (cruel jaw, last shark) they show pretty bad acting, but most Italian shark movies are good, which means that they are best chosen for the best Italian shark movie of all time. Some scenes in this movie show Violence / Gore, which makes the movie so good that it shows it like I said it's the best movie for all shark movie fans.
