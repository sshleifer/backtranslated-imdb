Has there ever been a Angel of Death like MIMSY FARMER in Heroin Opus by Barbet Schr√∂der? Kind of Jean Seberg with a hypodermic. Pink Floyd scores. Despite a few insignificant weaknesses, a classic Erich Segal / Noel Black has shamelessly torn for its awkward JENNIFER ON MY MIND (1971), even though Tippy Walker, who plays a similar character, is appealing even in the final mess. MORE, however, is terrific, a great drug film of the 60s and simply an important document of its time. A very iconic movie, so join the cult. <br /> <br /> No American movie shows the same area as far as I can remember. MIMSY is an amazing archetype that elevates it into mythical realms. Not for the faint of heart. Also great sex scenes.
