The cast for this production by Rigoletto is excellent. Edita Gruberova sings Gilda great and passionate. Luciano Pavarotti also sings great. Vergara is a beautiful Maddalena. Fedora Barbieri is a famous older singer who sings the maid Giovanna. Weikl sings Marullo; Wixell sings both Rigoletto and Monterone. Wixell is probably Rigoletto's most compelling acting singer in this hard-to-beat ensemble of great singers. Kathleen Kuhlmann in the Contessa. All principals are known and world famous. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting rigoletto, both visually and musically. <br /> <br /> I have it both on Laserdisc and on DVD. You should have it too!
