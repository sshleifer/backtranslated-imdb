This movie is pretty good, it's actually like a good wine, the better you see it, the better. The tempo is pretty slow for such a high octane theme, but the cinematography is beautiful and surreal. There is a cool blue hue that "rides" the whole movie. There is also a great performance in Gabriel Casseus' performance of the character "Midget". He is amazing. Why is this guy not working anymore? If the movie got better support, he probably would have.
