This game has comic graphics, not much violence and really short levels - why do people say it's so brilliant?!? Because it always attracts your attention, it captivates you and refuses to let go! They'll spend hours trying to find that damn black box and figure out how to get into the room without alerting the guards, and so on! The steps are short only if you know what to do. Until then you will spend hours trying to figure out where to find correspondence, where to find helicopters, and so on! And you will always have fun! Worth a rent!
