A bit of a remake of AIRCRAFT AND AUTOMOBILES in many ways. I think it's such a bad and sad coincidence that both John Candy and Chris Farley left us when they were still busy. God bless both I think the actions of 2 movies are really similar, road trips of two different poles of characters and a lot of unfortunate consequences because of Chubbie's great performance by Chris Farley, The missing part of this movie is the tricky stuff when we do compare it to Candy & Martin Classic, but I think it's better that way
