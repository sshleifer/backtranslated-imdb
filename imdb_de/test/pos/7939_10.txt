I saw this movie with a live performance by the Buffalo Philharmonic, and the music was one of the two things that definitely made the experience for me; especially the song after the battle, in which the woman is looking for her husband, was just devastating. The other thing that struck me is the fight on the ice itself, a bit of strategy that was thoroughly demolished in 2004 by the creators of King Arthur. The fight also lasts forever (half an hour?) - painfully long. I can not imagine another propaganda film that makes the war less glamorous or rewarding. I am surprised that Stalin liked this movie so much. I would not want to go out and fight after seeing it.
