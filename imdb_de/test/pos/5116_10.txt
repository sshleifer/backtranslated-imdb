I love Ernest goes to jail. It's one of my three favorite films from Ernest. The others are Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest goes to camp. In this film, Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a janitor for a bank, but wants to become a bank clerk. Soon he will be assigned to the jury service, but soon he gets into trouble when the evil murderer Felix Nash (also Varney) knocked him down and changed places with him! Soon, Ernest is in prison and must act like Nash, otherwise Nash will kill the love interest of Charlotte Ernest. When they bring Ernest to the electric chair, he thinks he is Nash, he gets electrocuted, breaks out and saves Charlotte from the evil Nash! Filled with funny scenes and comics, Ernest Goes to Jail is a movie that will make you laugh so much! I still do! Jim Varney was such a fantastic actor! He did a good job playing both good and bad! Varney was like his Toy Story star Tom Hanks. No matter what role they played their roles were memorabilia and that's one of the things that Varney will remember forever! REST IN PEACE. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thank you for bringing Ernest and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10!
