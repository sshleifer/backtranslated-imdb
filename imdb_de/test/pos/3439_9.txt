"Jaded" takes on the complex issue of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In less hands it would have become an erotic thriller intended for direct-to-video. However, this director has succeeded in creating a structured, multi-layered study with a decidedly different viewpoint. Given that the director / writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. Are women, too, would have turned it into a very anti-male movie. It is not. Being a sexual predator is gender neutral. The nudity of this movie is not erotic. The rape is brutal and not sexual. We consider victims and no screaming. <br /> <br /> The gifted cast is true. For a film that is so little known, the quality of the performances surprised me. They are good. Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are incredible. <br /> <br /> Somehow this movie has been lost. Maybe it's too smart for yourself. It's a "should see". Highly recommended. The sexual thriller of a thinking person.
