An unusual, revisionist West that is worth seeing. Despite a slow start, the film builds up? with almost no dialogue and no subtitles? an increasingly engaging and intense, almost existential portrait of life in the harsh environment of the western desert. The growth of the main characters is worth waiting for, and the strong central cast brings a real sense of desperation into the struggle for possession of the all-important horse. How interesting that this was done by a British director. I hope he smiles now: I have the impression that the film was largely ignored by contemporaries; but time works as usual alchemy, and hidden gold shines as it must be inevitable. One note shook me: Revisionism is only carried so far. Sam Waterston as an Indian? - Of course, he plays his role with real emotion and intensity, but in fact no Indian actor could do the job? His scenes with Caroline Langrishe, however, have an intimacy that contrasts beautifully with the immense landscape. <br /> <br /> Forget big, bankrupt Hollywood versions of the past, men with big heads and whirling music. In this case it is about a primeval struggle between protagonists who, without knowing all the peculiarities of "ordinary" life, understand what it is worth fighting for. Impressive.
