Despite its extremely low budget, "Sorte Nula" is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004. And I have to say, a thoroughly deserved success. What I love most about "Sort of Nula" is the intricate detail with which Fernando Fragata interests you, what's going on and what's going to happen next. It is very detailed and excellent for a seemingly simple thriller that has become the story of love. Even happier and ironic is the fact that the characters are in the same situation. None of them knows the entire story and is left to their own assumptions. This is definitely not a movie you want to go for a swim break, as you will surely miss something important. I think one of the film's main attributes has to be the environment it creates. It's scary, but funny at the same time. I read somebody somewhere who quotes this movie saying "... it was like seeing Hitchcock ..." and I could not agree anymore !! I love movies like these, where you have to watch out for everything to understand what's going on. 9.10
