A terrible little movie starring Mary Astor as a jerk who works his way up as a cumbersome paper company, but if the owner needs to sell for health reasons, she has a program for employees to buy the company with a jerk (Robert Ames ) as a "front", even though it is the brain. <br /> <br /> Of course, he becomes a great success and she becomes his chief secretary, who basically still manages and teaches everything. She loves the dope, but he never fails to fool around with a bunch of Bimbos. She is being persecuted by a married but separate man, Ricardo Cortez, who is not free. But when a company gets Ames, everything goes to hell. <br /> <br /> Astor is just wonderful because the too smart woman almost makes a big mistake after she lost her husband. Ames is good as a jerk (but what does she see in him?) And Cortez is good but has not much to do. Kitty Kelly is a good buddy, Dolores. Charles Sellon is the original owner, Cather Dale Owen is the socialite, and Edna Murphy is funny as Daisy. <br /> <br /> Worth a look.
