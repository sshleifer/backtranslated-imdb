It seems that some of the previous reviewers have overstated their expectations for this film. I found it to search the satellite channels for something (not knowing what) and happened on it. I thought by the title it could be one of the countless softcore porn movies that appear regularly on the movie channels, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although there was a frontal nudity for men (actually more than your typical soft-core title - go figure!), This was not the focus of the movie. It was just fun. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by my taste: My latest screenings include Before Night Falls and Europe, Europe (both Geat, IMHO). But I also enjoy watching a movie. Virtual Sexuality has done that for me and that's not a bad thing!
