My main criticism is that it's not long enough or detailed enough. I would have liked to see more of everything: the ship's construction, the engineering, the training, the first approach to orbit, the preparations for departure, the Venus orbital injection, everything. I would have liked to see more of the first stage, Venus to Earth, instead of driving there like a # 10 bus. In fact, I would have liked a series on Earth's history, with a full hour for each planet and perhaps another one for the loop around the Sun. So I was hungry. On the other hand, I also understand the budgets and the attention of the audience. <br/> <br /> To the Science: Let's be honest about the time delay of the speed of light: You mentioned at the beginning that it is there. There was a delay in the conversations, but they let them evaporate as soon as they became the outer ones Planets reached. The audience had to be presented with a kind of talk, and we must assume that the delay was lifted for the sake of palatability. So no complaints there. Zero for loud spaceships. The only film in which spaceships make no noise was Kubricks in 2001, and even then he interrupted the sound of the crew breathing in their helmets - which was pretty effective. I wish the Space Odyssey makers realized how scary the sight of giant rocket engines might be in total silence, but unfortunately Pegasus wakes the same roar as any other cardboard spacecraft in any other Sci-Fi film made of cardboard. > <br /> But the rest of the science was excellent. No complaints, in fact praise for the fact that they have just as well shown the radiation problems. I just hope the BBC, after making this movie, will not stop it from producing a really detailed version, but I think that's not for next week or next year ...
