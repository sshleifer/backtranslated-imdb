Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those movies I grew up with, but one copy has not been received yet. I just watched this movie on DVD and thought it was a delightful and charming movie with wonderful animations, good action and great songs. If this movie was made by Disney, the movie is considered a classic. Since he was made by a little known film studio, the film has slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The film was produced by Max Fleischer Studios in their studios in Miami, FL and published by Paramount Pictures. The film was scheduled to premiere on December 7, 1941, the date of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Although this has likely affected the release of the film, the film has been played in some movie theaters for up to a year, which has been researched. The movie was named a family favorite by most major American newspapers. The movie was re-released approximately every year, usually around holidays like Easter, at least in the big cities. In the mid-1950s, this movie was released under a new name. "Hoppity Goes to Town", named after the main character of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is a real piece that captures a bit of Americana, as it was in the late 30's and 1940's. The animation is great and many of the characters are very cute. The animation of the people in the film takes place via the rotoscope process. This means that actors were filmed and the footage was tracked by entertainers, which gave the movement a very real look. The Fleishcher studios were one of several animation studios that made animated cartoons in the '30s and' 40s. While some of the butcher characters such as Betty Boop, Popeye and the Superman cartoons are better known, the work of the studio is more or less forgotten. <br /> <br /> Almost as a whole the Fleischer Studios' work is in the public area. All Superman cartoons are in the public domain, all but one of the "Color Classics" series are in the public domain, and the movie "Gulliver's Travels" is also public. This movie never seems to have been released in the US on VHS or DVD, but was released in Europe. However, some who look around the internet can quickly produce a copy. I recommend the search.
