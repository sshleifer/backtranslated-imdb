The Reader is a perfect example of what a short film should be. A poignant story told simply in a well-written dialogue, beautifully painted images, a score that flows seamlessly through the narrative, and characters portrayed with thoughtfulness and grace. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at a festival Other interesting films and ideas were shown. But none of the other short films had all the elements of great filmmaking in a movie, like The Reader. The reader has grabbed the attention of every festival visitor in the room and led us 10 minutes into the emotional lives of the characters. <br /> <br /> Duncan Rogers has made a nice movie and I hope to see more of that director be it more short films or maybe a full length movie.
