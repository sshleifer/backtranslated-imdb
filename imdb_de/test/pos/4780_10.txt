This was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon and the first cartoon with sound. In the cartoon Mickey is still wearing no gloves. He does not speak yet. Everything he does is whistle and make music. The song he plays is "Turkey in the Straw", where several farm animals are used as musical instruments. For example, he plays the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pulls piglets like an accordion keyboard. I have taken this cartoon from the Disney Channel and think it's wonderful. It is based on a silent movie with Buster Keaton titled "Steamboat Bill, Jr.".
