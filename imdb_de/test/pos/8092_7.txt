This was Chaplin's first all-talking picture, and the results are mixed. The film is a biting satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their followers and their fanatical way of life, especially in relation to the persecution of the Jews. It was daring and forward for 1940 and must have gotten a lot of people to wind. <br /> <br /> Compared to Chaplin's earlier works, this is pretty pale compared. The sweet, funny style of his Silents is in my opinion far superior to his first talkie. There are many meaningless bits that stretch out. If this was a silence, it probably would not have happened. <br /> <br /> I find one of the funniest moments of the musical barber moment and the globe dance. One of the most touching moments is obviously the speech in the end. <br /> <br /> The Great Dictator is an effective and sometimes moving film that plays a major role in Chaplin's story as well as in film history. It's flawed, but Chaplin is in great shape.
