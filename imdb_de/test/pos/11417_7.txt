I liked this movie. I'm not a big horror movie fanatic, so I could not comment on the similarities between this and other films of this genre, but I found this movie very intriguing. The plot, though a little obvious, had some really scary / tense moments and the drama (especially the female lead role) was not bad anyway. Overall, I'm a bit surprised by the low rating this movie has received. I watch a lot of movies (working in a video store helps) and that's not as bad as people seem to think. However, I have criticism. The policeman's final call was awful, almost overreacting, the dead girl in the bathroom looked like she was sleeping a little (probably because of the amount of tequila she mentioned) and the children's reaction to what was happening in me that they were eventually killed. <br /> <br /> hope this helps some people
