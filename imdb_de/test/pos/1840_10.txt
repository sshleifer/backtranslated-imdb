Gracie (Minnie Driver), a woman in her late twenties, is on a waiting list for a heart transplant. Bob (David Duchovny) just had the tragedy of losing his wife in a car accident. You can guess the result. Gracie receives Bob's heart even though they do not know each other ... yet! A year later, Gracie feels like a new person, while Bob is just beginning to think about his social life. When a friend puts him on a blind date, Bob is interested in the waitress Gracie in the restaurant where the date takes place. They start to see each other. How long will it take for the truth to materialize and what consequences will it have? This lovely, funny and touching movie is one of the best romantic comedies ever made. The two stars dazzle when the pair that only heaven can bring together can come together, and the side cast of Bonnie Hunt, Jim Belushi and Carroll O'Connor is also wonderful. The area near Chicago is equally charming and beautiful. Let's do these dittos for the costumes and the script. If you know someone who walks through miraculous love stories ga-ga, you will be forever in his grace when you introduce him or her in this beautiful movie.
