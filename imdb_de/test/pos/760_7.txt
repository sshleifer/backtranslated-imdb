I had never heard of this movie when I spotted it while searching the shelves in a local pawnshop. After watching the latest Harry Potter issue, I was fascinated by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. I read the description of "an overzealous evangelical Christian Ph.D.," and identified myself as an evangelical Christian. I thought, "Oooh, that should be interesting." And so it was. I found the story of Mr. Brock beautiful in words and pictures; and sad enough, too familiar. The contrast he drew between Ben's parental interpretations of what it means to be a Christian was a poignant commentary on how Christians see themselves and the impact that perception has on the people around them. On the one hand, we told Ben's mother, "Whatever happens behind these walls, Ben, we are God's messengers, we are giving the world a smiling face." On the other hand, Ben's father discusses the truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film. At the end of his monologue, he says, "The more a person moves their Christianity in favor of others, the less I tend to trust in the Christianity they claim to be, God tells us that true faith is the freedom to choose the truth as you express that, the way, the way, the means at your disposal, these things have no consequence, be Christian or atheist, unless you are true in your heart. "If only our churches would be full of Christians who have ascribed to this latter definition what it means to be a follower of Jesus, and not the first. What difference would that make! As a Christian and psychologist, I would like to have an imperfect but authentic belief about a perfectly polished image every day. What a tragedy ?? In order to feel that I always have a role to play, I really only have to rest in freedom to be what God has made me to be. I think Mr. Brock gives a refreshing insight into what this freedom looks like in Christ. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a new look in the faith.
