When I saw this movie for the first time about 6 months ago, I thought it was interesting, but a little more. But it stayed with me. This interest grew and grew, and I wondered if my initial boredom and reaction had more to do with the actual VHS quality than with the movie itself. I bought the Criterion DVD box set and it turned out that I was right the second time. Alexander Nevsky is a great movie. It is rousing, and I am sure that it has achieved its main objective: propaganda against the Germans. <br /> <br /> This is the most common criticism of this film and Eisenstein, that it is just a propagandist and nothing else. It is untrue. He is an amazing movie artist, one of the most important who has lived. Meanwhile, the world is far beyond Joseph Stalin to view Eisenstein's films as art.
