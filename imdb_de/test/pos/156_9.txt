From the director of Oldboy comes this smooth vampire strip. Kang-ho Song plays a priest who is accidentally turned into a vampire while being healed of a deadly, mysterious virus. His vampirism and priesthood are quite conflicting, but he can survive by depriving the hospital blood bank and unconscious patients who may not be dealing with some blood from the blood. Because of his supposedly miraculous survival, he comes into the life of Ha-kyun Shin's family. Shin has cancer and his mother believes Song can heal him. Sadly, Song's vampirism increases his desire to a height where he can not help but succumb to Shin's young wife, OK-vin Kim. Kim is deeply interested in the world of vampirism, and the two become lovers. The film from there goes in strange directions that I should experience for myself. What should really be mentioned is the mastery of the medium of cinema through Chan-wook Park. My God, I've seldom seen such a masterful visual artist at the height of his powers. The main flaw of the movie is that it is a bit incoherent, especially at the beginning. Park is interested in telling his stories mainly about the visuals, which are sometimes hard to follow. But when it works, it flies. The movie is also perverse funny. The last sequence, easily one of the best of the decade, is both heartbreaking and wonderfully ridiculous. OK-vin Kim should become a global star after this movie. She gives one of the best performances of the year.
