It has been a while since I saw Cold Mountain, a bit I knew that I enjoyed it immensely. Although it takes place in the last days of the American Civil War, it's not really a war movie. It's more of a novel / drama and it works. mainly because of the performances. I do not usually like Nicole Kidman, but I like it very much here. I found her very convincing in her role. I also like Rene Zelwegger, whom I usually do not am Fan of.Jude Law is good as always. The minor occupation. There are some great supporting performances, too many to mention. There are also some breathtaking scenes in the movie. And there are also some very nice pieces of music. The story is sad and tragic, but it's a beautiful story. For me, Cold Mountain is an 8/10
