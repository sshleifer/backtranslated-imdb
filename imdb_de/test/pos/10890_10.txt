We all played Halo and Socom and GTA and Resi and so on, but none of them can withstand GE007. The game itself is great. I literally burned out my N64 by playing this great game with Zelda OOT. This game alone has created the form that is essential for all modern shooters. In addition, the multiplayer is great. The story mode itself is worth more than a hundred times to be played. It's a great game if your board wants to kill some people and there are endless unlock options. (cheats, aztec, egyptian, god knows how many multiplayer charries and the three difficulties as well as the familiar difficulty level "007") Our modern games are great, but if you sit down and play this game, you have a certain feeling that There are only a few other games you can give. And with the online skills of recent shooting games, we rarely see this old two-to-two death match style, and when we do it's not nearly as good as these games. And if the story gets boring, there are endless puzzles to find and use mishaps and easter eggs. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best shooter games ever.
