(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who contacted Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to meet her needs. Ronnie has to report to his National Guard and leaves Rae alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the city trampoline with the strong desire to meet with a man. After a party, Rae is brought home by a friend who beats her half to death and throws her sideways. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home. Lazarus takes care of Rae and believes that he can save her from himself. Since Rae is like a dog in the heat, Lazarus puts a 40-pound chain around her and his cooler to keep them from looking for men. Lazarus has his own problems because his wife has just left him for another man. Lazarus turns to blues music to relieve his pain. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The film has a deep meaning as soon as you have overcome sex and violence. The movie has a different feeling. The story is raw and almost takes you into the movie as if you were there. The 40-pound necklace is a good metaphor and symbolizes a chastity belt. You do not give love to anyone, but you keep them for your true love. The chain could also be a parallel to a woman chained to the kitchen, but Rae did not cook. Rae just wanted to have sex all the time, while a woman can not. I think Craig Brewer (writer & director) made an extraordinary movie, and Samuel L. Jackson sings a mean blues song. The story is emotionally charged and treats the themes of race, religion, music and sex in one. (Paramount Classics, running time 1:56, R rated) (8/10)
