Conventionally and superficially, Claudy's portrayal was incomplete, it is believed that only a few moments with Sheila he makes her win her love, but the story itself and the songs do it and the enjoyable experience essentially constitutes the final sequence. I do not know why there was a PG rating. <br /> <br />
