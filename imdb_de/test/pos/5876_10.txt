Since there were so many reviews of this beautiful movie, I will write in the form of a list and try to deal with issues that have not been discussed. <br /> <br /> 1. Dana Andrews was 38 years old when this movie was filmed. His character was mid-20, according to the script. Andrews, a highly underrated actor, played a character who was said to be much younger. <br /> <br /> 2. Fredric March, like all the BIG actors, sometimes needs to be held back by the director to avoid exaggerated acting. He was drunk on the night of his arrival after the cameras when he was drunk, and also the next morning when he checked his mirror in his mirror. <br /> <br /> 3. Dana Andrews was great when he was in "Laura", "The Ox-Bowl Incident", "A Walk in the Sun", "The Purple Heart" and many other films. Why did Fredric March win the Academy Award and why was Dana Andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance? <br /> <br /> 4. Harold Russell gave the best performance I've ever seen from a non-actor. <br /> <br /> 5. I realize these were the 1940s, but Dana Andrews did not seem to have a romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife (Virginia Mayo). <br /> <br /> 6. Ray Teal, who played the right bigot, became famous years later by portraying the sheriff on "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> 7. The professor from the South wrote that the movie was moving slowly, boring and working poorly. The professor is most likely uninformed about classic films. The beauty and significance of these timeless classics is that they are slow character studies that avoid obscenity, excessive force, and unfounded sex.
