Well, that's more like it is! One of the best movies I have ever seen! Although the film was done very well in all aspects, this movie was only used because it was not too historically accurate. Loosening: There are plenty of historical films out there. They were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them they do not come close to how great, how entertaining and how captivating this movie was! Well, that's what a movie ticket is about! You will get exactly what you want This genre and all naysayers of this movie are those with the anti-Flynn syndrome. This conservatively rooted syndrome is very closely linked to the anti-Elvis, anti-Ali, anti-Clinton and anti-Kennedy syndrome, which usually arises out of fear of charming individuals having unconventional beliefs. If the viewer of this film is open-minded and has the opportunity to separate politics from art, this film will not only be one of the best classics, but also one of the best films of all time. I guess it's the second best western ever, right Waynes Cowboys ........
