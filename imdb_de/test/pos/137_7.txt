Everything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant and distorted to a minimum. Well, all I am not is at least a cyborg. Park's latest movie entitled Thirst is a vampire romantic erotic thriller-dark comedy drama? yes, these are many adjectives ?? Inspired by the 19th century French novel by Emile Zola titled Therese Raquin. Park creates a uniquely Korean and unique park vision of the vampire myth and challenges the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest discovering that he has a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop. Park provides the elements that you would hope for, but he definitely misses the quality of masterpieces like Oldboy or even Lady Vengeance. Heavily bloated with a narrative that often loses less than the audience, Durst urgently needed another trip through the cutting room. It crawls when it's about to run, but fortunately brings it home before it completely loses the audience. As negative as the whole thing may sound, the positive aspects definitely outweigh the negatives. Undoubtedly, another volume has been added to the dark and twisted zeitgeist of the Park Chan-wook movie. <br /> <br /> Check out the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com
