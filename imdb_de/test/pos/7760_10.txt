Suzumiya Haruhi no y√ªutsu (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) might at first glance think that this is just another animated school comedy / drama. It is not good! The environment happens to be a school environment. This is a comedy but a very smart one with a lot of sarcasm. And the characters have a psychological grandeur almost in the same class as in Ingmar Bergman's work. The episodes, it seems, are broadcast out of sequence, d. The show is an adaptation of Nagaru Tanigawa's popular novel series on Haruhi Suzumiya. <br /> <br /> What about the story then? As in all episodes, the story revolves around Haruhi Suzumiya, who tries to ease her own boredom by embarking on adventures. Haruhi himself has no interest in ordinary people and is actively seeking aliens, time travelers and espers (persons with supernatural powers). To find these people, she has founded a club she calls the SOS Brigade (Save the World by funneling her over: Haruhi Suzumiya's Brigade). With the exception of Haruhi, the other members of the SOS Brigade are Kyon. He is the true protagonist of the show. It is in his view that we follow history. He happened to be at the front of the classroom when Haruhi got the idea to start the SOS brigade. He's rather skeptical of most club activities, just to make sure Haruhi does not go too far, and he's the only one in the class Haruhi likes to talk to. Another member is Yuki Nagato, who is the "indispensable silent member" and also the only remaining member of the literary club who has staffed the SOS brigade in search of a vacant clubroom. She does not mind that the SOS brigade uses her club room as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books. She also participates in the brigade activities. Mikuru Asahina was "voluntarily arrested" by Haruhi because the club needed a Lolita-like mascot for something suspicious to happen. She often acts as a club girl. The last member is the ever-smiling Itsuki Koizumi, who happens to be the "mysterious transfer student" (which means he spent two months in the semester that Haruhi considers mysterious). This Believes Haruhi All members except Kyon are randomly selected students in the school, but they actually have their own interest in her.
