Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarva's most political films. She has a strong attitude towards the status of authority of modern society in the life of the common man and how he has completely alienated people from nature. It questions the whole concept of freedom and prosperity in our welfare society. <br /> <br /> Vatanen (Antti Litja) - who stifles the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - tries to rattle the chains of society all through the wilds of northern Finland - just to realize that Concept of a "free country" is not so clear, in other words, society has the simple man at the balls. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, apart from the visual and humorous brilliance, Jäniksen vuosi is so extraordinary that it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in Finland in the 70s and the whole identity of Finland as a nation. In his loneliness and social distance, Vatanen is like an archetype of a classic Finn. Since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us Finns, the idea that modern society is slowly taking away this society is moving Jäniksen Vuosi emotionally exceptionally.
