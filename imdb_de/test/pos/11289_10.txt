The existential experiment of E. Elias Merhige is definitely a damn boring clock. This is as if Alexander de Large had to watch in "A Clockwork Orange". Despite the unsurpassability of this film, however, he is a success. <br /> <br /> If you've read this and have not seen the movie yet, it's too late. For me, the payout was (after 3 separate visits with many interruptions), the list of characters * after * the story was told. Then the simple message came home. But I wonder if Merhige could have told a story of about 30 instead of 78 in fifty minutes. <br /> <br /> However, seeing the credits on the title page of this movie, The Cat, prominently displayed is already out of the bag, and you will certainly appreciate this movie only if it's existential Appreciate filmmakers from the early 20th century. Even then, you may puke. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but I recommend some for crafts, even if it's unsurpassable)
