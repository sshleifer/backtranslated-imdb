I saw Love Life on vacation when it was filmed at a Florida film festival. It was a nice surprise to find a British film that was neither derivative nor exploitative. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will thrill audiences as they sit back and enjoy the gentle tempo of the movie. The transitions between the scenes were a little distracting, but as a whole I think Love Life is a winner, a ruby ​​in the dust. One for the whole family. A nice change to watch a British movie for a teenage audience that is not littered with four letters. Try it and see it.
