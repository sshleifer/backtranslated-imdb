After reading about this documentary, I rented it and saw it with my teenagers. It was surprisingly balanced, showing the perspective of each page, leaving many questions unanswered. That's the way it should be. I do not see a documentary that tells me what to think. I watch it to learn and to draw my own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, we made a detour to Waco and visited the Branch Davidians at the place of the fire. This was an important lesson to see for yourself. And it brought the basic honesty behind "Waco: The Rules of Engagement" home. If you just open your eyes and look, the facts can speak for themselves.
