This movie was the second movie I saw as a kid in the cinema. It scared the living crap out of me. So much so that I asked my dad if we could go half way through. <br /> <br /> Today, the only people who go halfway are those who have a good taste in movies. <br /> <br /> However, I still have fond memories of this flawed masterpiece of horror. Doug McClure and Peter Cushing in the same movie! Great! Monster made of polypropylene substitute. Creepy stuff. A rubber monster, if you think about it, is even scarier than a real monster. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this movie is how good the score is. Really stirring stuff. <br /> <br /> Prehistoric titmice can also be seen in the exhibition. Kind.
