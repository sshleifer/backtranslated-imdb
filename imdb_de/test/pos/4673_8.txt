I find it sad, just because Edward Norton did not want to be in the movie or have anything to do with it, people automatically think that the movie is shit without looking at it or giving it a shot. I really hope that Norton did not do that. He's a good actor and all, but he scared people off a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I found it entertaining. It was not gorgeous or with crazy special effects, but it was not bad. It was fun to watch. But yes, definitely not a bad / horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
