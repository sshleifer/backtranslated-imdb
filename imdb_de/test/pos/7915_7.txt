Eisenstein's first sound film tells the story of the Ice Battle of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the Livonian knights who were anxious to bring Russia under Catholicism. Nevsky was understood in 1938 as propaganda education: The Germanic knights with their eerie (and somewhat stupid) helmets are an obvious substitute for the Nazis. The Knights' Butchery, as they enter a Russian city, seems to be a prophetic warning of the WWII massacres. The film ends with a warning: Who came to Russia with the sword, will die by the sword. Made in delicate black and white (somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marks Eisenstein's return to official favor. In the late 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet filmmakers to stop experimenting and make films that are more populist and tasty for the Russian public. This has stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for a decade, and he returned to Newski with his more accessible film. Nevsky's strength lies in the second half of the battle itself, and it is rightly seen as a milestone in film history: Never before (and probably never) would a battle be so alive on the screen. Another important point is Prokofiev's beautiful, immersive soundtrack (the use of a composer to film a movie was totally unusual at the time). One of his weaker points: comic relief (in the form of two simple Russian warriors trying to woo a handsome Russian peasant) is really staggering.
