This movie immediately catches the eye, with the atmospheric aerial photos of a very pretty Hong Hong. Filmed in the rich colors of 1950 films that modern blockbusters never seem to grasp. Probably a sign of this time, because it is not a high-performance comrade, everything seen before the film, full of chaos and violence. The devastation and violence are in the background. Thousands of refugees are trying to get out of China. This is a very moving and compelling story, full of hope and love in a tragic period of recent history. The story of two people from different cultures who fall in love. And trying to overcome that is at the heart of this very beautiful and moving film.
