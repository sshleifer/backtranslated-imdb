I would like to hear from director Barbet Schroeder why he has decided to make More his first film, especially in terms of his interest in hippies - or rather this form of Euro Hippie Paradise - and their demise. The film is at least true enough to arouse interest, but in its own kind of truth it is strange and biased. It's a given heroin (aka "Horse") is terrible stuff, lazy, the conclusion for many stupid drug users who see this as the all-ending universe, because it's basically: after that, everything stops, it becomes life and it is either a constant run for more of the same or death. More begins as a romance between a New York girl and a German man, but it becomes something else, for better or for worse (sometimes both in the same scene). <br /> <br /> Basically it's about two young people, Estelle and Stefan, who are meeting in a city where Stefan has come from his home country as a kind of hiker, and she also wanders, somehow, and is Perhaps too friendly with a big pusher called Wolf, they land on a remote island somewhere nearby, and after they've picked up some daring "horse" from Estelle, they also find a block in the form of a seemingly more remote house on the beach Youth, sex and drugs are not too simplistic, which makes the film so many years later a clear and intelligent film, it is both direct and subtle, more about the characters and the fact that what he represents is in others The most pleasurable, and this is just a guess, Schroeder inspired the nature of the long sequence from Bergman's summer with Monika: two children in an unstoppable V connection, some good, some definitely not so good, against (also?) Perfectly shot landscapes. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I should mention that there are problems, some really big ones. The performances are not very convincing throughout; a few scenes are powerful or have the actors in a good relationship, but Klaus Grumberg trumps himself if he is by nature a German ornery (in which case I would have preferred Klaus Kinski in the role to make him crazy but deep enough for the topic) as well as farmers to their own degree. And there are gaps in the script's naivety that prevent it from being as deep as it really thinks. On the other hand, there are two big things: Nestor Almendros, the great cameraman (d. Days of Heaven), is DP and is for a first director like Schröder a big boost. Almost every picture is seen with an amazing purpose or skill, be it a picture of the cliffs by the sea or the sun, or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room. <br /> <br /> The other thing is Pink Floyd, probably the main reason why I and many others have ever heard of the movie (years before I really knew who Schröder was, I saw the soundtrack "More", if I was looking for Pink Floyd albums). It's a very good music, sometimes the overwhelming diversity that gives them the reputation they deserve. Some of them are also a bit boring, even if it is a movie about free love and a lot of drugs and sometimes both at the same time. I would not rate it as close to Meddle or Animals, and certainly not Dark Side, but it also helps to raise the subject to another level, especially when you least expect it or float it in soft tones or in buildings like Stefan or others walking on the streets. It's almost a better atmosphere than the movie itself deserves, but overall More is still worth a visit, but powerful, like a less ambitious but more massive Zabriskie Point.
