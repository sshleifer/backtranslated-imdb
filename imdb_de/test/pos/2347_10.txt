I'm a big Naruto fan, even though I have not seen every episode or read any manga. <br /> <br /> I really liked the first Naruto movie, and to be honest, I was a bit nervous that it would not be as good (or action-packed) as the first one (mainly because it was in Australia) had only one PG instead of one M, which is a PG-13 US or 12 UK). But I was wrong (luckily)! The animation was improved (though some of the characters' drawings were hectic in some places) and was especially good in the fight scenes. Speaking of it, let's talk about the fight scenes! The animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and very entertaining! I especially enjoyed the Genjutsu fight with Kankuro and the fight with Gaara who is fighting against the shape that is changing the female warriors! All the characters you want are here! Naruto, Sakura, Gaara, Kankuro and Shikamaru! If only Temari were in the film, Shikamaru could dramatically save her from female warriors! And maybe they could have a PASSIONATIC KISS! In my summary at the top I say that this qualification is more of a piece of cinema than just an extended episode. And it does! The action is very cinematic and the animation quality looks very fancy especially in combat! Overall, this is an excellent anime movie that is a must for any Naruto fan! 5.5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! Okay, I stop!
