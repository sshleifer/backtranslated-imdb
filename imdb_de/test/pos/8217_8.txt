The web is an excellent movie! It's about Angela Bennett (in a great performance by Sandra Bullock), a computer expert who works for the Cathedral Company, cleans up viruses, and tests games for customers. Angela is a typical nerd who has no friends outside of cyberspace, takes almost no vacations and goes out and stays connected almost all the time. One day, her friend Dale Hessman (Ray McKinnon) asks her to help him and sends Angela a floppy disk with a strange program containing a lot of confidential information. The same night Dale was killed, he was suddenly killed in a plane crash. On her way to Mexico, Angela meets a handsome man named Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) who has proven to be a cold blood killer bastard and one of the guys behind all the mystery of the floppy disk. <br /> <br /> Her life becomes a nightmare: all her notes are erased and she gets the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious problems with the police. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it shows how people make us dependent on computers and machines (sometimes more than we should) and how vulnerable we are when someday somebody chooses to control and change your personal information without giving us the opportunity to prove the mistake.
