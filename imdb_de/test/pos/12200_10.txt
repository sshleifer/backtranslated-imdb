Surface was one of the few truly unique shows on TV last season. I can honestly say that I changed my schedule so that I could see every episode at home. Lots of action, excitement, science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> The story is about a boy who found an egg hatched in a marine animal. The same marine creature that had killed the main character's brother and the female figure (oceanographer) had seen. Most people think that it is a deadly killing machine, but the machine pulled out of the egg was very friendly. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that NBC canceled it. Now we never know what will happen ... or another channel will pick it up.
