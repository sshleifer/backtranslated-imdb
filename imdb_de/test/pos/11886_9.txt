If you're looking for a kung fu action movie, look elsewhere. While there are fighting scenes, the film revolves around the protagonist of the province, which seeks to seek in the Americanized canton. Unlike most kung fu comedies, the action scenes are used to enhance the comedy, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> Cheung Booi is a statement about the absurd nature of kung fu movies The stars always seem to find a reason to fight. Instead of some big drama about honor and respect, minor misunderstandings cause the characters to yell at each other and start beating each other. My young aunt, as she is known in the West, is the story of Cheng Tai-nunne, played by Kara Hui, a young woman who marries an elderly landowner to prevent his possessions from falling into the hands of his greedy and corrupt brother falls. After he dies, she moves to Canton to live with her nephew, played by director Lau Kar Leung, and his son Ah Tao, played by Hsiao Ho. At the same age as Ah Tao, her attitude is more akin to her status as a step-aunt. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely bad), plays guitar and goes to costume parties, Cheng completely fails as she tries to adapt to her lifestyle in Canton, complete with make-up, dresses, high heels and dance scenes. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so good is its realization. Lau Kar Leung may be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, director of his generation in Hong Kong, and Kara Hui was awarded Best Actress at the 1982 Hong Kong Film Awards. This is also Hsiao Ho's best performance. His chemistry with Hui is remarkable, and although he completed a career in kung-fu comedies, often playing with Sammo Hung, he has the perfect combination of athleticism and comedy. As the romantic tensions and intrigues increase in the second half of the movie, his entire face changes. He does not walk so easily through a life without worry in the world. He becomes a hetero and his cohorts Kramer, Elaine and George. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that the comedic aspects of the movie suddenly die off during graduation. The film changes from a pure farce to a dramatic intrigue with little, but a change of random music. But there is a certain symmetry. The film focuses on the intrigue, focuses more on Lau Kar Leung's character and ends so. The final scene, however, returns to the comic roots of the film and completes both aspects of the film.
