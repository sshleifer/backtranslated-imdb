A completely different Jerry Lewis movie, not like all the more famous movies everyone knows. Lewis treats the difficult task of the Second World War and National Socialism in Germany rather unconventionally. But more interesting and important, he does it in a very un-American way. And as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry, un-American means more sophisticated, subtler, smarter or just better. For this reason, the film was not a success in the US, but a great success in Europe. All in all, Jerry Lewis has proved with this movie that he can do far more simple slapstick comedy.
