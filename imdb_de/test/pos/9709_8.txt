This film surpasses the previous incarnation by a mile and brings everything to the next level. As always, the JackAss guys are just amazing, and I personally have laughed harder in this theater than in a long time. As with the first JackAss, this is not so much a movie as an eighty-minute series of stunts and stings. It is pure circus entertainment at the highest level. Essentially, these guys are clowns who belittle for the amusement of others. And it's great. The shenanigans are so low, outrageous and often disgusting that they go into a higher form of conversation. <br /> <br /> You can not rate this in other films, it's in a class of its own. And it shines. Go and enjoy it for the sheer acting that it is.
