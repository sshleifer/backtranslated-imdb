Free from one scene to another, from one story to another, like walking, from a shady path to an open place, like the wind in the leaves, from one tree to another, how many different sounds? Just like when traveling, people meet, tell their stories and then divorce forever, who knows? And just like walking through these places full of lost expectations from another time, the human "fat" takes the breath away. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with friends of mine, not all of them liked it, maybe they were also used to scenarios and ready-made stories, I do not know. So this movie is for the fools who love to see the sun sparkle on the sea, walk in the hills or through the small villages in a hurry and listen to the growing grass that tells the stories of them underneath , in the warm summer wind.
