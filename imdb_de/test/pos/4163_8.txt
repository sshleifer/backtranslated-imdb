I never thought I would say that about a biopic, but the characterization (especially regarding Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) is almost over-abundant and too little in relation to the literal occurrences in his life when he dies (should he), or if his sister eventually dies (should), or if the director has spent too much time on the Galactic Railroad (which is an inside joke, if you have failed to do so) Miyazawa wrote a children's book titled "Night on the Galactic Railway. "However, this insight into the mind of a writer who" sketched out poems and fairy tales from his imagination "is very intelligent, creative, entertaining and emotionally powerful. <br /> <br /> All of this, although all are animated as an animal (as in many stories from Miyazawa). <br /> <br /> Some of the visuals are really amazing, especially as it is a TV movie, seriously, some of them (like the sequence with birds running after blue light) compete with Fantasia. I still can not stand computer animation when mixed with cel animations. The CGI trains are terribly obvious - even more so than the Anastasia train. <br /> <br /> 8/10
