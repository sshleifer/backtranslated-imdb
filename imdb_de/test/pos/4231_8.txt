The first Child's Play was an original and effective little horror movie. As expected, the two terrible sequels seemed to mean the end for this franchise. Well, when I heard that they were making a fourth "bride of chucky", I just rolled my eyes and murmured a "... when will they ever learn." <br /> <br /> But when I heard that they had gotten a great director, Ronny Yu, and a solid cast including the awe-inspiring Jennifer Tilly, my interest grew. <br /> <br /> this movie is extremely well done. It has a great sense of humor, highly stylized graphic violence, great cinematography and the stunningly sexy Jennifer Tilly, who struts her most impressive stuff in the first half. (I should add that she is also a fantastic actress.) <br /> <br /> it holds the tongue tight in the cheek without getting into camping territory. The doll effects are great and the verbal interaction between them is priceless. It's more of a horror / comedy than a sheer horror, but the humor is welcome and well integrated. <br /> <br /> I've already heard that they're planning a son from Chucky. If they can match the quality of this movie, this franchise may have made a legitimate comeback. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.5
