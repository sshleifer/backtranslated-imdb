What a crazy movie! It takes 12 (!) Hours and you do not understand who these people are and what they do! The main idea is about a lot of unsuspecting actors trying to stage the scene "Prometheus", but there is a lot of negotiation, like the disappearance of Thomas and a crazy guy looking for Monsieur Warok ... what does that mean? everything ???
