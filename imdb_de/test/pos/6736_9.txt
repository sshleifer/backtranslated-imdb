Blythe Danner and Judith Ivey deliver wonderful performances here, as Jonathan Silverman, as Eugene from 1937 reported in Brighton Beach, tells his life. <br /> <br /> What makes the movie so good is the relationship between the characters in front of a wonderful background family values. <br /> <br /> Bob Dishy had a wonderful opportunity here as the father of the clan. He gives a restrained but convincing performance as a patriarch of the family. <br /> <br /> His sons by Jonathan Silverman and Brian Dillinger are fabulous. There are certain scenes in which Silverman skates or jumps and I remember Jerry Lewis. <br /> <br /> As for Danner and Ivey, they too are wonderful. Their behaviors, intonation and idealism of Jewish culture are very well implemented by them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is just wonderful. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! Although the inevitability of the war was imminent, the film is rich in many of the typical problems facing families during this time. In a way, you do not have to be Jewish to know what the family is going through. <br /> <br /> A must for nostalgic fans and those of us who believe so much in family values.
