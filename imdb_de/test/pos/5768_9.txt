I saw it when it first came out, and found it a work of a genius. But I have to confess that I was clearly in the minority at that time. <br /> <br /> For me, the progressive madness of the owners of Guest House Paradiso is getting better throughout the movie, with one of the funniest highlights of any movie ever. <br /> <br /> But I would not recommend it to the mother. <br /> <br /> Comic comic-style comedians will appreciate this movie. There are subtle jokes that are hidden, but usually they are flattened quickly by a comedy pan. Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson are outstanding, and even the unsuspecting guests are excellent.
