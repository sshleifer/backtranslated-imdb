Despite all the delusions about the episode THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES, THE BALANCE OF TERROR may be the best episode in the series. And although I've always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it's so much fun, I really have to cast my vote for this Romulan episode as the best. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting enough, it really is like a World War II submarine movie hopping back and forth between the camouflaged Romulan ship and the Enterprise, trying to destroy the Romulans before They sneak through the neutral zone after raiding the Federation outposts. In many ways, the show resembles the film THE ENEMY BELOW - where, in contrast, the American Captain (Robert Mitchum) and the German Captain (Curt Jurgens) are both shown trying to outsmart the other - and they develop a reluctant respect for your enemy. Interestingly, only a small part of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet - and that's amazing, because an episode aboard the ship this could easily have been static and dull. But because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters wrote and acted so well (Shatner and Mark Leonard as the Romulan leader). Strangely enough, the hard-nosed trekkers out there will recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spock's father. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is a great and extremely captivating episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
