This parody is made wisely: from the songs (Express Yourself becomes Expose Yourself, Like A Prayer is now Party in my Pants and Vogue is now Vague) to the fake interviews of the series' characters, this movie is hilarious. Do you remember Madonna, who said she did not know about the rainy season in Asia? In this case, she knows nothing about the volcanic time. It is a precious gem. They got a lot of money for this parody, and it pays off. Highly recommended!!!
