Burt Reynolds has staged this action movie and (surprise!) Is actually a pretty good director. This movie starts well when Burt tries to raid a drug dealer and he is demoted to a vice squad. The cast of the ensemble has some pretty funny scenes as Brian Kieth always eats something, Bernie Casey has more class than all of his colleagues together and Charles Durning loses control of his squad. <br /> <br /> The deputy police stumble upon a costly call-girl ring that may have involved a series of murders. Sharkey spends days staking out Dominoes (Rachel Ward) apartment and begins to love her remotely. <br /> <br /> Just as they approach the criminal leader, Dominoe is murdered. I will not reveal any surprises, but the first hour of the movie is great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the script will become very clich√© and unbelievable. <br /> <br Why would Burt Reynolds confront the criminal boss with his big secret? Sure, the guy is sweating, but many more police are killed. And it's unbelievable that Dominoe and Sharkey would love each other after knowing each other for a day, let alone while their lives are in danger. And what happened in the end with all the policemen who ran into the building with our heroes? Is not there a SWAT team? Besides, the movie never says how all the bad guys are connected and why they have to kill so many people. Film, which is probably the only really snappy scene in the movie. It's a shame that the highlight is a typical shoot-em-up. Still, this movie is certainly entertaining if you like crime and action films. Do not think about the action holes and you will have a good time.
