The three main characters are all hopeless, and yet only one person is sorry: Ernesto, who is hopelessly dedicated to Mercedes. This was part of the disappointment: shouting at Mercedes to get a clue and give up the non-good Harry, to no avail. <br /> <br /> Then there is the satisfaction: Steve Buscemi has a big role as a transvestite and The moving story of Harvey Keitel that he plays a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is unbelievable. If you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino does a half-monologue and Anthony Quinn turns Ernesto into a wealthy man. <br /> <br /> There are always great moments in the story, but in the end it's hard to know what you should feel about this movie. It does not have a happy ending or a complete ending, but it somehow feels right. <br /> <br /> This film is strange, but then me too; No wonder I liked it.
