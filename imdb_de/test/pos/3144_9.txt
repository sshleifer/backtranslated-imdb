I saw this movie the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This was one step ahead of the others in terms of the quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of the story. It comes along with a professionalism that is often missing in short films. <br /> <br /> This is a great short film for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Amazing achievements. The two actresses are immediately convincing and credible. Your chemistry is palpable. The depth of their relationship is conveyed, even if the movie is 10 minutes long. The acting and the direction are very powerful. <br /> <br /> 2. Nice shot. The lighting, framing and general shooting are striking. The 35mm film distinguishes this film from other short films. And what difference does it make? The shooting deserve this film stand. <br /> <br /> 3. Strong story. Often, short films try to do too little or too much with time. Or they try to tell a predictable story. This is a good balance to tell you an interesting story without taking it too long or leaving you unsatisfied. You wonder what will happen next, while at the same time feeling that something has happened. <br /> <br /> Also a nice score. Compliments without overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If you find this at a festival, try to see it.
