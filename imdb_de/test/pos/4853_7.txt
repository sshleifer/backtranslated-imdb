Dramatic drama based on a novel by Arthur Miller. Something as simple as glasses changes your life. Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) is a man who has decided to be satisfied with his worldly life; the same profession for twenty years and still lives with his mother. He is asked by his boss to correct his vision with glasses. Newman's life changes drastically and puts him to hell. The glasses he has chosen make him look Jewish. He loses his job and is severely investigated by his Brooklyn neighborhood. In search of a job, he meets the attractive and outspoken Gertrude (Laura Dern), who lives in conflicts because of her Jewish appearance. Soon, the couple's new life together becomes a nightmare full of humiliation and attacks fueled by bigotry. A very excellent cast that has the following characteristics: Joseph Ziegler, Peter Oldring, Kay Hawtrey and the musical fame Meat Loaf.
