Idiocracy felt like Mike Judge took my thoughts about the company and brought them into the movie. In fact, the movie is a social commentary. Sometimes it feels almost like a documentary. Luke Wilson has done a good job of playing a boring average Joe (as in most of his films). Of course, idiocracy was an extreme of the present state of society. But that makes most comedies funny, one extreme in every situation. Fiction is not much different from reality. <br /> <br /> With children who praise the materialistic hip-hop culture and are proud to be ignorant. When people feel useless in life, they brood. Give you a meaning in the world. And it seems that only the worst people breed the most. I can understand that others do not like it. It does not help, most of the jokes were second-class bathroom humor. Not much different than a movie by Kevin Smith. <br /> <br /> Idiocracy throws away logic, reason and any intelligence (for a good reason). <br /> <br /> Mike Judges comeback was a knockout.
