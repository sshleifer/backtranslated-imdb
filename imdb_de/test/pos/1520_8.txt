Closet Land is not a happy movie. It is also not associated with social realism. That may be his strength. The removal of certain times and nations strengthens the message, makes it more powerful, and tears away the burden of nationalism and propaganda that you often feel in films to criticize nations that are against your own (of course, I'm talking first and foremost from American propaganda to any commercial film). <br /> <br /> A bit of wardrobe is so much more than a message. It's a film of sheer, surrealist beauty, filled with the same clean, clinical shape you find in work as 1984, and it's a match. <br /> <br /> I'm an old fan of Alan Rickman, the man with the golden sarcasm (and, I would add, the unparalleled sex appeal ;-)). The game between him and Madeleine Stowe is brilliant. Every time I see him, he seems to play an even worse figure than the last ... <br /> <br /> But enough sweet. The movie is missing in action. I do not want smashed cars, but I want something to happen, just talk. After an hour, I was really tired of the interrogation room, the predictable actions, and above all, I wanted a more complex view of everything, the world, the characters' past lives, and the rest of the missing frame. For some people a nice touch. For me something less positive. <br /> <br /> However, Closet Land is worth a movie if you're ready to take a trip into the abyss of human nature. <br /> <br /> And of course for us, who really loves the Always Evil Alan Rickman.
