The detective story is not typical of the Matrix universe. It's a movie noir-style private eye story with a strong narrator and a very rich feel. Rich in terms of visual appeal. The snow scenes, the graininess, everything stuns the eye. <br /> <br /> But what about the story? It's interesting, even if it feels a bit out of place. The agents hire a private detective to track down Trinity. He finds out that they have tried the approach earlier, but with dangerous consequences for the employed detectives. Nevertheless, he tries to find her, and he finally succeeds by referring to Alice in Wonderland, hackers and chat rooms. Then things get interesting ... <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a perfectly satisfying short animated movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
