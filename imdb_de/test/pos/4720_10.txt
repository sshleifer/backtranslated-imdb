Beyond Rangoon is one of the most emotional and intense films ever made. Directed by John Boorman and intensely by Patricia Arquette, this film is undoubtedly one of the best films of the 90s. The story and the lively characters grab the audience from the beginning and will not let go. After the movie, the viewer can never forget "Beyond Rangoon". The film has earned little money at the box office and is little known, but should be top-class. When you see it, you can say that it should be seen by a large audience. It is a very important and moving movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br />
