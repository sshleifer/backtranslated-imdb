At the age of 30 to 51, when he died of a brain tumor, Zachary Scott made 70 films. He was introduced in 1944 in Jean Negulesco's "Mask of Dimitrios", where he played Dimitrios. The next year, in 1945, he made three films, of which there is one. Cineastes reminds him best of the star of Jean Renoir's "The Southerner", one of the films of 1945, in which he played a sympathetic role. However, he often played scary characters, and in this movie he is a sociopathic murderer against money. So what happens here? He lives in a house with three women, so beware! Faye Emerson, who also appeared in "Dimitrios", plays the older of two daughters in the house. She falls in love with Scott and they are secretly involved. Then her younger sister 'sweet kid' (effectively played by Mona Freeman, who resembles Bonita Granville in looks and behavior) comes back from boarding school, casually revealing in conversation with Scott that she inherited a decent sum instead with all the stormy jealousy that is bubbling in the household, which had to lead to it. Things get tense and then tense. Meanwhile, plans of murder in the computational Scott think. However, it turns out that he is not the only one who has such intentions. He is also sought after as the result of his last killer opening the movie so we know his background story. James Wong Howe gives this story an effective, noiric cinematography, directed by Frenchman Robert Florey, who moved to Hollywood some time ago. The movie is an effective mystery of psychopaths in the home, which can cause a little wear and tear on the edges of some seats.
