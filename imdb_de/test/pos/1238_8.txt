(WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) A movie almost meant to take a break and test your memory of it - it's confined to a nearly empty motel where the large courtyard looks like a circus ring and spaces rather than temporary retreats act as a retreat. The more the characters deal with the past, the more the present falls away, until the countess's final appearance in the black Mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy. Whether her stories are true or not, and whether Stanton really is the father or just a crazy old man who enters their stories, seems impossible to pin down. The theme seems to be how the love of an extreme and unconsidered nature is blended with stability to the point where reality itself collapses. where exotic, misguided fantasies become dangerously tangible. The image of the burning motel - a symbol of destruction through destruction - is a fittingly weird ending to this strange, yet powerful, amazingly imaginative film.
