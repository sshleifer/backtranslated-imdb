The used submarine was NOT Varangier! In fact, these were two boats, P614 and P615, both built by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness for Turkey, but held by the Royal Navy throughout the war. P615 was sunk, but P614 was finally delivered in 1945. <br /> <br /> The confusion was undoubtedly because someone (like me) looked up P61 and found Varangian! In fact, when the last digit of P614 and P615 was actually just painted ... <br /> <br /> There are some extremely realistic moments in the movie. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-Class. Since no submarines of the S-class survive, the photos of them (as P61) and the depot ship "Forth" are now part of an interesting album and a great movie.
