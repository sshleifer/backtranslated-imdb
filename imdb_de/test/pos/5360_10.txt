As a "Wallace and Gromit fan" I was looking forward to this full-length movie. Surprisingly, I saw it at the world premiere in Vlissingen (NL), at the Festival Film by the Sea. A wonderful feeling of being one of the first to see this very amusing and happy movie. The point is that Wallace and Gromit (who I believe do not need an introduction) have their own pest control company in town, which is organizing a Giant Vegetable Competition in a matter of days. Everyone, including an eccentric baroness, hopes his giant carrot or melon will win the golden carrot. Unfortunately, the city is plagued by many hungry rabbits. This is where W & G comes into play. They have their own cracking devices to control these cute creatures in a human way. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and colorful story. Anyone who likes W & G's three ongoing short films (which are more than great!) Will love this full-length movie. Nick Park has really delivered a wonderful and original result with a great sense of humor. As in Chicken Run, I'm really surprised how he can capture so many stories and emotions in just a few pictures. "Job well done, boy" ;-) Oh yes: the music was fantastic! This really completes the ride. Enjoy!
