E. Elias Merhiges Begorene is a unique surreal representation of mankind's religious treatment. There are different ways to interpret things, but the plot itself is simple: A god tears himself apart and Mother Earth springs from his corpse. Mother Earth then condemns the body of the god after death and then impregnates herself with the rest of his seed. She then gives birth to a Messiah figure, who is probably shivering in infancy, but possibly with the horror of being brought to life on Earth. All this takes place in the first 15 to 30 minutes, and then the rest of the movie is made up of clothed figures dragging the Messiah (who is constantly trembling or conquered) across a desert landscape. The clothed figures only pause to brutalize the Messiah and then drag him further. <br /> <br /> There are several ways to interpret this, depending on your optimism and your worldview. It can easily be interpreted as a sinister nihilistic atheistic allegory about the total lack of apparent power that Christian "deities" can be perceived in a modern society, calling only their names to advance their selfish ends. Or you can interpret it as a postmodern pro-Christian allegory in which you view the film as a question of how humanity has so distorted Christ's message that its original purity and innocence in a world where this message and this Being inaccessible, supporting everything, from interpersonal violence, to war, to totalitarianism. <br /> <br /> The visuals of this movie are phenomenal and you will not see anything like that, period. If you can, look at the original VHS version. I recommend you. I'm not sure if the visuals on the DVD will be changed, but I've seen clips of that streaming on your tube and the effects are greatly reduced. In the VHS version, Merhige achieved TOTAL BINARY CONTRAST. That is, there are basically no midtones, with the exception of some grains in some shots. Besides, this movie offers a rare opportunity to see PURE White and PURE Black, and the result is stunning, hallucinatory and quite disturbing. This movie makes Film Noir positively washed out and mediocre. The recordings have merged in a surreal way, reminiscent of Un Chien Andalou, without completely simulating it. This has resulted in the effect of a cinematic Rorschach test. <br /> <br /> When the movie is said, the movie may well be an attempt on audience patience and commitment. There is no dialogue for the beginning. The only sound in the entire movie is a fairly constant loop of crickets that are peppered, occasionally peppered with the dying deities' gurgling and death rattle, and an amelodic booming synthesizer texture. Personally, I find that the film best hears experimental industrial music such as the instrumental NIN remixes from the Downward Spiral era, more abstract sounds / experimental music like F * ck Buttons and Odd Nosdam. It also works very well with apocalyptic Black Metal. Basically any music with extreme textures and / or hypnotic rhythms. This is one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this movie. It is PRIME for postmodern re-contextualizations, e.g. For example, projecting during a performance of avant-garde music or composing avant-garde music that accompanies it. <br /> <br As soon as the Messiah figure is born, the rest of the movie does not change much, which means that you will be forced through the desert and beaten for at least 45 minutes or more of the Messiah figure. It looks grim, but it's nothing new. It helps to clarify filmmakers' intentions that for thousands of years people have been using the name and image of Christ for personal purposes, but can be tiring for a casual onlooker or someone with a short attention span. If you are looking for a modern horror movie with excitement, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a unique movie experience and do not like mainstream Hollywood cinema, this could be your trembling Messiah.
