Cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes out on the streets to find the real culprit. The familiar Hitchcock theme of a man who is falsely accused of having a crime is well played out in this entertaining fare with the elements "The Thirty Nine Steps" and "North by Northwest", although he is not as good as the classics. There are impressive set pieces, including the finale of the Statue of Liberty. The plot is not plausible and unconvincing, and after a brilliant start, the power seems to go out. Cummings is nice, if a bit stiff at the top. Lane is the blonde, but not the cool variety of the director's later films. The supporting roles are generally played well.
