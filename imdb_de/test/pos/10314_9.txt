It may interest people to know that this film was made without recourse to Phoolan Devi himself, and when she finally saw parts of it, she was so angry that she announced that the film would not be screened or covered in India would be put in gasoline and set on fire. I do not know if it was shown or not, but I doubt it in view of her position as a rising politician. Since then, I have seen a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her Dacoit days and hidden as a result. <br /> <br /> Aside from their own concerns, this is an excellent movie, all the more so because of its refreshingly brutal approach; No pink melodrama that you would expect from a typical Indian movie. It should be emphasized that concerns about how feminist the message of the film really is, and something completely irrelevant: it is a true story. Their fears seem not to relate to what is portrayed, but to the way the film portrays them.
