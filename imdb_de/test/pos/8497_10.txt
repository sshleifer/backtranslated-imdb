First of all, it is pure joy to hear how the legend plays such wonderful and timeless music. This movie and soundtrack is a tour de force. Ray Charles is unique and amazing. I really loved the movie because it was thoroughly inspirational and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx has become one of the first actors in Hollywood, as Ray clearly shows, and he should get an Oscar for this role, he is unparalleled. In fact, anyone who has worked on this film should receive awards. I really liked Kerry Washington, who played the extraordinary woman ... Ray Charles obviously got married well. Regina King is an outstanding actress as well as the extraordinary Sharon Warren, who plays a young mother. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I would say that this whole project has been provisionally arranged. The entire cast was perfect, a great script and great settings. Key props to director Taylor Hackford and the crew who have done such excellent work to bring the life of Ray Charles to the screen so flawlessly. This is my picture of the year, certainly one of the best films ever made.
