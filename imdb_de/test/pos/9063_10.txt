Many films try the ambitious. Only a few succeed. This movie is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although he is billed as a black comedy, this term seems too restrictive to express the true nature of the story behind Max and Grace. Multi-hyphenate Michael Parness has managed to weave elements of the most absurd comedy with incredibly real human emotions. A remarkable achievement, to be sure. <br /> <br /> Although the comedic aspects are certainly there, the heart of the film is in its main roles: David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. The delicate balance of the movie - really crazy for real love - falls to them and they reach them by carrying them from the opening scene to the heartbreaking climax and the heartwarming end. David Krumholtz anchors the picture in the title role and as a narrator and does an extraordinary job. We see the world through Max's eyes and Krumholtz fills her with a kind of amazement and hope that one would not believe that they would come credibly from a character who had previously attempted suicide. From this point, there can be no doubt that he has truly attained the status of a leading man earned after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles. Natasha Lyonne could be a revelation to anyone who has only seen her in less challenging roles. The role of Grace is very extensive, requiring her to show both great anger and great tenderness - sometimes within seconds. She manages to convince us of Grace's deep despair, which is directly under her alternating force and mania. <br /> <br /> This is not a laugh, a tiny kind of comedy quit. Think more drama than comedy. There are some very dark moments, as one might expect in the face of the suicide motive, and some strange real moments, which were mainly provided by Emma Adele Galvin as Maxi's sister Sis. The most humorous scenes are those populated by countless name-actors in supporting roles. While Lorraine Bracco and David Paymer give their scenes the surreal aspect, the other supportive characters that populate the institution where Max and Grace meet are the real pleasure. Guillermo Diaz is a wanton scene killer, as Hector, the gloriously frenetic spinner. Ralf Moeller acts as Bruno as his pure man, but has his own charm and his attraction. Rosanna Arquette fully occupies the role of Vera with the stark vitriol of a bitter truckstop waitress. Even her hard-hearted figure eventually melts, as do all those who are touched by Max's literally immortal love for Grace. <br /> <br /> If love can conquer everything, the question could be behind the film and even if the realist says no in the movies, it's about escaping from reality, if only for a few hours. I recommend watching this movie not just as an antidote to reality, but also against the cynicism that says a love story like this never happens. Spend a few hours in a world where it will do wonders for the psyche. <br /> <br /> (Seattle International Film Festival - June 2005)
