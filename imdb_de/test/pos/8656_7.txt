Comrades 'Den brysomme mannen' http://ow.ly/PTTp (not my wife, so I saw it in pieces for a couple of days). <br /> <br /> Reviewers are mostly confused - most of them agree agree that it is allegorical but not of what; "Heaven", "hell", "socialism", "capitalism"? <br /> <br /> That most people do not want to escape, and it's essentially forbidden to use most of these options. <br /> <br /> So, you probably should project your favorites prejudice / prejudice / fear. <br /> <br /> So I would say it's about an Epicurean life. A vivid color, literally and figuratively saturated in the interpretation.
