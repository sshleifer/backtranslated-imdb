I heard about Begotten for the first time when one of my friends picked it up in a "cult classic" section of my local video retailer. She knew that I liked obscure artistic films, so I hired her and brought her home. He sat on my TV for a few days and then put it in the video recorder just before going to bed. I thought, maybe I'll see how it is, then spend more time the next day. What followed was that it actually woke me up. I ate through the movie and loved it. After I went through the credits, I looked at it again. Only when you see the credits, you get an idea of ​​who is who. After you know that you can see it again with new appreciation. Do not listen to the people who tear this movie. It is not for everyone. If you do not like to read subtitles that are not suitable for this movie (not that there are subtitles, there is no dialogue at all). If you're someone who owns Rush Hour 2, then this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> This movie is really original and inspiring. It does what other films have never done. It looks like nothing else and is bolder than anything outside - from 1989 to today. It can be said that all who are involved in the making of this film really love the art of doing what they do and understand what can be captured in kinoform. Film is not for you. But it is pure escapism in an extreme way and in film form. It's like someone putting cables to my head and picking up one of my worst nightmares. But this nightmare makes sense if you really see the pictures, analyze the action of the actor, and do not passively noodle your guitar, but just watch and wink but is begotten so much more. I'm not kidding when I say it's my favorite movie. It's an important movie, visually stimulating, mechanically inspiring and hypnotic. One of the criticisms that I have read about it is very true: "No one will get through begging without being marked."
