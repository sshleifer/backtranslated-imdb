I have seen most Tarzan episodes. Surely the rated X with O'Keeffe & Bo Derek, that's absolutely unfortunate. <br /> <br /> I have seen this version several times since it was originally shown. <br /> <br /> All cast had memorable parts, great acting with the monkey sequences. <br /> <br /> Last night I have seen the same on Spanish channel and unlike in some French dialogues all in Spanish. <br /> <br /> As far as Hudson Andies does not want voice he did not do anything until the end. He looked at the newspapers and could have hired a dialogue coach. <br /> <br /> It seems stupid that a story about monkeys and a man who was picked up by them all that they attacked by Hudson Andie She was an American cousin. The last time I was looking for Carolina was in the US. <br /> <br /> She was beautiful in the movie and with her eyes and gorgeous hair, alabaster skin has us all confused. She did not have to resort to Bos level. <br /> <br /> She has been a LADY throughout the rest of her career and should be watching this movie (before half her life) as a starting point. Her sincerity made this movie enjoyable and believed that a half-wild man could discover her inner beauty. <br /> <br /> Great broadcast for Sir Richardson, he stole the movie.
