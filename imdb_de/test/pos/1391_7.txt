In this weird little adventure movie, it's hard to believe that he was led by the same man who brought us such high quality giallo classics as The Strange Vice by Mrs Wardh and The Case of the Scorpion's Tail, but you have to say that despite it a low production quality. Island of the Fish Men is a fun ride that certainly deserves more praise than it gets. As in many Italian films from the seventies, this is one of the smears of a successful American movie. The film in question is this time the critically locked island of dr. Moreau. Sergio Martino's film picks up on ideas such as mutation, greed and adventure, forming a captivating film that balances what he lacks in coherence and logic with a set of mostly fascinating ideas. The central property follows a boat that crashes on a small island. It quickly becomes clear that not everything is normal in this place, and it soon turns out that half of the population has been turned into "fishmen" - a cross between a man and a fish that exist for purely selfish reasons. The truth about this movie is that it's a lot more fun to ignore the trashy production values. The central monsters look completely ridiculous, and most of the movie plays on sets that look like they're costing a few pennies - but the movie is still well-filmed. The underwater photography is a special highlight and the speed of the film is well done, as the movie never gets boring. The way the plot comes together is not exactly awesome, but it contains many ideas and I've seen movies that have been done on actions and contain far fewer thoughts than these. The biggest standout location of the film is definitely the lost city of Atlantis. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of adventure films and therefore I do not see that this lost city is often mentioned - but it's always nice to see them in a movie. The central location on the island is good in that it provides a fitting setting for the story and also gives the film the right amount of puzzles, since Martino uses the voodoo theme well. All in all, this is not a classic and there are certainly much worse trashy adventure films than these.
