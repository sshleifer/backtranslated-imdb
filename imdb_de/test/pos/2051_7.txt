Let me start by saying that I enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight as a whole. I would give it 7/10. The Good: 1. Acting: Samuel L. Jackson is entertaining in almost every role. In this movie, he does not play his usual character, the guy in control, instead Geena Davis is in control and Sam is there. His timing is great and he is the highlight of the movie. Geena Davis also gives an excellent performance as Samantha Caine / Charlie Baltimore. She's a credible action hero and I do not think too many other actresses could go through Geena Does. 2. The action: This is a very action-packed movie. Things always crash or explode or someone chases someone else. The special effects are pretty good, especially when they are almost 8 years old. I can see some green screen stuff, but it does not affect acting too much. <br /> <br /> The Bad: 1. Why did half of the movie need to set up the plot? This movie had to be edited in the script phase so it did not run that long. Maybe a drama or something like that takes so long, but people really have to be in the movie all the time to keep it up. I think if you can hold the first half, you'll like the second half. 2. Geena Davis is cold weather and a tank top, but she never seems to be cold. 3. Some things are unrealistic. Sam Jackson flies through a huge shield after being thrown out of a room. He lands in a tree and just gets up. If you see this part, you'll think it's a joke. Total fun movie 7/10
