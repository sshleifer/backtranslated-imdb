How many have I seen The Water Babies in the late 1970s / early 80s as a kid / teen? It's stayed with me ever since, with catchy tunes, memorable renderings, less successful animations, and a story full of heart, coldness, and finally good destruction of evil. Recently, I sat down and saw it again after at least two decades, and I noticed THIS time around its striking resemblance to the Wizard of Oz. No, these are not obvious pictures, but listen to me. In this we have a boy and his dog - who have personal problems at home, running away from something and in the scene right after they ran away, and changing the substance of their appearance. In this the boy and the dog are animated. Dorothy and Toto are colorful in The Wizard of Oz. In this case, the boy and the dog are told to look for the water babies for answers, and finally the crackers for guidance, and he has the opportunity to let Tom go home if he shows courage. Oz, Dorothy She must also find a key figure to test her before she can go home. In the water babies, Tom meets three characters who will help him on his journey to the water babies - Dorothy also has three helpers. When each helper is hit, we are entertained with a rendering of "Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi, HI Cockallorum ... we're on the way". The wizard states, "We'll look at the wizard." Dorothy has a good look at her. Tom has a woman with many roles (Billie Whitelaw) who does the same thing. If you look closely at them, there are many other similarities. Having said that, The Water Babies is in no way a dropoff, I just commented on the weird likes between the two. This movie has some solid performances from the bad guys Bernard Cribbins and the ever fascinating James Mason. The kids playing Tom and Ella are good. The side cast of Joan Greenwood (love her voice!), David Tomlinson and the vocal talents of John Pertwee and Lance Percival contribute significantly to the mix. I must confess that the animation itself is less than Sterling for its time, but sufficient for the challenge. The three animated characters that help Tom come home are all sympathetic. I always have problems, my favorite between French swordfish and John Inman / Mr. Humphries like seahorses. The scene in which we hear this guttural, crazy laugh from a shipwrecked ship, just to see a seahorse with a huge dotted fly, always gets me rolling! The water babies are a lot of fun. Sure, it's more of a children's movie, but it has and always will have a good place in my heart. Most of the credit for the success of the film must send director Lionel Jeffries. Jeffries is a wonderful comedic actor, and his sense of humor is evident in all areas.
