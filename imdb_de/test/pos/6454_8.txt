I saw this movie last night at a "Pre-Code" movie festival, and I have to tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head for its introductory close-up, the entire audience gasped. He was just so beautiful. <br/> <br /> Cooper looks away. This film shows the artistic perfection of Rouben Mamoulian's direction. Wonderful scenes fade, creative camera angles, symbolic allusions - Mamoulian constantly explores the medium of directing and develops innovations. <br /> <br /> This was Sylvia Sidney's first role in Hollywood after her success on the New York stage, and she's just as beautiful as a leading wife of Gary Cooper should be. It's nice to see her in a role harder than many she's got - so often does she look as if she's scared of being hit by someone. <br /> <br /> There are many famous faces movie, including the wonderful Wynne Gibson. Most notable is Guy Kibbee, best known for oily, rich men, as a grinning and mendacious hitman. <br /> <br /> There are not nearly enough of these pre-code movies that are available on VHS or DVD If you can not find a pre-code festival in your area, try Turner Classic Movies for a broadcast to advertise! The critic, who thinks Gary Cooper is too stupid to make dialogues more complex than "Yep" or "Nope", should have seen Coop's performance in films like "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or "Meet John Doe". look at. Although Heaven knows that anyone who looked so good should not be wise too.
