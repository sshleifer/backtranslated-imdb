It's hard to put into words the devastating beauty of traffic, partly because I still understand it myself a few hours after my second consideration. First of all, it must be said that Traffik contains some of the most incomparable and memorable scenes I have seen in a movie or TV production. Acting is excellent, notably that of Bill Paterson as British minister dealing with his heroin addict daughter, and a relief deal for Pakistan dealing with drug problems. Another conspiracy line describes these ground-level drug problems in Pakistan, centering around a battling poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. The third main action concerns the persecution of a Hamburg drug importer and the contradictory efforts of his wife and two German detectives during the trial. It is a fundamental achievement that the interaction between these stories feels natural and transcends the compulsive entanglement often found in Hollywood movies. It is an even greater achievement that a work that spans three countries can be so focused and captivating for half a dozen main characters, without too much simplification. It is devastating - dark and brutal, but never apathetic. In short, Traffik is a rare film work that deals with challenging topics with unparalleled compassion and clarity.
