Okay, "pretty good" does not scream, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed Campfire Tales. The directors are by no means a classic, but have an idea of ​​what tension is. The horrors do not just jump on you, but the directors build steadily on the climatic moments. The film is based on popular urban legends and ghost stories. The authors have updated the narrations pretty well and twisted them so that the known ends will strike one more blow. The best shorts are "The Honeymoon" and "People Can Lick Too". I enjoyed both of them because they have an exciting tension in every story. "The Locket" was a good ghost story, and the wrap around "The Campfire" is pretty good too, except they make too many twists in the end. The only disappointing segment is "The Hook", which is fine because it's pretty short anyway. All in all, I give a 7 out of 10 points. She has tension that most horror films lack today, and good acting. It can not be rated high with Halloween and The Exorcist, but it's a good little movie worth the rent.
