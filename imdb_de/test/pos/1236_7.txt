Once again we are lucky enough to see a beautiful opening scene where the work of the artists has been completely restored. We see this old grocery on a street corner where the snow falls gently. It contains the rich colors of all goods, from produce to canned food and packaging to medicines and sweets, etc. Essentially, this is a story of those goods that are "brought to life" like the animals on the labels of items or a cake or even a pack of cigarettes. <br /> <br /> The whole "show" is told by Jack Bunny, an impersonator of Jack Benny, with music by conductor Leopold Stokowski, who was in so many Looney Tunes animated shorts, I have not seen. Much of the humor is up-to-date, so it's worth knowing who's "Little Egypt" and other characters. The "Aqua" number from Busby Berkeley, where canned sardines come out of the can, and the tomato sauce from the tomato sauce were both smart! <br /> <br /> All the above and more in the first half of this sign was a bit longer than normal. The second half was about a King Kong guy exiting the Animal Crackers box, terrorizing everyone. This part was not much and ended with a little stupid note. So ... an "A" for the first half, a "D" for the second, which makes it a C-plus or B-minus.
