Twins Effect, with some of HK's most popular stars, offers one of the most beautiful experiences HK has ever had. It has something for everyone, action, comedy, horror, romance and drama. This film can not be taken too seriously, otherwise you would be disappointed, but if you leave your brain at the door and watch the movie just a little bit of fun, you will certainly enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Great special effects, excellent action, nice twins, cool HK actors, FUN movie! <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone!
