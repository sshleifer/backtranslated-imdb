"Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul" is one of the best music documentaries I've seen lately and is more than a movie about music. It is also a musical declaration of love for a fabulous city, one of the largest cities in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities in Europe's history and Islam, the city that in the future can bridge Europe and the Middle East can once again mean As happened in the history of the abyss between two worlds. <br /> <br /> Then there is the music. The film's interesting approach to music is that it emanates from modern music, and we hear a lot of (good) rock and rap in the first third of the movie. Then the soundtrack leads us backwards in time to the roots, to traditional Turkish music, to commercial romances and to the exotic instruments that are fundamental elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In such a complex and conflict-ridden country as Turkey, the film can not avoid some of the political aspects, such as the censorship introduced by military rule in the 1980s, or the relevance of minority songs, especially Kurdish ones. One of the best musical moments is actually a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedral-style hammam (Turkish bath). <br /> <br /> You can end up loving the city and its music end up watching and listening to this movie. I've never been to Istanbul, but after watching this movie, I'm sure I want to visit this place soon.
