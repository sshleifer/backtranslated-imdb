Without question, film is more than ever a powerful medium, as DVD / Video is accessible. This gives the filmmaker the additional assurance that his story or message may be seen by millions of people. The use of this medium therefore has its own responsibility to the artist, as the film can be educational as well as entertaining, and it requires that certain topics be addressed appropriately and with appropriate sensitivity and sensitivity. For example, a film like Spielberg's "Schindler's List" is important because it brings to life the memory of what must not be forgotten, and since history tends to repeat itself, Spielberg's film can be considered a valuable instrument for preventing one Films are viewed recurring this tragedy. In this sense, this film "Focus" by Neal Slavin is of great importance because it sheds light on the problematic reality of anti-Semitism, which has affected millions of people for years and is still unimaginable. Any manifestation of bigotry will continue if it does not controlled or ignored. Born of a xenophobic species, it is a disease-causing society that could end unabated; The film is a pervasive insight into the condition and is an effective vaccine that can at least help curb its spread and hopefully act as a step towards eradicating the whole. Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) served his country during the First World War and has since lived in New York in a quiet, conventional life. He has had the same job as a hiring manager for about twenty years and owns the house, which is located in an average middle-class neighborhood where he lives with his mother (Kay Hawtrey). Lawrence is a guy who gets along well when he's looking after his own business and refuses to engage in matters that his (he does not) have interests. <br /> <br /> All this will change However, as with the advent of World War II, Lawrence, along with the owner of the corner market, finds Mr. Finkelstein (David Paymer), inexplicably, a target of neighborly xenophobes who come to terms with the Union Crusaders. a national organization that currently serves to channel its fears and hatred of the Jews, or anyone who even looks like a Jew. And suddenly Lawrence realizes that he can no longer stand on the sidelines and watch the game. Because now he is the game, whether he wants it or not. <br /> <br /> Based on a clever, well-written script by Kendrew Lascelles, adapted from Arthur Miller's novel, Slavin presents a deterrent scenario that vividly examines the effects of bigotry on those against whom it is directed; and, considering that this is not just a hypothetical situation, but a representation of reality, this becomes all the more disturbing, even disturbing. And what makes the movie so effective is Slavin's obvious understanding of his subject and his studied presentation, which inspires reflection in its subtlety. In the opening scene, Slavin establishes the character of Lawrence and soon after confirms it in another scene that offers the audience the opportunity to observe and watch Lawrence work. the thought processes that determine his life. If this is the case, Slavin can take his audience with Lawrence as his troubles begin to unfold. In this way, he effectively demonstrates how the problem unfolds, rather than merely expounding and addressing the problem directly, increasing the emotional involvement of viewers and ultimately increasing the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> Slavin makes an important statement with this film, which is not only a charge against bigotry, but also contains a warning about apathy. And to his credit, he never beats you over the head or deals with subjective finger pointers to make his case; Instead, he works cautiously and strives to be as objective as possible in everything he presents to you for your consideration. His approach is that of a cinematic diplomat. and it's an approach that serves Slavin - and his movie - quite well. <br /> <br /> As Lawrence, William H. Macy - one of the industry's best character actors - has an amazing performance. To demonstrate the credibility and credibility of his character with a sensitive, honest and thoughtful presentation. He never tries to circumvent the personal flaws of Lawrys nature, but uses them to create a decidedly three-dimensional character, which not only convinces him, but also helps to affirm the integrity of the presentation. What makes it so convincing is Macy's ability to convey the process by which he examines his own conscience, allowing the viewer to successfully share in the experience of his personal epiphany. Ultimately, it's the power of Macy's performance that sets this movie apart. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the film is the performance of Laura Dern as Gertrude Hart, a performance that effectively complements both Macy's work and that of Slavin. Dern gives her character a tremendous substance and captures her both physically and emotionally, and her colorful zeal boxes contrast strikingly with Lawrence's Reserve, which works well for both her character and the movie itself. <br /> <br /> And just as Sean Combs recently (in "Monster's Ball") put forward a good case against rejecting the theatrical aspirations of an established "rock star", Meat Loaf Aday is doing a great job here, like Fred, Lawrence as next door neighbor. It also shows that a true artist will produce whatever the type of canvas he works with. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Michael Copeman (Carlson), Kenneth Welsh (Father Crighton) and Joseph Ziegler (Gargan) and Arlene Meadows (wife Dewitt). The kind of film that makes a filmmaker proud of his craft, "Focus," offers an unforgettable experience that will hopefully also enlighten those who are unaware that such conditions have existed and still do. the land of the free. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
