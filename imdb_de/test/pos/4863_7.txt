There are moments when you do not want this deep drama series. If you do not want a series with heavy stories or a must to see every single episode to be able to persevere. There are moments when you just want to watch a simple series with lots of action and cool characters. For those moments you have Cleopatra 2525. <br /> <br /> I was one of those who really enjoyed Charlie's Angel. Critics said it was too superficial and stupid. But the thing is, that's the point! People who can not relax and expect a serious movie hated him. It's the same with the Cleopatra 2525. It is superficial. It has stupid and unrealistic characters. And that's why I like it. It's not like any other series. <br /> <br /> The first season was not very good. The character Cleo was irritating and a little bit too much. The story was a bit lame and you did not really get to know the characters. But hey, they only had 20 minutes in each episode. <br /> <br /> In the last 5-6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the series 40 minutes. And here I started to love it. The series eventually became a very qualitative series. Too bad that they had to cancel the series. Because the last episodes of Cleopatra 2525 were actually very good. I will never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. Unique characters that only the creators of Xena could have created!
