Uzumaki has an excellent reputation in Lovecraftian circles and now I know why. Based on a manga title (which is unbelievably good as the movie), Uzumaki follows the bizarre events of a typhoon against an isolated Japanese city. I'm not telling you anything that's going on in this movie because it's a must-have movie. I saw it yesterday for the first time and was blown away. He shot into my top movies of all time and jumped with Pans Labyrinth as the best fantastic movie (literally and photographically) released in the last decade. <br /> <br /> This film is very lovecraftian in nature without formally having a direct connection to the Cthulhu myth. It was done the same way Lovecraft composed his stories; It radiates strength as an aura of "Something's not quite here" is intensified in a brisk phase to fear and eventually frighten through subtle progressive changes in the soundtrack and in the movie world. This is indeed a "weird valley" par excellence. <br /> <br /> Simply stunning.
