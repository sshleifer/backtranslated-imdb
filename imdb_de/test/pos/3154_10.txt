In 1858 Tolstoy wrote this in his diary: "The political is incompatible with the artistic, because the former must be one-sided to prove." This thought of a good spirit applies to USA The Movie. The film could be of those with a close focus as a 90-minute slam by Bush, Cheney et. al. and tearing America out of control as an imperialist force ultimately destroyed by its own folly and thirst for power. The more open-minded viewer will notice the recurrent images and themes that make this DVD a testimony to postmodernist thinking as the main character breaks into pieces surrounded by recurring images of the natural world that face man-made constructions; Towers, roads, video monitors, radio, vehicles. Above all, the threatening threat of wars that are and are to be burnt through and through. War and rumors of war are what is created, destroyed and restored on the canvas, in our conscious world and in our unconscious.
