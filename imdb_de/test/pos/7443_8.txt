The movie is really cool, I thought. It sticks well to the original game and some of the fight scenes are so detailed, it's unbelievable. I thought the movie could have been a bit better if it gave you some more information before the end, but trying to figure out what's going on is what interests you about this movie. <br /> <br /> The CG is beautiful, I do not think they could have done a better job with graphic art. Every little detail, how they move, how their swords look, everything is perfect. The characters look like they are making the characters look. <br /> <br /> The music was great and I found it entertaining to hear how much of it was remixed from the original game. New instruments and effects. All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes fast action and a good story. I would definitely play the game before I see the movie.
