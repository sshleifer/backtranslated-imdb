I found this movie one of the best for this time and era. The cast was very extraordinary and entertaining for all who saw it. I want my younger generation to watch this movie, but I could not find or see the movie in the past. My first look was back The early sixties and I have been looking for it ever since. The film showed me the potential of how far we can become a talented craft in which we can only have meaningless roles to act as antics and servants. <br /> <br /> Porky and Bess showed a bit of the urban life of my neighborhood, as I saw it in the time when I needed good male role models. Singing and acting made me hop for days and played the role of different characters in this great movie.
