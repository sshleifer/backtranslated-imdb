I had no idea what I would see when I decided to watch this movie, and to my surprise, it's just an extremely well made horror movie that is undoubtedly one of the best of the 70's. Of course the movie has a low budget and this is a great example of how the story and style of a movie create chills, not special effects! Strother Martin is one of the great character actors of all time and he has a rare lead role here and the movie also plays Martin's good friend L.Q. Jones and "Green Acres" Alvy Moore. Jones and Moore also helped in the production of this film. TV veteran Charles Bateman is the star and "Enter the Dragon" beauty Ahna Capri is his girlfriend. Capri is in bikini at the beginning of the movie and she's just beautiful to look at! The movie does a great job if it stays with the story and does not add a wrong sentiment, and I really liked the end of the movie. Great atmosphere, interesting story and good direction with Bernard McEveety. Martin's performance is also first class, as he does not hold back at all and really falls into the role of Doc. Good and underrated movie!
