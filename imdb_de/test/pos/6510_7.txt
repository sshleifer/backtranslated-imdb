Okay, I think we all agree that Michael Jackson was the low point. <br /> <br /> And also the special effects. But please keep in mind that this was NOT a big budget movie, okay? Not every movie gets as much money as Harry Potter or Star Wars. <br /> <br /> I thought it was weird. B- Nothing that I think would waste your time. <br /> <br /> Parodies are always fun, and just because it was not a big budget does not mean it's bad. > I think that was a good movie, albeit weak in some places. <br /> <br /> Hope this comment helps. ~ Angela
