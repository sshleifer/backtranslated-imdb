The "House of Dracula" really has nothing new to offer when it comes to chill or thrill or new twists for an already tired plot. This film was made as a hasty sequel to the somewhat better-made "Frankenstein House" from the year before. In "House of Dracula" you can see how the factory in 1945 demands production values ​​from an otherwise fearsome film. Footage from earlier films in the series and the ending of "Ghost of Frankenstein", which is used here as an end, makes for an "el cheepo" strip. Therein lies the shame of the studio and the producer, considering that they had a first-rate talent and only wasted the time and effort of each for a quick return process. But that seems to have been the trend throughout Hollywood at the end of World War II. This has produced some of those witless sci-fi images of the fifties with all their close-ups of harmless lizards to make them look like dinosaurs. The days of James Whale and Val Lewton, to name but two, were over to create a true mood and atmosphere in this genre. Also remember that make-up genius Jack Pierce, who was actually doing medical research to create all of our favorites, got fired shortly after this movie was released. A less capable makeup man named Bud Westmore was then hired as head of this department at Universal, soon to become Universal International. Mr. Westmore's ability not to denigrate, but horror movies simply were not his strength. OK, to watch or not. Just watch this movie as part of the chronological order of the Frankenstein series and you'll see how it all ended up as comic food for Abbott & Costello.
