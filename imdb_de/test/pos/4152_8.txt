This is a film that is remarkable for what is not shown as for what is. What IS has shown is the incredible poverty in Sicily as the 19th century passed into the 20th century, a lifestyle that made people dream of America's "new" world. The Mancuso family lives in a place that is not even a hamlet, just a stone hut amidst the hard, unyielding stones of a land that can not even offer a single blade of grass. An opening sequence shows the men of Mancuso climbing barefoot on a rugged hill and putting stones in their mouths to offer them at a shrine at the top in exchange for a "sign" that they are entering the New World should or should stay where they are. It also shows the life aboard the ship, in fact the masses who yearn to breathe freely, and the conditions in Ellis Island, where their journey is still not over, they are interrogated and examined to their " Fitness "for entering America. What is NOT shown is the ship in long shot or in fact ANY shot that would identify it as a large, oceangoing liner; What is also not shown is something that would identify America, no clich√© about New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty, so Ellis Island could be in any country. Perhaps the most notable setting is that of a camera crane looking at hundreds of people who have collided; Slowly, almost imperceptibly, two-thirds of the people at Screen Left separate from the third at Screen Right, and we find that the left-handers are actually aboard the ship and the right of them are on the dock. This is a strong statement of society fragmented. There is a strong sense of documentation, as though we were following a real ship full of immigrants, though it was carefully scanned and is clearly a mix of typical families / relationships at that time. Almost nothing happens dramatically. It's not for the popcorn brigade in the multiplex, but for the rest of us it's a very good movie.
