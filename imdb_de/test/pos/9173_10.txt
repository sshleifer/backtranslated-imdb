I just wish I was eloquent enough to say how GOOD this movie is. <br /> <br /> I ... it's hard to say. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just say what comes to my mind <br /> <br /> I laughed. I really laughed. I could not believe it. I laughed and there was no bitter laughter. it was not cynical laughter. It is the laughter that is generated by real joy. <br /> <br /> Joy. That is a foreign word for me. I do not feel that word often, but I did it while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Will. Maybe it's Will's face. He is a great person. "Smile on my face and there is a sparkle in my eyes." This line in one of Wills songs describes him perfectly. He has "joie de vivre". Trey is a happy boy who has a father like Will. Jada is a happy, happy woman who has a husband like Will. He is someone ... special. <br /> <br /> Happy. I actually feel happy. It's a strange feeling. I do not feel so much. It's so nice to see, see ... other people are really happy. I mean really happy In this movie I have done. As Will says in the movie, "Maybe I'm not happy with 'good', maybe I want to be" extraordinary. "You know, the movie made me think: Me too. <br /> <br /> Fun We all know that we are supposed to be ourselves, but it feels like we are being punished when we do that, maybe it has to be earned, maybe it's something we show after a long time, not us anymore That's why I just loved the end, Will, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valleta, and Julie Ann dancing at the wedding, dancing without inhibitions, no, they're not drunk, other than, actually, being happy, at least I can I think I can (at least I enjoyed seeing them happy and really happy). <br /> <br /> Men and women, I do not know anything about relationships, but I feel when I see this movie , I would like to connect with someone, aspire, urge, with someone want to be together. It seems to make a living ... something completely different. I do not really know. I can only guess. but I felt something when I saw this movie. I had the feeling that this connection must be ... must be, life is worth it. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie. It's funny. It is CLEVER. It is OFFER. It evokes a feeling. I had to think that maybe life is a wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> Do you want to laugh? Do you want to feel really good! Would you like some answers about girls (and girls, answers about guys)? Hitch watching. YOU WILL GET IT ALL !!! <br /> <br /> WE GO !!! You are a wonderful person.
