The edge of River is not a pleasing movie, but an incredible movie. After looking at it many years ago, I really believe that it would still be able to shock if it were re-published or re-made or something. Perhaps no film ever made captures the essence of young sloth in the city like this frightening, frightening movie. Given that this is based on a true story, it is even more disturbing. Very well played and easy to see UNFRIENDLY, but also a little known masterpiece and a really important movie. Should be displayed in all high schools nationwide. Fantastic.
