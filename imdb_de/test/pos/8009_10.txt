I like full house and step by step the same. I have no favorite sequence, I like certain scenes. but i do not like some scenes, but i want to say that i started seeing this show because Suzanne Summers was in it. and my favorite character was Dana. and Karen could sometimes be a snob, but she was also a good character. I just watch family shows instead of junk with lots of drugs and violence. This show is very similar to other family shows where one of the parents is always strict on curfews and appointments. Other than step by step, my favorite shows are Full House, Sabrina, The Teenage Witch, Gomer Pyle USMC, The Andy Griffith Show, and Dukes of Hazzard.
