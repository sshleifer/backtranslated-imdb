This is a gripping story that borrowed elements from the Kennedy assassination and successfully used them to create an outstanding Western story. <br /> <br /> The film has a good music score, although he has to repeat the title theme a bit too much. Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the cast are outstanding. This is a more cerebral than usual western spaghetti, based more on story than action, and it succeeds because the story is excellent. This does not mean that the movie contains no action. There is a lot and it is very well made. This movie immediately catches you and keeps you in suspense until the end. You will always wonder what all these documents are. It also has some snappy comments on American politics. <br /> <br /> This film shows why I think Valerii is in a threesome with Sollima and Corbucci to reach second place in the ranking of western spaghetti directors.
