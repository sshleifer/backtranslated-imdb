Just to read why this show was canceled makes me pretty muffled. This was a favorite of mine as a kid, and I've always seen it start, no matter how many times I saw the episode. Sure, the effects were not great, but they were not terrible either. They did a pretty good job with the costume and it had the nice atmosphere of the 70s, which is always enjoyable to see and hear, since the music was also very 70s. There were not really any villains in the comics, but then most comic live live adaptations had no or very few comic book super villains. Spidey's powers were also slightly different here, he had his Spidey feel and was able to climb walls, but he was nowhere near as strong as the comic spiderman. He was super strong, though I remember an episode in which he broke into a room by breaking the doorknob. He just was not the car beater who can be the one from the comic book. The show took place in Los Angelos, so there were not many buildings to swing from, but they were in agreement with the web. It's nice that this show actually has the web shooter and not the bio shooter of the movie. I love the movies, but part of me wants them to start over and make the smarter spidey pants that have the mechanical web shooters. This show had a good star as Peter Parker and he was fine as a Spiderman. It's nice to see a Spidey who does not live in the slums, as in the movies. Neither this show nor the movie has a spiderman who is quickly insulted, like the comic. Still, the show was fun without being as cheesy as the Batman show.
