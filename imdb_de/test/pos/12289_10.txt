I have tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this movie are in line with each other, while the vast majority of reviews are rated between 7 and 10. The reason for this could be that this film is hard to describe in a positive review, though a few have done that quite well. This movie is confusing, depressing and has no happy ending. I rated Pola X as 10, because for me it's basically literature and art in the film. This is really my favorite style of filmmaking. I only saw two Carax films: this and Mauvis Sang. As with this movie, I'm a bit presumptuous when I call this one of Carax's best films - but it's me. Carax has a minimalist style. If you do not like this kind of movie and are bored, then you should not look this up. But Pola X was less minimalistic than Mauvis Sang, so it had some intensity for a thriller - at least for my liking. I found it very interesting and exciting. The two main roles have done an excellent job. (I mean the lead role and the young woman he considered his half-sister.) Catherine D. is always great, but her role in the story was not very big or significant. But everyone has done a good job. I loved the cult stuff. It may not have been very credible, but that's because it's more abstract. There is a lot going on between the lines in this film. This is a very Freudian psycho thriller.
