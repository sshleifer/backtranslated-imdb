"Closet Land" was sponsored by Amnesty International and has many political overtones, but this rich history has much more to offer than this ... <br /> <br /> This is not just about the political tension of the end of the 80s - it's about the personal persecution that a woman goes through as a kid abused by a friend of her family. We see the subtle allusion to the parallels of a dishonest governance / society structure and the culture of sexual robbery, in which every fourth child is abused and every third woman has experienced a form of rape I, it turns out to be a deterrent hen-and-egg Question: Does the attitude of our sexual oppression leading to robbery create a political environment for fear and censorship, or does socio-political dysfunction promote a culture of sexual robbery? The psychological consequences, even when we ask this question, force us to a place where we develop our own answers. <br /> <br /> In the end, our young author (Stowe) has a similar moment to the end of Hensen's "Labyrinth" - she realizes, in a brilliant, brilliant moment, that the idea that you have the power of the Secret Police (Rickman) is stolen, it is an illusion. No one can steal your power - they can only make you give them up, and then you have the right to take them back at any time. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that you can easily get into. and you give it for sure. The minimalist aspects, coupled with the childlike animation, touch the deepest parts of the psyche and leave no spectator unaltered.
