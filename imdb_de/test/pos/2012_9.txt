I enjoyed this show, it was going on in the UK, but not at prime time, and they seemed to postpone the whole schedule so I could not see them all. I was surprised when it did not return, and had no idea why, still do not know, but I think that's not important. <br /> <br /> Great accomplishments of the two leads, they were very credible as friends. The two supporting actresses also contributed well to the mix. I think it was part of a series of lifestyle-focused shows. Friends were the obvious main event, but sex in town came a few years later. <br /> <br /> The characters get coffee, they drink in nice bars, something like that, a bit woody, in a way.
