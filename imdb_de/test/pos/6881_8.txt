An excellent movie with Anthony Wong, who certainly lives up to his title. Erotic, but increasingly violent courtesy of dreams acquired by a mad occultist who quickly turns into nightmares of some extent when the wizard enters them to manipulate poor Mr. Wong. Well filmed and moved very fast, this is an endless story of serious magic, herbal medicines, power and corruption, but also time for beautiful sex scenes and very bloody violence. Every now and then, there is just a little humor to meet you off guard, and it all adds up to an exciting 90 minutes or so. All around excellence.
