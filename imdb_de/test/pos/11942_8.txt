I have made these 8 stars out of a possible 10. It had an excellent storyline and Peter Coyote and Michele Lee and the rest of the cast have done well. <br /> <br /> Both Peter and Michele For the age in which their characters were supposed to be, the teeth were too long, and their children in the movie would obviously be better off than their grandchildren. <br /> <br /> I missed the first ten minutes of this movie So I do not know how this body turned up 25 years later and could be traced back to Denny Traynor (the character of Peter Coyote), but I had no trouble to understand the plot. Barbara Traynor (Michele Lee) is stunned when her longtime husband Denny was arrested about 25 years ago for a murder in Oregon. According to the state, Denny claims he's never been to the US. <br /> Denny, his story is changing. Then his story changes again and again until Barbara does not know what to believe. <br /> Barbara decides, however, to solve the mystery of the fateful time Denny and A young girl named Sherry accepted a ride from a stranger named Wayne Kennedy, who ended up with a murder. <br /> <br /> I found the movie entertaining, well-tuned, and let me guess what really happened between those two. Three people. <br /> <br /> From what I saw during the credits, this seemed to be based on a true story.
