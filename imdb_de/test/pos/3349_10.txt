I liked this little musical fantasy so much that I bought a copy that I can share with my friends. It is a pleasant and distracting change from our earthly life ... I believe that we can all benefit from an active fantasy life, one of joy and forbearance, I truly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent and the music uplifting!
