Black Snake Moan is seditious. It is overflowing rich, fantastically orchestrated, alien and cumbersome, unique and visionary. In continuation of Hustle & Flow, Brewer paints his portrait of the American South almost like a mythological land that would be expected in a fantasy or ancient Greek epic. And as long as his films float so far above us, they are still rooted; Rooted in the deepest, darkest soil there is. As in traditional fairy tales, Brewer paints his portrait in Black Snake Moan with extremes and exaggerations. Sharp and distinctive character traits, when paired with such extreme acts as chasing a half-naked white girl to a cooler to free her from her sins, exaggerate and accentuate the metaphor in the same way extreme visual techniques as some characters paint in Pleasantville reinforced the metaphor in this fairytale movie. But Brewer does not start his film with "Once upon a time"; In this film and also in Hustle & Flow Brewer presents us another fairy tale. a dark gothic fable of sex, prostitution and finally salvation. These themes draw like blood through the veins of the film and swing and blossom in its dark, brooding environment. <br /> <br /> But despite these harsh extremes, Brewer treats his characters like humans and creates extremely well-executed three-dimensional characterizations in Lazarus and Rae, highlighted by her relationships with Lazerus' girlfriend at the pharmacy, Angela and Rae's mother , <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty perfect all around. One has the feeling that both Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play these roles. Their characterizations are so intense and so severe; It is even more of a challenge for the actors to keep their heads and develop realistic characters. And that works admirably. Above all, Samuel L. Jackson disappears completely in his character, which is opposite to most of the characters he has played before. With films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft and others he has made a typography of the "ultimate bad ace". In Black Snake Moan, Jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and earthy character that is different from anything he has done before. And frankly, it's just fantastic. Surprisingly, however, is the casting of Justin Timberlake and in particular the fact that he seems quite bearable. Sure, he does not have much time on screen, but just like Brewer with Ludicrous at Hustle & Flow, he actually gets Timberlake to act and do what he's supposed to do, and that does not seem completely convincing and irritating. <Br /> <br /> But what's really incredible about the movie is the atmosphere Brewer creates. The rural southern areas benefit to their advantage by giving the entire film a dark, dirty, dirty, crunchy, robust texture that fits more than the thematic and metaphorical aspects of the film. And, using all sorts of elements, like the rising sound of the cicadas, when Rae itches, or a furious thunderstorm that increases and intensifies as Lazarus plays his "Black Snake Moan" blues number for Rae, Brewer almost manages to to create a fantasy world, a submerged mythology in the rural South. And it works so fantastically to develop Brewers unique vision. <br /> <br /> And you can not talk about a Craig Brewer movie without mentioning the music. In Hustle & Flow, he used a soundtrack of rundown, street-wise hip-hop music to emphasize the atmosphere and vision. In this film, the music works even better to fully express the unique atmosphere. It's a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, harshest and dirtiest blues you've ever heard. And it just sounds fantastic. <br /> <br /> All in all, it can be said that this film was a simple story of an old, broken, lonely, god-fearing black blues singer who was redeemed a young white woman as a child and now suffers at nymphomania. Maybe there was not much to write home about. But this movie is not about the plot nor about the characters as they are made in the movie. No, this movie is about the vision? and what a unique vision! It's about the atmosphere, the mythology, the setting. It's about anger, fear, salvation and above all the blues. And all in a unique, entertaining, stylized and impeccable band. Brewer has secured a spot on the most promising young director list, and with such a solid follow-up to a great debut film, Hustle & Flow, he's definitely on my radar for future projects. <Br /> <br /> It must also be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles I have ever heard.
