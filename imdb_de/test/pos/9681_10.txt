Family Guy has been funny for so long, but I feel like it lost its sharp and random humor at the beginning of Season 6. Although I enjoyed Blue Harvest, it felt like the remaining episodes were "graduation" episodes in which producers produced little attempt to fulfill Family Guy's reputation of American social satire. <br /> <br /> I saw all episodes of Season 7 and was totally surprised and happy that Family Guy found their true colors again. Season 7 delivers a lot of fantastic episodes and lots of jokes about the current situation in America. That's what we need now - more fun. <br /> <br /> I feel like the Simpsons have lost their spark All in all, though, this show has had a terrific recovery after showing how completely satirical they can be. Well done!
