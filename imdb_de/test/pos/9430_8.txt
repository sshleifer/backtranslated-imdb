Dr. Franz Tobel, a Swiss scientist, is being smuggled out of his homeland by Sherlock Holmes so that the NS agents who spy on him will not get his invention of a new bomb sight. Arriving in London, he moves in with Holmes and Watson, but goes to visit with his girlfriend Charlotte Eberli, where he gives Holmes a clue where his bomb sights are, which he has divided into four parts Holmes' eternal nemesis, Professor Moriarity, is also looking for bombings to sell to the Nazis, and kidnaps Dr. Tobel and the clue left by Charlotte, a code series of dancing men who can not fully decipher both Holmes and Moriarity. Holmes finally discovers the clue to the code and gets the position of the fourth part of the bombing animation, but Moriarity has the other three and a showdown is inevitable. Very good introduction to the Holmes series with a lot of mystery and guesswork. Atwill's depiction of Moriarity is more sadistic than the crafty way described in the Doyle Stories (or George Zucco's performance in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), but Atwill's acting skills make his Moriarity a benevolent companion. Both the script and the direction make this entry a cat and mouse game between the two characters. This is one of the reasons why this entry is so successful. Great work also on the cinematography. Rating, 8.
