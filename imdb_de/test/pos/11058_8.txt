This was my first Gaspar Noe movie I saw and I have to say I was shocked. I do not mind in general, but that's not even Gore, it's really battles. For some of you, some scenes may not be seen, and I mean, really disgusting. Apart from these aspects, the main ideas and dialogue disclosed here are quite brilliant. When you get a strong argument against a new life in the world and the way it is given, you can not stop and think about it. The actors did their job well and presented general masks of a hand selection that few people found in a sick society. The movie is full of metaphors, but I'll let you find them out. Do not look at it if you want to spend a relaxing time. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to think about it or just something other than what you find in an average movie theater.
