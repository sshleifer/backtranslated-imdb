The legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (magnificently played with evil sardonic splendor by Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack. A group of drama students steal Radzoff's body from his crypt and take them to a run-down villa to celebrate. Radzoff comes to life again and pulls out the rude young people because he has desecrated his grave. Author / director Norman Thaddeus Vane creates a fresh, original and even quite stylish twist on the usual bodycount premise, offering a beautiful reminder of the dazzling Hollywood milieu and creating a pleasantly misty and eerie Ooga Booga feel. The kill sets deliver the grisly wares, with a girl being set on fire, a juicy beheading (the severed head rolls down the stairs and onto the grass so a raven can pick it!) And another poor girl is crushed with a hovering casket rating as definitely gruesome highlights. A Kudos is also fine for the outstanding cast of well-known B-Flick faces: Mayne with his eye-catching role has a deliciously rolling ball, Leon Askin contributes an amusing cameo, while bitterly flushed director Wolfgang, Nita Talbot seems a bit flaky Psychic Medium Mrs. Rohmer, there are also nice twists of Luca Bercovici as jerky Drama student, Saint-Jennifer, Jennifer Starrett as sweet Meg, Jeffrey Combs as geeky Stu and Scott Thomson as Nerdy Bobo. In cool pieces, Chuck "Porky" Mitchell as Detective, Patrick Wright in one of his usual cop parts, and Tallie Cochrane as a corpse. Joel King's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive sheen. The atmospheric score of Jerry Mosely also hits the chill point. A funny little fright movie.
