One hundred miles from the scene of a cruel murder in the American town, Jill Johnson (Belle) settles down for one night with babysitting. With the sleeping children and a nice home to relax she closes the door and sounds the alarm. But when a series of weird phone calls are told by a stranger that she wants to "check the kids," Jill panics. Fear of terror when she has tracked the phone calls. And what the police think makes the perfect babysitter job the worst nightmare for a 16-year-old. There are no other main actors in this movie. Camilla Belle is the main star with a cute face. On the day she comes to babysitting, she really has no idea what the hell she really is expecting. <br /> <br /> If I were in a house where Jill was, I would explore everything. The fridge would be the first person I would look at, but I'm a man and I do not have a babysitter. What I found funny was the size of the house. I thought the movie would be the same if the house was not that big? Everyone could get lost in this huge house, but this movie needed a house of huge size. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle has a sweet face, a perfect smile, but it's like a movie like this, the lead actress needs someone with experience. I did not like Camilla so well. I do not know, maybe she thought that this could be her breakthrough role. I like her, she's a cute girl, but someone who plays a role in this movie must be someone who behaves differently. <br /> <br /> This movie was not scary. I also found this movie more like a "chick strip". I think the only reason why this was released during the SuperBowl Weekend was that the boys stay at home and watch the game and the girls go to see it. It also seems to be a kind of movie when girls are more fun than men. But I liked this movie, but the way it is. Girls just like fear and scream. This was just a pretty decent movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe everyone could like this movie. There are many PG-13 horror movies that are never successful. This was on a personal level. I liked this movie somehow. I give a 7/10.
