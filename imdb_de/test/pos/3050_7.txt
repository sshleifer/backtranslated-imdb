An evil land baron keeps water out of a group of ranchers trying to take their property for a penny on the dollar. Singin 'Sandy Saunders (John Wayne), who saves the day for Gabby Hayes and his daughter by hiding as the rogue's youngest shooter, is also in attendance. <br /> <br /> The first of sixteen films Wayne shot for Lone Star / Monogram, this one tries to cast him as a singing cowboy, with only an apparently lip-sync voice. On the title card, his character is prominently featured as "Singin 'Sandy," leading to the assumption that this should be the first in a proposed series. <br /> <br /> Yeah, it's ridiculous, but it's also fun to see Wayne sings songs and shoots with guns, especially when he's done with shooter Earl Dwire a bit. Riders Of Destiny plays a rare role for Al's "Fuzzy" St. John He's as fun with the bad guys as he is with a heroic buddy alongside Buster Crabbe and Lash LaRue.
