At first I saw this show from an early age and I always loved it. Sure, maybe I did not understand when I was so young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I've understood it for several years, I love it even more. The score of this musical is the wonderfully detailed score I've ever heard! Every note is perfect, I do not even have to hear the vocals to enjoy them! Of course, no one else than Angela Lansbury could play Mrs. Lovett, and she does it perfectly. And she should, she has been playing this role for several years. George Hearn is absolutely awesome. The best Sweeney Todd I've ever heard. He has a wonderful voice, but he can cast his voice so well! His "epiphany" is unbelievable, as can be seen in the audience's response. The judge, Toby, Antony and Pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles. Everyone is perfect! Well, I still have to move forward through Johanna's green finch and netbird. She just does not sing the song well. <br /> <br /> This show can be appreciated at any age but is not always accepted. I'm not a typical middle-aged theater lover, I'm only 15 years old, but Sweeney Todd has given me a greater appreciation for the music than I've got from any other musical.
