If all the films had to be destroyed and only one of them could be spared, it would have to be death in Venice. It is a monument in film history. Much is criticized because it is slow, boring and too obvious when it comes to the point (an old man discovers beauty in a boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically). 'Morte a Venezia' was shot over 30 years ago and sets back one period even further, at the beginning of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> At that time, life was slow compared to today. People should behave in a certain way and even hide their true feelings from themselves. Director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the leading actor, manage to admirably show how the aging composer of Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a little boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach, this was a shock in his time that was too powerful to deal with. We see his inner struggle, mainly on the face of Bogarde, against the beautiful backdrop of Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music composed by Gustav Mahler. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, there is no doubt about it. No special effects, chases or fights to keep the audience in their seats. Also no perverted sex scenes; The interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances and occasional smiles. <br /> <br /> So basically not much happens in this movie. Not if you want your senses to be hit like a bass drum. If you want them to be played like the strings of a violin in a romantic concert, this is the movie that serves it.
