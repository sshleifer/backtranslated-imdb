This may be the most perfect movie I've ever seen - in acting, adaptation and directing. It's self-contained and of some kind, so there's no point in saying that it's better or worse than other great movies, only that it can stand alone as a perfect work of art. And it's been fun seeing confused horror fans who got up and went out!
