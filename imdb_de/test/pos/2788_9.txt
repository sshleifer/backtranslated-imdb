As a former Erasmus student I really liked this movie. It was so realistic and funny. It has really taken up the spirit of Erasmus students. I hope that many other students will follow this experience as well. But I wonder if this movie is so interesting for people without international experience. But at least one of my friends, who has never visited Erasmus before, also enjoyed it very much. I give 9 out of 10 points.
