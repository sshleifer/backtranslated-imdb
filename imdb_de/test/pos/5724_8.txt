Tempo Di Uccidere (Time To Kill) by Guiliano Montaldo is a bit strange, but good in his own way. <br /> <br /> I will not deal with a summary of the plot. Most of the people I read make the wrong impression and make me believe that most of the people who wrote them did not really understand the movie. And you have to understand it to some degree, even if you can not describe yourself what it's about. This movie is strange in a way "once upon a time in America" ​​- only shorter. <br /> <br /> Many Hollywood stars (whatever that means ...) have starred in lesser-known Italian productions. It is well known that many actors who have their best times behind them or are slowly ascending do so. Cage was not a real star at the time. I'm not a fan of him. He is very good in some roles (Raising Arizona, Bringing the Dead) and weak when playing the hero. I do not really know what to say about him in this case, but he does not show the hero's typical protagonist. This movie could have gone without him, but the fact that he played along may be the only reason this movie ever made it on DVD. <br /> <br /> The side occupation is good. None of them looks spotty and they pretend they are really there. Solid support. <br /> <br /> I have seen 3 Montaldo films (Marco Polo, Sacco & Vanzetti and this one) and I think he is one of the great directors of that time. Unfortunately nobody knows him. This movie was his last in a long time (a break of 19 years). I think this movie might have failed in the office, but as it was made, I think it was a personal project for Montaldo that he really liked. <br /> <br /> The production is great. It is always enough. The dusty army camps, the claustrophobic cities and the beautiful landscape play a big role. It all feels very real. In some scenes you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but the music of Ennio Morricone is very good. It's not a piece you'll whistle under the shower, but it definitely works great. <br /> <br /> So this movie looks, feels and sounds just right. It does not serve the lessons learned from it on a golden plate, but that may be the biggest difference between Hollywood and Eurokino. It may sound strange to give it an 8 and not recommend it to people, but I do too. If you are looking for action; avoid this! If you're looking for a well-made Apocalypse Now in a different time and environment, but with a bit of similar travel in a 'state of mind' (sorry, if that sounds like it, but I do not know what else to call it)? Maybe that enjoys a lot.
