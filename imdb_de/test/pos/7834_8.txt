Forget everything you've ever read about the direct release of the Mallachi Brothers' Snakes on a Train video, especially if it's a negative review. This movie is much more fun than the movie that he obviously breaks off: "Snakes on a Plane". Honestly, I'm surprised that not many people rave about this low-budget asylum release. Instead, most of the reviews I've read have nothing good or critical to say, except for the usual stupid herd mentality, such as: For example, that the acting was amateurish, the action of the advertisement did not correspond numerically and the whole thing was a terrible waste of time. Of course, it does not help that the title is an indication of the obvious rip-off of this film. Actually, I had the feeling that "Snakes on a Train" exceeded "Snakes on a Plane" for several reasons. <br /> <br /> First, the producers used real, real snakes until the last 15 minutes when they replaced them with huge fake snake heads or a computer created a super giant snake that consumed a whole Amtrak-like train. How many movies have swallowed a train? "Snakes on a Train" is therefore considered the first movie that scales this height. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this low-budget movie uses some gruesome effects. The woman who coughed baby snakes - real - was fantastic! The special effects of her forearms, which were later torn in the film, were visually tempting! You can also see a little white girl being eaten alive by a snake. She was as sweet as she could be, no more than 10 years old, and she died screaming all the way as the evil, monstrous, huge, Lord Snake head swallowed her. Not only children in danger, but also children eaten! This is exactly the graphic material you do not find in 99% of Hollywood releases. Of course, she was not eaten by a real snake, but it is the subversive thought that counts. Third, it's one of the cursed films in which Alma (Julia Ruiz of "That Guy") The female protagonist - not a heroine - has a curse on her parents because she does not marry the man she recommends. As a result, she is filled with snakes, coughing up amounts of green radiator liquid waste and chewing up a baby snake. Imagine Medusa, the mythical characters who had snakes for hair, with only the serpents in their bellies. Her Psycho-Shaman friend collects all the snakes that come from her because they travel to Los Angeles on a train to see a relative of him who can put all the snakes back in her and bring her back to normal. Talk about a flogged character doing stomach mucus routines. Prepare for a lot of mucus, blood and blood. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the train had only about twenty passengers, not hundreds. Even so, the Mallachi Brothers seemed to have filmed this above-average horror movie aboard a real train of real snakes and they were playing the swaying motion of the train on the tracks. <br /> <br /> Fifth, the snakes Glide around the first hour and infiltrate the train quietly, before they go crazy and attack everyone. In other words, it's exciting, exciting, exciting, before people die of snake bites. Until the last five minutes, when the snake gets bigger than the runaway train and she swallows "Train" is warped, wonderful and out of the way. There is not the attention deficit processing of a Hollywood movie of the big league. It is a fantasy about an unhappy Hispanic woman who falls prey to her feminist attitude that contradicts society. <br /> <br /> All in all, you have bloody fantasy stuff. exciting snakes, which glide around the train, and in the end a gigantic snake. By the way, they get on the train because a few other Mexicans have bribed an access door and the Mexicans on board think the girl is so cute that they have released her and her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than "Snakes on a Plane" if you want a harsh, small, independently produced horror movie.
