In Mississippi, former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis and misses his wife who has just left him. He finds the city slut and the nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) on the street next to his small farm, stunned, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, gives medicine, cares and nourishes her like a father and keeps her on the chain, to control their heat. When her friend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is released from the army for fear of being afraid, he misunderstands the relationship between Lazarus and Rae and tries to kill him. <br /> <br /> "Black Snake Moan" is a funny story of faith, hope, love and blues. The gifted Christina Ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young wanderer who has been abused by her father since childhood and had sex with the whole city in which she lives. It's amazing how versatile this actress is, and probably this is the most mature work I've seen at Christina Ricci. Samuel L. Jackson also has a fantastic performance in the role of Lazarus. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I have ever heard in a movie, with wonderful blues. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Entre o CÃ©u e o Inferno" ("Between Heaven and Hell")
