Yes, I'm watching this show. Because my girlfriend watches it, of course. Well, at least I'll tell my friends. But since nobody knew me here, I can say that; I love it! This is an excellent trash television. <br /> <br /> First there is the panel. Tyra herself, who does not miss any opportunity to talk about herself, but she is serious because she is quite the business woman. Then there's Jay Manuel, a sober gay guy, very serious and surprisingly professional, and Miss Jay, an extrovert, "queen" of the catwalk and a damn funny guy, and Nigel styling himself as the only man on the record himself. <br /> <br /> Second, the show is a deeper insight into a flat industry, and we have to give it to the producers to show us the inside, which can be both informative and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Finally the issue is great; It's just the right mix of everything. The girls who live together in the ego-house, their impressions on the set, the competitions themselves and the judging. All this slides smoothly with just the right tact. There are no lengths. <br /> <br /> Of course, there must be other factors that have led to excretions that we do not see in the shows. The panel consists of moody divas, extroverted and nimble on the slut. woe to those who insult them! But as long as it is said, as long as a participant does not step on his toes, his judgment is usually fair - I think. <br /> <br /> So give your brain a break. If you can not beat them, join them and watch this reality TV with your loved ones. It will somehow call for more, somehow.
