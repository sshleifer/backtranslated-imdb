Before I talk about the end of this movie, I'll talk about the plot. A guy named Gerald breaks his engagement with Kitty and runs to Craven Castle in Scotland. After a few months, Kitty and her aunt venture to Scotland. Upon arriving in Craven Castle, Kitty finds Gerald has aged and grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle (the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want her to stay, but Kitty insists on staying by excuses. One night, her aunt sees the monster running through the hall. It scares her so much that she faints and (another excuse) that they have to stay longer. Kitty is more worried about Gerald after she tries to enter the maze, but Gerald gets her and is even meaner for her. Kitty then sends reinforcements, she calls her doctor, who is actually her friend and colleague. To keep things from being suspicious, invite a few other friends (who really do not do anything). Blah, Blah, Blah Kitty and their aunt land in the labyrinth, where the tension is the most exciting. They are somehow separated and try to find each other. But the aunt stumbles over the creature ... here's the moment we've all been waiting for, what's the creature lurking in the shadows? ... it's a huge FROG !!! OMG what is better than that! After seeing the aunt, the frog literally goes insane and runs, oops, I mean, hops up the stairs to the castle. The frog then jumps out of an open window. Then we make a shot from the ground and see the frog come towards us (oh yes, this movie was in 3D). But you want to know what's funny, the frog that pops out of the window is actually a toy, because it's 1/10 the size of a frog before jumping. It then turns out that these were all developmental faults, blah, blah and kitty and Gerald getting married. Then the last shot of this masterpiece is the grave of the frog in the maze, the only place he was ever really happy;).
