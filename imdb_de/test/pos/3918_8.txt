This is one of the best horror / suspense movies Hollywood has made in years or even decades. Although this movie was partly predictable in my opinion, it has everything a good movie in this genre should have: CHILL, THRILLS AND MUCH GORE !! WAXHOUSE SURE DELIVERS !!! In some places it was kind of far-fetched, the acting was not great, but my overtaking ability for HOUSE OF WAX is eight out of ten. If you like to sit on the edge of your seats then this is just the movie for you, I have to admit, it was kind of neat to see the whole city out of wax ... I enjoy these museums myself, but having this Watching a movie, I'm going to watch it in a movie in a completely new way!
