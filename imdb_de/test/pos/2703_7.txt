Yes, this is one of the better-made TV movies, and I would expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a big fan of The Carpenters. I was able to sing all of her material in elementary and middle school choirs and I was able to do a lot of the solo material that Karen Lead sang. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70s - and as a kid / teenager who sang these songs and learned music, the only thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman. I never got around, she died three weeks before that happened. And yes, that affected me, because I did not know anything about anorexia - and could not fully understand what happened. <br /> <br /> When this TV movie was produced, I was pretty understanding. Maybe not everything is open to the TV audience in Karen and Richards life, but when I opened the parts shown, I understood a lot about the music industry of that time. What bothers me is that I write "from that time" and see "now". Nobody has learned a damned thing, even though this was a very informative and heartfelt look at the problems of a family in the music industry. These movies are not made for fun, but to open a door and show us something. Here was a wonderful woman involved in the idea that her talent was based on weight. She was fine. Did not Know It Received mixed messages about her weight from the brother she loved, the parent she loved, and the music industry, which cared more about her looks / weight than her talent. It got worse with the onset of MTV. With 'American Idol' it's like a puss with English accent. <br /> <br /> A wonderful TV movie, I'm sure someone will be able to get HBO treatment later, but in any case, many lessons have to be learned, missing another wonderful talent.
