Anyone who calls this a simple rip-off of "Elephant", there are no other comments you can make to the film as a separate film (regardless of the obvious similarities with other films). <Br /> <br /> Anyone who questions the validity of the film - in terms of its stereotyped characters (compulsory gay, jock, disabled child, etc.) - I'm not sure how long it will last Since she was a school-but no matter how amateuristic acting may be, the happenings you use are surprisingly close to what can actually happen. <br /> <br /> And those who ignore the movie are so simple: only six teenagers with the regular teenage fear pushing one over the edge ... someone stopped thinking, and noticed that the girl, that her life was not really one of those six !! As can be seen from a comment, she had a maximum screen time of 2 minutes (without the last scenes). I think the meaning of the film is not only to make a question of teenage fear, and how far he can bring someone - it is also not obvious who is always in danger of committing such an act (suicide) ...
