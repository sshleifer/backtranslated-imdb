After reading the previews for this movie, I thought it was a letdown, but after I got my DVD with 1 DVD (the DVD was available before the movie was released in British theaters), I was pleasantly surprised, strong Performances by all cast members make this a very enjoyable movie. The fact that the script is pretty weak means that you are not stuck in the story and the replay factor is bigger. I recommend this movie to anyone <br /> <br />
