Almost four years after the Iraq war, we are in a bigger hole than ever before. That's right, so all the flags that were so sure of America's right and power are chasing their tails, is not that right? You can bet that it is so. This movie said it from the beginning. It's kinda crazy how much the movie knew or what I should say, the filmmaker, knew what was coming. It's almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what would happen in the future. There was a point where I felt the hair on my neck rise when GW said "important combat is over," in addition to a picture of a broken motorhome being carried away with the American flag in the back. view mirror. You have to see it to understand what I mean. But even if you are apolitical or if you are interested in the war, this film will have an impact on you because it is so embedded in the story.
