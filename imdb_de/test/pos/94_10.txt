This wonderful short film will come home to anyone who asked specifically for something as a kid, because it was hip or cool just to get something that would shape you for a peer life, and from your mom or dad (or dad) both)) that it did not matter because you had seriously considered engaging in a witness protection program to avoid ridicule. For the people of the US who do not get the horror of not hockey, it's like a Dallas Cowboy fanatic getting a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan getting a Red Sox jersey. It's not pretty Think of our European friends as two big rivals (football for us) and imagine a fan of a jersey getting a jersey from the other. Ouch!!! NFB of C has excelled here! Une hommage du Maurice "Rocket" Richard, Merci, M. Richard.
