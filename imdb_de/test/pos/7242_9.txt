"Nemesis" was the last book in which Miss Marple was written by Agatha Christie (the last case was "Sleeping Murder" in the 1940s). I have loved the characters and they are lovingly brought to life in this outstanding BBC adaptation with Joan Hickson, who is as fantastic as ever as Miss Marple. Some characters are dropped, the first (new) murder is slightly different and some new characters are introduced. I personally found that the added character of Lionel Peel was unnecessary and quite irritating. Tour guide Madge was irritating in other ways, but often quite amusing. It's mainly because of Lionel that I'm not awarded 10 out of 10! The other characters are beautifully done, especially Helen Cherry as a worthy Miss Temple and all three odd sisters, but especially Margaret Tyzack, who performs excellently as Clothilde. She threatens to go towards the end, but simply avoids it. The female bodyguards are also cheap and the episode features one of my favorite lines from Hickson ... "An Archdeacon ?!" <br /> <br /> This is another relatively early BBC Marple that looks and feels wonderfully nostalgic. Highly recommended.
