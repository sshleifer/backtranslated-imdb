I just wanted to write a short answer to everyone who rates this movie badly because they think it's not funny or that it's boring. <br /> <br /> Here's the trick - the movie should not just be a comedy. It has some depth. Like many Demme films, these are people who live in some corners of society and try to put together a fulfilling life for themselves. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film and home video industry is not well advised with subtlety and puts it in the "COMEDY" filing. It's funny, but a lot of humor is unsurpassable. The heart of the film, however, is not the humor, but the people in it. <br /> <br /> It's not one of the best movies in the world, but it's solid and entertaining. <br /> <br /> And the cast is one of those who show why casting is an art in itself. Michelle Pfieffer is great and this could be the movie that showed she had some acting skills to add to her beauty. Mercedes Ruehl is a big scream and can chew the scenery as only she can, in a role that requires it. Throw Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack in smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you have a great cast that makes a big difference here as usual. <br /> <br /> Matthew Modine is fun, but more importantly, he's a big hottie in this movie. Hot, cute and sexy. <br /> <br /> Lean back, wait for the unexpected and let the movie get you where you want to go and have a great time.
