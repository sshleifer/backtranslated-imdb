This movie is probably the best of Hal Hartley. The theme of unusual originality (with Hal Hartley usual) is treated with great humor. This feature is by no means the only quality of this film: the elaborate frame composition (everything is parallel, down to the smallest details), shooting angles and lighting, which give these blurred images a more supernatural dimension (Jesus' downfall could not be filmed conventionally ), the wrong "poser", are qualities that make it necessary for this Bible to be reread in the form of an apocalyptic delirium.
