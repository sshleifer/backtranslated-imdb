The story is powerful as she tells the story of Ma 'Barker, and then her mishaps with her boys and the FBI ... Theresa Russell is very talented and her beauty even shines through, as Ma 'Barker, in public enemies. Although the direction of Mark L. Lester was not as good as in '85's Commando, it was still very interesting. Eric Roberts, who plays a short-lived role as a security guard and becomes a thug (and Ma's lover)) and Alyssa Milano plays a prostitute hanging on the gang. Frank Stallone plays a thug who helps the gang, and while one of his acts gets one of Ms boys in trouble, he himself gets into a finale so to speak ... <br /> <br /> I was amazed during this movie, intrigued and fascinated. So, I wonder what movie those other people who have chosen it so low have looked at ... For all of these questions ... Uhm, the FBI was so bad at first, had no machine guns like the Outlaws and was therefore quite disadvantaged, Whenever they got into gear shifts with the Ganges of that time I saw the '30s, I thought it would be more realistic than many other films portraying this era ... It is in many ways like a train accident atch, but ONLY ..Enjoy !!!
