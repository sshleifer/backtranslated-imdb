"Batman Returns" (1992) was the second round by Tim Burton as a director. Once again he was a hit when he made this film again dark and bleak as his 1989 film. Gotham City is once again a place of darkness and darkness, where crime and corruption reign on every street corner. It was also smart to see Burton using the policy as a subplot well and neatly connected with the business corruption of entrepreneur Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the plan to make "Penguin" (Danny DeVito) mayor of Gotham was! Anyway, Keaton returns as "Batman" / Bruce Wayne again and he does another outstanding job as a weird and torn man who simply can not find love in a normal world, but he is challenged when he becomes one in Selina Kyle other lonely soul meets. Kyle has a dark secret of her own, which is very insidious, and she's just a veritable vamp as a sexy and mysterious but dangerous "Catwoman" (Michelle Pfeiffer). Between the two villains, a plan is formed to destroy Gotham, and above all, they want to free themselves from the bat. While this movie is truly violent and quite crude with many penguin scenes, it is obviously an exciting ride from start to finish, as you will never find a boring moment and thumb and thank Tim once again for having experienced the characters as grim and conflicting Movie more interesting. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance was the best ever to make "The Catwoman" any better, and Devito was perfect as the "Penguin" matched his character's body perfectly with his character, even though Ghoulish is fun , "Batman Returns" is a fun, exciting ride that you can not distract from, as a spectator you'll enjoy it often, it's so exciting and explosive.
