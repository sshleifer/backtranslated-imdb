Yes, this movie was just funny and the acting was first class from the whole cast. Apart from Shelley Winters, the German accent was not great, but that does not matter, since she's hardly in the movie. So, if you're a fan of her, watch out! The two main stars of this film are Laurence Harvey and Julie Harris. Prior to this film, I only saw Miss Harris with James Dean in the East of Eden and had a tape recorder from The Glass Menagerie that she had recorded on stage with Monty Clift and Jessica Tandy. I was in that role and BOY, she impressed me. How hammy was she? I love ham! ;-) Mr. Harvey, he tickled my imagination! I am now a full time Laurence Harvey fan! This hair !!! * cackles * OMG! It's almost like Burt Lancasters, this crazy, messy look, it does not get any better. He is young and so innocent in this movie. SEE IT NOW! It's definitely in my top ten! :) I am so glad that I found a copy that is all mine! Unfortunately, this film is out of print and very hard to find on video. :( <br /> <br /> By the way, pay attention to the scene in the hospital hotel room !!!!! It is one of the best games! Or if Mr. Harvey has convinced himself that he is ill and tries to get his knee Kick, you know how doctors with this little rubber mallet ;-) Well, he does it himself and his leg occurs and it occurs on the table * squeaks * Look at the expression, so innocent !!!! I can not describe it, but to all the people who say he can not behave well, and other cockamamie comments. Watch this movie and you'll see what a great actor he really was. You will be overwhelmed! If not, unfortunately I can not do anything for you, you are hopeless. ;-)
