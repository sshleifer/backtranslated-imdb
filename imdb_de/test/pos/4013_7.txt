Oh, I remember watching this show at 16:00. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember the way I looked at my homework. <br /> <br /> Even so, the show caught my attention as Alex showed off her special skills and dealt with the typical problems of junior juniors. > <br /> But the show was not just about adventure and special powers. It was more of an education for a younger audience to be more interested in school and biology as a whole. <br /> <br /> The lead actress (can not remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste out the key details) delivered a fantastic performance. She made the show worth seeing. <br /> <br /> You just do not do shows like these anymore ...
