A sweet, rich Talettm√§dchen has a crush on a punk out of the alley, and if his girlfriends do not like him, she has to choose between her heart and her popularity. A very funny romantic comedy that includes elements of black comedy and cheese from the 80's makes this a lot of fun. The film does not just follow the life of the Talmud and her punk. But her friends shop, celebrate, hang out and go to the mall. If the dialogue does not make you laugh for a week, the music plays. Songs like "Johnny, Are You Queer?" can be found everywhere. Elizabeth Daily is also a fun, existential character, and the Prom King & Queen speech in the end is hilarious!
