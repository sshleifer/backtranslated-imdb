If directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, this film would be recognized as what it is: a cinematic masterpiece told with depth and subtlety and passion, a film unparalleled in the visual realm. It is indefatigably stunning and also very brutal in depicting our great heritage of greed and annihilation. And what the reviewers could not stand is, of course, not that it tells a simple story, like 99% of the Hollywood production. His characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions. They even seem to think, something that average film critics can not understand and can not bear, so they destroyed it. Look at the original uncut widescreen version. It is amazing.
