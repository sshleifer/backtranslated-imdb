This movie is a love story against the background of the war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I saw the movie yesterday and would like to get my own DVD as soon as possible and watch it often. The story ends at the beginning. I was very happy that he came back and I was proud that she became a doctor and fulfilled her father's dream. She honored her father, her boyfriend husband and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also a phenomenal actor. Some stories have a happy ending. Apart from the love story, I thought about how a beautiful, peaceful and peaceful island was influenced by the war, and I realized that the real devastation could be a war for humans. Her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while having regular dreams. I loved the scene where she complained that she did not get a dowry, and I loved the scene where both experienced the earthquake. They were survivors.
