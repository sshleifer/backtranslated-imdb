In a bizarre experiment, an astronaut is exposed on the moon as Alice (Florinda Bolkan), an uneasy translator living in Italy, awakens from a nightmare of a moon mission mingled with an old movie that terrifies her as a child. She also does not remember the last three days except for a torn-up photograph of the Garma hotel she finds in her apartment. Alice is fired from her job and sets off to this holiday island to piece together the puzzle ... <br /> <br /> Often as Giallo because of her director (Luigi Bazzoni of THE FIFTH CORD) and the presence of Evelyn touted Stewart, Nicoletta Elmi and Klaus Kinski, FOOTPRINTS is actually a deliberately tuned psycho-thriller with sci-fi undertones. Confusing between dream, reality, memory and film, the disturbing story is photographed by Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro with a thoughtful assessment by Nicola Piovani. It also combines elements of such diverse films as MACCHE SOLARI by Armando Crispino and DEATH IN VENICE by Lucino Visconti in his depiction of alienation, isolation, hallucination and perhaps insanity. Always on screen, Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan makes a redux of Carol Hammond in Lucio Fulci's lizard in the skin of a woman as Alice bumps a young woman into a mystery that challenges her. The locations reflect Alice's unstable state of mind. Out of season, with its Arab influence and ancient ruins, Garma Island is a lonely, almost mystical place unwilling to reveal its secrets. Evelyn Stewart starts off as a worried friend, Nicoletta Elmi and Oscar winner Lila Kedrova are hotel guests, Peter McEnery plays a handsome biologist trying to help Bolkan, and the ever-intense Klaus Kinski is "Blackman" in the movie -in a movie "Footprints on the Moon". <br /> <br /> FOOTPRINTS is a classic case of "Guaranteed 100% Euro-funny", but not for everyone. There is only one murder at the end, but you will not see it when the movie starts to come together.
