Lost was one of the most fascinating and exciting experiences I have ever seen. Not only is it the mother of chance, but every time you think you can put the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a whole new direction. <br /> <br /> Take this victim, for example, The US Marine, who gives Sayid the path to become torturer Is Clancy Brown, who plays a character called Joe Inman. In the last episode, he plays Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in Hatch. Destiny, uh? Yeah right! <br /> <br /> I think we all have to wait to see what happens next in the life of the Wonder Peoples on this strange island in the middle of nowhere. Knowing that some of my favorite characters Desmond, Sayid and Mr. Eko have an unidentified fate <br /> <br /> I believe that this, along with 24 and The Shield, is one of the best TV series ever to feature Twin Peaks on one keep special place.
