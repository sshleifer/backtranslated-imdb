I searched for this mini-series for a long time. I saw this movie when I lived in Russia many years ago. I'm curious if someone who has the recorded copy of this film can send me the copy. I'm ready to take over all the expenses and pay for the extra tapes or DVDs. This is one of the best series I have ever seen. I would recommend it to anyone who is after the Second World War a little interested in the history of Israel and world history. I also try to find a book (I've heard that it's even better than the movie). However, the new book on Amazon costs about $ 50, and I have never bought a used edition. My e-mail address is yurets777@hotmail.com. Many thanks for your help.
