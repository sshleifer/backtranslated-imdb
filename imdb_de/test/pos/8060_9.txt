This is a movie that every child should see before it gets bigger and gets distorted, often passing on ideas from generation to generation. I grew up in two different places, but only 20 miles apart. I went to school and had friends of all religions for the first 8 years of my life. Then I moved to Hillbilly (though not anymore), where it was very unusual to even have an African American in your class. My high school graduation had 2 or 3 African Americans (God, why can not I just say black, you can call me horny or whitish or whatever!) All of this political correctness is a mystery to me like most others!) Back go to the movie, try to see what happens when people get a distorted view or what ignorance or misunderstanding of a culture or a country has done! This is an excellent movie that everyone should watch especially children.
