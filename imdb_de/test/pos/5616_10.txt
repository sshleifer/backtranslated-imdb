Although many audio recordings by great musicians such as Jascha Heifetz survive, the film or television recording is indeed limited. That's why musical offerings like "They Shall Have Music" are such rare gems. While one can argue with modern eyes and ears about the plot, the attentive viewer should bring the unique pleasures of this film into perspective. The plot was designed to appeal to young and old audiences of that time, but it remains pleasant to this day. An important aspect of the experience of watching classic films is to see them through the eyes of the moviegoers of this era. or who feel obliged to report that their students express such reservations. These are youthful complaints that reflect a limited historical perspective. For the teacher, this should provide an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black-and-white photography and its place in film history. In fact, color can stand in the way of a good plot or music. For example, the black-and-white photography of John Ford's "Stagecoach", like Ansel Adams' statues, is an artistic masterpiece. <br/> <br /> What Heifetz made of wood, I could not argue anymore. If you want a blatant emotional attitude, go to a rock concert. The role of a classical musician like Heifetz is to move the audience, not himself. Heifetz's feeling is conveyed through his play, not his body language. He had the rare ability to extract any emotional nuance from the music and transmit it to his listeners. It is the listener who should be moved, not the artist. <br /> <br /> By the way, a reviewer asked whether Heifetz plays the first movement of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto with Frank McHugh on YouTube. This is a 1947 movie "Carnegie Hall", not "They Shall Have Music". "Carnegie Hall" is an even greater treasure of many great classical artists in prime years. We are blessed that there were film producers who, at least in these limited cases, chose to present these artists. In was still a time that is not completely overwhelmed by the lowest common denominator tripe we get today.
