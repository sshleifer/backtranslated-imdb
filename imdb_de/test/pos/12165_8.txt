After ten visits in 20 years, I also think that this was the best performance of Crazy Gang in the film, with more cohesion in the plot than their next "Alf's Button Afloat". In fact, they were a crazy trio of double acts that were thrown together mainly on stage, sometimes in front of the royal family, until Chesney Allen retired in the 1940s due to "illness." He survived her every year. Apparently they were just as crazy outside of the "work" and regularly played practical jokes with each other. <br /> <br /> The head of the Six Wonder Boys troupe for "I'll get together with me" (Alaska) to dig for the gold found there. It seemed like a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because they had been there. When they come to Red Gulch, they find out that their information is only 40 years out of date - they thought the chips in the guilty newspaper they read were funny. But until then, it does not matter because they all fell in love with Snow White and wanted to help their grandfather find his long-lost gold treasure. Baddie Bill "M" McGrew, however, wants it for herself. <br /> <br /> The number of verbal and visual puns is amazing, but most of them will probably only suit British and ex-Pats who are interested in seeing only Make sense British B & W comedies of the 30s. Imho works almost all the jokes and routines, including the Gold If pattern between Bud & Chesney and the "Whistle While You Work" patties - even the Mountie inserts "Always Getting Our Man". A wonderful little movie, rather tired but absolutely recommendable.
