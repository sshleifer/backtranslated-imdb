This is a movie you must have seen. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and when it's over, you'll want more. Well written and captivating, this movie attracts you and holds you tight. The casting was perfect, the characters purposeful and the performances outstanding. "Nanny" is the standard that all women should adhere to: strong, forgiving, protective and never judgmental. "Nanny" for me is the epitome of what a Christian mother and wife should be: a true pillar of the community. If I was half the woman who is "Nanny" I could think I was okay. I would have been devastated if "Nanny" had died in the movie sometime, but since she did not, I'll definitely buy it when it appears on DVD. I can only hope that the story continues and that Ruben returns to Lackawanna to try to rebuild the city piece by piece and person by person.
