Mary Haines (Meg Ryan), a wealthy woman discovers that her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman (Eva Mendes). She does not know what to do and friends Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Jad Pinkett Smith) are trying to help. <br /> <br /> OK - there was no reason to repeat the 1939 film. This is a true classic and does not have to be updated and renewed. Of course it was done. This has received some of the worst reviews I have ever seen for a movie. I love the original and have seen it MANY times - I have constantly compared it to that. Well, this is not a classic, but it's not that bad. <br /> <br /> ** MINOR SPOILERS !!! ** First the bad - the story is old and has been (badly) updated. Really - a man who cheats on his wife is hardly shocking today. Meg Ryan (a wonderful actress) is pretty awful here. Her face does not seem to change the expression! I could not believe how bad some scenes came over her. Eva Mendes is bad too - but it's not entirely her fault. Her role is poorly written and she has to stand out from the original with Joan Crawford. Smith's character (a hard lesbian) breaks up in the operating room. It's funny ... but it turns out that a strong woman breaks in an emergency immediately. The script also adds a few awkward spots where Ryan talks to her daughter about being herself. In these moments, it seems more like a lifetime movie than anything else. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie retains the original's decision to NEVER show a man on the screen. This film is about and for women - men are not needed (BTW - I am a man). Bening is just great as a Fowler - whenever she's on the screen, the movie makes a big leap. Smith is also wonderful - she does not overdo her lesbian character. Brass is good too, but she does not have that much. Bette Midler is just hysterical in a small role and Cloris Leachman takes on the role of housekeeper. The direction is good too - especially during a fashion show. I've heard that director Diane English was reportedly having great difficulty making her first feature film, but is not shown on the final product. There are also some clever references to the original (mostly specific lines) that were inserted without much effort. <br /> <br /> I saw this in an audience that was full of women (there were a few men but not many) and she loved it. The film ends with a sequence in the operating room, where everyone howls. Well - that was not necessary, but it is not the catastrophe that people say. People also say we do not need a movie with all women. Well, why not? I see a lot of movies with all the guys in the cast and nobody complains about that! Ignore the complaints and bad reviews and see this. With a better performance from Ryan I might have given an 8 or 9, but as it is I can only give a 7.
