A friend brought me this movie and at first I hesitated, the tempo in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring. But the life scenes were attractive, it's like watching as watching. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be amazing throughout the movie. The way the director acted the life scenes to reflect reality was confusing but somehow overwhelming. It's like understanding the real life of a vivacious person rather than watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Mr. Alejandro Polanco and Mrs. Isamar Gonzales have done their roles so well that it's more like they tell us their own stories. In fact, they used their real name in the movie.
