I saw "The Sea Within" today and I loved it. The actors of the film are wonderful (especially Javier Bardem, of course), but I thought Belén Rueda would play a better role. Lola Dueñas, Clara Segura and especially Mabel Rivera give excellent interpretations. And I can not forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist). <br /> <br /> I loved two technical aspects: Aguirresarobe's photography and the score of Amenábar himself. I liked the song "Negra sombra" ("Dark Shadow") by Luz Casal with music by Carlos Núñez. <br /> <br /> In short, I think the Spanish Academy should choose 'The Sea Within' to attend the Oscar Awards. I liked other Spanish productions, like Almodóvar's 'Bad Education', but Amenábar's movie is way better than them. "The Sea Within" deserves all awards.
