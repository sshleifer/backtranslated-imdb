When this show first got in the air, I saw it once or twice, thinking it was another "fat guy, skinny wife" show that seemed to populate the networks back then. On the first sightseeing it was just "ok" and I did not look at it anymore. However, as soon as it went into syndication, I saw several episodes (just because it ran twice a night), and I tell you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all the great minor characters are connected, you'll laugh out loud in this show. Each new episode I watch is more creative than the previous one - people who only see it a few times will not notice. The writing and plot lines are much more sophisticated than they seem at first glance (this is a far cry from "Jim"). Kevin James is hysterical, incredibly charming, and a talented comedian, as well as the minor cast. Leah Remini has great timing, and Patton Oswalt's Spence is one of the funniest characters on the show. And of course Jerry Stiller is brilliant as Arthur. I was shocked to read the comments that he was the worst part of the show - he's a gigantic part of why this show is so great - his implementation of these ridiculous plans (which round out the crazy father character) are more than funny. And the screaming - the best episode is when they show him as a child and "Lemon Icee !!" call. In this episode where Carrie takes him to a therapist, hoping to get him medically treated (to make Doug less stressed), guest star William Hurt decides that Arthur screams because he has never been confirmed. The last part of the episode in which Doug beats up his childhood in a therapy session is more than funny, it's one of the most creative scenes I've seen in a sitcom. I feel the strange need to defend this show because it is severely underestimated - while "Friends" was sometimes amusing and "Raymond" has some great episodes and characters, both lacked the creative touch that "King of Queens" has. At a time when most sitcoms have jokes and are overall mediocre, "King of Queens" continues the sitcom cover and shows real comic genius. Obviously, critics of the show do not understand it - or did not see the show enough to give it a shot, because anyone who is really funny and creative has to laugh aloud while watching. It's certainly in my ridiculous tone with my other two favorites, "Seinfeld" and "The Office." It's the TV's Arthurs, Kramers, and Michael Scott who watch us and laugh out loud.
