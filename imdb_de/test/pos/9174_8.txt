Hitch is a carefree comedy that entertains you with beautiful ideas. Will Smith plays a credible performance as a Dirt-Man of Mantle and Dagger, who must remain invisible to protect his customers and his profession. Smith was excellent, he never chalked it too much. <br /> <br /> The best play goes to the actor (do not know, name) who plays this accountant who falls in love with this woman who is out of his league. This actor did an excellent job of developing character as he listens to Smith's instructions, but in the end, it can not be who he really is. <br /> <br /> And in the end this is the main message of this movie. Be the one you fell in love with and you will be fine. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Will Smith meets this attractive lady and the date doctor gets a taste of his own medicine as he slowly falls for it. I do not know her name, but she was pretty good, too. Overall, this was a delightful, light-weight movie that's definitely worth a visit.
