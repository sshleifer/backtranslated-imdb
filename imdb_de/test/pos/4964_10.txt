The music was written by Stravinsky (and not by the stupid incompetent Philip Glass) and was written ten years before Glass's unfortunate birth. The staging is simply extraordinary. The Japanese narrative adds a menacing quality and intensity that the Latin version does not possess. see. Terzieff's version. The huge heads and hands are fully justified by the mythical aspect of the story. The props and make-up used for the plague are simply on-site. It is Taymor's best work. The singers are very good, especially Terfel. Langridge is very moving and clean, and Norman finds the right expression. Their beauty is magnified here and finds its right place: greater than life. Just a must.
