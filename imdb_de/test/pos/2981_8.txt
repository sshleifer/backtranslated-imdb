My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally published. The controversy surrounding the original release (teenage nudity, physical intimacy, and unfamiliar pregnancy) were topics that never touched our view of the movie. We were almost the same age as Paul and Michelle and experienced many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the (sometimes) simple acting and the (sometimes) crazy emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in ways that an adult love story could never have. I remember sitting in the cinema with my girlfriend and holding her hand while weeping during the tragic (albietsirupartigen) final scenes.
