Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentation by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the dissidents of the nation (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are rounded up by a tribunal and brought to justice. Then they are offered the choice of a prison or the leadership of Punishment Park. It's a 52-mile desert trek to an American flag that is being pursued by the police, National Guard and various other officials. The idea is, if you make it to the flag, you're free. The tribunal is made up of a number of conservative types who condemn any behavior that is not their own, and there is no result other than imprisonment or the "punishment park" option for all defendants. There are many things that are still true today, which is troubling in and of itself. Halfway the water is promised to the people doing the course, and the persecuted officials are mostly a sadistic bunch just out for some target practice. This is not a very graphic movie, but its ideas and themes are more shocking than anything else. The scary thing is, it could happen. Not a very optimistic movie, but definitely worth seeing. Attention: It could make you angry. 9 out of 10.
