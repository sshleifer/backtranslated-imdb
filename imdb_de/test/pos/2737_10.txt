I've remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what stamina he has! It was funny and creative. I wish my children and grandchildren had seen it. It's all up with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased when one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had much to offer that today's cartoons for kids do not have. Today's cartoons seem to promote the idea that you need something special, a magic formula or a talent to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances. While the early cartoons did not specifically address the evil - it was a much gentler and safer time - they allowed us to develop our own talents and characters.
