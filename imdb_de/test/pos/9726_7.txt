I had no idea what I would experience with this 1940 old film. But I always like to look at Laraine Day (Katie Lattimer), who plays as a younger sister of Jean Muir (Helen Lattimer) and also her mother. Billie Burke, (wife Julia Lattimer). I thought I was going to get bored with the story of two sisters and a mother overprotecting their daughters until they meet Robert Cummings (Ridley Crane), who has the reputation of a Millionaire Playboy, who has many girls and girls is a strong one Drinker who celebrates constantly. One night, Helen Lattimer meets with Ridley. He gets blown out of his head and just can not drive his car. At this point in the movie, this becomes a drama and changes the overall direction of the movie, which definitely keeps your attention until the end of the movie.
