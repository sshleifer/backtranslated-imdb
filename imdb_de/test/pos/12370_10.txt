This is unfortunately a little known movie .... I say "unfortunately", because he arrives there with the "classics" of the American silent film section! <br /> <br /> It's about a legend of a "phantom car" traveling around the world collecting the souls of the deceased. Legend has it that the last person who died on New Year's Eve is sentenced to drive the car for the next year. <br /> <br /> It recalls the order of the "spirit of the future to come" Dickens famous "Christmas Carol". <br /> <br /> The double exposure effects of ghosts (especially when they interact with the "live people") are EXCELLENT! <br /> <br /> If you love silent movies, you MUST see THIS; it will blow you away! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel <br /> <br /> Norms old movie heaven http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html
