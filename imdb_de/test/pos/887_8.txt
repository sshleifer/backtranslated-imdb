I saw the movie at its North American premiere (July 14, 2004) at the Fantasia Festival. I was a little disappointed when I expected a more epic ensemble cast film modeled on Musa the Warrior. Instead, the movie focused only on a much smaller number of characters. Nevertheless, the film was solid, thoughtful and visually fascinating. The dominant, thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties, intrigue, and blood over the lighter, more extravagant martial arts sequences was a bit rough. It almost seemed like the filmmakers could not decide whether the film should be a combat movie or a historical epic. History touches upon the need for loyalty and the need to adapt to new situations. Is it really worth your life and those of your friends to be faithful to a master, or is there a time when you have to submit to the wind of change? Is there perhaps more courage to leave the old ways for new ones? How do you decide? These questions are raised in this film, and ironically, there is a suggestion that the answer is actually wrong!
