This is a quirky robbery movie that seems predictable at first and then surprises until the last scene. The protagonist is a grapple who goes to work in a small carnival, where he is paid to kill the belly dancer Divana Divana, and then in love himself. It is seductive, tricky and deadly, and it keeps disappearing and reappearing like a magical trick. Other requisites of the film include her double husband / employer (played by the talented Armand Assante), some evil Dominican gangsters, and most of all a plot, a suitcase full of cash. Just as with the old "shell game" where you have to guess which pea is under it, you'll guess who has the money, and like the victims of the buggers who run such games, you'll probably be wrong. As a lovable Divana, Dagma Dominczyk is a talented actress and a feast for the eyes, whether she dances with the giant snake around her shoulders or works with all the unfortunate men in her orbit. Norman Reedus is doing well, facing the young cheater who is stunned by the elusive beauty he was about to kill. But do not count it out, because it turns out that he is smarter than anyone who credits him with credit. This funny movie is worth a look.
