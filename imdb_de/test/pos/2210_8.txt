I was surprised to like this movie since I got out of school "Check your brain at the door and have fun" school of film watching. However, this movie touched my heart. I have friends like the mentally retarded Emily. I have friends like the anti-socialized Evie. And I was in Evie's shoes and chased the opportunity out of fear and dedication to others. Amy Madigan's disappointment over her daughters was almost palpable on screen and the uncomfortable moments she tried to bridge. The gap to Evie was raw and painful. And maybe I'm a lot closer than most, but I've never seen Evie's father come. Usually I attack these things pretty fast. <br /> <br /> My reservations are similar to others here. I thought Christopher Lloyd's wonderful, sympathetic character (a very different role for him, I thought) was underused. What happened to him when he understood what was going on with the poems? Would he, like James, try again? Second, the end, as it seemed, did not seem to solve or achieve anything. I did not expect the pieces to be picked up and all the ends properly tied, but I felt that I did not agree with the characters, that there was no real healing and no real effort was made to heal. Otherwise exquisite and lyrical and disturbing and for some very, very true.
