I love this movie. Tense with great characters. The child of "Sandlot" is as outstanding as Corey Feldman. When the kids storm the bank, the adrenalin is pure. Inside the bank, it becomes a bit of a "lord of the fly" situation where they address each other. Justin Walker of "Ahnungslos" is wonderful. I saw this on "Showtime" while surfing the channel. It was a pleasant surprise. James Remar is also pretty good here as a small town sheriff. Taylor Nichols, whom I love from "Barcelona", is also doing good work as a federal agent. I recommend this movie to any fan of bank robbery with many good characters. I was shocked to learn that Roger Corman was a producer because the film is not a B-movie.
