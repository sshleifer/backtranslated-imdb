For me, "Late Chrysanthemums" was interesting not only because it was my first Naruse film that I liked, but because it was as technologically advanced and innovative as his work from the '30s that I've ever seen. This does not mean an innovative adaptation, as introduced by Godard in 1959 with "Breathless", on the contrary. <br /> <br /> The editing was as fluid as in the best Hollywood movies of the 30s. 40s, but at the same time incredibly fitting, as he told his story. Unlike them, it never purposely emphasized or attempted to make itself "invisible," but along with the cinematography, I felt as though I was traveling on a gentle river, constantly feeling the waves beneath me, like a gentle handshake or the almost imperceptible weighing of a cradle. In this sense, the film was comparable to Ozu's and Mizoguchi's work, but somehow even more subtle. <br /> <br /> What was so modern was the fact that the cut was almost a character in itself, similar to the remarkable camera. Working in Dreyer's Ordet (1954) or Vredens dag (1943), which reveals a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing us. <br /> <br /> I feel that Naruse's cut and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films, which raise the importance of stories beyond the obvious. The wonderful sets and settings should not be forgotten! I found the story itself rather conventional. <br /> <br /> The narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way, and I thought that the first half of the film was a filigree, ingenious spectrum of emotions and connections. Unfortunately, the second half of the film and its dissolution was rather didactic and formulaic compared to the set-up (though it would fit into any other - less complex - film). Somehow, I had the feeling that he had failed something when he tried to dissolve the many layers he had woven. Maybe he should have kept her intact. This criticism may seem a bit hard to a viewer of this film, especially since the process again reminiscent of the handling of Ozu with the plot in his films. Unfortunately, I do not yet feel that Naruse was able to highlight the story and its characters in the conclusions of his films in a similar sublime way. The best efforts I've seen so far - Ukigumo (Floating Clouds / 1955) and Midaregumo (Scattered Clouds / 1967) - have sustained the energy he has built up throughout the narrative while providing poignant and resonant endpoints already more than most directors and in my opinion the basis for a true mastery of the cinematic medium. In this regard, and given the response of the last two films I've seen of him, he may already be one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have right now is where I am I'll see more of his films on the big screen.
