this is fantastic!!! There is no partnership like Errol and Olivia. love is real! I'm 24, but this strip is now as captivating as I'm sure it was 60 years ago. Raoul Walsh is an underrated genius, his direction is so far-reaching, so broad and yet so intimate. The last scene between Colonel Custer (Flynn) and his wife (de Havilland) almost brought me to tears (not easy for a 24-year-old man !!), it's so heartbreaking. It also contains a deep Christian message, the faith that Custer has to carry her glory, and the trust and loyalty of his wife so that she lets him go so that he fulfills his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians certain massacres. There is no film that deals with these topics so much. A must for anyone who wants to look at this crucial moment in American and military history from the inside. patriotic, for all the right reasons. I knew that Errol Flynn was a star, and De Havilland was a screen legend. This just confirms my suspicion that they are among the very best!
