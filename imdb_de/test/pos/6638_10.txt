This movie offers one of the greatest experiences available to moviegoers. It is by no means a pleasant movie, but offers realities and emotions that the human mind may never want to touch. It opens ways for an individual to think, and then change man forever. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was in the classroom, and immediately after seeing it, I had to skip my next lesson and walk around the campus to readjust my body and mind , I felt devastated and somehow unreal, as if I did not exist. Just a few months later, I told one of my friends about SHAME, and she asked, "Oh, was that when you messed up after you saw it and talked calmly about me?" I did not even remember that I met or talked to someone outside that day. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> The plot is the simple story of a war-torn couple. Suffering is greater than that of the dead, and in the end ... There are no words that could complete Bergman's picture. It's like a terrible dream that makes you wake up and change your own reality forever. This movie has to be seen.
