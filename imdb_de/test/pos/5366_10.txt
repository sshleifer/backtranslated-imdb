A wonderfully thoughtful and engaging film that leaves an impression behind the initial liftoff. Based on a true story, one of the many "little" pre-World War II stories that lend understanding to the mindsets of the majority of ordinary human cultures, influenced by others who were perceived as former enemies and possibly future enemies with the dimming of war clouds on the horizon , Seen at the Stony Brook Film Festival, the movie was received with enthusiasm. Well written and expertly staffed. The characters were the most believable and put on one to experience their trials and tribulations.
