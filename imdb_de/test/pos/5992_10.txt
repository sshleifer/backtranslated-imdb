Romuald et Juliette is one of the most romantic French comedies in which they seem to violate all rules, much like Trop Belle Pour Toi. The magnificent Daniel Auteuil learns of true loyalty and love when his life threatens to crack his ears. The film is not a moral moral story, but a wonderful story that will captivate you until the end. Firmine Richard (as Juliette) is a hero who will cheer on women - her laughter is my lasting memory of this warm and funny movie. The down-to-earth way of involving all their children from their different fathers - especially the birthdays - gives the film an edge that lifts it above the average romantic comedy. But it is always the French who seem to show us how effortless that is!
