Hong Kong, the 1920s. A young man of bad beginnings dreams of being a hero, and spends most of his time training and learning kung fu and bodybuilding, much against his father's will. He helps a maid escape from a reckless businessman whose idiots then come after him and terrorizes the noodle restaurant of the young man's uncle. The uncle turns out to be an old, reformed Triad assassin who now helps the young man to master martial arts. It's the karate kid style with "wash the wok" instead of "wax on, wax off". The kung fu villain is the son of a ruthless businessman who has a scorpion style that looks cool, although he's pretty stupid and totally unrealistic. But the story that evolves over time is epic, good characterization, great kung fu, and is generally very entertaining. The young hero is very sympathetic and offers a good protagonist for the root. The romantic dimension is not yet developed, which is a bit disappointing. Otherwise, a great movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 out of 10.
