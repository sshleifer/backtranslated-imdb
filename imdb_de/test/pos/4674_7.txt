I saw this movie with a friend of mine who does not like robbery movies. But she enjoyed it. I've missed parts and parts of the movie throughout the movie. It's a story about Edward Norton and a crew that stole gold, and Norton decided he wanted it all to himself. Then the people he betrayed want to turn back to him. It's a well composed, intelligent, funny and action packed movie that I have to see again ... all the way. One of my best movies of the summer so far. <br /> <br /> A big help for the entertainment factor is Seth Green. I do not know anyone who does not like Seth Green, and he adds to the taste. He plays a man who says he created Napster, and his roommate stole it from him. He is a brilliant computer that is a miracle. <br /> <br /> It was said that Norton did not want to do this movie. But if I were him, I would have wanted to sign up. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that it is very predictable. Every movie lover should be able to say what happens before it happens. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint with the movie is the choice of Eddie Norton's facial hair. The thick but thin mustache and a small pike on the chin ... he looks like a porn star from the 80s.
