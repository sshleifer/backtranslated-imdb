The trailer is nowhere near scratching and scratching only on the surface of the film, and rightly so, not because he has the obligation to keep his actual narrative under wraps, but because what actually happens will evoke quite different issues some of which are frustratingly unanswered in the movie, leave your own devices to interpret the series of events. Which of course means a lot of material for an after-show discussion. The box metaphorically refers to how we humans tend to unconsciously drill into everyday situations or things, and how our closed thoughts tend to see things from a particular perspective, rarely outside the box. There is a speech at the end of one of the characters that lets you reflect on this fact, which governs the basis of the entire film and even permeates existentialism, where our bodies are only vessels for the soul and from the cradle to the Cradle The grave in which we plug ourselves into more boxes in a way of life. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the film is the attempt to intelligently sound NSA by the common name of undercover government agencies like the CIA and CIA, as if something was obviously hidden from those agencies we know about should. They only serve to scrutinize every action and every person, so that no one can be trusted, which in a certain sense destroys both the characters and the audience, while we try to keep up with questions of trust, in order to keep up with the Interpretation of the film to help narrative. Used in 1976 against manned NASA space missions and at Langley, Virginia, they created a heightened sense of caution that will sate your energies when you sit patiently. <br /> <br /> Based on The Short Story Button, Button was written by Richard Matheson in an episode of the Twilight Zone. The story follows the Lewis family, where husband Arthur (James Marsden) works at NASA and develops a prosthetic foot for his teacher Norma (Cameron Diaz), and you think it's all a happy family with her son Walter (Sam Oz Stone) until one day a mysterious man named Arlington Steward (Frank Langella in a two-face inspired face effect), whom we anticipate at the opening, knocks on and gives them a deal or no deal button in a box. If you press the button you will get a million dollars (we are talking about the 70's in dollars), though a stranger will die out there. If not, the deal has an expiration date. <br /> <br /> The story would dictate a deal that will naturally trigger a mysterious sequence of events that unfold with even more shady characters (the nosebleeds), some that inexplicably look like zombies, obviously all under the influence or employment or Arlington Steward. Whether steward is death, a clandestine government employee, a messenger from God, or a representative of aliens after an anal examination remains unanswered. No matter how you look at it, it's like he's expecting something he expects. Shake off the innate greed so his work can be interrupted, and return to where they come from. <br /> <br /> If you put some distraction from the different scenes that make up the narrative, and the production Art Direction, the 70s look is gorgeous when you try to find out the secret of the consequences that come from result in a result in which the fine impression is not fully understood. It is a comprehensive circle of human nature, our desire for instant gratification, which translates into longer-term pain, confusion, and other choices we will make based on real sacrifices. There are also nice special effects in the game, but leave more room for the genre of the film. <br /> <br /> So is it horror, science fiction or a mystery thriller? It is actually all in one, along with a pinch of the philosophical. Do you just not expect a pure narrative film with clean and simple answers in the end? This is like an X-Files episode about steroids.
