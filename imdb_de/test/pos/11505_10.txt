The movie Angels of the Universe is a pure masterpiece, and it proves once again that you can make a brilliant movie with little money. For example, the American Beauty and Blair Witch project. The director Fridrik Thór Fridriksson gives the novel Englar Alheimsins a new life on the white screen. The film is a breakthrough in Icelandic film production because it is the largest and largest film shot in Iceland. The music of the movie played by Sigurrós is very symbolic for the movie is absolutely awesome. I recommend anyone who wants to visit the movie as soon as possible, you will not be disappointed. I would bet that the movie wins the best foreign film award next year? around the world!
