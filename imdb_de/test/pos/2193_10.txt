I was watching my videotape for the first time in at least ten years last night. I found the work itself and the performances as compelling as in my memory. George Hearn, of course, was the master of the role of Sweeney; There is never a hint of softness in his determination to seek revenge on those whom he believes have caused his wife's death and the disappearance of her daughter; At least not until the end, when he discovers his vengeance has made him murder his wife. On the other hand, Angela Lansbury creates a more complex representation than Mrs. Lovett. She understood that Sondheim wanted this role to be a "weird" counterpart to Sweeney; and even brings some tenderness into her advertisement of Sweeney and her care of the boy Tobias. For those with long memories, this performance leads to their debut performances in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Gaslight; she wrote long before the murder. One year ago I saw the musical at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. with the current opera superstar Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others have commented on the opera quality of the score. My conclusion is that "Sweeney" works better with actors who at least master the vocal lines than with opera artists who have limited acting skills. Finally, I would like to recommend the performer who portrayed Tobias. with his mixed loyalty and confusion about what's going on around him. It seemed appropriate that he had practically the last word.
