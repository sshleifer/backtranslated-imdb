This movie is a masterpiece. It was intoxicating from start to finish. The story of a writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson about a porn star is narrated with style, grace, humor and even wit. The actors and the characters they play are first-rate, including Mark Wahlberg at the helm, who proves to be a solid actor and can wear a movie. Burt Reynolds may be doing his best as a porn director discovering Wahlberg. The film traces the late 70s and early 80s with absolute precision, from the disco scene that begins the film to John Johnson's "Vice Vice" of John Johnson, which he wears in the final scene. Most regular moviegoers watching this movie will undoubtedly compare him to PULP FICTION, but he has much more to do with the films of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese. The film is a stylish triumph. The first tracking shot of the movie is just as impressive as THE PLAYER and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS. Editing by Dylan Tichenor is phenomenal. I could not believe that the cut did not receive an Oscar nomination (GOOD WILL HUNTING was a better-edited movie ?!). The best scene in the movie has to be with the firecrackers. I had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense. When I saw the movie a second time, I had exactly the same reaction to the scene. Unfortunately, it may not have the same impact on television as in a theater with good stereo sound. It is a shame that many people did not see this movie during the running of the show, because this is the best way to see it. Anderson's use of the widescreen will suffer on TV (get the DVD or a letterbox tape). It's amazing how easy Anderson makes it look, because this is just his second movie. The music, stage sets, costumes, photography, unusual characters, sex, violence, happiness and heartbreak are captured by a man who is clearly in love with filmmaking.
