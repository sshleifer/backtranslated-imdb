William Shakespeare's plays are classified as comedy, tragedy or history. Some of his most memorable - and most read - creations provide us with wistful humor, gentle poetry, and funny slapstick. Some of them survive as memorable dramas of captivating depth and gravity. Nevertheless, he was able to write with unprecedented skill and ingenuity and contributed significantly to our young language. In which category is the merchant of Venice? I was very surprised that it is one of Shakespeare's comedies. I had never read or seen it before, but having looked at this latest movie version, I decided it was neither both or both. This is one of many questions that the viewer has to answer when dealing with an obviously startling and profoundly disturbing moral tragedy. The players are introduced quickly and easily. One of them is primarily Venice itself; Director Michael Radford filmed the Venetian scenes in the actual city and formed an impressively lively, busy backdrop for the staging of the play. In this landscape enters the young Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), who returns to Venice to see a dear old friend, Antonio (Jeremy Irons). It seems that poor Bassanio heard about a princess whose father died and gave some sort of lottery to all possible applicants. On the island property of the beautiful lady wait three small trunks, of which contains only one "pictures of the princess". Who can guess the right one with mere intuition and the cryptic teasers written on it, will preserve the great fortune of the father for his life. Oh, and forgot to mention his daughter and her eternal love in marriage. Here the light comedy by Shakespeare takes over the film. This clumsy storyline drives the story and also fills much of the movie's screen time, as a series of painfully zealous opportunists arrive on the island, humorous to compete for this very affluent hand in marriage. But before this happens, Bassanio, lacking in finances, challenges Antonio to lend him three thousand ducats to pay for the long journey he has to undertake to get his prize for the prize. <br /> <br /> Antonio, himself almost destitute, reluctantly embraces humility by seeking the financial help of Shylock (Al Pacino), one of a myriad of Jewish usurers who keeps the slack economy afloat, yet still Finally despised and persecuted are the zealous Christian majority of the city. So they live in the abdomen of society, and here the two borrowers have to go. Shylock does not hesitate to remind the two men of a specific incident in which Antonio insulted him and spit at the city market. He proudly introduces this man who frankly has a lot of nerves and asks for help. But help him, Shylock does it. He even clears any kind of interest on the loan. He probably has no reason to worry about Antonio repaying him within three months. However, Shylock's only contractual claim is a pound of Antonios' meat, should he oppose their approval. This is a disturbing request for Antonio and Bassanio as well as for us. However, it does seem that despite his legitimate pride, Shylock does not really expect such a cruel act to occur. <br /> <br /> So the foundation was laid here. And while the film explores its softer side with its love lottery and its false identities, the grim prospect of credit still threatens. What will become of this threatening agreement in the end? Meanwhile, we have alternately left behind to explore the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has a lot of dramatic weight here and that with convincing effort and passion. There are times when he is given room for the plays we expect from such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are those in which he internalizes this energy and shows a contradictory personality: honest, sincere and proud, yet brooding, vengeful and utterly ruthless. This is one of Pacino's most exciting performances so far. And while the rest of the cast plays its roles believably and convincingly, it's really Pacino who really owns the movie - especially towards the end, when Shakespeare turns this seemingly romantic comedy with a slap on a third act on its head. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal much here; All I can say is that it's the first credit - a huge shoe you'd expect to fall sooner or later. And always does. In the end, Shakespeare has thrown up a series of dilemmas for his audience: seemingly unsolvable questions of faith, morality, law, and mercy are thrown at us through the final scenes, and while the closeness of the curtain may agree on the position of the playwright, we seem at ease Of course, they are completely at odds. There are winners and losers in this case, but have the winners earned their loot for good reason, or have they lost in a larger sense? Was virtue rewarded or simply ignored? Is justice fair this time? By the end of the play some destinies are painfully clear and clearly sealed. But the audience should really decide the verdict of all involved. And for some, the verdict is also available for the game. Comedy or tragedy? The author has cleverly veiled the intense finale of the courtroom with an end to the joy of light and the romantic resolutions. Does he say that all is well and the end is good, or is this his final, ironic condemnation? The humor of the piece serves to prepare us for such a serious crash. And while this unfortunately keeps the Merchant of Venice from achieving the greatness of Shakespeare's other works, he is still captivating, amusing and thought-provoking.
