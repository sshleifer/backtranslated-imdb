"Porgy & Bess" was the very first movie that my parents have ever seen. Even at the tender age of 5, I was so touched by the drama that I shouted loudly on the screen, "Crown, please do not take Bess!" I was fortunate enough to see the only TV show of "Porgy & Bess" so many years ago. Now all I have is the great memories (and record album) that I can remember from this wonderful, wonderful movie. I've waited and wished and hoped that one day I might own a copy of "Porgy & Bess" - but it does not look like it's going to happen. What is the stop? Obviously, the public's interest in this film is sufficient to justify a publication. After all these years, I remember it and it seems like I'm not alone. This movie is full of human emotions - jealousy, lust, anger, bravery, determination. "Porgy & Bess" is a buried gem that deserves to be illuminated for a new audience and admired by an old crowd.
