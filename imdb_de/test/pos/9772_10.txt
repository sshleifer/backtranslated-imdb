I've never sat down to watch a miniseries for six hours, but Changi changed that. I'm not going to lie, I know that some Aussie flicks can be pathetic and boring (I actually like Aussie flicks myself, but maybe I'm biased), but Changi is on a completely different track. Although not historically accurate, as we constantly recall, the show combines a superb drama, script, and humor to give us a fun and emotional take on life in a WWII prisoner of war camp. > Remember that the show should not be documentation. So do not be disappointed by factual mistakes. <br /> <br /> This series features such creative writing by John Doyle (aka Roy Slaven), who is more known for his comedy than anything else, and an outstanding director and actor perfecting that creativity. If you want to see how much hard work this series has, visit the official website. She is really interesting and you will learn a lot about the true reports of changi. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Changi yet, make sure you do nothing for a whole day, as you want to see the show in its entirety.
