I am a small 1st class officer (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years. I believe that this film strongly represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were far-fetched. The most common was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down into the sinking ship to pull the ship's captain out of the engine room ... that would never happen. Swimmers are not allowed to go on a boat under any circumstances. Second, the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak), it looked more like a NASA Command Center ... We do not have high-tech equipment. Third, the Captain of the Air Station would not conduct the search and rescue operations with about ten guards. In reality, it would be an E-6 or E-7 as a SAR controller and possibly 2 other support staff such as a SAR assistant and a radio watch stander. Otherwise, the movie was dead. I think they should have taken more of the other installments in CG and their roles in search and rescue than just aviation-based rates. Some scenes from the "A" school reminded me of my days, theirs, and the stupid things I had done that had got into trouble in my younger days.
