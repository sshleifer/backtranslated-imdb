This is a very visual movie. By that I mean that the dialogue is sparse, almost so much that it is a silent movie for some very long takes, starting with the opening shot. <br /> <br /> However, the silence is interrupted by an overwhelming sound. This track ranges from discordant, staccato beats to a haunting mix of violins and vocals that sound like dreams. It is a feast for the ears and for the eyes. One of the early visualizations was a man walking down a street, so busy with his interest in a well-formed woman, that he enters a lamppost: one of the consequences of love and love a metaphor for what is in store. <br /> <br /> Another movie a long time ago? Love Story (1970) - said that love never has to say that you are sorry. This story turns this idea upside down in various ways, starting with the main character Titta (Toni Sevillo), a seemingly harmless, long-time resident of a hotel in Switzerland. Every day, week after week, he sits at the same coffee table and enjoys the passing world, his cigarettes, his coffee, his loneliness. and he's been doing it for ten years. He sits, observes he, and once a week he takes part in three very surprising activities that you will experience when you see this little masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> Love will be in a different way Explains Immediate Contrast to Titta's Loneliness and Restraint: Two older hotel residents are still very much in love, but the man wants to die in spectacular fashion when his time comes guests, one of whom is Titta. Now Titta knows about her quarrels, her love, the cheating of the man, his apology to his wife and his wailing. As? In a surprising and black-comedic way ... one of those surprise activities that I mentioned. <br /> <br /> But in reality this is not a comedy, even though it's the idea of ​​human comedy in a Balzacian sense: the irony of life and what to do with it. This decision had been made for Titta ten years earlier when he left his wife and started living in the hotel. He occasionally stays in touch, and it is clear that he still loves his children (who are now grown up) and the grief in his voice speaks volumes. But there's more to it than just grief ... <br /> <br /> Such a life as Tittas seems to be boring, and it's actually from many perspectives. Only when we learn what lies beneath his almost death-like countenance does the horror of his situation strike the observer between his eyes. But not until we know that bartender Sofia (Olivia Magnani) is very interested in Titta and awakens Titta's interest in her. <br /> <br /> And then things start to unravel Titta: He finally succumbs to her femininity and rediscovers the consequences of love. Ironically, he realizes what he has to do with his life, in a spectacular way. <br /> <br /> I know that all of the above is a bit cryptic; But saying more would ruin the movie and the story for you. If you like Italian cinema? I love it! ?? I urge you to see them here. The spectacle is great. the soundtrack cools the spine; The camera work is really innovative. The direction shows the maturity of a true artist. <br /> <br /> I know, I'll see this movie again and again ...
