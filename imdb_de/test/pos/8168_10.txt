I'm a sociologist / anthropologist specializing in the field of Symbolic Interactionism, and I have to say that this movie has a high quality in a symbolic context throughout the movie. To anyone who has not seen this yet, I recommend that you also read "The Search for the Ultimate Meaning" by Victor E. Frankl. I think you will be able to draw some amazing connections. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I would say that despite the fact that the main characters are gay, this is not a gay story. This is a story about finding and finding meaning in life, despite the difficulties and challenges, the pain and the horrors that stand in your way. This is a story of finding and finding balance, wholeness and happiness.
