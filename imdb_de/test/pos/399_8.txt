Normally Anthony made Mann with 'The Big' Westerns - James Stewart, Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda. , , the A list cowboy stars. But in this B + movie, he did something very special and was pretty successful with something that turned out to be truly unique in the West. The main character, played by Victor Mature, is a trapper / miner, and usually they are romanticized in movies - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, those kinds of things where the hero is not really a typical miner, but a pure cut heroic figure, hanging around with real miners. Not here. For once, a true hillman - vulgar, raw, animal - is the central figure, and there's something to see that lends Mature to one of his better later roles. The real actors are provided by Robert Preston, who excellently qualifies as a self-serving Custer-type cavalry commander, and James Whitmore, the Armenian Spencer Tracy, as one of the old-timers who feel trapped on one side between increasingly hostile Indians and the oncoming power of civilization on the other side. Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft as the wife of the officer, who is initially repulsed by the sight of Mature's gruesome character and then slips off her own civilization veneer when she realizes to her own shock that she is attracted to him. Rarely has a remote fortier fort ever been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic appeal that John Ford has given in his masterly fort Apache. The battle sequences are big and, above all, violent and especially impressive when you watch them in widescreen format. Good show and undervalued movie.
