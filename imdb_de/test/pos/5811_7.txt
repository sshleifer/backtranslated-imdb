As a big fan of Hammer Studios and an avid watcher of their gothic horror movies, I wonder why it took me so long to see their television series "Hammer House of Horror," which ran in 1980 for just one season. I have the first four episodes Seen in the series, I can say that it easily fulfills my previous expectations. This first episode of "Witching Time" may not be the most imaginative horror story ever told, and does not provide the wonderful gothic atmosphere for which I love Hammer movies from the 50s to 70s, but it's undoubtedly a scary surprise post History and create real eerieness within fifty minutes. The composer of film music David Winter (Jon Finch) is tormented by Lucinda (Patricia Quinn) from the 17th century. The story may be simple, but for less than an hour, it's effective and delivers many scary moments. Northern Irish actress Patricia Quinn, perhaps best known for her role in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (1975) and the fantastic Monty Python comedy "Monty Python's Sense of Life" (1983), is wonderfully vicious in her role that fits her like a glove. Jon Finch is also pretty good as David, and although Prunella Gee, who plays his wife as an adulteress, may not be the best actress ever, she's definitely nice to look at. The episode is accompanied by a beautiful score that suits the atmosphere. Overall, "Witching Time" is a very entertaining episode with several really spooky moments and a decent start to the series.
