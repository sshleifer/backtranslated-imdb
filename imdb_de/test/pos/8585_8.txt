I myself am Belgian and am interested in the history of the Congo. It has been our only colony for many years (Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate but not a colony) and is part of the history of our country. Nowadays it seems very popular that everything the Belgians did in the Congo was wrong, especially in the 19th century. I'm not saying that bad things did not happen. Of course they did, but back then it was not unusual. Do you really think that the French or the British were so much nicer in their colonies? No, they were not. At that time, for our King Leopold II, it was "normal" to use the Congo as a way to gain personal wealth. It was his private property (at that time it did not belong to the state) and he tried to make the most of it. Of course, cruel things like choppy hands had happened and were inadmissible by today's standards, but then it was common. And it has to be said that all this has not happened in the last decades ... I know several people who worked for many years in the Congo before declaring the Congolese independence. It is true that they had several black servants, but they are very nice people and I really can not imagine that they have ever treated them badly. As far as I know, they have always treated them with a lot of respect (though I do not say that all Belgians did). If they were not that old now (almost all about 80 years old), they would like to return to the Congo. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this film is that it conveys a historically accurate vision of what has happened in recent years of Belgian governance and the first years of Congolese independence. The story is not so black and white (maybe not the best words in this context, but how else can I explain what I mean), as I feared. It does not mean that all Belgians were wrong and that everything the Congolese did was good. It shows perfectly how the Congolese, in their onslaught to break away from the Belgians, did not object to seeking help from both the Russians and the Americans, both of whom were more interested in the raw materials copper, diamonds, bauxite and rubber to pay attention ... and to get the Congolese into their political "camp" and were not too interested in their independence. Not only is there a good idea of ​​how Lumumba became more powerful, but also how Mobutu played a dual role. It shows the Belgian reaction to some of our compatriots who were injured, threatened and even murdered (My father was one of the paratroopers sent to the Congo to rescue the Belgians.) There is a good idea of ​​the political problems that are going on Lumumba was hit when the province that did not want to take Katanga to the Republic of Congo, the role that the Belgians had in the murder on Lumumba ... all this gets its share in this film. <br /> <br / > The story seems to be very accurate and the characters really look and behave like the real ones.This film could give a very good idea of ​​how life in the Congo in the late fifties and early sixties was made by anyone looking for It should and should be shown in history lessons, especially in Belgium, because it is a part of our history that we will never forget should. I give 7.5 / 10, maybe even 8/10.
