This is a wonderful movie ... it's funny, dark, poignant, thought-provoking, innocent, cheeky and generally entertaining. I do not know that I've ever seen anything like this ... "The Rapture" or maybe one of Todd Solondz's comedies "or even the last movie" Teeth "these are all bitter, evil little gems." Franklin's "manages to do it despite the darkness around the edges, to have a thoroughly sincere and pure heart.The story resembles John Waters's "Low Down Dirty Shame," only this movie differs in that it actually has a story, and something to say, beyond Waters teenager "Sex is not dirty (giggling, nudge-nudge)" message A conservative, oppressed family is experiencing a drastic change in a car accident and is suddenly not so conservative anymore ... in fact they are actually happy, probably the only ones People in their city (or maybe the world) who they are, and when you talk about why that's the case, you'd spoil the movie, simply put, everyone should marriage, although of course only people who are already sold, what the optimistic, hopeful philosophy of the film would ever be Prevent the process from becoming too intense ... Teresa Willis gives a particularly memorable and courageous performance as an upstanding mother who like a butterfly turns up when it is released. Both she and Robertson Dean earn kudos for their relentlessly sincere performances (not to mention frequent and extensive nudity and sex scenes). They make a joking joke that includes a "deviant sex practice," a touching, believable, and lovable moment. Aviva as a daughter is an outstanding person to watch and perfectly captures the attitude, anxiety and speech patterns of a girl of her age. Vince Pavia as a "himbo" brother with a secret looks and is functional, though his story and how everyone reacts to it is more rewarding than his actual acting. Mari Blackwell, as the captivating best friend of Mother Franklin, is wonderfully cold, confused and even compassionate in a role that could be exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie looks fantastic, all in bright colors and in wide colors -open locales ... it looks like Hi-def has shot ... If so, that's the line very thin, she looks very much like a movie. There is a lot of talk and a lot of philosophical, which is a bit preaching (more, I can imagine a viewer who disagrees with the politics of the film), but this film says a lot of things that need to be said. .when only people are not afraid to listen and think. The arguments that are used here are clever and thoughtful, and above all, they refuse to demonize the religious or non-religious parties. <br /> <br /> The end is on the ambiguous side, which I found a little disappointment somehow ... I think it would have worked better if the author (as Jay Floyd, since he produced, wrote and directed ) has given a more workable solution, a kind of solution, but on the other hand, there is probably no one to play off people of different faiths against each other. Nevertheless, it was a moving, memorable final image that stifled me - a success. Meanwhile, I'm very happy that Mr. Floyd made this movie and look forward to sharing it with as many people as possible. Listen.
