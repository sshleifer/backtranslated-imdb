Life is crazy. You're crazy, I'm crazy, we're all crazy. We're all a bit of Minnie and a bit of Moskowitz. Sometimes it seems best to be sensible ... but then what could you miss? <br /> <br /> They must be you. You do not have to park cars and shout at people by accident, but you can not hide behind a veil (or dark sunglasses) and pretend that everything is alright. And sometimes you have to be really careful because why else are you living? <br /> <br /> I will not "rate" this love compared to Cassavetes other films, because they are all absolutely 100% unique works and each one of their own expression and exploration of our lives. In this sense, they are all great and comparisons are abominable. Of course, this movie has a crazy, sometimes crazy, but ultimately wonderful and liberating effect that all of his films have - you never know what's going to happen next, and you never know what the characters will think, do or feel next. The characters themselves not - and do we really want to live our lives differently? Unlike Moskowitz, you can have a great job and invest reasonably money in your IRA, but live the life of an adventurer in your feelings, your mind and your life experience. Yes, we can have both, Cassavetes shows us. Thank god someone did.
