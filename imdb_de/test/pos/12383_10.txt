That's better than the first. The movie opens with Sheriff Sam. Then Sam and Anne grab their bags and head to the Tropicana while Jack goes along. <br /> <br /> People are shot, get glass through their necks, squeezed by anvils, stabbed with icicles, eyes blown out, head explosions, drownings, hangings, lobsters pushed into faces, slashed throat, frozen to death, killed by snowballs , Arms torn off, melted by antifreeze, pots and pans struck with icicles in the neck, fingers bitten off, icicles bitten through the mouth, bitten into the neck, people exploded, snowballs roasted and pushed into blenders. The snowballs are hilarious, they put it in a blender and turn it on, then it says "that was fun", they put it in a waffle thing and it gets burnt. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie. Then they start to find other ways to kill it, and the snowball answers, "That's not nice." <br /> <br /> It was worth ten bucks spent to buy it. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars.
