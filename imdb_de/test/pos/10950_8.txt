Lots of action, cheesy love story, unexpected actors and a lot of fun. The special effects are acceptable / decent, some fights are reasonably neat with some interesting acrobatic moves. The whole story goes through and is so cheesy that you wonder when the inevitable will happen, even though there is a small twist (just a small one). The general naivety of the film makes him sometimes quite bizarre. Sweet enough chicks too, what more do you want? PS. If you want to check a movie like this, try checking it for the category the movie would fall in (not necessarily where it fell off). So do not bombard good cheese films!
