A brilliant horror movie. Extremely cruel and very scary. The Thing is a remake of John Carpenter, but do not let that distract you. It's just awesome. At the beginning of the film, the alien's spaceship races to Earth for centuries before humanity exploded through the planet, which unleashed the title of the film in stunningly bright white and blue with the inscription "THE THING". One of the best opening speeches for a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The cast of actors from the twelve-member science team is a real pleasure and the venues for their station in Antartica are visually stunning on DVD widescreen. It must have been great in the cinema. I'm sorry I did not see that on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is honored as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to fight a deadly form that alters their monstrosity and infiltrates their base. All performers are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and suspense about who the thing has infected. My favorite scene in the entire movie must be when Macready examines all who are still alive for infection, it's tense, scary, and finally spectacular. I love it because it's funny too. <br /> <br /> Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his really amazing make-up effects and the shape change of the alien's designs themselves. If he did not get an Oscar for the best visual effects at the time, he should be damned good. This is also controversial as to whether this is the best film by John Carpenter ... it is certainly a cruel feat. <br /> <br /> Wait for a cold winter's night. Get some Budweiser out of the fridge. Sit down and watch The Thing, a horror masterpiece of flaming heroes battling form, changing towers of blood and slime. <br /> <br /> Absolutely brilliant. <br/> <br /> Ten Out Of Ten.
