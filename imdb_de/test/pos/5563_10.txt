One of the biggest crimes against sci-fi television was the cancellation of Farscape. As one of the best-written, well-played, and outstanding shows ever written for the Airwaves, it set new standards for sci-fi television. After the flagship, the most acclaimed, critically accredited sci-fi channel show, explaining why shows like Buffy, Tremors: The Series and even StarGate: SG-1 take so long, it has stayed that long they did it. Yes, Buffy too. But I will save my Buffy again. Farscape was badly treated by the sci-fi channel, constantly thrown around in the planning, repeats were rarely shown and never really advertised. But while the show was canceled, everyone involved in producing the show wanted to bring the show back (even Brian Henson, CEO of Henson Company). There is also an extensive fan movement to bring the show back. All in all, everything is not dark, and hopefully the fans will get their 5th season.
