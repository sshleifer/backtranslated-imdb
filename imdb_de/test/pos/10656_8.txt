There are only a handful of films made on such a large scale that make such a big difference in the art of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> "Bronenoset's Potyomkin" is one of those movies, and it should run everyone's list to learn more about the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Grigori Aleksandrov and Sergei M. Eisenstein conducted this groundbreaking film documenting the horrors of a Russian battleship. When the sailors finally take revenge on their superiors, the locals embrace and support them. It gets ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of the business. What follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. Anyone who has seen "The Untouchables" and "Bronenosets Potyomkin" knows exactly what I mean. Overall, I think this movie has raised the bar, just like "Intolerance" a few years ago. If you do not mind silent movies, do yourself a favor and see "Bronenosets Potyomkin". <br /> <br /> If you do not like silent movies, check out "Bronenosets Potyomkin" anyway. <br /> <br />
