My first "Columbo". I really enjoyed it. Great format and Peter Falk's character is extremely good ... Wonderfully quirky, he can take his place next to Poirot, Miss Marple and Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I can see why this series has such a consequence. <br /> <br /> As a professional musician I have to say a few things. First of all, a conductor who produces these pedestrian performances of the simplest examples of the repertoire (A Little Night Music, Strauss Waltz, Beethoven ...) will never be called a house like this or such fame or such cars are much less a genius , And the conducting that the actor does is so bad that he is ridiculous. No orchestra would take him seriously. <br /> <br /> There are also some little things, such as his rehearsal of A Little Night Music (why rehearse it when you've just played it for television? Any orchestra musician could play it in his or her own anyway sleep ...). His instructions to the ensemble are downright nonsensical, and when Columbo Blythe Danner asks what "quasi-fantasy" means, she says it's "Latin." It's Italian, as well as the vast majority of musical instructions. <br /> <br /> And finally, no two great musicians would have the following exchange: "Play something". "What should I play?" "Chopin". Music is their job and their passion, they know it well. Something far more specific would be asked and offered! <br /> <br /> I know. I should come out more ...
