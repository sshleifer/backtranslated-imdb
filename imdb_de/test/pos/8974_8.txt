Nice to see a comedy for adults. Masterfully structured by Aaron Sorkin through Mike Nichols' own championship. Mr. Nichol's mastery is to showcase characters in all their shocking truth, from the sad and mesmerizing Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in "Who's Fear of Virginia Woolf" to the sad and intriguing Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law, and Natalie Portman in Closer. In "Charlie Wilson's War" is the shocking truth outside of the characters and the sad and mesmerizing Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are available for something else, it's only personal, to some extent Hanks has to bury his brilliance in single malts and Julia Roberts throws parties and presents characters with straightforward straightness.Amy Adams is a witness and exists as a character, an insurmountable task that Miss Adams can master in a wonderful way, but it is Philip Seymour Hoffmans Gus, with whom I monopolized my attention, his character may not be P remiere, but it's the first way Hoffman presented it to us. Someone who survives the disrespect with which he is treated by the absolute conviction that he is smarter than anyone put together. Hoffman is great. The pace of the story helps enormously not to get into a multitude of useless questions. A sharp, short, smart, sad comedy and when could I say that last?
