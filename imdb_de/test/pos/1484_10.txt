This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time, Rowan Atkinson is just a genius! And it's only fitting that I chose this as a 1000 rating. I can not say how much I love Mr. Bean, he's the man, and what I'm wondering is how he comes out of these incredibly difficult situations, and he's always so creative, and Robyn Driscoll also deserves awards! he is also a genius!. My favorite piece he made is Mr. Bean's Amazing Adventures, and while all the others are amazing, this remains my true favorite, and I wish the show did not stop so fast! Each episode is brilliantly written and they were all masterfully staged, plus Each episode is a classic in my eyes! This show is incredibly popular and I can definitely see why, because it's probably the funniest show ever. The character actors all played their roles very well, especially Robyn Driscoll and Matilda Ziegler (as Irma). This is one of my favorite TV shows ever. Rowan Atkinso is just a genius and an incredibly talented comedian (possibly the best!), And it's only fitting that I chose this as my 1000's review if you have not seen this show what you're doing and see Believe me, you will not regret it, trust me, it's one of the best TV series I've ever seen, and I'll watch the show over and over again, I never get tired! Mr. Bean Rules! ***** of 5
