*** May contain spoiler *** OK, it was not exactly as good as expected, but it was a lot different than I expected, but it turned out to be a pretty good movie <br /> I'm interested usually not particularly for this kind of music, but in this movie it worked perfectly (I mean, he is a rock star), but I loved Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah, even though she had a little part of the movie was incredible. <br /> <br /> And even though Tom Cruise played Lestat in an interview with a vampire, I have to admit that I'm glad he declined the role, even though I do not usually like to use it. Different people play the role same characters in sequels and things. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was great and I liked it, even if there were parts that could have been better. Great vampire movie.
