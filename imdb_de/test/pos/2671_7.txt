It is sometimes difficult to see such self-proclaimed "message movies" from an earlier, seemingly easier time without some cynicism. The problem of racism and religious tolerance is a topic that has come to us from an early age. With increasing growth, teachers and authority figures have sought less obvious but equally effective means to convey the message. "The house I live in (1945)" is about as inconspicuous as "Message Movies" come, and Frank Sinatra seems to treat his audience like a child? Perhaps this was the point, as the short film was doubtless intended primarily to influence younger moviegoers. Nevertheless, I was curious when Sinatra introduced this honest patriotic speech about what it truly means to be an American. and I'm not even an American! Director Mervyn LeRoy, who had just been released two months after the end of World War II, welcomed the war-weary audience with a message of tolerance, togetherness, and most of all, hope. The music is not bad either. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra with a fresh face ?? already a star, but not yet the superstar he would have become? opens the film in a recording studio and roars "If You But But A Dream" with full orchestral accompaniment. As Frank walks out among the songs for a smoky, he watches a large group of children harassing a young Jewish boy, and their taunts are provoked solely by his different religion. Ol 'Blue Eyes quickly puts an end to this childish behavior by burning the bullying enemies "Nazi werewolves" and scolding their irrational prejudices. Then he earnestly and benevolently teaches the group about the simple stupidity of racial and religious discrimination, assuring them that every American culture, even if different from ours, is still American in heart. unless you are one of those bloody "Japs". There is a touch of hypocrisy in advocating racial tolerance, while portraying a nation as a collective enemy, though Hollywood could hardly be accused of being overly enthusiastic about the plight of the Japanese in 1945, with a wonderfully heartwarming interpretation of "The house where I live", written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol, is home to home. When the songwriter heard the song for the first time in the film, he was furious that the filmmakers had completely ruled out three of his verses, which was crucial to the message. These omissions were most likely due to time constraints, but Meeropol understandably did not accept them too well and was reportedly thrown out of the cinema. When first released, "The House I Live In" was such an important short film that it won the Golden Globe as "Best Film for Promoting International Good Will" and an Honorary Oscar for all involved. In 2007 it was categorized as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and was included in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, which is why I learned about it. Although his approach may seem a little hokey sixty years later, thanks to a young man by the name of Frank Sinatra, this film still remains worth seeing.
