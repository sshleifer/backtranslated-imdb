I think this is one of Burts top five films, along with Deliverance, Smokey and the Bandit, Boogie Nights and City Heat. He also directed, so he had a talent like his buddy Clint Eastwood. I wish he had made more movies or even a sequel to Sharky's Machine than Stroker Ace or Cannonball Run II. This is a tough, hearty cop thriller with Reynolds at the top of his game. Having beautiful Rachel Ward of Thorn Birds in it has also helped. Henry Silva is the bad guy and he always does that well. The movie is also a great soundtrack. I highly recommend it, wish it was on DVD in the UK, an audio comment by Reynolds would be great as well. *** 7/10
