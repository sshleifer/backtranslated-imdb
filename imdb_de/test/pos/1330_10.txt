With such a cast I knew that acting would be amazing. Nevertheless, I was careful because I'm always on sequels. Would it maintain the feeling of the first movie? Could they possibly mimic the thrill and thrill of Ocean's 11's masterful assault? We will never know because they did not try. At least not as I expected. Instead, they made a light and really funny parody of the genre "heist". If you want a gripping, logical robbery, do not look at it. If you want a good laugh, with witty dialogues, quirky characters and an absolutely brilliant scene in which Julia Roberts has to embody herself, you will love Ocean's 12.
