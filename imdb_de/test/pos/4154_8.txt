The Golden Gate is the story of a Sicilian family traveling from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their native Sicily, undertake the tedious journey through the thundering seas and colonize a country whose rivers are said to flow with milk. In short, they believe their dreams of wealth will be fulfilled if they risk everything for the New World. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, smart and highly imaginative. Silver coins rain from the sky on Salvatore, as he expects how wealthy he will be in the New World. It is shown that carrots and onions that are twice as large as humans are harvested to suggest wealth and health, and streams of milk are swum in the minds of those who foresee what the New World is expecting. All of these images are surreally interwoven with the characters and help to complement the bitter realism unfolding the story for the audience. The contrast between these images and the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps to give hope when they are aboard the ship to the New World. <br /> <br /> The journey to the New World is mostly shot in total darkness when the seas storm and almost kill the people inside. The dark reality to which I have referred is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. The Old World is portrayed as something penniless and primitive. This is shown when Salvatore collapses to sell the few possessions he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) to get the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the New World. I found it quite interesting that these people believed that they had to adhere to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the New World. It almost hinted that humans had to apply a certain stereotype or form in order to be recognized as morally correct. The strongest image in the film was when the ship left its home and sailed to the New World. This shot shows a top view of a crowd that seems to be slowly separating, representing the separation between the Old and New Worlds. This shot also indicated that people were being torn away from everything that was once familiar, wanting to divorce their former dark living conditions and going into a world that was more promising. <br /> <br /> As later as the New World looks, the Old World appears dark and bleak compared to the bright but foggy New World. I found it particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty on Ellis Island was never shown through the fog, but remained hidden. I think that this was a deliberate decision that seemed to nullify the purpose of the Statute of the Statue of Liberty: "Give me your poor, your tired, your hunger" seemed to be a joke about what these people had to go through and when to arrive New world. Once they arrived in America, they would have to go through rather humiliating exams (ie delousing, math, puzzles, etc.) to prove themselves fit for the New World. These tests have completely changed the view of the Sicilian people. Salvatore's mother, in particular, had the hardest time to submit to the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more hurt than being treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World wanted was pejorative and rude. Salvatore hardly changes anything but his attitude towards what he perceived as the New World, compared to what the New World was actually disappointing for him. This attitude was shared by all who traveled with him. Her character sheets are more concerned with a cherished dream and a dark reality that needed to be accepted. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be giving a strong commentary to prepare for entry into a heavenly and civilized society. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Follow these rules to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps this is a commentary on how America has learned from the failures of other nations, and has been purposely established to ensure that these plagues have not been infested and destroyed. Although the rules were strict, they were there to protect and blossom the people.
