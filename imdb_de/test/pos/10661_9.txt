Eisenstein created the Russian montage theory, and this film is his best example. It took years for someone to use his ideas and get them working (The Limey, 1999). Nevertheless, the pram scene really shows the disconnected nature of RMT. Granted, as with most movies, it will be long in some areas, the beauty of the movie is amazing. One of the best silent movies I have ever seen.
