I did not read the novel based on The Kite Runner. My wife and daughter thought the film lags far behind the book, and I'm ready to take their word for it. But in itself the movie is good - not great, but good. How exactly does it represent the devastation caused by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? How convincing is the following intolerant Taliban regime? I would rate it at the first C + and at the second B +. Human history, the Afghan-American who has returned to save the son of his childhood mate, is well done, but it was in this context that I was told that the book was far more compelling than the film. However, the most exciting part of the film - Kabul's Dragon competitions and later a mini-contest in California - can not be achieved with the book. I would put money on it.
