I know that Chill Wills played westerns mostly endearing old varieties. But his role in this segment has been with me for a long time. Wills could be a first class villain. Yes, Burgess Meredith's case was right! That look in Hepplewhite's eyes! It expressed swine greed, ignorance and the threat of violence all at once. A pretty good performance, I think. <br /> <br /> The segment itself was also good. Question: Can not the little black bag cure alcoholism? I think it has somehow been done with case. But the doctor would have been wise to use the remedy, if he had, as soon as possible with Hepplewhite. <br /> <br /> There is a moment that is annoying but also necessary. It seems to be something that keeps coming up in these night gallery segments. It is Serling's constant need to preach. Because we have once again with Dr. Get a case. I do not know, which was more frustrating, losing the black sack and all its wonders or not stopping. Fall off the sermon about the bag's benefit to humanity as he rubs Hepplewhite's greedy face in the mud and therefore almost begs only for Hepplewhite to attack him. But as I said, it was necessary. At least it was for me. Otherwise, we would not have discussed Wills's performance above. Everything without moving a muscle or speaking a word.
