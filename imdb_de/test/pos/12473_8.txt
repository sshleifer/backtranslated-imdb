SPOILER Edgar Rice Burroughs' famous character has been adapted a thousandfold for the screen until his thirst is satisfied, especially in the 1930s and 1940s of Hollywood. Its productors made Tarzan one of the most successful cinema chefs. A few years later, Hugh Hudson opted for a more ambitious version of the ape man, and it's a more natural, savage and down-to-earth Tarzan he's revealing here. Hudson cleverly avoids the clich√©s that you usually give to Tarzan, like his famous scream or his friendly pet cheetah. Not only are we far removed from the character designed and invented by Hollwood, but also far from the film set he used to write his stories with. The film was shot partly in Africa (more precisely in Cameroon). The film introduces two obvious parts: the first to play in the jungle, where Tarzan lives among his adopted friends, the monkey, and considers himself as their master. But he ignores his true origins. The second in England, where Tarzan discovers English society. Ian Holm embodies the connection between the two parts and Hudson avoids that the film becomes ridiculous thanks to a clever script. In fact, Holm Lambert teaches basic codes of conduct to behave correctly in English society and the results work. Besides, nobody laughs about Tarzan in the second part and he is even appreciated. As for the end, it is a bitter and a happy ending. Happy because Tarzan returns to the jungle and meets his close relatives again. But also bitter, because by this homecoming, the Greystoke line is not secured and condemned to disappear ... Christophe Lambert finds here his first (and last?) Great role. Unfortunately, he will never achieve the performance of his performance in this film and he will play in bad and threadbare action movies. Still, as I said earlier, a clever script, a rare-quality performance, and stunning natural landscapes (both in the jungle and in the English countryside, and we get a beautiful movie.) It's also a great read from a popular novel, so why? only hardly rated (6/10)?
