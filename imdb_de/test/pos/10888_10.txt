They wear only the best Italian suits by Armani, sewn by hand and adjusted to your measurements. Your car is the best German engineering has to offer, and is equipped with as many equipment as horses under the hood. They are among the best polo clubs, frequent in restaurants like Spago and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. Your pocket watch also serves as a nuclear explosive, while your Trusty Pen can also be used as a semi-automatic .22 caliber. You can ski in the Alps, deep-sea scuba diving in the Caribbean, dive the skies over the Andes, and your hair is never out of place. They are Bond, James Bond, the most famous spy in the world, the beloved son of the good queen, the bad boy of the British SS and perhaps the most coveted man in the world. The character of James Bond was designed by Ian Fleming and is the most durable icon of the film industry. It is the subject of more than fifteen films from four decades. The last man to play the role is Pierce Brosnan, who took over the role of James Bond from Timothy Dalton in 1996 and made his 007 debut in Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the backdrop for the first major title Developed by a third party on the Nintendo 64. Goldeneye, developed by Rare for Nintendo, has been on the market for some time now. The continued dominance in the sales charts is just one proof of how good this game is, and without the replay library it would not be complete. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - most of the time, movies licensed by the game are flops. Although the two seem like a good mix, the results were largely dreadful. Games like Cliffhanger, True Lies, Lethal Weapon, and not to mention all the Star Trek flops are ammunition enough against this mix. And for the record, I'm not a fan of movie licensed games, especially when I saw the movie. At least that's what I thought. In the case of Goldeneye, I had more reservations than normal. Although it's not a bad movie, Goldeneye did not catch on so much, and I do not put it in the Top Ten of Bond films. Let's just say it's a completely different story. <br /> <br /> The game is a first person shooter, and to be successful you need at least as many heads as your muscles. For those who have seen the movie that I think he reads most of you, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the movie with little variety. A conspiracy has begun in the USSR to control the world's most dangerous satellite, Goldeneye, and a beautiful woman has been captured. Your missions will be many, the danger extreme. You must rely on your wits and experience to guide you through the most grueling missions the world has ever known. M will inform you as soon as you are done. Good day, James.
