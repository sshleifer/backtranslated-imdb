"Pixote: A Lei do Mais Fraco" deals with perhaps the biggest Brazilian topics: Poverty. And along with poverty, the other unnatural feelings and actions that it brings with it; Prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder. <br /> <br /> Brazil is the land of paradoxes and its social problems are everywhere. The difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; Happiness and deepest human decay. <br /> <br /> "Pixote" is one of the films that dare to touch and open these painful wounds, and does so without the slightest glimmer of hope in an honest depiction of a land that, like Pixote itself, already does is lost.
