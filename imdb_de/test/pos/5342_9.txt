Wallace & Gromit have been around for a while, but this was the first push on the screen. Fans of the British television series, like me, wanted to see them, and the movie was doing quite well in the cinemas. The reason is that the movie is fun and very original. In a world of CG movies like SHREK and TOY STORY, this stop-motion movie is a great alternative to the trend in children's films and also totally different from a cartoon. Compared to many previous stop-motion movies (like KING KONG and the Ray Harryhausen movies like SINBAD), the quality and movement of the characters are light years better - they look very fluid, natural and alive. <Br /> <br /> Apart from the quality of the animation, this movie deserves Kudos on every level as well. First, the speakers do a good job. Secondly, the script is very simple, but also very sweet and enjoyable - with a few twofold intentions that are likely to transcend the head of the children. Third, not only do they make a movie for children, but for people of all ages, because the film is neither saccharine nor directed at the younger crowd. I was particularly fascinated by the incredibly cute movie - and especially the adorable rabbits. I especially liked her in the credits - which made me very happy that I saw the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The end result is, unless you are a real thug, you will enjoy this movie. It's fresh, funny and surprisingly smart. I hope we see a sequel - and that says something, because I usually hate sequels.
