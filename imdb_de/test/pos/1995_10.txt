Everyone seems to compare that to The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I saw it for the first time, I would have agreed - I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed. But on repeated visits, my respect for this film has grown immensely. <br /> <br /> The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is ​​a great action movie in which some philosophical mumbo jumbos are thrown in. The 13th floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo jumbos. Existence is not an action movie at all, and it is (as many seem to believe) "reality" or such a "deep" concept. It is about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial world (both in its origin and in its behavior). <br /> <br /> The coolest moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats it. "scripted" line. At this point, you realize that people in the game have voluntarily given up their free will to participate in a story. This gets even more frightening when D'Arcy Nader (or rather his player) comments on the possibility of spending his life in the game. I fully sympathize with the "realistic" philosophy that providing interesting worlds in which people simply find the right predefined way to the ultimate goal is ultimately a recipe for soulless existence. Living in the game is not alive at all, but it's a tempting way to spend your time on Earth. Allegra comments on the real world: "There's nothing going on here." Could also dive into someone else's imagination and pretend to do something interesting. (Though I must ask if Cronenberg considers this an indictment, bearing in mind that he himself offers worlds that can be experienced in 90-minute snippets.) <br /> <br /> Leaving the theater after I've seen this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of those movies that could only be viewed to see how it ended. But after I've seen it a few times (thanks SciFi channel), I've realized how much deeper it is. Seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves another consideration.
