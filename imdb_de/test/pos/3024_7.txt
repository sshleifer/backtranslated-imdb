I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was released and it looked pretty cool. I never had a chance to see it. When I went to Blockbuster to borrow some videos, I thought I should watch it. After all, I loved "Silence of the Lambs" and "Se7en," and if you like those movies, you could kick The Cell. The whole story concept is very interesting. I can not imagine in which world they live. The acting is actually pretty decent. Jennifer Lopez is the only one I have to say that was not great, but she does a credible job. I would recommend for a scary thriller. <br /> <br /> 7/10
