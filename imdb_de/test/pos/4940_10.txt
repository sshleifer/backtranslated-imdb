It just started on TV when I opened it, and when I felt too lazy to change channels, I finally looked at it. Man was so happy. <br /> <br /> This movie is more of a fairy tale than a demanding drama and sometimes openly sentimental. It's definitely what could be described as a feel-good movie, and I usually find such films boring or irritating. Still, this movie is so well done that I could not help but love it. The script will not twist your brain; it is conventional but flawless. The actors are brilliant, everyone fits perfectly in the role. There is not much of a score, but the pieces of music improve the movie in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate things other than expensive pyrotechnics, vicious murders, or saving the world in a movie, take a look at this, you've got a chance 5/5
