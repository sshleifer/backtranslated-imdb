On the success of "Rebel Without A Cause" was a tidal wave of "teen" films. This is probably one of the best. A very young McArthur stands out as a not really worrisome teenager. The story focuses more on the perception of delinquency than on any traumatic event. The side cast is memorable, Frankenheimer conducts like an old pro. Just a story of a young man who advocates that he takes his actions far too seriously.
