First of all, to borrow or watch this movie, you expect something in the field of B-horror. What this film delivers to the astute fan of this genre is a pretty funny gimmick with a Nordic flair. Sometimes I remembered the humor of Jackson's Dead Alive and others in a film by Stuart Gordon. This little find should giggle the most. <br /> <br /> The f / x reaches some heights of truly scary (the first time Ed meets his nemesis), but generally has the feeling that this film was put together by an af / x team that has opted for All props from other films ... Gremlins, Devils, Slasher movies, etc. have worked very well and worked through hallucinations. <br /> <br /> The jewel of the movie is the humor. The Gore works mostly, but more laughs. In his heart it is a parody and a funny one.
