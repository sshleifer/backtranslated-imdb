My girls 4 and 6 love this show. We've stumbled across a PBS station, and they always ask when it's about to happen. It reminds her of her grandmother, who takes care of her every day during the summer. It's also funny and sometimes they can not stop talking about one or the other scene. I would definitely recommend this show to all young children. It is very clean and shows you how to slow down and not watch TV all day long. When Nana reads a story, she is slow and she talks to Mona about each page. It reminds me to slow down when I read the next book to my girls at bedtime and talk about the book instead of going through it quickly just to fall asleep.
