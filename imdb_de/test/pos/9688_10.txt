This movie was the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life. I laughed so much that I almost puked. After the movie was finished, I laughed for about an hour as I thought about the last thing in the movie. It's definitely 100 times better than the first Jackass movie. I loved to see everyone together again. If you are squeamish or do not like a slippery childish humor, you will not like this movie. If you are open-minded and do not take it so seriously, you will laugh at your ass. It's amazing that no one was killed in this movie. Everyone seen in this movie is so original and different from the next, that you do not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> Mike Webber
