The word "impossible" has led many to choose a particular point of view for each incredible task. In 1927, it was believed that nobody could breathe the Atlantic. Many had tried but failed and some even gave their lives for the effort. However, it had to be done because every challenge has to be tackled with equal determination. This is the heart of the film "The Spirit of St. Louis". The actor selected for this historic film is none other than American James Stewart, who plays convincingly to Charles Lindbergh. Although there are many facets to Lindbergh's life, the segment presented here aspires to be the first man to fly across the Atlantic. The story is interesting and compelling for fans of stewards to say the least. He was looking for enough money to build a special plane, and the fateful decision to start the journey on a bleak day in May 1927 was enduring "Luck Lindy" when he was baptized, huge risks shown in this great movie , Other well-known personalities who have credited this film are Murray Hamilton playing Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson as Ben Mahoney, Arthur Space and Charles Watts as O.W. Schultz. The sum of this now famous movie is that he has become a classic in spite of his bad sayings on his debut. Well done! ****
