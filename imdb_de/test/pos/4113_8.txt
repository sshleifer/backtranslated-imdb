While the songs and dance numbers in general are not as strong as many would be, the film's story and message are still there and sound loud above the simple 70s. <br /> <br /> Considering that this movie was made when the Hollywood musical was almost extinct (with rare exceptions being rock musicals), the viewers who considered it new did not appreciate the fact courageous attempt to do something that had not happened before. Viewers who see it today will tend to judge it with the movies and musicals of today and perhaps with the huge all-star casts of musicals that have passed. But dealing with this movie is an injustice to the movie itself. <br /> <br /> There are some good musical moments in the movie. The first is that of Bobby Van. Mr. Van took up his role as Harry Lovett shortly after completing a two-year (best actor) run of the Broadway revival "No, No, Nanette." He is a singer-songwriter from the past and frankly the only one in the cast who was really talented and experienced for musicals. He never misses a step in his "Question Me An Answer" and rightly so ... he was like Harry at home. More pleasing numbers come from Olivia Hussey, as she welcomes the new visitors. While the lyrics are weak, James Shigeta shows his strong voice in the "Family" song as well as a successful staging of the entire piece. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie as it is ... a fantasy about a place where you will never grow old, tucked away in the ice and snow-capped mountains of Tibet, by a group of unsuspecting people modern people who are located in the city dispute a modern culture. Take this and compare it to reality, and you get a movie that misses a target. But ... take this movie for the message of Love and Peace and Silence and Brotherly Love and you will receive a warm and refreshing message and a positive message about it. <br /> <br /> For some, this movie may seem a bit crazy to others a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of reality. At first try not to judge and just enjoy the message. Second, you have discovered the secret of Shangri-La!
