This film was clearly an early attempt for a new director, but he managed to be original and entertaining, and at times to make him think. However, I must say that without the outstanding performance of Paul Anthony as Pip, the story would not have been so good. He made the well-written parts very credible and influencing and the weaker parts more bearable. I also have to mention the performance of Alan Cumming. It was refreshing to see him in such a part. He attached importance to his role, which gave the film a very fundamental element. Paul Anthony: Who is this guy? Why did not I see him anymore? Someone please give him more roles!
