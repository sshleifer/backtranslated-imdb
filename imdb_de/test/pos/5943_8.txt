What a pleasure. This is really a parody. Only French people can do such a thing without being rude. And as a result you spend a really good time watching Jean Dujardin stupidly. Most of the movie is on his shoulders and he has it wide enough to make up for this movie. He has the perfect way to exaggerate the James Bond guy that he is no match for Mike Meyers in Austin Powers. The dialogues are also good enough to hold the viewer's attention, with lots of stupid jokes that are really perfect. Both women, who have the lead roles in the film, bear comparison with the main character, and that was a challenge. There is no real action in this film, but that is not expected in this kind of movie. They just want to laugh for an hour and 40 minutes, and that's exactly what the movie does. It deserves the success that it has in France
