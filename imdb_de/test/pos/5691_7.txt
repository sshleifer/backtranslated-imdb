This low-cost crocodile film really delivers the goods. The fact that it was inspired by real events would mean little if you were using a fake-looking crocodile, a bad C.G.I. Fortunately, nothing is affected by this great, very realistic movie. The crocodile is real, there is no C.G.I. and filming takes place in a real Australian swamp. The actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances, and they succeed. They can embark on their plight, which proves how "Black Water" is realistically translated as entertainment. Highly recommended. - MERK
