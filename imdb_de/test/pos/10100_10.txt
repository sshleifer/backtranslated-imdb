Many horror fans complain that the horror has hardly progressed in the last twenty years. I agreed until the influx of Asian horror movies arrived, a trend that has admittedly become boring. However, it has produced some real classics, and for me A Tale Of Two Sisters is at least an extraordinary piece of cinema and perhaps the best horror movie in a long time. <br /> <br /> It is vaguely based on a Korean fairy tale and tells the sad story of two deranged sisters living with their father and stepmother. After having problems at home the first night, they decided to stick together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship. The tension increases and there is the inevitable cracking. What happens after that, however, requires more than a pair of eyes as the story makes several turns and the horrors become more emotional and real. In the end, you may need a few moments to absorb everything and put it in your head, but it is this combination of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of those genres and makes it a classic. To see one again and again, if only to clarify everything.
