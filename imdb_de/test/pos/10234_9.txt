Author / screenwriter / director Clive Barker, who adapted his own novel "Cabal" for the screen, developed this wonderful story of horror and fantasy. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man suspected of being a serial killer. The cops shoot him down in front of Midian, on the surface a cemetery, but actually a haven for monsters, which were shunned by society. Appealing to Boone and making him one of their own has an impact on everyone, including Boone's sweet-toothed friend (the very sweet Anne Bobby) and the dubious psychiatrist (a very pleasant David Cronenberg). <br /> <br /> "Nightbreed" shows the wild and twisted fantasy that I do not often see in movies. Firstly, Ralph McQuarrie, an old concept-art hare who has worked on films such as the first three "Star Wars" entries, is helping Barker create excellent visuals for "Nightbreed," starting with the opening credit sequence. The visual and make-up effects are elaborate and the production design and cinematography are impressive. Barker and crew do a wonderful job to create this whole other world with captivating characters. It's a colorful and extravagant entertainment and pleasure to take in. Of course, there is also a strong sense of social commentary on intolerance and bigotry, not to mention the serious consequences that can result from a person's actions. <br /> <br /> Great supportive services contribute to the fun. Cronenberg launches a lot of malicious intent and is a real gas as a bad doctor, while Charles Haid is a fine hate-love antagonist, a pretty nasty police captain. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley is buried as a tired Lylesberg again under strong make-up and is as solid as a rock. Hugh Ross is great fun as Narcisse, as well as Catherine Chevalier as Rachel (as an added bonus she blows her breasts in a sequence). Also Simon Bamford, who played the "Butterball Cenobite" in the first two "Hellraiser" pictures, appears here. There is even a cool cameo by John Agar, a sci-fi star of the 50s and 60s. Danny Elfman delivers another of his fantastic results, and Barker leads us steadily through the fascinating story of a fulminant apocalyptic showdown. <br /> "Nightbreed" is an outstanding genre movie that's worth it for anyone who does has not seen, take a look at it. I recommend a heartfelt recommendation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
