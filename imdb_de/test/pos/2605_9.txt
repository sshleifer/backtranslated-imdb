I have to admit that this is one of the few Lou Costello films that I actually saw in the theater. Most have now been seen on TV and I have to admit that Lou is really fun and he also gets the girl. This was the first time I performed Dorothy Provine and of course I fell in love with her like many others that day. I have seen most of the work she has done and enjoyed each and every one of them. Your performance in The Great Race is one of the reasons I bought the CD! <br /> <br /> Any comment on this movie says that this is the movie that Lou Costello did without Bud Abbott is true, but if Lou had lived, he would have done much more. He really does a good job and does not have to rely on his old routines to laugh. I'm sorry that the little man from Patterson, N.J. I did not get the chance. <br /> <br /> I hope this will be on DVD for a while, so I can add it to my comedy / sci-fi collection.
