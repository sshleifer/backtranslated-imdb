First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby. Although I found the rugby aspect of this film interesting, it could have been any sport, and I think I would have enjoyed it as well. The fact that it was not just about rugby did not make it any better or worse for me. <br /> <br /> What made this movie great is the story itself, based on the actual events that have occurred in the past 30 years the Highland Rugby Club. Coach Gelwix is ​​the type of coach most parents enjoy for their children, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and lost only 9 games in over 30 years!). ). The more I have learned about the coach and the team, the more I like this movie and its message. <br /> <br /> I saw other sports movies that seemed great at first, but then I just looked for details to find out. Most of these films were 10% facts and 90% fictions the 10% of the facts were greatly exaggerated. Not so with Forever Strong. It may be too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing. If it were a fiction, it would only be a happy story and nothing more. Instead, the movie is inspirational and lets you be a better person. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie as it is rated negative by some critics. I have read some of their reviews and most of them have given the film terrible reviews. These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate. In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the film good reviews, because I almost always disagree with their opinions. <br /> <br /> Go to this movie and write your review (positive or negative)! Currently, most audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar websites), and I'm curious if this trend will continue. Many Thanks!
