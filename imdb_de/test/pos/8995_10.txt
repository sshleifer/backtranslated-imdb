My family really enjoyed this movie. What Rugby's movie will do in the US ... Well, I'm sure that's going to be questionable. But I and others around me know that after the movie, we were more curious about the sport, and personally, I gained more respect for the game. You may be wondering how this is possible, especially as the movie does not immerse and explain rugby. But the simple fact is that it drew you into the players and emotions of the game and of life. The movie was both inspiring and entertaining. It made us laugh and cry. The chemistry between Sean Astin, Big Budah and Sean Faris worked well. Some may think the movie is a little cliché, but I sincerely hope Hollywood made more films like this. I could not help but draw analogies of the game and the life struggles. In the end, I saw myself in my life to see what I needed to do better to be the best person I could be. Honestly, I was grateful that this film taught morality, values ​​and teamwork, there is so much opposite. After watching, I really hope that my children will be trained by someone who has a philosophy like Coach Gelwix.
