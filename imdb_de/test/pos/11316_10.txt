Dirty War is absolutely one of the best political, state and credited TV dramas in the 25 years. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is outstanding, the writing is spectacular. <br /> <br /> Diry War shows the true side of why we are not prepared to respond here on American soil to a nuclear, biological and radiological terrorist attack. <br /> <br /> Dirty War should become a big movie - so good! I can recommend this great drama to anyone who wants to know the truth. <br /> <br /> This TV drama reveals how the British secret service (MI5 & MI6) is trying to expose a terrorist conspiracy and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims of England's involvement in the Iraq war. <br /> <br /> The scenes in different parts of London, England, are also spectacular. <br /> <br /> Dirty War is a must !!!
