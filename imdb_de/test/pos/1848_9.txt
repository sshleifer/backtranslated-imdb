I saw this movie again yesterday with a 20 year old intern from my office (OK - it was the quiet day after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique conspiracy, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer and the way the dog is waiting at the door. Does not everyone belong to us like this dog after someone dies whom we love? <br /> <br /> I also love the old people in the restaurant. where your ethnic group is a very important topic. And I love the wedding in the end. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is great in this movie - and Bonnie Hunt should have gotten a prize for everything. <br /> <br /> Bonnie - make more movies!
