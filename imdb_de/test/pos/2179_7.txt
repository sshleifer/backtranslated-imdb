Well, I've just seen Buster Keaton's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy and - despite the harsh way it all seems to happen for almost no logical reason - I found a lot to laugh about. When Buster orders Butcher molasses from Fatty, Fatty brings Buster back to pay. Buster says he put it in the bucket where the molasses is. Fatty tries to remove it while the molasses falls to the floor. Buster is now sitting on the floor and so on. It probably was not funny, but it was funny on the screen, more slapstick, flour thrown, and a later sequence that took place at the boarding school of Fatty's friend. Fatty got dressed and Buster helped Fatty's rival pull as well. As I said, many scenes do not make sense, but the visuals, especially those of Arbuckle and Keaton, are still laughing today. Recommended ad for Keaton Completeists.
