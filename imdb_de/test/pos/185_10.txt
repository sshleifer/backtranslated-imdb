If you believe that every war film can really feel the war, you have to see "Letyat zhuravli" (English: "The Cranes fly"). It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), who are in love on the brink of World War II. They walk along the shore and watch the cranes fly by when the war starts. Boris is immediately sent to war. Veronika hides with a family and marries the son she does not love. Boris trudges through the countryside, fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war until he runs out of energy. When Veronika, who works in a military hospital, receives this message, she refuses to accept it until Boris' body comes home in one of the trains. At the same time, the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and the Allies have won the war. The Soviet Union has lost 27 million inhabitants, but it is the beginning of a new era. <br /> <br /> This film has done a great job showing the human impact of the war not only on the battlefield, but also how it has affected the civilian population. This is definitely a movie everyone should see.
