This short topic collected kudos from all sorts of places for his plea for religious toleration. <br /> <br /> After a session in a recording studio, Frank Sinatra leaves a group of children who have beaten another because he was Jewish. He was holding it forward, with only an American icon able to explain the importance of prejudice and what we had been fighting for against the Nazis. The meaning could not be clearer. <br /> <br /> Both songs of this short theme have been recorded and widely sold for Columbia records. But if you're a dream and the song that was written for the movie, The House I Live In. The latter is one of the best songs about an idealized version of America that we would all strive for. Sinatra did The House I Live In during the Sixties for a joint album recorded for his reprise record label. The album is now a rarity and should not be. His co-workers were Bing Crosby and Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians with the orchestra conducted by Nelson Riddle. Axel Stordahl was the principal conductor and arranger of Sinatra in the 1940s. When he died, this position eventually fell to Nelson Riddle. Stordahl plays the Orchestration for the short and Columbia records, Riddle for the reprise album. <br /> <br /> Sinatra connoisseurs and others should listen back to back and compare. And start this valuable film whenever it is shown.
