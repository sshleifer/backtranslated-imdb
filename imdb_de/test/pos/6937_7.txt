"You can not take it realistically." Sheets <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2 (ZB2) is a world apart. I've never seen anything like it. The only thing I can think of to compare is Psychedelics. Excuse the stereotype? I do not just mean that it's incoherent and absurd, even if it happens on occasion. I mean, it takes you through such a wide range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions that you get overwhelmed so quickly, and when it's over, you'll find that everything happened while you sat on the couch. > It's worth noting that it's an extremely cheap budget, as a disclaimer for those who, after seeing "Shaun of the Dead", consider themselves fans of underground zombie movies. It is also noteworthy that it is much more "brutal" than one would expect. Children are undressed and someone mocks a young girl before he shoots her in the groin. Her body is then "raped". These are certainly no shortcomings, and I believe this is thanks to the film. But if it does not sound like your kind of movie, do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> (I do not mean to exaggerate in terms of brutality "Inside" or anything.) I'm reluctant to give away any of the plot because it's really full of surprises, even the opening scene, which has nothing to do with zombies is also a classic horror scene and something very original. <br/> <br/> Man, I'm three paragraphs in it and hardly said anything, I thought the movie was great: 1. He is big and keeps going, and at one point you expect it to become another NotLD clone, a board-up-the-windows movie where everyone is in a farmhouse arguing with each other until the end of the movie the farmhouse scenes are a distant dream, however, and there are a number of outdoor urban scenes that are rare in low-budget zombie movies. <br /> <br /> 2. Make-up is much better than ZB1 More convincing and creative Somewhat funny: The early zombies really look lame Half way, they suddenly look very good, with dentures and everything. Some of them look like fulci zombies, others are reminiscent of Mr. Tongue of the "Day of the Dead". And there are big scenes with dozens of zombies moving around. Never gets old. <br /> <br /> 3. It's a bit strange emotionally. A character claims that the sky exists and that our dead / undead protagonists are now in heaven. In the context of the film, we believe that it is true. Although the characters behave with the typical stupidity of the horror movie, they really seem to be interested in each other, and I took care of them accordingly. <br /> <br /> 4. The pace is great. There is hardly a boring moment. <br /> <br /> My only observation that borders on criticism is that Todd Sheets finds the most bizarre dialogue I've ever heard. I personally feel that it contributes to this experience, but I do not think he does it on purpose, so I can not give the film the right rating. (Example: When a car breaks down, the owner shouts at the passengers, then says something in effect: "I'm sorry, I yelled at you, you do not know what it's like when your dad is over you Razor, when you're five years old. "Wtf?) In the end, it will be more than I can handle. Participate in a montage with Bill Clinton and a few sermons explaining the zombie metaphor. At that time, I had really relived my drug experience. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10.7.
