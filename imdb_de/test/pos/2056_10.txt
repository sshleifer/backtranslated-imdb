I've probably seen this movie a dozen times since it was originally theatrically released. Anyone who calls this film garbage or horrible, just does not understand action movies or recognize good movies. For some incidents and results that may seem far-fetched, but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon / Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) has created one of the most thought-out action adventures you will ever encounter. Up or not, this film flows like a clockwork and the action keeps coming back. The final action sequence is one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. The cast in this movie crackles. Genna Davis did a tremendous job and it's a damn shame there was never a "LKG" episode. Samuel L. Jackson is weird when her buddy Mitch looks at his private eye to help her discover her lost past and earn a few dollars. If I'm confused, how could someone not like this movie? It packs so many thrills and it's so funny. The Wisecracks in this movie make me laugh just as hard 10 years later. In my opinion, the first Matrix movie and the Long Kiss Goodnight 2 were the best and most original action flicks of the 90s. By the way, Shane Black had made a fortune selling this script. At the time it was the best-selling screenplay and it's worth every penny. It is so sad that the audience never gave this film a chance, seeing Renny Harlin's best movie and Genna Davis as you have never seen before. Long live "The Long Kiss Goodnight" !!
