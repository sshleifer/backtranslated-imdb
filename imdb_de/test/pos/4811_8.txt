I recently saw Anzhan. Not because it was a Hong Kong movie, but because I was looking for a change from the films produced here in the US. In my humble opinion, the film could easily compete with the action thrillers produced here, with the exception of the traditional idiocyncracies of the Hong Kong movie. The one who still bothers me was the chief inspector. I still do not understand why there must be a completely idiot-comic-like relief figure in the serious films coming from Hong Kong, but I can live with it when the movie is so good. The characters are believable, even if the situations they are in are not. The story is fast and really attracts you. The real Cincher scenes were for me the two bus rides that the thief character takes. Overall, a really solid movie.
