The biggest Tarzan ever! This movie is shot in a way that no other Tarzan ever came close to. It contains everything you would expect in a Tarzan movie. No other Tarzan movie has depicted the character so well. I would say if you saw a Tarzan movie and liked it, you should see it, you will love it, and if you have never seen Tarzan, you should see it and forget the rest.
