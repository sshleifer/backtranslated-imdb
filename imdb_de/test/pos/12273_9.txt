"Zen and the Art of Lanscaping," written and directed by David Kartch, is a short film about a young man named David (his friends call him Zen) and what happens on a strange day in his life. Zen works as a lanscaper for a middle-class family. The housewife tries to make Zen cheat on her husband. Unfortunately, her son is replacing her husband. From this point on, the movie begins to go through many revelations between the characters, along with the possible involvement of the houseman. "Zen and the art of landscaping" is funny, clever and overall very well written. The comic timing of the actors is also very strong. It's a fun, easy movie that I strongly recommend.
