This movie is the most impressive Turkish movie I have ever seen. "Okul" is probably the first Turkish horror movie. I have to say that for some reason I got excited while watching the movie. The first reason is that the story is impressive. I mean, at the end of the movie, you've seen all the details about the movie. Another reason is that no Turkish man has made such a movie before. This shows that the Turkish film is improving over time. Although it was the first attempt to make a horror movie, it was really successful. I advise you all, not to miss this movie ...
