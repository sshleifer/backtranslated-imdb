Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who defines the word "dreamer" and her solemn, pragmatic daughter. Adele, who wants to make a fresh start in a big city, moves her from Wisconsin to California. <br /> <br /> Decent, if not exceptional or memorable, with some serious and sad moments. It expresses some emotional buttons, that's for sure. The best it offers is a solid cast, and Sarandon and Portman are pretty good in the lead role - even if their characters are sometimes one-dimensional. > <br /> I gave this seven out of ten points.
