This movie had some very funny moments. The above-mentioned bad sketch for the beginning. <br /> <br /> The places where Rik tries to act dignifiedly in front of his guests and looks down at them through his nose. Very subtle, especially because the guest himself was a toffee-nosed adulterer. <br /> <br /> The scene where Rik learns that Gina has a fianc√©: "Ahhh, she's been tricking me all the time, the brazen Huss." with his 2 candle eyes. As if she really liked him. But he believed it. That's why it was so funny. Great moment. <br /> <br /> Gino was also excellent. He should have used more than the bad man. "Where are the whores I ordered?" he roars. Brilliant stuff.
