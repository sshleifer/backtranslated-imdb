This is a haunting piece of work. It's only ten minutes long, but I'd rather spend ten dollars going to the cinema to see this than watch a full-length movie that's making the rounds. It's a simple piece of a man who thinks. A young man arrived at this place and was fascinated by a room and the music that came out of it ... and now he sits and dies in his old age in this place that he so lovingly associates with his youth. The music is brilliant, the guitars have this jazz room like Neil Young's music in the dead. If you have the chance, watch this movie. It is worth it .. If Rutger Hauer did more films like this, I think he would get more respect than he gets. Sure, that's not what Rutger wants to remember as an actor. He has also directed this film, so he shows he is a very artistic actor / director I hope to see more of this Rutger Hauer, as he is one of my favorite actors.
