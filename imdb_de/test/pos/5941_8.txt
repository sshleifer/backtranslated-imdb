Granted, there are some scenes in this film that seem a bit unrealistic. The gorgeous woman first panics and then, minutes later, she starts to kiss the young guy while the old man is right next to her. But as the movie continues, we learn she's a fugitive girl (or a slut), and that explains her behavior in part. The cinematography of this movie is well done. We can see the elevator from almost all angles and perspectives, and some of these images and scenes really increase the tension. GÃ¶tz George plays his character well, a would-be hot shot that gets old and is overpowered by young men like the Jaennicke character. Wolfgang Kieling, whom I admired in Hitchcock's THE TORN CURTAIN, delivers a great performance that, while not saying much, is by far the best actor in this piece. One critic complained about how unrealistic the movie was and that in the worst case, nothing would really happen. But how realistic are films like Mission impossible or telephone booths? Considering the fact that we are talking about a movie here, and that in a movie you are always dealing with scenes that are unlikely in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. It's a lot better than many things I see on German television these days, and I think the 80's vintage style has added something to that movie.
