A Respectable Royal Rummage Event 1. Edge Vs Shawn Michaels 7.5 / 10 7.5 / 10 A very strong opener ... Edge's heel performance was as great as it was during the Rumble event. All in all, say EDGES NIGHT .... <br /> <br /> 2nd Undertaker vs Heidenreich CASKET MATCH <br /> <br /> 7/10 Many people hated this rivalry, although I liked them. I thought Heidenreich played his character really well. The game was not amazing in the excitement until Kane and Snitcky get involved. It gets even better. <br /> <br /> 3. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. JBL (WWE CHAMP) WWE TITLE MATCH <br /> 7.5 / 10 a surprisingly good game as there was only one really exciting ringtone ... of course ... ..very good title match ..good pace .. though a predictable ending. But not all royal rumblings are predictable. <br /> <br /> 4. Triple H (WORLD TITLE) vs. Randy Orton WORLD TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 Not that good for the guys involved, too many dry spots, orton Amazingly sold his concussion, but ended up with something of an anti-climax. <br /> <br /> 5. ROYAL RUMBLE EVENT ... by the way, there were a few segments during the other games ... two that were really cool ... Cena rapping on Christian and Guerrero, who got the ticket number 30 steal. The event was good. 7/10 would have won a 9 if cena had won, but unfortunately my biggest enemy is batista (THOUGH I UNDERSTATUS WHY). Then a drop comes down and takes a drop, and the whole arena breaks out in laughter.
