"Witchery" is a decent little Euro Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is damn funny in this movie and he is one of the better actors. Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife ... she's weirdly bad! The plot of this movie is also ridiculous. It has some holes that you can not help but notice, but it remains entertaining throughout. <br /> <br /> The story in "Witchery" is extraordinary. I loved the part where the old bag is "sucked" into the garbage chute and ends in the chimney for frying! And the part in which the lady was "exploited" by the devil was damn disturbing. I would say that this is a must for Gorehounds. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an overproduced, well-functioning movie, look elsewhere. However, if you like Italian sleaze in the old school style and go overboard, then "Witchery" is on your shelf. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the low rating! What do you expect people to do? "The exorcist?" 7 out of 10 children.
