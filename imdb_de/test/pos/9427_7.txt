Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) are fighting for control of the Switz inventor's latest bomb sighting creation. Holmes wants to secure it for the British, while Moriarty is not sold through the Nazis. <br /> <br /> While many fans will undoubtedly be disappointed when Holmes is updated to the 1940s wartime, this movie proves carefree fun that does not indulge in war propaganda, as it might have. Dennis Hoeys Inspector Lestrade and Nigel Bruce's Dr. Watson tend to steal the show because their characters are always hilarious with their hectic methods. The sparring between Holmes and Moriraty is colorful and thoughtful. Atwill is good enough as Moriarty, even if he is not as memorable as others who played the part. <br /> <br /> While this does not add anything new or exciting to the fans of the series, it's a wonderful escape from reality that I believe is appropriate for 1942 and that reflects many of the 1930s and 1940s movie serial adventures offers a more compact, less repetitive presentation. All while remaining true to the spirit of Sherlock Holmes.
