Time is doing extraordinary things. It is the ultimate judge. Time has given "Married To The Mob" an extra dose of freshness. There are no dead moments or cheap shots. It is now more joy than ever. Michelle Pfeiffer creates a mafia widow who is as far removed from a cartoon as anything she has ever done. A true original creation that touches or alludes to the stereotype just to guide us through it, but its Angela is unique. The legendary Dean Stockwell presents us a mafia boss who is just as threatening real as he is funny. And Matthew Modine? Why did I think back then that he had no chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was wrong. They are wonderful together. They reminded me this time of Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray of "Remember The Night". I'm writing this comment now to lure you to this Jonathan Demme gem.
