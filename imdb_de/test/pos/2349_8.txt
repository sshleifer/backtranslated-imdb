Naruto, the Anime TV series, has produced two movies so far, and a third one is coming this summer. <br /> <br /> The first one, released in the summer of '04, was an entertaining adventure with the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, you have to be a blind, deaf and one-legged chicken to deny the flaws of the movie. While the first was definitely enjoyable, there were many things that could be improved. Naruto Movie 2, however, picks up all these aspects and stands out. <br /> <br /> The action was incredibly cinematic. The lighting, the setting and the style were three times as effective as in the first film. At first we got basic action, well animated and choreographed animation, but nothing special. The cinematography of this film was extraordinary. The combination of shadows and lighting to make the action even more intense was very effective and added combat power. <br /> <br /> The entertainment was very good. It rivaled Disney. However, since this is a movie about TV characters, the character design or detail of the characters was not exceptional. The animation, however, was incredibly fluid and realistic. I think they even needed twice as much cels for every second, because the animation was totally restless and incredibly fluid. <br /> <br /> The music ... I think that's where this movie fails. The original composer / conductor of the TV show was used for the film, and I do not really feel that he did a good job. The music usually reminded me of many pieces used in old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the synthesizers used for the film did not convey the melody very well. However, they did not fail in the film and added a good accompaniment to the action. However, apart from a few violin and string instruments at the end and some choral work, the music surpassed no limits or acted as something special. <br /> <br /> The story was fun. It was a fairly typical storyline for Naruto and was very similar to the first films, except that everything that was wrong with the story of the first film was taken back and improved. The characters were much more interesting and the story's progress made me watch the whole movie. It kept you thinking that the movie was about to end every second, but then it would go on, but instead of feeling undressed, action and characters all felt fresh and exciting. All in all, this movie is a good evening, but as good as it gets, it's definitely one for the fans. I enjoyed the movie, but that's because ... I'm a fan! But I can see, just like Final Fantasy's Advent children, that it's not a movie, it's just a fabulous fan service for an hour and a half. Although I think this movie is a good introduction to the series for current non-observers, it will not have a full effect on anyone else who does not stick to Naruto screens. Despite all this, it was a fun movie to enjoy in this depressing phase of stuffing fillers.
