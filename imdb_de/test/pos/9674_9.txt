This is a great show that makes me wonder why it was so often blown up. But I think it is now here to stay! This show can not be compared to any other. Before Simpsons was pretty "on the edge" and then came Family Guy, and they extend it to go from the "edge". The things this show brings are incredible. Perfect the clock! If you like the Simpsons, you will love family!
