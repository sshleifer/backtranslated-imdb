The little Dieter Needs To Fly is another remarkable film of Werner Herzog's film work, which has no equal. Recently re-released on DVD nearly a decade after its first release in the US in 1997, it has lost none of its power. You can see its impact on documentaries that are as diverse as Duke's own Grizzly Man and Errol Morris' The Academy of War. Like the former, it describes the life of an interesting American in its far too short 74 minutes. Like the latter, there is a view of a war side that few see. Yes, we see violence and heroism, but when the fog of war has brought us to the head of one of the leading warmongers of the last century, this film allows us to see the life of a grunt captured and tortured by the enemy , and finally triumphs. Apart from the form and the form, the film is neither simple nor optimistic as my short description. Even the little Dieter Needs To Fly, Dieter Dengler, and the German immigrant who survived the attacks of the National Socialists are not affected (we learn, for example, that his grandfather in his hometown Wildburg in the Black Forest was the only man to vote for Hitler and to suffer brutally for this point of view) Germany after the Second World War and its own detention by the Viet Cong when its air force jet was shot down on Laos on 1 February 1966. While the title of the film and the idea of ​​Dengler's passion to become a pilot are troubled by the impression Allied fighters made on him when they destroyed his city as a kid, they believe Dengler is the film's central theme , that is not true. The theme is the survival of Dengler or, more precisely, his human will, all human will. The details of Dengler's romantic life are too Hollywood and a quiet aspect to interest Duke. Nor is it the fact that he has a Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, the D.F.C. and the Navy Cross won. What made Dengler survive so much and remain a relatively optimistic man (though dark sides are visible) is what's central to this film, and all of Duke's canon. Duke Country's Dieter Dengler's 'distant barbaric dream' of his past is fully developed, and the use of a Malagasy vocal, Oay Lahy E, in many of the jungle scenes, along with other outstanding touches in the score, shows that Duke perhaps only shows something beside Martin, Scorsese, the best manipulator for image and music in the film. Long may he merge!
