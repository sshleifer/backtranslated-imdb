Right after the first gangster movies Warner produced in the same year, Little Caesar (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931), this gangster movie is one of the better efforts I've ever seen. Although not quite in the same league as the aforementioned classics, it has a strong performance by young Sylvia Sidney. She's great and delivers her lines more naturally than anybody else. Gary Cooper is better at this stage in his phase than usual career and shows signs of what would follow in the next few years as he rose to the top. The film has some intriguing villains in Paul Lukas (he has never seen him so detestable) and Guy Kibbee (what a shock when he plays Hoodlum). The direction of Rouben Mamoulian is very resourceful, probably the first commentary that shows people appearing thoughts in this movie. If you get the chance to see this little gangster strip, do not miss the chance.
