I love action / adventure movies and that's one of the best. Of course we love the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest, but it's the story that really counts. The best are reasonably feasible, but we can tolerate those who are a bit 'exaggerated', like comics. The more twists and turns, the worse situations are the heroes and the more shocking are the moments in the film. The more action / adventure fans enjoy them. "In the Line of Fire" has ALL the elements that get carried away for an action thriller. It has Clint Eastwood as a near-retired intelligence agent whose only bad moment of failure haunts him. It has one of the meanest, despicable, craziest villains in John Malkovich, the guy you can not wait to see him get "his right." It has Rene Russo as a "love interest". It has twists and turns, an occasional shock and even a hint of warmth and humor. It is played extremely well by director Wolfgang Petersen and even has a score by the great Ennio Morricone. This is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller! Do not miss it!
