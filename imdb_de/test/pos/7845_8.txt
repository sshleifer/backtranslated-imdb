The Beguiled is one of the under-represented films in the career of a director and / or actor, who in the end plays better than expected. In the same year that Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel worked with Dirty Harry, they also worked together on this little psycho-sexual drama that takes place in the Confederate Civil War era. It's almost 180 of what "Harry" had for the audience. Here's a movie that's under the radar and low budget for almost no business compared to what Dirty Harry pulled into it. It is also a story in which Eastwood is not surrounded by a world full of dangerous men, but women who, despite their first appearance, have dark sides. And there is even romance between some of the rougher and more complex scenes. But in this context in which the film can be filmed, Siegel has indeed a little more freedom to work with the style of the image, which turns into something more European; I am reminded here and there of Polanski's work in the 1960s. It all works pretty well, even with the initial doubt that these two figures of masculine filmmaking (Eastwood the Obvious and Siegel's niche in B-Noir and low-budget thrillers) can pull off material for which something could possibly be done - a lifetime -Movie. <br /> <br /> It was also captivating and really gritty comic to see here and there Eastwood's performance came from these girls. He does something subversive in his performance, still having the kind of Eastwood machism - if there is such a thing near his clich√©d film image - by sometimes being one step ahead of this little school for young women and not others. Seeing Eastwood in a performance like this with Play Misty for Me (the other Eastwood work from 1971) shows how cool he can be with credible actresses. Here are in particular the four female main characters with different ages and different pull on their "Yankee" man. While Siegel's direction for all actors has his moments in the first half, it's true that the story is only passing the halftime mark in the dream sequence (less successful than the director is capable of), and the really juicy scenes are beginning to take hold. Much of this is the best that has dramatically staged the seal, marginalizing the psychological and emotional edges of scenes where it was unlikely. <br /> <br /> It's a difficult movie to put aside all this praise, as it does not paint anyone but overly respectable - only the character of Hallie, the slaves played by Mae Mercer, is sort of disconnected from what is between them Curious women and McBurney happens. Along with this role, Eastood plays a role that he does not normally see in his films during his time of formative years. He is an anti-hero here who was his trademark of Western and other thrillers he did back then. But unlike these films, he is not really in a mode where he is "bigger than life" to express it in a way that he is both deserter and womanizer, cheat and trick, even in his most charming and friendliest moments. If it is not one of his best acting, which is really difficult to put together considering his catalog, then it is worth a look for fans who might want to see another side of him. It is a credit to him, but also to what has been clicked with his collaboration with Siegel, since both at this time in Hollywood have taken a risk.
