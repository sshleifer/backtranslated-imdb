I did not find Gilmore Girls when it first came out, so I still did a bit of catching up in the first season. I read most user comments and for the negatives I have to ask which show you are watching? <br /> <br /> This show is a classic, great lines, characters and good acting. And best of all: NOT your standard formula always shows an occasional twist of history. There are likely to be more women in the Lorelai / Emily relationship than in the Lorelai / Rory relationship. The people and the storylines are not a PC, but they are real !! <br /> <br /> If you find the dialogue annoying, I suggest that you record the program so that you can see the parts again.
