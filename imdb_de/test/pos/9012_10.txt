I've never been forced to write a review on anything, but seeing such bad reviews about such an innovative show made me say something. First, people just have to overcome the fact that the voices are different. If you watch an episode, you'll never remember that. The humor is original and although some jokes are taken out of the movie, they are delivered fresh. Some of them even recall Shrek - self-referential humor. Many of these jokes seem to be directed at teenagers or original fans of the movie as well as at tweens and younger ones. Patrick Warburton and Eartha Kitt are both very funny as they repeat their roles as Kronk and Yzma, and their Annie Award nominations were quite justified. <br /> <br /> This show needs some time to love, to really get into the groove "of the things, so to speak, if you ignore the terrible title song (which should not really justify as much as a show since it is only 30 seconds of the total product), this show is laughing joy and does not lose any new spirit of the Emperor.
