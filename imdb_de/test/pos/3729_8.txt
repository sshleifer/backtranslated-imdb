I thought Besson's film could do without words, which few films could do with them; Capture real human emotions. The fights, achievements, setbacks, hopes and wishes of the main character are all shown so honestly that you wonder if he is even acting. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glamor and glamor of most Hollywood productions. However, this minimalism allows the film to overcome the stereotypical sci-fi labels and become a real drama. To call this film a drama would escape the fantastic post-apocalyptic conspiracy. While it's true that this kind of movie has been done before, I think this movie captures the joys and sorrows of this kind of world that may be better than any other.
