I stumbled across this movie while I reflected the channels on the teevee one night. It saved my interest some twenty years later, through the important real-life lesson that teaches us about the dark side of human nature. And although it tells a true story that takes place in World War II, it's surprisingly cheap for the ugly things that are happening in Europe today. <br /> <br /> If you think of "ethnic cleansing" as it is called today, then something has to do with race or ethnicity you will think differently after watching this story. <br /> <br /> I think I was pretty naive in thinking that evil follows all the prescribed rules. Evil is like evil. <br /> <br /> This lesson is a valuable lesson, and I highly recommend it. Church groups or civil rights organizations. <br /> <br /> I do not expect it to be too easy to find and rent, but I would really like to see it again because there is an amazing scene that there is a completely unintentional but interesting one Insight into the banal subtleties of "racing expertise". In this scene, the protagonist, who was captured by the Nazis at the beginning of the war, is "discovered" by an SS race authority and taken to a room. There, the two play a kind of guessing game where the SS officer can tell where our hero (Anthony Quinn's character) came from and where his ancestors came from. "Come to find out" that Quinn's character is not a member of an "inferior" race, but on the contrary, he is a perfect, Arctic Aryan! It does not mean much to Quinn's character, he's more interested in the cities, rivers, and mountain ranges the SS man has just named ... Still, there's the advantage of being a perfect Aryan archetype. Among other things, he is allowed to do his job in a slave labor factory, where he wears striped rags, and in a slave modeling job in which he wears customized Nazi uniforms. Yes, it is definitely a better show for a man who always appreciated wearing beautiful clothes ... until the Allied armies arrive and recognize his face on the front pages of the magazines. <br /> <br />
