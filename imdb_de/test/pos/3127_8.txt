A few cowpokes help a group of Mormons on their way to a new settlement through a rugged country. This inconspicuous Western is unusual for Ford because he does not miss any big stars. Johnson gets a top-billing, but his role is basically a supporting role, though he and Carey work well together. Dru has little to do except the love interest. The best performer is Ford's Favorite Bond, the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him to gain a starring role in the long-lived TV Western "Wagon Train" before his untimely death at the age of 57. With his beautiful cinematography, Ford saw this as one of his favorite films.
