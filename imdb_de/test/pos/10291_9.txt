Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. I experienced extreme frustration when watching this movie as I sought reunification for the two tracks. That never happened in the end, which has disappointed me to no end. But the ending gives a generally cynical film an even more cynical note. It's not a movie that people are likely to watch again, but a watch itself will have a profound impact on people. So far, I have not watched the movie again, and I do not think I'll do that. <br /> <br /> The story tells of the experiences of a man, Max, who is engaged to be married to Muriel. He remembers his old friend Lisa (he thinks this is the love of his life) as he happens to listen to Lisa talking on the phone. So he tries to find Lisa. Here begins his extremely frustrating search for Lisa. There are many layers in this movie. There are undercurrents of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. There is also another character named Alice, who is involved in all the confusion. The film then goes through a whole series of twists and finally leads to an end that can be interpreted in different ways. It's fascinating how this movie has only four main characters, but the clever script makes it interesting and unique. What I love about the fact is that a movie about obsession and jealousy is so carefree. It has a very high tempo, which is probably why it can appeal to a broad audience. The main character, Max, has grayscale and I thought the ending was perfect. I do not think he should be a pure character, considering that he is looking for his long-lost love during his engagement, and he also has an affect with Alice. <br /> <br /> The character of Alice is even worse. Their manipulation and compulsive lying can really irritate the audience (that's the point, I think). The scene in which she breaks down before Lucien really shows another facet of her character. It shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of lying and games and wants to lead a normal life. In the end, she understands that she has to get away from it all. The end gives a cynical touch. Because it looks like Max's love for Alice is temporary and unreal. It's like saying that love is generally a passing emotion, and it's better to choose the safe option (ie, H. Muriel) than to track something that is running away (ie, Lisa or Alice). In many ways, this is not really a romantic movie, but a satire about romance (in a sense). <br /> <br /> The performances deserve high praise. Vincent Cassel as Max gives a great performance. He perfectly describes the confusion of a man who is not really sure of his engagement. His geeky looks are an added benefit as he fits perfectly with the character. The real star of the film is Romane Bohringer as Alice. Her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of Alice and falls in love with Max. The scene in which she screams "I'm a nutcase too" really shows her desperation and her yearning to lead a normal life with a man who loves her pulled out of this movie. Alice's actions can be explained in several ways. And her unreasonable obsession with Lisa can also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. It may be a stretch, given that she encourages Lisa to forgive her current friend. But I felt like she was a lesbian for a long time. She also avoids Lisa's questions about a friend. She spends a lot of time with Lisa and is happy during that time. This could lead many to question their sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> Overall I would give her a 9/10. I think it deserves it, but I deducted one because of the readjustability factor. I think it's a perfect movie otherwise.
