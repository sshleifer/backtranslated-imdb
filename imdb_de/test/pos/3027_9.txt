What makes watching and playing movies a pleasure when, from time to time, a movie like The Cell comes to expect you least, and repels your socks! This movie is a terrific horror that offers everything you could wish for when you want to be scared out of your mind. Without going into history, all I'm going to say is that it has a great beginning, middle, and end that will keep you at the edge of your seat while banned from the amazing special effects. Acting is good without being outstanding, but that does not matter, because the theme and the way it's shown on the big screen make this movie one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. It's one of those movies that you started out as a novel, but thinks that it does not look like an adaptation, so Mark Protosovich, the author, needs a lot of recognition. 9 out of 10.
