I have seen this movie at least ten times. I disagree with the previous comments. This is a movie in the tongue, and some of the acting should be stilted. Men like Paul Cowley are few and far between, women like Linda are unfortunately a dozen. The sad thing is that although similar relationships like these rarely lead to murder and cover-ups, this is too familiar a scenario. Boy adores a girl, a girl does not know that he exists, they grow up, a man sees a woman, whom he fantasizes about, and rescues her. The bottom line was that she never loved him - he came at the right time and she used him. Thomas is excellent as the nerdy but adequate Paul. His portrayal is sensitive and touching. Madsen is perfect as a femme fatale. What really moved me was the final scene. Paul says he finally cried, but not for Linda, his wife, but for the unknown girl he had watched so far from so many years ago ... and longed for ... and loved. And I loved the close-up of Thomas in the end.
