While this movie is not the next Evil Dead (hell, maybe he knows it's him, but he's only been out for a year). It's worth a look. Do not expect a movie of $ 10 million. Because you will be disappointed. Expect to be entertaining, to laugh and enjoy the experience. Everything in this movie is MUCH better than many, if not all, low budget horror films. I've seen movies that spent more than 10 to 20 times what this movie cost, and were 10 billion times worse. The effort put into this film weighs the setbacks it faces with a limited budget. Films should entertain, and this film makes sure. In fact, this film could even open new doors for you when filming. It's available on Netflix, if not in your local video library. So watch out, then decide.
