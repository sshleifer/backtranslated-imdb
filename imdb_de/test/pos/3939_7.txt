Richard Schickel's documentary film about Gary Cooper from 1991 - "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" shows us through his films and his life a look at the huge, exclusively American star. Told by Clint Eastwood, the theme is definitely "Gary Coooper, American," as we get through quick clips of his many Western appearances and scenes from Meet John Doe, Mr. Deeds's Goes to Town, and Sgt. York. The best part of the documentary is the home videos of Cooper and his family and his children's photos, showing him as a beautiful blonde child with the sunny smile he would have throughout his life. There's also a funny clip Cooper on The Jack Benny Show comebacking on Bird Dog - and Benny loses it. The documentary also briefly introduces us to his turbulent affair with Patricia Neal, who has almost ruined her life. <br /> <There is a lack of cohesion in this bios / retrospective - it bounces around a lot and has no recordings of Cooper being interviewed, which would have helped a great deal. Also, Clint Eastwood's narrative was described as inconspicuously boring and monotonous. As Cooper himself on the screen tended to be a strong, quiet guy, we could have used a small animation. <br /> <br /> Personally, Gary Cooper was one of the prettiest men ever to live - in his early films, there were a few glimpses of him; z For this fan, it's not nearly enough. That smile, those lips, this bony structure - he was handsome all his life, but in movies like "Morocco" and "Desire" he's devastating. Instead of looking at a scene from one of his worst performances, Howard Roark in "The Fountainhead," a speech he admitted to the author he did not understand - he thought a young, polite Cooper in a tuxedo would be a nice touch , Unfortunately, this documentary was definitely produced by a man.
