<br /> <br /> Since cats have nine lives, I give you nine reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> * Kittens Berlioz and Toulouse play piano together (so incredibly sweet!) * Die Car Hounds Napoleon and Lafayette * Toulouse jumps every time as electrified, if he wants to be like a tough street cat * Marie sighs romantically while street cat O'Malley seduces her mother * Scat Cat and his jazz band, the "ev" sing rybody wants to be a cat "* Stupid, but neat and nice English geese Amelia and Abigail let the cats go like geese * O'Malley procures the" magic carpet "that shames the Cheshire cat * Roquefort the journey of the brave mouse Help from Alley Cats * Edgar , the butler, chases scenes and switches from a cute guy to an insane cat hater because the cat liberation plan has gone bad
