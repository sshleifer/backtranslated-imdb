The best of everything. What is the best of everything? It's different for everyone, but for most of us it's love. But unfortunately, not everyone knows where or to whom to address. This story is about looking for love. Sometimes in all wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes, "We are the captains of our own ships," and that's how our lives are. We are responsible for the choices we make in our lives. Once we make those decisions, we have to live with them. If we look at this story and see how these women make decisions that will most likely change their lives forever, we wonder if we would make the same choices as these women or would we be smarter? Who knows?
