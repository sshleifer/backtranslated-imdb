The two new OSS 117 films have a kind of humor that's both intelligent and stupid, which I find extremely amusing. It really reminds me of the classic Pink Panther movies with an almost as good lead actor as Peter Sellers in Jean Dujardin. And unlike Steve Martin, who completely ruins Clouseau, Dujardin is pretty brilliant. <br /> <br /> The comments that the films are anti-Semitic are obviously a case of total lack of humor and therefore of understanding. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy or hate this movie really depends on the humor you have. I can hardly wait for the sequel!
