The many comments made by others have been very instructive, and I am calling for the release of Porgy and Bess, the 1959 film. <br /> <br /> In my early teens I joined a record club and this album was one of the free I have decided to join. I knew that some voices were dubbed, but only Robert McFerrin was recognized on the album. My daughter recently bought a CD from Austria, I think. The quality is excellent, so I'm confused why it's available in Europe from CBS Records, Inc. if I was out of luck in local stores. <br /> <br /> Actually, I have not seen the movie for years but have asked local video stores to get it. Now I know why it was never available. <br /> <br /> I cast my voice to others who deal with the heirs of property and rights, and agree to release it, no matter how imperfect they are - the beauty of music and music History reached so many of us who would otherwise never have had the experience.
