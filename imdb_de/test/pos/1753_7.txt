Hoppity is a charming, if somewhat phycadelic animated film, which, considering it was made in 1941, has passed the test of time incredibly well. Now I have to admit that I have a penchant for 'HoppityGoes To Town' (as it's called in the UK) after seeing a VHS version that our parents often took with my siblings from the television. This morning, just in time, to see it on Channel Four (at 0615 no less!). The movie was just as adorable as I remembered the animation like. Maybe one day I will share this forgotten classic with my own children. With a nice running time for kids (88 mins) and a simple yet engaging action, there really is something for everyone, from this little guy who comes along well. I could really see that this was successfully restored in CGI. Note Pixar.
