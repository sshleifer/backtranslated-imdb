I'm not a fan of Disney at all, but I happen to be in Orlando at a friend's wedding. So my travel partner and I went to Disney for a few days. I have not seen a good 3D effect yet. Therefore, I usually try to stay away from these presentations. The 3-D effect was so good. I'm a grown man of 38, and even I wanted to try and touch it. It is so good! An advice. Finally, look at the back of the theater on the wall. To put it this way: When I saw it for the first time, the effect did not work. So I told my friend ... "It would have been nice if ..." My friend said, "That's what happened, it's a great show, you will not be disappointed !!!
