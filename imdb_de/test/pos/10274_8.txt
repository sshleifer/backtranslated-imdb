Here is a small background, as I saw this movie. As you probably know, this is the original French film, which was then rebuilt by Hollywood as Wicker Park. Well, I avoided this movie like the plague when it was first released, simply because a) I knew it had absolutely nothing to do with Wicker Park, and because I lived in Chicago, I did not see why they called him that - he was shot in fricking Canada for a start! - b) I have a hard time dealing with pointless remakes just because Hollywood says we're too idle to read a few subtitles (by the way, I fear the remake of Infernal Affairs) Josh Hartnett said nuff there. <br /> <br /> However, I recently came across WP on TV, probably about half an hour, and I have to say that it made no sense at all until half an hour after the end. when it started to come together. In the end, I was really surprised that I was really involved in it, and then the ending just seemed to be so good - a perfect combination of story, passion and ending with one of the perhaps greatest musical opportunities I've ever heard (heard ?). <br /> <br /> Since then I have talked a lot about the dispute between L'Appartement vs. Wicker Park and WP heard, I still say that it has everything to do with Chicago, but it did seem to be something I liked it, so when it ran again, I saw it again - unfortunately, the first piece was still missing ( I still have not seen it!), and I still thought it was pretty good. Heck, even Josh Hartnett seemed good! But I was curious about L'Appartement and wanted to see what the hustle and bustle was all about. So I waited and waited to be somewhere in the apartment somewhere. Netflix let me down, so I got a copy from a website in Ireland. And I just saw it. <br /> <br /> It's really weird, but funny. A classic French movie. Romane Bohringer is a great spectacle - sorry, but she plays Monica Bellucci in every scene in front of the screen. Vincent Cassel was a strange choice for the lead but in the end he works. And I've seen Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in many movies and I just love him - the scene where Alice lets him out in the restaurant and he just looks like someone said his puppy had been run over was agonizing! But I can honestly say that I saw WP and pretty much expect it to be a scene for scene copy (since about 75% of the rest of the movie had been - maybe in a different order, but come on, the scene with the coffee in the glasses word for word !!), you can imagine my surprise when I saw the end of L'Appartement !! I can literally say that I was overwhelmed - hmm, a bit like poor old Lucien was really through the cafe window! So be prepared, if you've seen Wicker Park and you want to see the original like me, do not make the mistake of expecting an identical film, because you'll either be disappointed or look forward to a piece of French film history - a great example for how you can watch a movie, you think you'll see a sparkling happy ending and end up with a whiplash of total spin in the opposite direction. Definitely catch this movie. Oh, and while you're at it, maybe not too close, but in the street, look at Wicker Park, it'll surprise you, too.
