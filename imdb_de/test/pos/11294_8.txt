I saw "Begotten" last night, and I have two views in the movie. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I appreciate that it's the total twist of a Michael Bay movie. No dialogues, extremely stylized grainy black-and-white photography, some of the most frightening images ever made, and a very convincing use of sound (which no one seemed to find so far). It is a reflection of a theme, and it dares to move where most filmmakers go, not just in terms of images, but also in terms of production and concept. It's a movie that most people do not understand, and if you read through those comments, you'll find a lot of people whose lack of ability to understand this movie causes them to fervent gibberish over "presumption "the bars of his cage squeal at feeding time. It was really shocking and troubling me, and the last time a movie did that was a while ago. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is a 30 minute short film that stretches over one and a half hours half. I understand that using repetition and monolithic tempo as a stick may be an artistic value, but in this case, it just does not help keep everything together. Imagine being addressed by a ragged man in the street who grabs you by the shoulders and says something that totally confuses the core of your being ... But then, instead of leaving your shattered and hackling creature behind you, he just keeps talking and talking. At the end of the film, I occasionally looked at my watch. <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment, people. That's disappointment. This is how you program people who have just seen "glitter". Watching movies to be entertained will frustrate, confuse and possibly annoy you. You do not go begging like a chocolate cake that you want to eat because it tastes good. They approach him like something on the menu you've never heard of before, something you see furtively through the kitchen door, something dark and glittering and twitching on his plate; something you order, not because it will taste good, but because you just have to know how it is.
