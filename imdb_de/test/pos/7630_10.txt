Prepare to meet your Messiah - they call him Masts Thrust. Male role models are increasingly difficult to find in today's overexposed society. Every other day, an obvious role model must apologize in tears for a youthful indiscretion, or let innocent drink a few teenagers on his ranch. The last dinosaur is the story of the last big hunt of Masten Thrust, an old, plastered big game hunter who serves as a role model for everything. Despite his gaunt features and bulbous nose, the women, including Joan Van Ark, are attracted to him, like the Meatloaf to cheesy lyrics. Thrust is openly sexist and does not apologize for his mature lifestyle, which includes a red scarf and a private jet with a working fireplace. <br /> <br /> Thrust embarks on a mission to find and hunt the world's last dinosaur Ironically, after a rich, full life, he is truly the last dinosaur. Despite his inclination to shout at everyone in his presence, his employees and friends are steadfastly loyal to him. He can pretend to be drunk all the time, but do not make a mistake when he calls you "Ding Dong", you are a "Ding Dong". <br /> <br /> His own ballad can not be denied, Thrust's song shamelessly praises him and his manhood. A selection of texts include: "Few men have ever done what he did or even dreamed, what he dreamed / Few men even tried what he tried, most men failed where he won / The World Nothing new to him, and things that scare you and me are just boring, few men have ever lived, how he lived or even walked, where he went. "Even BMTG artist Clay Aiken could Do not grab these lyrics and become a bumpy machine. <br /> <br /> Thrust and his crew of scientists buckle into the 'Polar Borer', who wear a mini-cycle helmet, though Thrust offers the luxury of the red handkerchief. The huge, human-filled drill digs through the Earth and the ice to jump into a lagoon, and dinosaurs from the air and land soon come to the scientists who force Thrust and her crew to run for their lives, masts settles back and gives a hearty laugh, not so much to celebrate Li For example, to acknowledge that the game is in progress. <br /> <br /> A little later, it's not surprising that we see a couple of cavemen, who have slumped slightly, and glimpse their visitors. Thrust, not content with just killing a dinosaur, then decides to make it his mission to make a cave wide. Throughout the film, the lone T-Rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a brain the size of a peanut. Despite its enormous size, the local T-Rex can almost unnoticed stay next to his victims. With the element of surprise, T-Rex crushes one or two scientists and loots the campsite. Again and again you see the bloated and timid thrust as he shouts at someone, shoots at something or flirts with a primitive J-Lo in a male manner. Thrust is like James Tiberius Kirk, not only in his addiction to love, but also when it comes to produce limited natural resources in a short time complicated weapons. Thrust and the rest of the crew construct a high-precision catapult that hurls a large boulder into the skull of the ripped T-Rex. Realizing that he too, Mast Thrust, can not beat this addition to his trophy case, Thrust decides to stay in his prehistoric setting. The ever-diminishing crew leaves Thrust to spend his days with his handsome, if somewhat playful, cavernous wife and introduces them to his personal collection of sexually transmitted diseases. This is just a brief summary of a film that is so complex and rich in the BMTG tradition that it needs multiple views to pick up its message and realize that Mast Thrust is the answer. The press conference with a screaming thrust, mumbling reporters and the introduction of the big bunta is a classic moment. Also, look for a corpse resembling a dead Ricky Schroeder lying on some tree trunks and the strongest use of someone called "Ding-Dong" in movie history.
