The animation is still the slightly rougher style of the first episode, Simpsons Roasting on Open Fire, but already with this first regular episode, Bart the Genius, the humor begins to become more and more "layered", faster and more intense characterizing already appears. <br /> <br /> This episode sets Barts "slacker" personality, and subtle Lisa's intellectual superiority over the whole family. Although this is the main theme of the entire episode (there is also a nice secondary theme of Bart and Homer's father / son relationship), it gets to the heart of it first when the episode starts with the Simpsons playing Scrabble. Lisa has "id" for her word - in short, but you have to be well educated to know it. She has to read the definition to the rest of the family from the dictionary, which serves as a support for the couch. Marge can only come up with "he". Homer already has "oxidize" on his tablet in the right order, but does not realize it's a word, and instead presents "do." Bart comes with "kwyjibo", which he considers a word. Similarly, Bart deceives his IQ test in the main line of the episode, which results in him being taken to a special school with gifted children. We know that will probably not last long. <br /> <br /> "The Simpsons" has always been a lot of fun playing with people's diverse intellectual abilities through their characters. Different degrees of intellectual abilities fit in (or not), are accepted (or not) and are perceived in society. In addition to Bart, Lisa, Homer and Marge taking a seat in this regard, this episode already begins with respect for nerds and geeks outside the Simpsons family. Through some dialogues of the students of the special school as well as some other, even purely visual references, this episode also shows that "The Simpsons" will not strike by writing or speaking to the audience. It may just be a cartoon, but it's a cartoon that intellectuals, geeks, and nerds will understand more than anyone else. And that fact, in addition to being a very funny show, is the key to the longevity of the show.
