Valley Girl is one of the better teen comedies that was shot in the 80's. The young Nicolas Cage plays a leading role. Deborah Foreman is fun as an object of Cage's desire (and whatever happened to her?). Look for the seasoned actors Colleen Camp and Frederic Forrest as Julie's hippie parents - they are pretty funny!
