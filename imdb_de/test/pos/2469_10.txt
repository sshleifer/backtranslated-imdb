The most intense and powerful movie I've seen in years. There have been other films that have dealt extensively with the Vietnamese veterinarian, but nothing compared to this emotionally heartwarming movie. A typical American suburban family (circa 1972) is loosening at the seams and exposing the scars that Vietnam has left in our entire collective Souls The cast is fantastic with A ++++, with all four actors (with Kathy Bates playing a prominent role ) with exciting performances. The wonderful thing about this film is that you can not take sides, but understand all four characters and empathize with them, even though all four have different views and needs. There are scenes here that are as powerful as revealing family secrets and feelings (like the confrontation between son and mother) that emotionally drain you and put you into tears of fear. I actually cried in this movie, which I rarely do. The shocking ending is a madness! A much overlooked movie to watch. I rate this 1996 film 10/10 as a piece of superlatives. Especially in this day and age, it is highly recommended that our country be involved in a vicious war, that our headlines scream of atrocities, and that our young men and women return with profound psychological scars. A must see movie.
