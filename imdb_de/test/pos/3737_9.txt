I think that this show was right for me. I saw it on the plane, but there were parts in the movie that made me stop myself from breaking everywhere. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane Lane was very believable (fantastic acting in both parts)! I loved how Diane Lane's daughter acted on the show. She showed maturity and how she transformed herself during the show is easy to believe what a teenager might look like in real life. <br /> <br /> I loved this show from start to finish. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!
