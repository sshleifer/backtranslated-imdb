I really liked this movie. One thing I noticed was that the Korean TV dramas are far better, as far as the whole story goes. I watch movies when I have no time or desire to go through 16 to 30 episodes. Movies seem rushed and if you are not looking closely, you may miss something. <br /> <br /> I feel like this part was rushed and I had to rewind a few parts to try to find what I missed, especially at the end. If you like beautiful love stories, I still find it cute and if you have more time, I still think it's worth it to see it. <br /> <br /> It's always nice to follow the actors in different directions because we can not follow them from the beginning, as we do the producers and directors of the actors in our own countries.
