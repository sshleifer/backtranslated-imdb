"Love is a multi-faceted thing", set in Hong Kong in 1949-50 and tells the story of the relationship between Mark Elliott, a white American journalist, and Han Suyin, a semi-Chinese half-European doctor. This story of mixed race love was a daring topic for the 1950s, and how often did Hollywood try to mitigate the blow by acting as a white-haired actress, a non-Caucasian woman, who falls in love with a white man, something that today would be considered politically incorrect, but then was quite acceptable. (Think of Ava Gardner's casting in "Show Boat," or Natalie Wood in "West Side Story.") Setting the story In a British colony, it was perhaps also a way to examine racist issues in such a way that they could America caused less controversy. Suyin loses her job in a Hong Kong hospital because her British bosses assume that she is dating a white man whom she can not marry because his wife does not get a divorce. As was sometimes the case, European colonialism was made a whipping sensation for some American failures. Imagine the sensation that would have been unleashed if a similar film had been made about a black or multiracial doctor at a hospital in Alabama. In addition to racist questions, the film also raises questions of international politics. both on the Communist seizure of power in China and on the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a real person and a well-known author of the time; In fact, it supported the Mao communist regime, but here it shows itself to be strongly anti-Communist. However, this is not primarily a "thematic" film about racism or politics, but rather a romance, a good example of what would have been known as the "image of women" at the time. Although these films were mostly made by male directors, they were primarily aimed at female audiences. They dealt with love and romance - often unfortunate romance - from a woman's perspective and had a strong female character in the lead role. The genre often provided roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard novels. Earlier examples were usually monochrome, but in the fifties they generally used, as here, lush, lush colors. <br /> <br /> Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress would have been more persuasive in this role, Jennifer Jones does a very good job of doing so as Suyin. I found William Holden quite uncharismatic as Mark, but that does not matter, since Suyin is the dominant character. It's much more than a canvas, and the film explores her family and professional life much more than his own. Although Jennifer was still strikingly beautiful, she was in her mid-thirties, older than most of the romantic heroines of the films of the time. Holden was about the same age, unusual for the fifties, when "boy meets girl" often means "older man meets girl". <br /> <br /> The film is not particularly profound, but with some well done Attractive photography, especially from Hong Kong itself, reflects the growing trend of the fifties to turn the spot and not on studio sets. Rarely has Hongkong looked so beautiful; The view from a hill over the city gets a special meaning, as Suyin and Mark do their romantic tasks here. The overall mood is one of poignant, damned romanticism, a mood enhanced by atmospheric photography and music score, including one of the most memorable movie themes ever written. 10.7
