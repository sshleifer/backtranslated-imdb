After seeing the Harry Potter films, I was a fan of trio actors Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe, and Emma Watson. But we were waiting to see if they would do other projects, except the same characters in the year or every two years of the J.K. Rowling series. Instead of a trio, the cameras and magazine articles focus more on Daniel and Emma as they are the leading male and only leading woman in the saga, leading Rupert to a dead end. Anyway, every actor has a time to shine, and Rupert's light hits him in this movie for once. <br /> <br /> "Driving Lessons" is the name given to Harold and Maude of this generation, with Rupert Grint playing Ben Marshall, a young British guy who plays with his domineering mother (Laura Linney) and a sissy of a vicar (priest's father ), for whom he wants a job in the summer, but finds no job, while at the same time taking his driving test (and failing) and write poetry for a young girl who has no interest in him. Ben is looking for an ad in a church newspaper for which the job requires looking after an elderly lady. He accepts the job and realizes that he's looking forward to surprises when Evie (Julie Walters, Rupert's mother in the Harry Potter series), an unemployed actress who is also a poet who gives Ben the prize for his money , They connect and tell each other secrets, while Evie behaves like a child and becomes mischievous, taking Ben on a shore excursion. From there, not only does Ben drive all the way from Britain to Scotland, since Evie has to recite in a local library, but at the same time an elderly lady falls in love with the young man in whom Ben begins to become a man. <br /> <There is mishap and merry with Ben and Evie. I was really excited about the movie when it hit the cinemas and I was impressed with Rupert Grint's acting, especially if he showed the rest of the movie world, even though he brings some of Ron Weasley's in Ben Marshall, the actor is on not to slow down its brilliant performance.
