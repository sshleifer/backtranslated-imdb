Compared to the competition Soul Calibur 3 is a god among the games - a true work of art. However, compared to its 128-bit predecessors, the latest series of namcos superior slash em up is ambitious - their attempts to improve perfection are not very successful. <br /> <br /> There are new modes and game modes I recommend taking the series to new heights - but they just make things more complicated. Examples Well, the character creation mode is a great idea in theory, but in reality it has some limitations and is by no means as customizable as in the WWE games. The Chronicles of Sword Mode are funny and thought-provoking for a brief moment, but eventually move on and feel like a chore to earn money rather than a really fun game. Also, the soul mode, which is essentially arcade mode, with bits of inconsistent history and Qt bits placed in the Qm style, feels really slow. <br /> <br /> "OMG !!! SaYiNg" is probably what the most over-zealous of you think, but do not let it twist - I do not hate this game - this game is great! It still has the classic gameplay (though some character movements have been changed unnecessarily), absolutely stunning graphics and the epic soundtrack for which the games are known. And also on the good side of things are the new characters (especially Zasalamel), who are all cool in their own way (with the exception of setsuka-yes, I know I'm nitpicking). <br /> <br /> For Soul Calibur 1 and 2, it feels like it's a lot more than it actually is. That does not mean it's not a classic, it just means that it's a bit short compared to its own high standards, even though more characters have been moved and better graphics than ever before. <br /> <br /> Still, Soul Calibur 3 wipes the floor with 95% of the games outside - and that counts for something! Oh and anyone who calls this review "unhelpful" clearly feels hurt by insulting their darling Setsuka. Listen, Fanboy / Girl: YOU ARE NOT REAL! And even if she were, she would not get caught with you.
