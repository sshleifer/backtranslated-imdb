Above all, I believe that this film is much appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's "Heart Of Darkness", the book that was the literary basis for the film. I think this movie is amazing. It is an excellent war film that focuses not so much on the brutality and brutality of the Vietnam conflict, but rather on the psychological tribute it paid to the young, inexperienced "children" sent to battle. Coppola showed a genius in the art of filmmaking and used many visuals to tell the story. The acting that I felt was definitely at eye level. Marlon Brando's role in the film is what really got me to act. His explanation to Willard at the end of the film brings you to the fore and reveals the emptiness of a man you've heard about and whom you wanted to see throughout the movie. Those who view this war as just another war film must give a detailed look to all the literary elements associated with this film, for it has great significance behind it. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculpted and best-made films of all time.
