In today's world of advertising, teenage horror and sensationalism, it's very rare to see a movie and not mind it. Movies like "Psycho" and "Blair Witch" are thrilling (both with great constructions), but the fact that we know everything about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them. With Mute Witness, a rare treat, I stumbled upon this movie and saw it in the middle of the night in fear. I was afraid of the threatening Russian ambience, the "snuff" motive and the claustrophobic position of the mute and the fact that the (amusing, who always lead to sympathetic characters) can find the end in every second. Since this is a cheap and rare movie, we look at it without expectations. It also has Fay Ripley in a rare film role, looking and ready to be excited, frightened and excited in a totally unexpected way.
