This is my favorite horror movie, a close second to poltergeist. I saw "One Dark Night" when it first appeared in theaters in 1983 where I worked. I was born in 1963 and have some love for the horror movies of the 80s. They are a bit dated and the dialogue is not well written. What I thought so original was that the phenomenon of "psychic vampirism" (at least to my knowledge not then) was addressed and is a very real phenomenon. <br /> <br /> I did not do it 'I do not care if Adam West was there (nothing against him, but his supporting role was not memorable), but thought Meg Tilly would be a good casting. The little-known Donald Hutton (of "Brainstorm" and "Invaders From Mars") as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw the investigation of Ramar's abilities was unfortunately overlooked. As a gay man, I paid more attention to David Mason Daniels, Meg Tilly's unfortunate but great friend. He now sells real estate in Texas. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie as "realistic" in two ways: Raymar, who had murdered 6 girls in his surreal flat, had a funeral that was sparsely attended, he was a mysterious hermit, but a murderer , As you know, these guys are buried without fanfare. Second, if bodies were telekinetically mobile, they would float and drag their feet. The filmmakers could have opted for the beating, groaning and outstretched zombies, but opted for what would be credible. Kudos! The humming electric discharge from Ramar's eyes at his 'throne coffin' (as if watching over his realm of the dead) throws an eerie magenta light into the mausoleum that will stay with you for years! If you have ever been to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their own Rosetta lighting caused by glass windows. Do not bring me into the cavernous silence. Even Ramar himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric, perverted old man. The score was unique and memorable, and I make the point myself that I did not put it on the cassette when it first came out. The track shoot was done where it should be. I particularly liked the carefully planned characteristics of each corpse: the bride, the seriously decayed child still holding his teddy bear, the grandmother, the tall, skinny black man and the half-faced veterinarian from World War II, and the green-eyed eyes Lord, who was the first to welcome the initiators of the "Sisters" cliques. I suppose corpses can be good actors too. The only thing I had to moan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and suffocated Julie's friend when no body was laid on his stomach and feet, but why? It also looked a bit too fresh. <br /> <br /> The film starts eerily, with Ramar's face (until the last quarter of the movie, which is like unpacking a birthday present) as he picks up the girl girl escapes in the psychic flash of his daughter. Then we see coroners dragging his body away in his one-bedroom condo, where we see he's been experimenting with his telekinetic craft by flinging dishes into his wall. The rest drag as the Heathers-like "sisters" group lure Julie for a final inauguration by spending the night in the mausoleum, but it's a well-placed setup for the later horror. The movie is not bloody in any way. The most greedy part is when Ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror to give him the strength and then he bubbles and then melts. I have always felt that a power like Ramar could never die, and a sequel might be worth a look. I can see it now: One Dark Night II: Turning in The Grave. But let's be honest: the movie is alone. I heard that the movie had different titles, but the original fits. <br /> <br /> A remake would be pointless. But if there were one, I'd write a better dialogue and extend some scenes, as shown in the lab tests of Ramar's abilities instead of listening to it on a tape recorder. In this information age, such a thing would be well documented on DVD. And more corpses! Why only raise those in the mausoleum if Ramar's power could spread to the graveyard? Let's just say that I hate being one of the people who had to end the chaos at the end of the climax. something that can also be shown. I think one of the introductory sisters would have recognized that one of the relatives' corpses had added a good, albeit distracting character. With CG effects, there would be some fantastic scenes with Ramar-animated burned remnants off the wall! <br /> <br /> Say what you want, 'One Dark Night', but it has everything. See at least once in your life ... or death!
