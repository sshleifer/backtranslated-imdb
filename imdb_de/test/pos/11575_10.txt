This is the most exciting competition you can imagine, it takes place in an incredible cruelty, with nothing under your feet, nothing around, no spectators, no noise, no fame, no big one Desire for victory, without the great fear of defeat in a sickly atmosphere of lukewarm skepticism, with no great faith in your own right and even less in your adversary.If this is the form of the last wisdom, life is a greater mystery than some we think it should be. "Marlow in Joseph Conrad's" Heart of Darkness "<br /> <br /> It's difficult to make the subject of death lyrical in any piece of art. Recently, however, films have made courageous attempts to humanize them so that they are accepted as part of the cycle of all living things, and they may be chosen rather than established by law. "Chosen" is the motto for Alejandro Amenabar's Sea Inside, which is based on the true story of the Galician sailor Ramon Sampedro. It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice in love, poetry and friendship. If it sounds like Barbarian Invasions (2003), when a cancer professor says goodbye to lifelong friends and loves them before he takes his own life, then you're right. In fact, Sea is better because it spends a bit more time with the protagonist before he leaves, a remarkable feat in which none of these moments are the least boring or uninteresting. Javier Bardem, while Ramon has expressive eyes and a commanding voice for the romantic four-legged friend, a combination of hard realist and poetic sufferer. Belen Rueda plays the disabled lawyer Julia, who becomes an imaginary lover for Ramon and increases in radiation as the disease progresses. To the already almost soap opera circumstance comes Lola Duenas as Rosa, a worker who Ramon initially wants to dissuade the attempt to seek death, but quickly fell in love with him. Are you talking about the romanticizing disability? This guy has incredible luck attracting considerable women, and he can not move a finger. But he can talk and prove the ultimate argument about what women want: love that speaks, not only does. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from mentioning the main movie, which now stands for an Oscar that has euthanasia as a culmination not to spoil the experience for beginners. Suffice it to say that both films manage to open both sides of a controversial topic without forcing a particular point of view. Religious law has the right to complain that the former film and the barbarian invasions are celebrating suicide. It has no right to indict the beautifully balanced Sea Inside of it. <br /> <br /> "Living in this state has no dignity," says Ramon. The irony is that he behaves himself with the highest dignity that makes everyone question his determination to end his life. "The Sea Inside" is an impressive feature in the Oscar nominations for Best Foreign Language Film of 2004.
