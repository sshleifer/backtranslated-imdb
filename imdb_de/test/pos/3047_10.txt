In this movie, my theory was based on books based on books: instead of following the clich√©, "You've read the book, now you see the movie." If you are looking for a good book to read, try a movie that you like because it will be 10 times better. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on its first release at the National Theater in downtown Eugene and I liked it so much that I saw it again and again. It's a perfect fusion of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors, Jon Voight, with what became my favorite book "The Water Is Wide" by Pat Conroy. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine a better movie about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life. Two tiny reservations: <br /> <br /> (1) The video suffers greatly from pan-and-scan and deserves a letterbox version. (2) The title should be traced back to the name of the book, a reference to one of the most touching, enigmatic songs ever written
