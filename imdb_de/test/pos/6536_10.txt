Wow is all I could say. I really loved the movie and I could tell Aaron Carter that I really think you should be in many more movies because you're rocking. I love Aaron Carter so much, he's hot and I say thank you for making this movie great. I really wish he could do a lot more movies because he is a great dancer, actor and singer. I wish I could sing as well as he could. and I was a fan of him as always and I will never stop loving him. I rented the movie and I had it for two days and literally watched it ten times. loud laughter I could be called crazy, but that only proves that I liked it a lot.
