In his dramatic account of Wild's novel, John Osborne condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally showed Dorian's essential malice rather than shown. If you want an explicit rendition, read the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time span, but they were certainly completely different men and writers. This story is really about a topic similar to Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Note, however, that Wilde treated his story as a fantasy, while RLS took the scientific path. Both protagonists are men in which good is fought with evil and wins evil in the end. <br /> <br /> The actors in this BBC film are taking a different path than those in the 1945 film. John Gielgud says all caustic and cynical jokes like George Sanders, who in his role projected Wilde himself, but with one subtle difference. You'll suspect that Sanders really believed what he said, but Gielgud may say what is expected of him, not what he sincerely believes. Peter Firth is also reluctant to show the two sides of his character, but then we do not see as many of his antics as Hurd Hatfield had the opportunity to show him. <br /> <br /> It's a very good production, with dramatization reflecting the essence of the novel, if not all of its effects.
