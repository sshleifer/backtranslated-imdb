Much about USA The Movie can be summarized in the title. It prefers parallels between the country's attitudes in the face of war and a sort of Hollywood-like falsehood that glorifies things that should not be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's stance on the recent events (though I can not always say exactly where he stands, frankly speaking), but I admire the unusual and artistic way of conveying the point. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poems etc. play a major role here as well as visual elements. Most of the visuals in the story are well accompanied by these audio elements. I'm kind of a radio player, so it was satisfying to hear the radio being integrated into the tempo of the movie. In fact, most of the dialogue about history takes place instead of characters talking to each other. That does not mean that there are no "characters" (real people), but apart from "Jim," the protagonist (a sort of misfit of the '60s with an unsteady state of mind), the others come pretty fast. Some make a very strong impression, especially a guru-like taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom himself. If he breaks out in a spontaneous prayer song while he drives Jim to the subway, this is a very powerful moment. On the cover of the DVD is the quote "The danger is clear," taken from President Bush's speech, which paved the way for our invasion of Iraq. In retrospect, listening to this speech in a climax of the film, showed how we live in a historically charged moment that we will always remember.
