Ettore Scola's masterful rendering of this epic of the heart deserves a much wider audience. It is a worthy successor to the Risorgimento classics such as Vischonti's Senso and Il Gattopardo as well as Rosselinis Vanina Vanini. The 19th century is indeed a fertile source for Italian filmmakers. The period settings and traps are nicely implemented here, but the story is timeless and can occur in any period. The fascinating thing about this story is that the hero is trapped in a claustrophobic situation in which he finds himself as the energetically pursued object of desire, and he is completely powerless to free himself from the alarming circumstances. Giorgio (Giraudeau) is frustrated by his inability to visit his charming but reckless married mistress (Antonelli) and succumbs to the dangerous passion of the in love Fosca (D'Obici), the ugly and sick daughter of his stern commander (Girotti). The resulting anxiety and the resulting tragedy experienced by this unlikely couple makes them understandable, pitiful and immensely sympathetic to the audience. Bernard Giraudeau's outstanding performance will fascinate and leave a lasting impression. Not to miss.
