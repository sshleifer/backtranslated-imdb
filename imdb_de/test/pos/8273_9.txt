When this was first aired on Masterpiece Theater, it had a profound impact on me. It is beautifully filmed and played. I immediately read the book by Mary Webb, and it remains one of my favorites. Janet McTeer is wonderful as Prue, and I absolutely expected her to be a fixture in the British drama scene. I think she chose the British stage instead. <br /> <br /> I had hoped that with the American success of Janet McTeer (with Tumbleweeds) years later, this film would be available again for us. Unfortunately, it has not been released on DVD yet. If someone is listening out there, please make it available again!
