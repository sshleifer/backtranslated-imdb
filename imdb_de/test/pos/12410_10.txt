My wife and I loved this movie. Intelligent dialogue, great characters, clever plot construction. The pace in this movie is uninterrupted. Could not even come to the kitchen for a few snacks. We've never seen Corey Feldman so funny. Taylor Nichols plays a good Fed ... my wife loves him on the HBO show "Married Man". The cast was strong. The turn at the end made us rejoice. That's why we give this movie a "standing O".
