I first saw this movie by chance when I visited my uncle about 3 1/2 years ago in Arizona. The VHS print looked a bit faded, but I was very haunted by what I had seen. Did it all make sense? Well, honestly, no, it did not. However, this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all aspects. The beautiful tragic score followed me and the bizarre pictures made a quiet impression. <br /> <br /> When I found out that Anchor Bay had released this curiosity on DVD, I immediately recorded it. I was very happy with the transfer, although I was missing the extras. Although the film is about the characters "O" and "Sir Stephen," it has nothing to do with Pauline Reage's original novel or the 1974 movie "The Story of O". However, the film respects artistic details and symbolism of almost mystical nature. "O" decides to prostitute for Sir Stephen in violent Hong Kong in the 1920s. Her mission is to prove her infinite devotion and love for her Master by giving her body to other men. Of course, Sir Stephen enjoys her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds a lover. The tables, however, are turned when "O" actually finds some kind of love for a young male admirer. Suddenly, Sir Stephen senses the threat ... <br /> <br /> I feel that the deep meaning behind the film (including the tragic score and artistic direction) really makes this movie a classic. The viewer is introduced not only to the life and past of on-board comrades of "O," but also the revolt of Hong Kong from the 1920s. Like the political environment, prostitutes also need affiliation. Nobody is happy in the movie, even if they think they are. (However, "O" finds happiness in her young admirer). A prostitute whimsically recalls how her father behaved like a dog in a drunken state, which naturally leads to a fetish because her clients behave like a dog. Another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. She can not let go of this vision. She treats her clients as co-stars and even swears she hears a piano in the river. <br /> <br /> As for "O," she has a flashback about her father leaving her in the chalk circle. When leaving she feels abandoned. Of course, in the same flashback, Kinski suddenly becomes her father. This picture bothered me a lot, very much. I really felt like "O" at this point in the movie. She barely smiles and this scene really explains why. Her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees Sir Stephen as her father and satisfies every one of his obscene demands to prove her love. <br /> <br /> Another peculiar aspect of the movie is the young kid (aging in the end) selling fortune in a box. It's a very random character, but somehow it just adds to the feeling of loss and emptiness in the movie. At one point, the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent humans. Well, if that is not your symbol! (Laughter) <br /> <br /> All in all, I really love this movie a lot. I feel like it is a very deep and moving experience. It has erotic scenes, but the scenes are not supposed to really excite. Like the lives of the characters, the sex acts are empty. They are movements, but they lack feeling and tenderness. (Once again, the only tender scene is between "O" and the young man). "O" believes that she is in love and that it is an honor to lower herself, but in the end she thinks she has choices. She can also be her own person and pursue her own happiness, but she also has the opportunity to stay in the circle her father has drawn. The director leaves many unanswered questions, but some things do not need answers. The viewer will make the judgment that works for him. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I wish a special edition of this DVD would be released that would have director commentary. I think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion about the film and its message years later. It's a shame that the soundtrack was never released. This movie has a really haunting and heartbreaking score. There is something about the long-lasting vocals that freeze my back. I can really feel the feeling of loneliness in the movie just by listening to the music.
