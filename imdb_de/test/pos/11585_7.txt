-Facts (I): "Mar Adentro" tells the (at least in Spain) known story of Ramón Sampedro, a Galician lateral thinker who has killed after 28 years (supported by some friends). Richter had several times denied his applications for active euthanasia. <br /> <br /> -facts (II): "Mar adentro" becomes the film of the year in Spain. Everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people ... Everyone likes it, even the opinions of the critics are in agreement. The film wins many awards (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goya ...) and annoys Catholic community and life-lovers. A star Is Born. <br /> <br /> Facts (III): The intensity and quality of the performers in "Mar Adentro" are simply overwhelming, so I'm wondering why we have to look bad at seeing young actors in most recent Spanish films , I do not know if Javier Bardem is a great actor or a big imitator (there is a big difference between one or the other). Anyway, his job is just as impressive as Lola Dueñas', Belén Ruedas or the job of all guest stars. This is (the selection of actors) the strength of Amenábar's film. <br /> <br /> Facts (IV): Alejandro Amenábar has learned his lesson there at the Cinema School, no doubt about it: he has a privileged brain. He takes control of every technical aspect, he knows what the audience wants, he knows how to touch the right chord, even if that makes him such a demagogue (just as Spielberg is one of Amenábar's idols). <br /> Facts (and V): When you criticize a movie like "Mar Adentro," it seems that you are having trouble with the moral issue that the story is telling. There is a trap in this kind of picture: you have to distinguish between the movie itself and morality. If you do not like "Schindler's list," that does not mean that you agree with Hitler's philosophy (or?). So for me, it's a good movie and an extraordinary story (because it's a real story that makes it much more extraordinary). Grandiloquent, selfish and anything but neutral (no matter what Amenábar or Bardem said about it: the characters who do not advocate euthanasia are not good at all !!). 50% heavy / 50% too sentimental. <br /> <br /> -Epilog: "Mar Adentro" would not be in my ranking of the best Spanish films of the 50s of all time. Nobody has any special merit in the story except Ramon Sampedro himself. He is the movie. Now Alejandro Amenábar becomes the more international Spanish director of all time, perhaps he moves to Hollywood; but some of us would like to see him filming a simple story without a bit of final twists, without dying dead or dying alive ... "The Others" is still his best movie. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
