Certainly, this film has the ring of truth about it, as it claims to rely on actual occurrences in a naval base. It is an attempt to hide the local naval commander from the unacceptable behavior of a naval major shot by his former girlfriend, a naval captain. The man and the woman had been lovers, but the captain tried to break off the relationship when she found out that her boyfriend was married. He continued to follow her and went so far that he once fired his sidearm in her direction. Finally he broke into her house, attacked her with a knife and was shot and killed twice with her service pistol. The civilian attorney decided to kill the self-defense, but the Marines decided to charge the captain with murder. The Major was a decorated hero from Vietnam and an old friend of the lieutenant colonel in the naval base. The captain had also made some enemies in their Motorpool command and had rejected some male advances in a very slippery style. <br /> <br /> There is a considerable psychological burden that motivates and controls the actions of the main characters of this drama, which beautifully communicates the very capable cast. However, the director and the editor seem determined to disguise the action as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and changing angles. You are lucky if you know where you are most of the time. But stay with them. It is a worthwhile story as the captain's court martial develops, and it seems as if every man's hand is against her, sometimes even against her lawyer. <br /> <br /> The verdict? Well, that's a pretty exciting story, so you have to see it for yourself. There is a kind of "pacifist" message that is folded into the movie, but do not forget that. Sure, "war is hell", but sometimes it can not be avoided. We will need these marines, even if they are not always the best champions of fair play internally. As Kipling says in his poem "Tommy Atkins": <br /> <br /> "It's Tommy's and Tommy's, and Tommy's out there, but there's room for Mr. Atkins, when the troop ship is on the high tide. "
