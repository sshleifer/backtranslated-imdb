I remember a time when the only thing that took place was clubs, drug pubs, and parties. This movie came a few years after I started clubbing. If I had never discovered the Ravierian side of things, this movie might not have made sense to me. When I first saw it with some friends that night, I was blown away. I had never seen a movie that was as close to reality as I was in my life back then. Almost everything I could relate to somehow. There never was a character I could fully engage with, but rather a combination of all in one way or another. My buddies were no different and I remember that we all said that they were where we were or where we were. We were all together this weekend to do exactly what the crew is doing in HT. We came down while we saw, and when the movie is "run down," I remember that I actually got a bit more run down. It was actually quite depressing in our room during these "low points". That's what's so good about Human Traffic. it really knocks the whole situation. <br /> <br /> It's a unique movie in the way it's not controlled by the plot, but then it's not entirely character-based, though the characters are important. it always seemed to be based on the situations. Situations as a group and as individuals. Every character is lost in life for a variety of reasons. but each one reacts in the same way to the lost. Work every job to earn money for the weekend and get away from it all. it is your holiday for her. But the reality is that you can not really escape. Another situation that they all face. <br /> <br /> Me and my colleagues did not differ from these guys. We all had our own things. Human traffic helped us to explain what we did not understand about ourselves. It does it in a way that does not speak to you. It made us feel that we were not the only ones like us and that the lessons learned where many others from all over the world had gone. It was only when my lifestyle changed from party-popper to career that I fully understood this movie. Today I watch HT from time to time (as I have just now) and remember the old times. No other movie can do that. I was peter popper, i was jip travolta, i never landed with my chosen family. I would have $ 200 in my back burner and I will grow the lot! Do not worry!
