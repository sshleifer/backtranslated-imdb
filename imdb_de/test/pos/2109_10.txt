Undoubtedly, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of stars and musicians of the "AAA" level ever assembled for a fun, "G" rated family adventure. This is a must for any video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skillfully combines the drama of the Rodeo / 4H competition for the cow "GRAND CHAMPION" with a touching and funny story of perseverance against difficult challenges. Joey Lauren Adams delivers her typically solid performance as a well-intentioned mother, but star of the show is the 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS, whose presence in front of the camera is a glory like that of her famous Aunt JULIA. You can expect a lot from this young Roberts-Protégé ', as shown in her new Nickelodeon series "UNFABULOUS".
