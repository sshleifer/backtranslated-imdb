Doctor Who is amazing. It's everybody's cup of tea. It must be. The guys will like the monsters and the action and the adventure, and the girls will like the emotions and feelings that go around them. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was exceptional as Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real. <br /> <br /> David Tennant is also funny and funny and it's so nice to see. <br /> <br /> But now Billie left and Rose left with her on-off friend Mickey and her mother and her father in a parallel universe (he died when Rose was a baby but this is Pete Tyler from the parallel universe). It will be very strange for Martha to be the new companion since I only saw her with Rose (except for the runaway bride with Catherine Tate). Freema, be good !!! > <br /> But nobody can beat Rose !!!
