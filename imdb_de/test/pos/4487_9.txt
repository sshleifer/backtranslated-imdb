During the Sci-Fi TZ Marathon on January 31, 1999, this episode was the last to be aired in my time zone (East) in the 20th century. It was New Year's Eve, and when the clown starts singing, "We're here because we're here because we're here because we're here ..." I realized that this was a clever niche of TZ New Year's Eve because of this Melody is also the tune of Old Lang Syne. Coincidence? We will never know. <br /> <br /> I love this story for the little touches: the tear on the ballerina, the clown's antics and the hit-yourself-in-the-head ending. This and the Art Carney Santa TZ are the only ones that deal with Christmas. <br /> <br /> My personal top 5 episodes after five characters ...: 1. The Hunt 2. The Hours 3. The Hitchhiker 4. The Lonely 5. Little Girl Lost
