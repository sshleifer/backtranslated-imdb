The frogs looking for a king or a frogland is Ladislaw Starewicz's most cautious story about people who want the government to solve their problems that I've ever encountered. The irony is that they ask the god Jupiter for their answers. Jupiter sends first a stump and then a stork. Both do not work and the stork is particularly dangerous for the amphibians! The frogs have some human qualities when we see them dressing in the latest fashion of the day, and we see some photos taken or a movie camera used when the stork comes! As I said, this short film is a political allegory that is more suitable for adults than children. In fact, for the first time, I saw this on the Rhino VHS, which had Bambi Meets Godzilla. That alone should tell you what you can expect here!
