Otto Preminger's "The Man with the Golden Arm" is an allusion to heroin addiction - something that was supposed to have been risky before 1955, fifty years ago (today's censors still have a problem with drug content in movies!). <br /> The lead role was originally offered to Marlon Brando and then kidnapped by Frank Sinatra before Brando could answer. Sinatra convincingly portrays a pro-card dealer and ex-heroin addict who returns to the city to face the demons of temptation. Preminger is one of my favorite directors (his "Anatomy of a Murder") "with James Stewart is a brilliant and revolutionary court drama." In the '50s, Preminger changed the face of the cinema quite a bit - "Anatomy of a Murder" was extremely controversial when it came out due to its plot and content (evidence of rape, "slip" for women, etc.). and "The Man with the Golden Arm" deals with a topic that is equally volatile. <br /> <br /> Preminger, however, prefers it without becoming exploitative. This is like a forerunner of "The Panic in the Needle Park" (1971) and has more than a few similarities to the classic Billy Wilder movie "Lost Weekend" with Ray Milland in terms of general motifs. In particular, these three films are probably the best films about alcoholism before the 1980s and are still relevant today.
