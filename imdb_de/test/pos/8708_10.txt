This is a perfect example of a Classic Full Moon Pictures movie. Any fan of horror / vampire flicks should definitely check this. Original plot and good, easy to follow story. In this movie, there are also some exciting scenes in which horror is combined with action. Right now, the only sequel I've seen in this movie is Part IV. I have to say it's almost better than this original. <br /> <br /> I give him 10/10. <br />> Fans of horror movies like this one should check out Puppet Master, Slumber Party Massacre, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures movies.
