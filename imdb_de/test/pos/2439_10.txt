This is one of my favorite movies of all time! Together with Casablanca and Cannibal Holocaust this is a perfect movie theater. Rex Allen tells this wonderful story of a puma who just needs a little love. Includes action, adventure, excitement, comedy and riverbed chaos! SEE THIS FILM IF YOU NEED TO KILL TO DO IT !!! You will not find a better cat picture anywhere, with "cat from outer space" not so close. Charlie's performance is great. Even animal cruelty and intensive logging! I have to love Disney, for all moral failures!
