"Confirmed Dead" is an important episode in the series as it introduces four new characters: the rescue team Naomi contacted before getting a knife from Locke's back. As the quote in my one-line summary suggests, its true purpose on the island may be something completely different. All new characters are intriguing (especially Miles, a kind of psycho / exorcist), but it's too early to make informed judgments at this point. I felt that this episode was a slight departure from "The Beginning Of The End" (this time no flash-forward, instead short-term flashbacks), but it still has some of its awesome moments and eventually fumes up. *** from 4.
