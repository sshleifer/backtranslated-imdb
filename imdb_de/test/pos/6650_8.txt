I really enjoyed this Minghella epic and did not think so much about "The English Patient" (a modern classic). The first 20 minutes or so feel awkward, but when Inman (Jude Law) embarks on the journey to his love of Ava (Nicole Kidman), the film is picked up abruptly and becomes a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. Apparently it's fashionable to hate Kidman right now, but I do not agree at all, and she's doing well here. I actually think that the romance between Inman and Ada in the script is poorly developed (they really do not have much time to build a relationship), but Law and Kidman do it all and convince. Ada's journey is the heart of the film - she becomes a strong woman who can endure almost anything. Zellweger seems ruby ​​at first sight, but she still grows on you and sparkles in many of her later scenes. The film has a beautiful photography and stage design, but never really captures the feel of a historical piece. Especially Jack White has long, stringy hair and a pale rocker complexion that looks totally out of place with the environment. Fans of Cillian Murphy will see the talented Irish actor in an early role, and Natalie Portman actually proves she can perform in what is probably the movie's most eye-catching sequence. It is a pity that she is so inadequate in "The Other Boleyn Girl".
