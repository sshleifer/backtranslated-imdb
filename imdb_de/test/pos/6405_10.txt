It is a shame that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen had such a great talent among writers and actors, a wonderful setting that was the ultimate escapism for those who were in a Sun-locked country. Many of the actors went on to bigger things. Another indication that something wonderful had been lost. I was living in Columbus, Ohio at that time, with all the very big family of my (now ex) husband in a refrain from "NO NO !!" Each time it would be taken over again by a baseball game broadcast. <br /> <br /> Someone who wrote here said he was against 'Rosanne' ... all my ex and I noticed that BASEBALL always preferred it !!!! Yes, FOX has really wasted something wonderful that one and nothing is ever the same ~! Thanks for the memories.
