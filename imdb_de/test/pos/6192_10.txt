The problem with this series is that it's too real. I watch it on Amazon "Unbox" and after I've finished Episode 2, I hate Fark, the leader of the cell. I can not remember a TV series that ever had this emotional impact. Do you remember the old headline for horror movies? "Just say, it's just a movie"? Well, I keep reminding myself that it is "just TV". But of course it's not just TV, is it? The possibility that a cell like the cell pictured here actually operates in the United States is certainly plausible. This gives this program its vicious authenticity. And that's why I hate it so much.
