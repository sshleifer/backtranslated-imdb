This show was in many ways a really good, but certainly an atypical Western, in which the hero (?) Rode on a motorcycle rather than a horse, due to the attitude of 1914 for a Western very "late", which usually tends Set between 1866 and 1890. I remember some controversy over the refusal that I did not really see during his time on NBC. When I saw and loved it, it was a decade later, when I was with the army stationed in Germany, and it was shown on television every week from the beginning. Margot Kidder was famous as Lois Lane at the time, but I will always consider her to be Nichols' friend. In many ways Nichols Maverick was very similar; Both were much more interested in getting rich with little effort than they were fighting. In the small TV magazine that they distributed on the PX (not really an authorized edition of "TV Guide" that looked as similar as possible without getting into copyright issues), I first learned the true story behind the cancellation. I really wonder what the next season would have been with the more violent twin, if they really did do it as planned. At the time of this show, of course, the "western age" of television has been declining for about a decade; One day I hope to be able to write that the "reality era" has been in decline for so long! While "Gunsmoke" and "Bonanza" were still running, both were nearing their end and it was years since a new Western had really prevailed; I think that this trend "Nichols" has held back very much. This was the main reason why NBC managers doubted they would ever find a large audience. But for me, a good Western, unlike a show of today, is timeless, as other "periods" show; Changing fashions and the like does not make them look "outdated" anymore than they actually were, and I think it has ten points when I look at this show, 10 years after it was produced. This show is also an early pair of Garner and Stuart Margolin, who is truly one of the great companions of all time, and not just in westerns.
