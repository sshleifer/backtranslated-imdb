I filmed this movie at Glenwood Cinemas during the Kansas International Film Festival this weekend, which, as usual, offers a thoughtful and eclectic selection of world cinema. <br /> <br /> I've been interested in Australian film for several years, so I was pleased to learn that this movie was recorded and I certainly was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Greatly shot, fixed, it's an eerie story of a man and his journey to the heart of darkness, so to speak. It reminded me a bit of Lynch's Wild at Heart, it has that weird madness in it, but I stuck to the movie for other reasons - because it's a portrait of Australia that's very believable. > <br /> I have vacationed down in the country several times, once in the 1980s and again about 7 years ago with my wife. <br /> <br /> I do not want to spend a lot of time on my holidays, but director Frayne seems to understand a lot of what I find so strange and eccentric that say, Australia, a country responsible for the land, Nick Cave on the one hand and Steve Irwin (the "crocodile hunter") on the other. <br /> <br /> An incy wincy whinge - - I would have liked more unknown Australia. Much more actually. But I also realize that it only takes one and a half hours to get everything in ... "Sigh." <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is very, very successful.
