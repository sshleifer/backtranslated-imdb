The film is described in 1989 in a flashback and Charlie is honored for his role in the defeat of communism. I have to admit that my heart sank when I had to endure a serious, slightly boring and excessively long life story at the thought. How wrong I was, because this short scene is as close as the movie gets boring. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of entertaining and amusing setups and cracking dialogue in some of the most unexpected places. The next scene after the award ceremony is Charlie in a hot tub with a couple of naked women and a man trying to get him to invest in a TV program. Another rather amusing scene is about three quarters of the movie. It consists of Charlie, a group of his sexy secretaries, Phillip Seymour Hoffman's CIA Man, and a bottle of whiskey. As far as the dialogue for a line is concerned, the senator says: "He can teach us writing, but not let it grow." OK, schoolboy I know, but the movie is full of great lines. <br /> <br /> As far as the performances are concerned, Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he's in, as usual. Who is very good in the role of a rather eccentric Texas Oil Millionaire. The War of Charlie Wilson has long been one of the best non-musical biopics, and he is as rare as a movie entertains, amuses and informs alike.
