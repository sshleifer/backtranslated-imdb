I have no idea what the budget was in this movie, but whatever it was, they made it work! I've seen movies that spend 100 times (Pearl Harbor?) And sucked 200 x worse. This movie has everything. David "Makin 'It" Naughton starring as Adam, an average college student who turns into a game called Great AllNighter by Leon. This guy rocks! with a thoughtful game for a group of people, but he not only selects his friends, he has a team of jocks, nerds, fatties, average kids, and of course the team of flounder who are the "bad guys." There is no such thing in this movie Black and white, there are many shades of gray. Adam is not an altruistic hero without mistakes. He treats Alex P. like crap The jocks play dirty, but everyone else! This movie rocks! The scene in the PBR factory? Classic! "Johnny's Obese Male Child?" Can you write a better hint? This stuff is golden Jerry! GOLD! from a different generation, but I love films that seem farfetched but still have roots in reality. That never happened ... but it could ... Eeee e-Gypt .... EEEE .... Easter bunny .... Easter parade! Oh, and watch out for a young Paul Rubens who still works on this Pee-wee character. PS that Devra Clinger was WAR / IS HOT! She must have been a bad actress to stop working in Hollywood. SEE THIS FILM!
