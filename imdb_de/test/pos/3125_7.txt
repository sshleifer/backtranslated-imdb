This film is about two horse dealers who agree to take a small group of Mormons through the desert. On the way they encounter a murderous family of thugs who threaten the peaceful people and endanger their pilgrimage. <br /> <br /> WAGON MASTER is what I would call a "little" John Ford movie, as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of its other westerns. In particular, the big stars like John Wayne are missing in this film, but some of the usual secondary characters are the focus. Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr., and Ward Bond, the longtime actor of Ford's stock, were elevated to lead roles, and perhaps Johnson was the one who came in as "the lead" - though the other two had nearly as much screen time and time Focus. That's not a bad thing, because the movie worked well without the big star - and it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> Well, I do not want to say that I loved the movie. It was very good, but certainly not perfect. In particular, as far as the music is concerned, you will either love or hate them. The music of the sons of the pioneers, I sometimes found a little pouty. It set a nice mood but occasionally seemed to dominate the scenes. I think a little bit worked better. With their unrelenting vocals in the background I also expected that Roy Rogers would emerge at any moment. Another small problem is that the plot was amazingly simple and the end was more of a foregone conclusion. <br /> <br /> However, and I'm glad to say there is an "albeit", though it's more formulaic and sentimental. The film still worked well. This was mainly due to John Ford's nice, usual direction and Ben Johnson's extraordinary performance. He was able to anchor the film perfectly. Another plus for me is that I saw it the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG, another movie about the Mormon walk. While BRIGHAM YOUNG was somewhat stupid and exaggeratedly "holy" in his depictions, the Mormons here were less "perfect" and more like real people - with weaknesses and personalities. Oh, and when you talk about BRIGHAM YOUNG, it seems Jane Darwell was the motto for Mormon movies at the time, as she played an important supporting role in both films. Considering that she died in BRIGHAM YOUNG and she was hired about 20 years before WAGON MASTER, this is a stunt! <br /> <br /> If you want to catch a glimpse of the famous Jim Thorpe, he plays a tiny part in playing indifferent Indian dance around the campfire alongside Jane Darwell.
