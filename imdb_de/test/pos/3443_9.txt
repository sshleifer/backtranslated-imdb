Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator to refer to this film as a fascinating, fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes, as the first ones are the best, while the last are a bit tiring, but for anyone who likes Germans and their good-natured nature, all the episodes are worth watching. Typically German fashion, values ​​are constantly being questioned, even though the murderous Nazi past has been confronted in recent episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended to anyone who wants to live or travel in Germany, preferably in the original language !! <br /> <br />
