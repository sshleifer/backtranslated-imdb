I really liked the movie "JOE". It has really become a cult classic among certain age groups. <br /> <br /> The producer of this film is a personal friend of mine. He is my father-in-law. He lives in Manhattan's west side and has a bungalow. in Southampton, Long Island. His son-in-law lives right next to his bungalow. <br /> <br /> Currently he's not doing any productions but trying his hand at HBO films Mr. Gil is a true gentleman, and I wish he had been able to continue the production business of the move.
