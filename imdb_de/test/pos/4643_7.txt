I recorded this as a mid-80s teenager based on the summary in the cable management (the aspect of the scavenger hunt appealed to me) and I had no knowledge or expectations about the film. What a pleasant surprise! It was such a funny movie and I remember seeing him repeatedly. I thought that the concept was well implemented, I enjoyed the harmless competition between the different groups and I thought the scavenger hunt itself was pretty smart. Sometimes people seem to have far too high expectations for movies. Not all films will have a significant "message" or show, production values ​​or special effects. Sometimes movies are just for entertaining and having fun, and it works on both levels. It was so nice to read the comments of the actors who played the twins. I have not seen this movie in years, but if I did I would have an equally warm and enthusiastic response to how I did it as a teenager. As I type this, snippets of the cheesy but fitting title song run through my head: "When the midnight madness comes to you ... it does not matter what you say, it does not matter what you do ...!"
