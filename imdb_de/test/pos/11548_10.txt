Oh dear God ! I can truly say that Maya Angelou is one of the most fascinating and important people in the world, especially in my culture. She is so inspiring and her story is the story of a great woman! When I first picked up on this film, I thought the cast was beautifully composed, now we see it in action! Maya Angelou is already my favorite PoetEss and now one of my favorite actresses and spokespersons. I believe that she is the greatest of all times. This film had me on the edge of my seat, reaching out to Kleenex, reminding myself that no matter where you come from, if you decide you're going to be great, you'll be great! And Ester Rolle played a wonderful supporting role ...... 100% AWESOME ... and now even "I know why the Caged Bird is singing".
