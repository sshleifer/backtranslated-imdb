I really appreciate what Jung-won did before he died. Everything. I want to say that his choice for love is selfless. If he chose da-rim, that's good for him. But Da-rim needs more time to recover from his death. Obviously he does not want to let it happen. As in the movie, he decided to give up. So it was just a temporary pain for Da-rim. <br /> <br /> For comparison, my life without me is very different. Their behavior shows a big difference between eastern culture and western culture. I can not say which is better. Everyone can have the right to vote. That's up to you. Life is the same for everyone. We can only live once. Any choice is acceptable if only you think it is suitable for you. <br /> <br /> In truth, the slow pace of the movie can not be an excuse for refusing the movie. Just calm down. You get more out of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best Korean movies I have ever seen. 9.10
