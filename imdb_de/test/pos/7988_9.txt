When I rented Batman Returns for the first time, I immediately thought it would be less than extraordinary. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so how could there be a good movie without him? Simply, throw in Danny DeVito. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is a darker movie than Batman. There are more villains here, less dark comedy in many aspects and more nerve-racking themes. However, the music is similar to the first, if not darker. The landscape is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail except for the season. This movie follows the same comic format we love at the first Batman. <br /> <br /> Now for the performances. Michael Keaton gratefully returns as Batman / Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first movie and also in this sequel. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton, as Batman needs MORE! Danny DeVito gave an award-winning performance as The Penguin, the most heinous, disgusting, lovable, angry, vicious, saddest and saddest villain who ever graced a superhero movie. You hate him so much and at the same time you feel so bad for him. And it explains it to the last detail, which makes it all the more contradictory. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman / Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She also has a lot of background story. Christopher Walken did not disappoint as Max Shreck, the greedy, selfish, selfish CEO of the energy company. Thankfully, Michael Gough returns as the lovable Alfred, and he was just as good here. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, though I think he has never really been in the limelight. <br /> <br /> With many great twists and turns, Batman Returns will surely delight any fan of the original. <Br /> <br /> 9/10
