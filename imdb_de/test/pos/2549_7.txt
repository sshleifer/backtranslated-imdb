I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani's Man Push Cart, and this movie is just as good. This piece of life is almost a documentation of how life is lived on the edges. Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do a great job as a 12-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister living in a small room above a car shop. There are no parents. They survived alone. Ali complements his income by stealing car parts, selling bootleg DVDs and selling candy in the subway. Izzie supplements her income by selling herself. They try to make money for their own truck. <br /> <br /> One is tempted to express outrage that these two children must stand alone, and certainly Izzie can be very upset about selling their bodies to willing truckers, but the fact is that today this is the richest country in the world World exists, not in an underdeveloped country. Save the indignation and do something.
