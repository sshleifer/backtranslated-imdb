One should not consider the second function of the director too critical. <br /> <br /> I really like the camera work of Madiba. As Mr. Shawn pointed out, he had a unique view of things. <br/> <br /> But how come a 14-year-old boy shoots such beautiful pictures? Remember, he has no education. I do not think English is the common language in the ghettos in Cape Town. Even worse, Madiba looks even smaller than his presumed age of 14. If you overcome the above peculiarities, you can still watch the movie and still enjoy it because the camera works well.
