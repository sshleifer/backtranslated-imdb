When I was young, I was a big fan of the Naked Gun movies, but recently I watched the show Police Sqaud! and I think it's great! Leslie Nielson is fantastic, Alan North is cool and who is Rex Hamilton? Nevertheless, it is a stupid show. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of this show, playing the still scene during the credits. I think my favorite is when Norberg (not O.J.) comes in during the scene and he tries to fit into the still image. Classic! <br /> <br /> The only problem for me is that the cigarette gag gets very old (when Drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks "Cigarette?"), and the person answers, "Yes, I know.") I think so They've used it too often of whatever. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good gags, great show! <br /> <br /> 7/10
