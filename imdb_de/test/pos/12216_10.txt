Surface is one of the best shows I have ever seen. NBC is so stupid to break off a great show like this, and worse, it's only half full. NBC or another person should give Surface at least one more season to complete. It's as if NBC has given you a book to read, and halfway they decide to take it away from you, and then you can never figure out the end. I just want to see what happens to everyone, and most of all, what happens to Nim. I think I can say for sure that most Surface fans want to save Nim! Nim has taken away all our hearts and NBC just cuts them in two. Come on, NBC, give Surface another season!
