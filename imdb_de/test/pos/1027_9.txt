Like a previous commentary, I saw it in 1980 and never was able to shake the memory of the gripping story, the great drama, and the dramatic music. It certainly contains some of the best work of Sam Waterston. He and the writers portray Oppenheimer not only as unjustly endured heroes - which he was - but also as naive, alcoholic and snobbish, a well-rounded portrait instead of a clich√©.
