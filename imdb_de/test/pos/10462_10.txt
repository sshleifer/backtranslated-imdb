This is one of the best movies I've ever seen ... the stark landscape ... the isolation ... the ignorant bigotry people hiding behind their religion ... a setting for some wit and sophistication ... Acting is natural ... but for me as a "foodie", the best is the actual selection and preparation of the festival. I've spent some time in Paris and know the kitchen well ... if the Cafe Anglais really exists or not, I prefer I do not know, but I know similar establishments and the menu and selection of Babette wines are authentic .. and of course the end, despite the perfect meal, the return to friendship is the only end that could give 10 out of 10 movies and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it
