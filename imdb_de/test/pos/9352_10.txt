What a nice movie! Unfortunately, the 1947 script did not follow the book from which it was adapted, but murdering a homosexual would have been too hot at that time to cope with it. <br /> <br /> I thought it all The performances were outstanding, as well as the script, the direction, the brilliant black and white camera, the music and the film noir atmosphere. I understand that the film in 1947 was not racist against blacks or prejudices against homosexuals. (Robert Young's account of prejudice against his Irish grandfather, who lived through this racism 100 years ago, was rather lame, but times dictated that the film avoids further research on racism.) I've done one remark and one Ask the Audience: 1. Did you notice that Robert Young did not point at his gun when he shot Robert Ryan, who ran fast in the dark and shot Young from an upper window into the dark. 2. If Robert Young's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 (the movie was shot in 1947) and Young was 40, the timeline would not be logical. If the grandfather had been killed 50 years ago, the timeframe would be realistic.
