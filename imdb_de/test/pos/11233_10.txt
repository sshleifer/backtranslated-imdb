The Polish brothers are unique film artists and they have really taken the envelope here. A fantasy that has some similarities with "Wings of Desire". "Northfork" tells the story of a small 1950s town in the middle of nowhere, two days before the flood, thanks to the wishes of the US government, stands a reservoir at the place where the city stands. It's a weird parable about loss and remembrance, with angels, dreams, forebodings, and the most amusing government officials who have been reclaiming since Repo Man. The performances are all excellent, especially Nolte and Woods. As I read some of the comments, I noticed that there are people who were simply insulted by the fact that the Polish twins use elliptical narrative tactics, and I would say that's one of the reasons why this movie is so great: its willingness to do that Mysterious as an aspect of everyday life to accept. David Mullen's cinematography is breathtaking. Highly recommended; If you have suffered a significant personal loss, for example, the death of a parent, I would even call this movie a necessary look. - beam
