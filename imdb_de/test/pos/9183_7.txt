That's the promise of the trailer I saw and hired with Hitch. Specifically, a serious film viewer should not expect much more from this title, but surprisingly, Smith, Mendes, James, and Valletta managed to achieve a theatrical performance that was metaphorically summed up in their rap dancefloor routine at the end of the film: Theirs Characters made an effective combination that will make more than a good laugh on Sunday afternoon with this DVD, provided your date is not an exquisite, French-Swedish director of the '60s, the movie fan. <br /> <br /> PS: The techniques to be evaluated are all TRUE, especially the "Cocktail Girl" routine!
