I love this movie about a columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a great homemaking magazine that delivers an inviting article each month that details her great home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful home in Connecticut. The problem occurs when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a World War II hero as guests during the Christmas break. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small apartment in New York, is not married and has no baby - and can not cook at all! Merriment (and romance) arises when she tries to perform a credible act to save the face from being fired by the owner of the magazine (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is a delightful comedy; one that I can warmly recommend to classic movie lovers !!!!
