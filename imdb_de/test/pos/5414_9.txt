This movie is full of little surprises, many of which are funny. The fact that it is written and directed by a 24-year-old hurts me. Some of the scenes where the high school students use Ecstasy made me feel very uncomfortable because I had a kid of that age and I could imagine how they used it. As a parent of a teenager, I found the depictions of the parent-child interactions absolutely on time. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the many little jokes of the movie and I liked that not everything makes sense and not all the problems were solved in the end. To rewrite Mark Twain, truth is stranger than fiction, for fiction is required to abide by what is possible while truth is not. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that plays with the viewer People are what other people think, only to realize later that the people we thought were right did not know the real situation. One of the movie's strongest scenes, a scene where we feel very relieved and sympathetic about what the character is doing, is based on a completely wrong assumption, and the figure, though admirable, is completely wrong. It's very subtle, I think. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> I really liked the score - I thought that really helped the movie, set the mood right - the movie has a few moments of the ball and the background music helps. <br /> <br /> The Valedictorian speech is a scream and a half - a big laugh! The movie is really in my head - I saw it this morning. I'll try to see it again if time permits. Ten are hard to come by, but a solid nine in my book.
