This film is hard to describe in a way that is hard to describe. The description of the events before and the subsequent investigation into the World Trade Center's first attempt at destruction in 1993, now after 9/11, is pretty accurate, but it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> It would be a mistake to call this movie prophetic, but it definitely makes up the common wisdom of the playground: "Be ashamed of me, be twice ashamed", comes alive. <br /> <br /> Our government has learned Nothing shows the attempt of the World Trade Center of 1993 and the subsequent readings of the 9/11 report that many of the mistakes that led to the bombings in 1993 were repeated. Some have criticized the First and Fourth Amendments of the US Constitution, which are partly responsible for Islamic terrorists being able to implement their evil plans, but that is wrong in every way. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the people who support this argument do not support a ban on freedom of expression, a free press or freedom of religion? In any case, I hope that they will not help our government officials break into a person's apartment or office to seek for no reason or warrant. The fact is that the FBI, the INS, and even the local The police could have been given arrest warrants based on the information they had in their possession, but decided to do so for several reasons. No matter how disgusting or ignorant, it is not illegal to talk badly about America or its leaders. Likewise, it is not illegal either to have your own weapons or to pray towards Mecca. <br /> <br /> Consider this: Until Lee Harvey Oswald actually fired his rifle at President John Kennedy, he did not really break the law. Living in a free society has its disadvantages. <br /> <br /> Still, Path To Paradise is a movie I absolutely saw. As far as I know, it's not on DVD and 2007 is its tenth anniversary, and there are no known revivals of it. <br /> <br /> I'm not really surprised people do not like to document their mistakes and this movie undoubtedly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us did not do their jobs properly and for the simplest reasons, such as: , As judicial clashes and refusal to share information, that's a shame as Path To Paradise is well done and gripping and as many have said, the last scene in which Ramzi Yousef (played by Art Malik), the bomber that built the truck bomb used in the first attempt to destroy the two towers. Passing the World Trade Center after being captured and delivered, it simply says, "Next time we'll bring both down, "is a movie moment that freezes me for a few minutes.
