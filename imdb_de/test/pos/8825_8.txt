When watching this PPV, I had high expectations, as Smackdown is the best show in WWE. This is a very good PPV as it is the last one before Wrestlemania. FIRST GAME HARDY BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W / MELINA IN A 6 MAN DAY TEAM GAME Good way to start the game. It started a bit slow in the beginning, but later the pace got faster and the game became more exciting and entertaining. Benoit rolls through and lets Joey Mercury win the victory for the Hardy Boys and him. 6/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND GAME GREGORY HELMETS {CHAMPION} VS. SHANNON MOORE VS. FUNAKI VS. CHAVO GUERRERO VS. DAIVAIRI VS. SCOTTY 2 HOTTY VS. JAMIE NOBLE VS. JIMMY WANG YANG IN AN OPEN CRUISERWEIGHT INVITATION GAME FOR THE WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP I'm a big fan of Cruiserweights and I'll never be disappointed if I see them here. Chavo Guerrero brings Jimmy Frang Splash to the Frog Splash to claim victory and become the new WWE cruiserweight champion. 5/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD GAME FINLAY & LITTLE BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN This was not really a wrestling match, it was more like a comedy match, though it was not a clear wrestling contest, it still entertained me with the funny antics. Finlay meets little Boogeyman with the Shillaegh to win. Boogeyman does not deserve to be in a PPV and does not deserve to be in WWE. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FOUR GAME CANE VS. KING BOOKER W / SHARMELL This was a surprisingly good match. I thought it was mediocre, but it turned out to be a real wrestling contest. Hats off to both men and a very entertaining match. Kane wins after a chokeslam on King Booker. 6/10 <br /> <br /> FIVE GAMES PAUL London & BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} VS. DEUCE & DOMINO W / CHERRY FOR THE WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS Not really good for a good match. Deuce & Domino need more training to fight, and London & Kendrick are the only ones to keep this match fast. London and Kendrick keep their titles after Kendrick has one of the boys for the win. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH GAME BOBBY LASHLEY {CHAMPION} VS. SIR. KENNEDY FOR THE ECW CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. Kennedy attacks Lashley from behind before the game begins. It was a good game, but not really good. Lashley & Kennedy have a bit of chemistry, but not enough to get a good match. Kennedy wins by DQ after Lashley has nailed him with a chair, and attacks him with the chair to the entrance. Lashley still retains his title. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SEVEN GAME - JOHN CENA & SHAWN MICHAELS VS. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the best tag team game I have ever seen. Hats off to all these men {yes, even Batista}, who are as close as a 5-star classic to the Main Event. All four men played their games very well as this was a very great and entertaining tag team match. Batista turns his back on the Undertaker and leaves the ring behind. Then he leaves the ring, causing Michaels to nail Sweet Chin Music, then Cena, to find an F-U for the hard-fought victory. 7/10 <br /> <br /> I do not know why everyone says that this PPV is not good enough or boring, I just do not get it. It's a great PPV that Smackdown always delivers. A great PPV indeed. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give 8/10 & a B +
