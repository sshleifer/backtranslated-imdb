A young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major role in a staged piece as Lady Macbeth, as the production diva has fallen in front of a moving car. Betty (Christina Marsillach) is an achievement that has been honored with her awards, and instead finds horror because the one who is blamed for getting to that point terrorizes her cruelly. <br /> <br /> First, her stage manager friend Stefano (William McNamara) stabbed to death with a knife, tied to a pillar in his uncle's sprawling mansion, so that his eyes can not close, thanks to needles, which were glued under their eyes, and if they blink, a result. Betty allows her to escape and finds herself in this unfortunate position again, when there is a certain gold chain in her Lady Macbeth wardrobe, which the madman had torn to pieces after she had killed a number of crows coming out of her cage in the equipment room They had fled from the clothing designer, who was first hit with an iron on the floor and then pierced by a pair of scissors (.. To cover this vile scene, the chain falls into her neck, the killer must cut her neck find it; while Dario does not specifically elaborate on this act, Dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors to get the most out of it, with the camera often retreating into the dead face of the victim, Inspector Alan Santini (Urbano Barberini, who, at Dario's request, turns him cold and boring plays) promises to get the nerves, while Betty remained on her few Friends, the theater director Marco (Ian Charleson of GHANDI & CHARIOTS OF), who would later die of AIDS: a sad footing revealed to Dario in an interview that Charleson told him at the end of the shoot that he was HIV positive. He tried it after a successful horror film career, though he was rejected by critics and a buddy Mira (Daria Nicolodi, Dario's previous squeeze), her agent and self-confident. But the serial killer is pretty driven and a showdown between them will of course take place in the theater, as Marco has added an interesting change to the production with the crows available to him. I think that's something Dario is of his wildest and most nihilistic. Although he later certainly made cruel films (as suggested by his Masters of Horror contributions and SLEEPLESS), this film really enhances pure violence against the victims of the psychopath. His method of forcing Betty to watch was, admittedly, a gimmick by Dario of the kind of audience that likes to stay away from the dreadful parts of horror movies. I rubbed my eyes every time she had to blink (brilliant: Dario shoots the stitch from the face of the face and, in our view, produces a tormenting effect, as if we were the ones with the Scotch needles open our eyes hold ). I like how Dario will show Betty's broader eyes, appalled by what she's forced to watch as little blood tears down the needles when she has no choice but to blink. The photographic work of Ronnie Taylor is impeccable, such as the view of the crow, which was taken at the end of the theater in the search for the murderer. Or when the camera "travels" through the rooms of the theater and follows the murderer, who wants to see his muse from a box seat. Or the dream sequence in which we are implicated in Betty's memory of an event caused by a particular killer regarding her mother's death, wearing the same mask and gloves as the one currently causing her trauma. The highlight, in my opinion, is the peephole shot sequence, masterfully staged by everyone involved as the camera follows a bullet that shoots through the eye of a victim, explodes from the back of her head and goes through a phone that Betty plans for is to call for help. We even get a crow picking the eyeball from the killer (to supplement this vicious scene, the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling around in its beak). The only aspect I did not care about, often from commentators on the film, is the "final" ending that I personally thought was unnecessary, but Dario wanted to point out that Betty was not really like her mother. a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies, which refers in one phrase to why the killer tortures our heroine. The rock music used in the violent scenes did not bother me, because I felt that those moments of evil graphic attacks required a shattering blow that heavy metal could often offer.
