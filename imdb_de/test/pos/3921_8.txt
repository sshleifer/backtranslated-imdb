Before I saw House of Wax, I was convinced that it was simply a low-quality Second Slalher movie following in the footsteps of films like The Darkness or Amityville Horror. After seeing an advanced show on my college campus, I can honestly say that the people at Dark Castle did a great job making a slasher. <br /> <br /> Starting with the usual staple foods of a teenage horror movie, such as a small group of friends making a road trip, they find a strange detour that takes them through the country's back roads, hitting spooky locals Slow but obligatory backstory, this movie really gets a quick clip. Paris Hilton appears in this movie, as many already know, but I really have to give it to her for her icy performance. Obviously, her acting was not Oscar-worthy, but the filmmakers use their appearance to the fullest, pushing two blatant satires of their, as they say, less noble media appearances into this film. Ms. Hilton also claims the title for the film's biggest death scene, and not just because it was her death scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is brimming with troubled moments and cheap fear, but Jaume Serra has definitely created quality tension and tension between characters. The causes of the horror are partly because the audience cares about the characters we do. The usual setup was followed by a loud noise, tearing the camera into some other formidable moments. These standard movie techniques inherited from many previous films are almost perfected with this film and offer many good horrors. In fact, there is no slow moment after coming to the little town that houses the dreaded House of Wax Museum. <br /> <br /> This film is due to many earlier films of this and other genres, although I'm not sure how much comes from the original 1953 movie of the same title. References to such films as Texas Chainsaw Masacres, Saw and even Titanic (see Paris Hilton's great death scene and you know what I mean) are common, but in the end the payoff will make you feel anxious and satisfied when you're looking for it a good scare with a few laughs. Not bad.
