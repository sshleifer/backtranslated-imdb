Putney Swope is the story of a black man on the board of a major advertising company that was accidentally elected chairman of the board when the owner of the company overturned when he tried to stutter an idea about which he was apparently quite excited. Of course, Putney takes his new role to heart and fires most of the agency, hires a new crew (all but a white guy black) and continues to extract the most offensive and non-PC commercials that one does could ever ask for. Now it's a pretty colorful crew, and yet they somehow manage to succeed with the cash. I like the scene where potential advertisers are relieved of cash and then asked to "come out". And their commercials will follow later, whether they are or not. The story is good, but the highlight here is of course the unpleasant commercials themselves, especially the "Face Off" acne cream. This is rather outdated, but still a funny movie and full of funny moments. At that time Robert Downey Sr. was working for an advertising agency that produced experimental ads, and I think this was his middle finger for the agencies of Madison Avenue. Very good and damn funny. 8 out of 10.
