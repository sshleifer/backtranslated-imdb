I scarcely know where to write about this gem except to say that it represents the young Buster Keaton at the peak of his power and certainly must be counted among the half-dozen best comedies ever made. THE GOAT consists of twenty minutes of smooth, expertly photographed, nicely done gags; two quills of uninterrupted comic-fiction driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia, yet somehow leading to a happy ending - which was not always the case with Buster's comedies. (See COPS for a case where fatalism was ultimately superior, or ONE WEEK for defeating defeatism.) If I had to describe this movie in a word, I would call it "effortless," but if I were allowed two I would would call it "seemingly effortless," because there's certainly a lot of hard work going into creating a comic opus that unfolds with such lofty ease. Nevertheless, they did not call him the Great Stone Face for nothing: Buster never let him sweat. <br /> <br /> A sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is "in Millionaires Row," that is, on a bread line in a bleak urban environment, where Buster waits patiently at the end of the line and is consequently not fed. It must be stressed, however, that he does not for a moment play for pathos; Buster has our sympathy, but he never asks. After a series of accidents, coincidences and absurd misunderstandings, Buster is thought to be a runaway killer named Dead Shot Dan. He is persecuted by every policeman for miles and yet he is obviously dismayed by this turn of events never a hint of self-pity or even surprise; We have the feeling that he always knew that this would keep life for him and that he did not have time to get angry. He has to find new ways to evade this policeman and escape the latest trap. <br /> <br /> Just as Buster renounces sympathy, he never seems to laugh, which is particularly impressive because THE GOAT must be one of the most laughing short comedies there is. This is the movie that shows the iconic shot of Buster driving the cow catcher of a train to the lens of the camera, which is not exactly a gag, but certainly provokes laughter in its own peculiar way. There are now gags with guns, dogs, policemen, an incredibly furry mustache and a clay statue of a horse melting under Buster's weight (a truly surreal sight), but some of the biggest Boffos are rescued for the finale when Buster is Big Joe Roberts, a plump policeman who happens to be the star of Virginia Fox, tries to escape his primary nemesis. Buster jumps into Big Joe's dining room, jumps over him and drives through a mirror. He turns a telephone booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear. Finally, he uses the elevator to free himself from his pursuer and win the girl in time for a final fading gag. <br /> <br /> To say more would be a disadvantage for first time visitors. I only wish I could see this movie in a theater full of people who had never seen it before and let the laughter float. Live music accompaniment would be nice too; By the way, the music that Kino is making available for their home video / DVD version of THE GOAT is first-rate and serves as the icing on the cake for an already delicious cake.
