"MY WIFE AND KIDS" is in my opinion an absolute ABC classic! I did not see every episode, but I liked it anyway. There are many episodes I have enjoyed. One of them was the place where Junior (George O. Gore II) received his driver's license. If you want to know why, you must have seen it yourself. Before I summarize, I would like to say that everyone has always performed well. The production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. To sum up, even though it is syndicated now, it is strongly recommended to catch it, just in case it gets out of the air forever.
