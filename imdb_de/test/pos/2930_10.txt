This is a simple episode ad after watching all Season 11 episodes (except the Imaginationland trilogy). This is the one who made the most laugh. My favorite so far is the 11th season a toy store a kid who has the Tourette syndrome and comes up with a new idea for Cartman. You can imagine that Cartman now has the Tourette Syndrome and is great, since Kyle, as soon as he knows how he "fakes" is. Cartman is definitely on fire, telling the teachers, the headmaster and everyone he wants. On the other hand, we have Kyle, who is now the intolerant, basically because he claimed Cartman pretended he was brought to children with Tourette syndrome, just to show him that Tourette syndrome is real and great because Kyle is "good" Maybe somebody makes a fake to have Tourette's for fun. "In short, Kyle could not explain that Cartman was faking my favorite scene in this episode is likely to be when Cartman is with Kyle, but Immediately after this scene, another boy who just fakes Cartman, the boy with Tourette, who was in the toy store, Cartman said to this kid essentially, "Is not Tourette's awesome." But to say whatever he wants and To be a brave boy for everyone is just the beginning for Cartman, his master plan: to go on national television and say whatever he wants ("People call it brilliant television, they will probably exist.) I bi n 'an Emmy "- fantastic, in this episode the word" s *** "is used 26 times, and surely that's not all. South Park won an Emmy like a month before this episode aired). But there is a twist here, Cartman basically has all the bricks removed from the wall, he says everything now without thinking, so we hear from Cartman that he got his bed wet last night. Now Cartman is not kidding and he says "I can not control what I say" and certainly the person who was with him is like "of course you can not control what you say you have Tourettes" so Cartman is like " my Tourette has gotten worse before I blew out cool stuff that Jews are lame and so, but now it's really gotten bad ". There are also things about Chris Hansen and To Catch a Predator. In fact, what happened to a pervert here happens to many other perverts. Kyle and Thomas were behind to stop Cartman. Kyle is Cartman's savior! Fantastic! <br /> <br /> TSA VOICES CONCERN on "South Park" October 3 Episode <br /> <br /> On Wednesday, October 3, the cable network Comedy Central will broadcast an episode of the animated series "South" Park "In which one of the young characters, Cartman," gets "the Tourette syndrome, given the nature of this program, we fully expect it to be offensive and insensitive to TS members and numerous calls and emails from our members and the TS community is coming in. <br /> <br /> We've already made arrangements for strikes, such as the request that Comedy Central, during or after the show, announce our public service announcement (featuring comedian Richard Lewis) Once the episode is aired and we can see exactly how TS is rendered, we will be able to answer the authors with specific problems and issues we have with the show. <br /> <br / > "We are Englisch: www.goethe.de/ges/m It is actually astonishing that the creators took so long to use TS as a comedy feed in this program because it does not prohibit disability, illness or controversial issues, "said Judit Ungar, president of the TSA. <br /> <br /> "We always view the presentation of TS (good and bad) as a chance for education and education, and a representation of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception and gives the TSA the opportunity to provide factual information about the Disruption, "said Tracy Colletti. Flynn, Public Relations and Communications Manager, TSA. <br /> <br /> We will post an official statement on this site where the TSA will respond to the program after the show. <br /> <br /> TSA RESPONDS on "South Park" Episode <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as was the case with far too many media depictions of the population With Tourette Syndrome (TS), the season opener of South Park ("Le Petit Tourette", 10-3-07), the myth that most of TS sufferers have involuntary outbreaks of unfair language has been further perpetuated. Indeed, 85-90% of people with TS never experience this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom (medically referred to as coprolalia). For viewers who are less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, could the misleading enthralling message not be clearer? If you do not curse, you have no TS. <br /> <br /> Despite our fears of broadcasting, we acknowledge that the episode was surprisingly well researched. Despite the greatly exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia, surprisingly much accurate information was transmitted to the attentive viewer. The scripted contributions from parents, a neurologist, colleagues and the therapy session with the "TS Child Support Group" served as a clever way to make these facts accessible to the public. "Undoubtedly, this episode in South Park has raised the national awareness of TS, yet we are very concerned that TS schoolchildren may be mocked and even bullied by insensitive colleagues who may have seen the program," said Judge Ungar, TSA President , "We know that writers' satirical parodies have spared no group of celebrities, the disabled, or political figures for over a decade, and the fact that TS has been the subject of popular television shows that the public is so much more aware of the disorder Obviously, the heightened awareness that we have worked too hard can sometimes turn out to be a double-edged sword. "<br /> <br /> The TSA contacted the program managers before broadcast, and we will contact them again. Maybe we will succeed in making it a chance for positive TS awareness.
