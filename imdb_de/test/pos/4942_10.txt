This game was one of the main reasons why I actually got a PS2. I remember playing Soul Edge (sometimes called the Soul Blade) that day, and I loved it. <br /> <br /> I played the Original Soul Calibur, but I never had the chance to play it for a huge amount of time. However, I bought the Gamecube version of Soul Calibur II, and that's what really intrigued me, and I was thrilled to hear from Soul Calibur III. This game still gives us the classic characters like Mitsurugi, Cervantes, Nightmare and Taki. However, there are also some new characters like Zasalamel, Tira and the unplayable Night Terror. (The true boss of Tales of Souls) The strategy-based "Chronicles of the Sword" mode is a new feature that I really like, it can be quite challenging in the later chronicles, but is a good addition to the series. <br /> <br /> In Soul Arena mode, there are several missions in which you have to fight a certain enemy under certain circumstances. (The exception is Final Battle, where you just have to defeat Night Terror.) It's another fine touch that makes the game even more fun. <br /> <br /> In some scenes in Tales of Should you should be prompted Press certain keys to get a different result. This can be done to avoid / block an attack or to achieve a better end. (Each character has two ends) All in all, this is an excellent game and I would recommend it if you are a fan of fighting games.
