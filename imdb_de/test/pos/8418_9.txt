I'm a Maharashtrian, a teenager living in the 21st century, and it's obvious that I do not even like Bollywood or even Marathi movies. When I saw Shwaas, I had a unique feeling that only an extremely effective movie can produce. <br /> <br /> It is a fact that the film, like most Indian films, has its own true and complete effect only in the original language. Much of the movie's emotions and meanings are embedded in its Marathi dialogues, which, however hard it is tried, can not be effectively translated into English. Shwaas explores the relationship between the two a grandparent and a child. And it fully lives up to this strong bond. Dialogues like "mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe" (My parscha is also a million) increase the emotion. Anyone who has closely monitored the relationship between grandparents and children can get involved in the situation depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is definitely worth looking at. It's a movie that deeply impressed me. I will definitely recommend it to anyone!
