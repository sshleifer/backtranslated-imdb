I would say that this movie is disturbing. The brutality is presented in a very sick way, it is like a psychosis in 40 minutes. At the same time, it is a cruel introspection of human behavior. The scenes are cruel and begin with the slaughter of the horse and end with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. Every emotion is extremely exploited, the butcher's frustration, the love for his daughter almost incestuous, the anger when he learns that she has been abused, every feeling is so natural and so wrong. This film delivers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way. The message of the film is that a person's life can change in a second as a result of his or her behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the strongest and can determine one's own actions. I was thrilled with the unique style of filming, simplicity and brutality, accompanied by the silence in which only inner thoughts permeate.
