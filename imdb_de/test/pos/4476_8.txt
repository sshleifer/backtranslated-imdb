An excellent story well told by the filmmaker. The interactions between the man and the leopard asked the audience many questions about who was human. People killed the animals for no reason just to survive. At the end of the movie, you wondered who the real "hero" of the movie is. A well told story. The human actor did a great job, but the leopard stole every scene he was in.
