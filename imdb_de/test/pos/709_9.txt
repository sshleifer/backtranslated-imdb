A movie that has earned theater release. This television movie is a cinematic jewel that illustrates Michael Mann's technique of moving contemporary music that is tightly integrated with visual images. With Mr. Mann, amplifying the influence of the music is almost as if an ensemble of cast, writer, director, and cameraman are added to an invisible actor honored with Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely one of my favorites. Although nothing is perfect, this movie comes very close. <br /> <br /> In addition to an outstanding screenplay, great direction and a masterly play by Richard Strauss, there is an all-star ensemble of the finest character actors: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Louder; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard minor; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You can not recognize the names, but you will recognize every face. <br /> <br /> When this pops up on TV, pop in on popcorn, turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and a score, and get ready to be tied to the 97 minutes of the movie. I highly recommend the recording, as it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland and DVD Region 2 is encoded.
