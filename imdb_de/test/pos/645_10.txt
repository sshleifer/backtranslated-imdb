I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a love job for Eleanor Bergstein. The main characters (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Beals, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) were very well selected and played their roles superbly. It was a very uplifting movie that I wish it was available on tape or DVD. A rare gem.
