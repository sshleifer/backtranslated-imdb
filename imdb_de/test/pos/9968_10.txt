I saw the Merchant of Venice last week in London. Great show by Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins. Compared to other films based on Shakespeare's play, this production has made the play so easy to understand and follow. Bravo to Michael Radford for directing such top actor. The costume and the scenery are great and since it was filmed on location in Venice, there is the movie and the authentic flair. I had read the play at school over thirty years ago and the emphasis was on the antisemitic behavior of the characters towards the Jews and the cruelty of the Christians. I do not know if this movie is going to be controversial, but I'm sure he will receive only a few Oscar nominations.
