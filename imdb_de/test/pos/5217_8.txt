He is very good at this role as a dissatisfied and bored husband, an excellent Air Force officer bored with his predictable suburban life and deciding to make a radical change. <br /> <br /> One evening he meets Karen Sillas, an attractive woman who is younger than his current wife. A relationship develops, and Cole decides to take it to the next level. <br /> <br /> He not only has an affair, but fakes his death to escape his family responsibilities. Lies become more and more a pattern as he begins to rob banks, to make his new wife (Sillas) happy, and to project the image that he is a success. Apparently a fictitious illusion. <br /> <br /> This was also based on a true story that makes it all the more fascinating. Cole is believable and outstanding in these roles. Recommended. 8.10.
