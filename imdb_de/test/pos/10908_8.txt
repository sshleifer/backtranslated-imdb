The first and far better of the two gay roles of Kevin Kline. (The second is the dreary "De-Lovely" in which he played Cole Porter.) Inspired by Tom Hanks' emotional acceptance speech for "Philadelphia", in which he played his high school drama teacher, the nominated film was in this version obviously more "Forrest Gump" than "Philadelphia". Here is the Hanks character played by Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> The reaction scenes in most films are very funny and, as has often been said, particularly effective, as was done by Kevin himself, Debbie Reynolds. Tom Selleck (a brave step, as he himself was the target of such rumors, which he denied!), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as the final smeared bride. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks' real teacher criticized the closing scene that people do not act that way in real life. However, this is a farce and not a real life. That being said, it's not as effective as it could be, and the misdirection of the last "wedding scene" that makes Tom and Kevin look like they're rushing, I found quite pointless, annoying and a policeman out. <Br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie for me is, of course, Kevin's scene with the how-to-a-real-man tape, and it's funny, but by no means realistic, if the tape responds to Kevin's reaction Actions. <br /> <br /> On the whole, a shout!
