TV news producer Jane Craig (Hunter) meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), an emerging news presenter, at a seminar, and her mutual attraction leads her back to her room. The romance, however, is interrupted when it turns out that Tom is in his own words "no good in what I'm successful," and Jane realizes that he personifies everything she hates about television news. The maturity comes when Tom reveals that he's about to join their Washington office. <br /> <br /> Jane and Tom's first appeal will therefore be given a second chance, but Jane will be able to share her professional opinion of the man she feels attracted to - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is Jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and confidant. Despite his obvious talent, Aaron's career stands in the absence of people's self-confidence and abilities - and the classic look - to succeed as his new, less skilled and less intelligent colleague - Tom - becomes. He is also worried that his good friend Jane might fall in love with Tom despite her better judgment, as it becomes increasingly clear that Aaron has his own romantic feelings for her. <br /> <br /> This pivotal romantic conspiracy is set in the trials and tribulations of a television news network where moral dilemmas and ethics are quickly fought, and apparitions and dramatic effects become more and more important. <br /> <br /> Here comes most of the bite of having well-watched comments and scenes. One of many moments is a scene in which Tom first meets Bill Rorich (a cinematographer for Jack Nicholson), the network's best moderator, and the camera focuses on her handshake. In a movie full of great lines and dialogues, long and short, one of these two men becomes much aware of this short shot of two hands. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the characters is one of the smartest wits you'll ever find anywhere in the movie and in such abundance. Brooks gets the best part of them, according to his character, but even the shortest conversations that happen to be heard by one or more characters as they move through a crowded room should be heard. <Br/> <br /> Hunter is a tour-de-force in this role, for which she rightly (and not only) was nominated for an Oscar and for which she would probably have come if it was a role in It's not part of the company that has developed into a closely related industry - and against a strong performance by another actress in a more traditional feel-good Rome com. Brooks is also terrific as she is constantly frustrated. Occasionally too complacent for her own, Aaron Altman. <br/> <br/> Hurt, who has the look and personality he needs for his character, does not always convince him that he is so weak. The character says he is or should be. He has a latent intelligence that allows him to take advantage of his obvious limitations, which can be plausible, but I do not think Hurt does it right. Besides, when he tells us that he "stinks" or "does not understand," Hurt looks a little smarter. Otherwise, it's an effective performance in which his character is affected by his intellectual limitations, but Brooks and Hunter overshadow Hurt's performance. It's the only negative thing I can say about the whole movie, and who says everyone else would have done better or better would have done, playing alongside Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this movie. <Br /> <br /> Support is provided by, among others, Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack, and Christian Clemenson plays a role in the role of the later Boston Legal and the shortest role of Joan's brother John Cusack, whose face you do not look once. <br /> <br /> James L. Brooks has provided us with many great TV shows and films, and this movie should compete with the best. Although it could not have won Oscars despite seven nominations, but won many other awards and made Holly Hunter a star.
