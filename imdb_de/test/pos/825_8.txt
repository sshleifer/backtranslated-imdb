After 10 years, it is finally clear that our Belgian Action Star is back. Personally, I found this movie even better than Wake Of Death, making it its best movie for ... 10 years. Okay, it's not like his highlight years as Timecop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or even his best engagement yet: Hard Target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of John Woo's best action directors). well, the story is exciting, the dialogue is pretty funny, this is better than expected. The bad guys are fantastic as in Hard Target, and the fight scenes are "old school". Real fans know what to expect. I have to say I gave him up, but Van Damme is finally back. More please....
