When I first started watching "Surface," I was addicted. It had everything I wanted in a show of suspense, action, riddles, great action and a great cast of characters. My whole family loved watching the show. It seems like when there's a great show on TV, the network usually picks it up as if it seemed to be about this show. They use the Nielson rating system, which I think is stupid because there is a lot of garbage they seem to watch the air. If there was only one way for anyone to vote in a show, then the good shows might not be canceled , When I watch TV now, I only see good shows. Now that does not look much TV.I hope the network will bring the show back, but if they make a stupid decision, they seem to stick to it. I hope there are many people who feel the same way.
