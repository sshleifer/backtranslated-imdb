This must be one of the best episodes of Doctor Who I've seen since coming back last year. There is a brilliant mix of entertainment, fear and tenderness, all blended together, which amounts to an amazing episode. The Ooods were brilliantly designed and I'm pretty sure there'll be a lot of good jokes in the coming weeks. I myself am guilty for that. I especially liked the way we saw Rose and the doctor's relationship and the end from a different perspective. Well, it's the first time I've hidden behind a pillow! I can not wait until next week to find out how they get out of this mess.
