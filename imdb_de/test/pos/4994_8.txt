I'm a big fan of Lonesome Dove and all the books in the series and I love the movie. I was glad to see that they were done with Comanche Moon. I've been a fan of Steve Zahn for a long time and really wanted to see him in a serious role. I personally think that Steve Zahn has created Gus. I can not imagine another actor who would have been better. He has the voice, the manners, the pronunciation of the word except for a T. Granted, nobody could hold a candle to Robert Duvall as Gus, but I think Steve Zahn did a damn good job. Karl Urban behaves the same way in all the films he has worked in, and has adapted Well to Woodrow Call. AS for the movie itself, yes, it's a bit crazy, but can you really beat Lonesome Dove? No I do not think so.
