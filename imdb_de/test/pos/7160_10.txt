I agree with the other 9 and 10 star ratings. That's what I saw at the South By Southwest Film Festival in Austin. Of the 20 movies I've seen, 7 were really good and that was the best for me. I'm a jerk for movies with plotter devices where characters go through transformations that completely change their lives. The great show was mostly done by people involved in television, or it was their first movie. It was written and directed by Jay Floyd. This was his directorial debut. Jay's day job seems to be an administrator for a number of famous movies. To forgive the Franklins was a total pleasure and in the places extremely funny. This is a movie where I would buy the DVD and watch it again, really a high supplement of mine. Well done, Jay, yes ... give up your job!
