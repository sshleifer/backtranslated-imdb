I saw this movie during a vacation in Pablo, CO, in a theater. I had just quit my job as a biomedical engineer in a hospital. I think the script is an exaggeration of the actual kind of things that happen in hospitals. <br /> <br /> The idiots who diminish the production value have no sense and have probably never been hospitalized. And never worked with security. Billy Jack (same era) was very poorly produced but had a significant social commentary and was a very good movie with a real social message. I've been looking for this movie ever since, this is the first page I've found where it's mentioned.
