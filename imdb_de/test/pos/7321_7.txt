Under the direction of the big brother Leo McCarey's younger brother, this is a pretty good shortcut to the Three Stooges who have been nominated for an Academy Award. These are doctors named Doctor Howard, Fine Fine and Doctor Howard. They are not the smartest doctors, but they benefit from the doubts as long as they champion duty and humanity. It's not one of the best, but some moments are still funny. A joke repeated more than once works every time. The part in which they have to run the boss of the hospital is great. To say more would spoil some of the jokes, so you have to see for yourself. Just another good short film from the Three Stooges.
