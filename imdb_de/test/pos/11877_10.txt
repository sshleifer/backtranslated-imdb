I'm a big fan of Larkin's works, I think he was in the midst of the greatest poets of the 20th century. The film itself does justice to the Bard of Hull. Wonderfully presented by all players in their roles. Bonneville does a service to the sexually repressed Larkin, he avoids the impression and refrains from becoming a caricature. The use of his poetry was the highlight of the piece. Rather than playing the massive intensity with which Larkin felt, using his own words gives a better insight into the storyline, adding a much darker, but more intriguing, atmosphere. The most beautiful.
