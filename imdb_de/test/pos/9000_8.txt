I just saw it last night and it was great. I can see why some people from a rugby fan and Maori culture have bad feelings about it, but other than that, I have no idea what's so negative about it. The movie is great. It has a lot of heart. Very inspiring and encouraging for all ages. Great family movie! You did a pretty good job, considering it's a budget movie. I love movies based on true stories / events. I've been brought up to rugby all my life, it's a great game, but I was never really brought to it, because (forgive me if I insult someone, not personal, as I've seen), I thought, theirs Training is not so ruthless or hard, the players are not so disciplined and did not seem to be as serious as other athletes, and it looked like only muscles and flowers were attacking each other, etc. But after seeing Forever strong, that was I like, wow! I was proud It has done good for rugby (well, it changed my view of rugby) and also the New Zealnd Haka. I actually cried. I am not even a New Zealander and I was proud of her culture. I did not even know what the song meant until this movie. The movie is NOT about rugby techniques or rugby, it's not about New Zealand All Blacks or the haka or etc ...... mother of pearl !!!!! hahaha SHUX! <br /> <br /> So to all the beautiful negative people, you miss the point! I'm sure if they had the means, it would have been better, the Haka is here because that part of Highland rugby culture, tradition or whatever you want to call it. <br /> <br /> So all new members on this site like me, do not be put off by these negative comments. See for yourself! Must see movie! You can learn a lot from this movie, people of all ages. In any case, you want to be a better person and be humble! This movie reminded me of many things I already know and grew up with, but I am somehow lost along the way! Loved it! Enjoy reading and all the best! <br/> <br/> Muawha!
