Uzumaki was seen last night and immediately was reminded of two early Peter Weir films from Australia, The Last Wave and Picnic at Hanging Rock. It was films that were laden with atmosphere, but just before the actual horror. Uzumaki seems to be clearly influenced by these films. There are a number of rather banal scenes that become more meaningful the deeper you are sucked in by the movie. It also has more scenes of horror, and although I do not think the movie really does justice to these two films, it's worth the time of the most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems to be fair, but I have to say that the movie is still with me years after my last visit to The Last Wave, and it's precisely Picnic At Hanging Rock's unresolved end that makes him so insistent. P.S. All the people who criticize acting ... Pullleasse ... in this genre?
