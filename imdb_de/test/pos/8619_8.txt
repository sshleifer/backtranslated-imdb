Another fantastic movie by Catherine Breillat, this time about the difficulties of making a sex scene in a movie. With comedy? a new genre for Breillat? We get a look behind the scenes of filmmaking, but in a documentary style. The character who plays the director in the movie is based on Breillat. The sex scene in question comes from her earlier movie "A Ma Soeur" and the lead actress of the teenager. But the film is, like all works by Breillat, not just entertainment. It is peppered with philosophical observations about the nature of sexuality and demonstrates a dedication to purity (as opposed to pornography), which is a cornerstone of Breillats work and a devotion to real emotions. We see the director's character tempting the young lead actress and lead actor to make the most of them, hypnotize them into the parts they need to play, and create a part of themselves the director can see in them, but they can not see themselves reach the height of the acting that demands of them. It makes meaningful films, not kids, but it shows the work that's needed and gives us insights into the (decidedly French) film production process and the psychology of men. female sexuality.
