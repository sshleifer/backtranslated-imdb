I saw this movie for the first time in the mid-60s when I was a teenager, and it moved me so much, in fact the final scene where Han hears Su's hearing about Mark's death and then plunges incredulously onto the hill where You then hear Mark's voice, "Give me your hand," and then the picture disappears from him. The butterfly with its superstitious meaning, the music, the broken feelings of love of Han Suyin made my heart sob. I cried bitterly, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked at my reaction. I have just left the room to be alone. Fortunately, I do not react that way anymore, BUT I always cry in the end. I love everything about the movie, mainly the music, the costumes of Han Suyin and the location. The beauty of Jennifer Jones and handsome William Holden were both at their best. I have the VHS and DVD of this wonderful movie. I also have two versions of Music & Lyrics by Arthur Newman and Sammy Fain. I also have the book A Many Splendored Thing by Han Suyin. I recommend this movie 100%
