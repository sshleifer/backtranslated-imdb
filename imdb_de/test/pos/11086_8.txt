Oscar winners: Hutton and Penn are both exceptionally good at the movie. The movie is even occasionally funny and sometimes quite disturbing. David Suchet nearly steals the show as the man who works for the Soviet Union. This picture has a well-known cast in the supporting roles. It was pretty underrated when it was first published. Despite some great reviews from some of the best movie critics. This picture is actually based on a true story. The storytelling has some flaws, like these two main characters, but overall it is a worth watching movie. Based on a novel by Robert Lindsey. Screenplay of the Oscar winner: Steven Zaillian (American Gangster, Hannibal, Schindler's list). (**** / *****).
