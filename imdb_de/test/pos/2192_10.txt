Since I have not seen the 1936 version, I can not offer a comparison there. However, I can say that Stephen Sondheim's musical treatment of this story is absolutely brilliant. Only Sondheim was able to come up with music and lyrics that are outstanding for themselves, but fit perfectly with the very bizarre themes. If someone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, they should see this (and also "Dr. Strangelove"). When Mrs. Lovett changes from the "worst cakes in London" to a booming, high-profile business, we're not talking about "Soylent Green" - but the ingredients are similar. Especially brilliant is the song in which Mrs. Lovett introduces her idea to Mr. Todd. Even in the introductory number, the line "... they went immaculately shaved to their maker ..." gives a good indication of the premise, the drama AND the upcoming comedy. Outstanding!
