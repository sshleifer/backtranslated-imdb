If there are people who do not like this movie, I do not think they are human. This movie shows all the emotions and shows many pages of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997 is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and really the movie that Judith Light played in to make me a big fan. This film is incredibly moving, even if you sometimes want to babble with your son because he trusts her so much. I cry at the end every time and it takes a lot to do that to me! The plot does not have much to offer, but the drama of Judith Light is incredible. She looks beautiful all the time and in the end you do not want the fate of the courts to happen to her. All in all a film that is worthy of my highest praise! Thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty. I'm anxiously waiting for this movie to appear on DVD or some other form of media, as Lifetime starts releasing a few films to clients. I do not have much hope for this movie since it was almost nine years ago, which is still hard to believe because this movie is still in my head after all this time.
