This movie is somehow good. It looks like they used the Tyrannosaurus Rex like an inflated balloon, just like Godzilla. Maybe the scientists did not have enough information at the time. on all types of dinosaurs. At that time, the scientist was still dinosaurs. I think this movie is based on a Tyrannosaurus Rex movement in the 60s and 70s. There was even a part where a huge stone shot by someone at the Tyrannosaurus Rex damaged the Tyrannosaurus Rex, and it was briefly knocked off. In the end, the Tyrannosaurus Rex went back in search of food. There is also something wrong in the movie, like a gun, how can a rifle kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex if it could be 1,000 to 5,000 stronger than us. If this movie is going to make a remake, I suggest making it better and more agitated, because if you see an old movie, it seems to have a remake, if it's lucky.
