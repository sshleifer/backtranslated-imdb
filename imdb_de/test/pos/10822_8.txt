Even though there are not more than the previous posts (like Ruby Liang's very good), I wanted to share my own opinion. I hope my english is understandable. <br /> <br /> Gute Reise is a rhythmic, light, but profound depiction of the disorganized French state, but also courage and charm. In a brilliantly reconstructed 1940s France with many details (from luxurious hotels in Bordeaux, which were occupied by the seat of government in Nice and attacked by useless, high - class Frenchmen, to Parisian coffees near Le Pantheon / rue Mouffetard and the cars of the Gérard Depardieu and Yvan Attal give their second role an ingenious taste;) Isabelle Adjani and Virgnie Ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles, and Grégori Derangère delivers a charming performance :) <br /> <br /> Much easier As the average (eg, American) war movies and focused on the civilian population, Bon voyage shows a lot of things about French subjects (even for a Frenchman like me), some of them pretty deep.
