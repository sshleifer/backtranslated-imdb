Les Amants Reguliers immediately sees a comparison with Bertolucci's film "The Dreamers", in my opinion the best film about the 1968 student uprising in Paris. Actually, director Philippe Garrel seems unavoidable to compare with his much more famous colleague, to share the lead actor, and even take a direct imitation eye over an older Bertolucci movie. And yet LAR is another and interesting movie. <br /> <br /> The story also seems to be familiar. The film begins with long scenes of 'emeutes' from 1968, which may be among the best so far. The film is shot in black and white, and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the barricade is reminiscent of Eisenstein. Then, as in The Dreamers, the action moves in the Paris apartment, where the heroes of the defeated rebellion make art, smoke drugs, dream and fall in love with each other. There is no direct social commentary, no real explanation of the background of the revolt. The film focuses on the psychology of the characters and the love story between the main characters. It is like a premonition of the transition process to the establishment that the 1968 generation has gone through. It's just that not all participants can adapt or survive the events. And it's just the style he's remembered for. The black-and-white cinema is memorable not only in the revolutionary scenes but also in the evolution of the characters. Many sequences are enhanced by a technique derived from the silent films. Long takes are accompanied by an off-piano melody. The effect is exquisite. The length of the film, however, is barely justified, it lasts more than three hours, and I doubt it would have been just a failure to shorten it to two hours. The deepening and subtlety of Bertolucci's film LAR is yet another perspective the most important years in the history of France and the world in the 20th century should be remembered.
