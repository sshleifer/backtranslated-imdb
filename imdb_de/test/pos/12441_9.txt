This film is undoubtedly the clearest example of British humor that Germans can not understand. One-liners are widely used in a film that produces one of the largest film series in British cinema history (St. Trinians). The history of bureaucratic incompetence in the midst of postwar processes allows Frank Launder to direct the talents of all cast. It is probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford in Alastair Sim hits her match for powerful characterization (but she still wins). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis deserve mention in Dighton's masterpiece of English etiquette and the stiff upper lip. <br /> <br /> No Rutherford / Sim / Grenfell fan would do that in his collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83 minutes long.
