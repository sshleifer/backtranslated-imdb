In the original French version, the jokes of Numérobis (great, funny voice - Jamel Debbrouze) are very funny. <br /> <br /> But in translated versions (I've seen the German and English versions) it's not half as good as the original ones. <br /> <br /> But: silly special effects, almost the full comic (with differences, like the figure of Lügnix (German name)), is placed in another comic book, the Asterix comic book is cult, but If you look at the animated comic films from 1968 to 1998, you'll see much better jokes, better stories and the old "charm" and "flair" of the cult stories. <br /> <br /> For French speakers, I recommend viewing it in its original version with or without subtitles, if available in different languages.
