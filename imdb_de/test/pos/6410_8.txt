The whole world falls victim to a deadly disease, and the rain never stops: in this atmosphere of nightmare, a man and a woman discover that they are neighbors thanks to a hole in the man's home. They fall in love: at least not everything is lost. Although this wonderful film expresses man's loneliness and weakness, there is also room for hope in the brilliant singing scenes.
