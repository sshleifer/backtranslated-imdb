It must be so difficult to tell a story in which not much happens and yet attracts the attention of the audience. I think this short film achieves this with effortless quality. Rutger has an amazing voice that is very reassuring, wise and fatherly (I'm not gay). It recalls the qualities that Robert Redford has in telling. The end is very sad, but beautiful. One wonders how long Harry will be left, will he be lonely and will he say goodbye? In addition, they annoyed about Mr. Hauer, because he is no longer concerned with this caliber. Let's hope he continues to do a good job in Holland and stay away from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Worth watching
