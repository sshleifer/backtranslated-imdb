I saw this movie yesterday (February 4, 2006) in a Singapore theater and got a better understanding of what patients with schizophrenia and their relatives are going through. Ms. Aparna Sen not only needs to be congratulated on accepting a difficult topic, but also treating the mentally handicapped with a deep understanding of her difficult situation, which she needs to cope with the traumas of disorientation, hallucinations, and the turmoil in her head , <br /> <br /> We had Hollywood movies on this theme like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," where Jack Nicholson brought the honors. Since then, research has helped to provide more insights into the problem and to eliminate some misunderstandings about the treatment. For example, in "... Cuckoo's Nest", shock therapy was portrayed as barbaric, but in "15 ..." the point was made that it's not as bad as it turned out. <Br /> <br /> The other misconception is that abuse in childhood is a cause of schizophrenia. Scholars like Dr. However, E. Fuller Torrey has emphasized that studies have shown that schizophrenia in childhood is a brain disease thought to have genetic roots. Any clinical disease and its progress can be screened at early detection. Even in relatively advanced stages, regular medication and counseling can be effective. <br /> <br /> The same understanding that Ms. Sen has shown is reflected in the way the actors play their role. Consistent with the seriousness of the theme, the drama is consistently controlled, with Ms. Konkana Sen-Sharma's evocative silence and eyes reflecting the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind that speaks louder than some of the usual propaganda in most movies containing mentally handicapped characters. <br /> <br /> Like me, the audience in the theater seemed suddenly confused. Many questions remain related to the plot. <br /> <br /> Has Meethi's search come to an end? Why is not she in No. 15? Did children actually play when Meethi passed the gates with appreciative eyes? Can someone solve this puzzle?
