It took years for cult icon Bruce Campbell to get this project off the ground - but he's finally made it - and what a great piece of chat entertainment it is! Look at the plot; It sounds like two things. A great base for a very stupid B-movie and a shameless excuse for Bruce Campbell of what he does best - the slapstick humor of the Evil Dead II style, and this film delivers on both counts. The Man With the Screaming Brain is thoroughly comic nonsense - but there are really great scenes and it's almost impossible to get bored with this movie. Bruce Campbell wrote, directed, produced and stars in the film - and although it's not quite Citizen Kane, it's fair to say that this is a hit for the man who's famous for battling his own hand in a forest cabin , The action follows American businessman William Cole on business trip with his girlfriend in Bulgaria. However, the journey goes awry when he, his girlfriend and his taxi driver are dead; Thanks to the same woman. Crazy scientist Stacy Keach is there to merge Cole and the taxi driver's brain into one. and we have a cult movie on our hands. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is entertaining and offers some laughs; but once the main plot point has been executed; the movie really takes on. Bruce uses the scenario best for all sorts of stupid situations, from changing clothes in a trash can to deciding (with the cab driver in mind) what to eat in a restaurant. The humor is largely slapstick variety, and anyone who enjoys Evil Dead II (which should be anyone who has seen it) will undoubtedly enjoy it. It feels like Campbell is playing a bit too much with this whole project, but if you turn on and do not see Bruce doing what he does best, disappointment would ensue. Apart from that, no disrespect for the man; but he was never the actor with the greatest reach. Although it is a lot of fun; the movie is not great because sometimes it gets a little too stupid; and there's a whole signing with a robot I did not like; But overall, the man with the screaming brain is a movie we unfortunately do not see too much these days. The movie is a total B movie without restrictions. and it deserves respect, if nothing else.
