When Fellini hired 8 1/2 for the film, many commented that finding her perfect expression was the most personal vision. When Dante became engaged in the flames of his immortal passion, many were horrified by the honest brutality of his unrequited feelings for a younger woman. When Onur Tukel and a jolly band of wickedly talented and misplaced filmmakers - from the Mekka der Wahnsinnsfilms together - commented during two cool weeks in December 2000, many commented that nothing higher up had ever been committed ... much less in the film. Well, to the doubters out there, look at this original piece and find out why the badge is both a charming and a powerful thing. and if that is not getchya, roll over and rub one out ... it's probably time for you to do this. <br /> <br /> Kudos onur on a great piece of art
