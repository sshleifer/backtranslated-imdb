This movie was a pleasant surprise for me. To be honest, the previews looked terrible to the point where Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman appeared. So I rented it by reservation, but I really enjoyed this movie. It had great acting, some good moves, and of course Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. It's definitely worth it.
