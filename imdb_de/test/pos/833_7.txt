After seeing Undisputed 2, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine. <br /> <br /> The Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent movie (not Van Dammes best, but definitely not his worst) VD supports the cast, but it makes sense. <br /> <br /> The plot and the plot have all been done before, so it's nothing new. I mean, that's Van Damme. We do not really expect much from an amazing plot, right? Let's talk about what we want to see this movie for anyway: the fights. <br /> <br /> Without giving anything away, I thought the way the fights were filmed and filmed worked well, much better than a few of VD's most recent films like Second in Command, in which the whole Final battle is HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera, and if you've seen Undisputed 2, he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoy it. A few fights in The Shepherd reminded me of VD's older stuff, we all want to see that. The fights were good and I said loudly a few times "hah, awesome". But I just hoped a little more, considering how well I thought Undisputed 2 was interesting to me. <br /> <br /> Something I found fascinating was the daughter of VD in the movie. I thought, "Wow, she's kinda hot," to find out his Bianca Van Varenberg, JC's real daughter. I've never seen them before, so that was a nice treat. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is not half as bad. Yes, the story has been done before, but at least JC was trying to make a good movie. Next time, add more hand to hand combat! I think he still has what it takes to make another big budget movie ... his acting has improved since he did DTVs and at 47 he's really in good shape. I do not know if you exist, but I'm one of those who believe that most of his DTVs are actually good except Derailed. All he has to do is go back to "blood sport" form and make a martial arts movie ... and I think people would react well even if he is not Jet Li. This movie is definitely worth the rent. =)
