Boogie Nights is one of the best movies of the 90s, and I would say that it should be in the Top 250 IMDb. I can really understand why many do not like it because of the topic. Personally, however, I believe that, according to viewers and critics, this is considered to be top-notch. <br /> <br /> The direction and spectacle in this movie surpass the good and reach the level of brilliance is not a scene in this movie that is not amazing. The individual characters stretch and touch you. Given that this is a movie about the porn industry, one could not imagine that the sex scenes could be treated with such sensitivity, but they are. The direction is one of the best I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> The film is not about a particular person's story, but about many. It's a character study of people who have many shifts and who might be most alien in an industry, but who still dream the same dreams and are both bad and good with them. Boogie Nights draws you into their story from the beginning, and although the movie is very long (I think it's almost three hours), you do not even notice it. And if it ends, you do not want it somehow ... <br /> <br /> I'm not easy to impress, which means that there are not many movies I'd rate 10 out of 10 but that's one , Beyond the study of several characters is the use of music in the film. I've never told a story in all the years I've watched movies being watched, just like in this movie. There was such flawlessness, you know it's not something you'll see every day. Burt Reynold's performance may have been the best I've ever seen, and Mark Wahlberg is unbelievable (I'm amazed that there are still people who say he does not behave well, I do not know how anyone would see it but that could be) The person who really surprised me was Heather Grahem (Rollergirl), who is absolutely fantastic in her role, especially the catchy scene with Burt Reynolds in the limo towards the end. <br /> <br /> I'll do it again echoing other IMDb reviewers saying that this movie is not for everyone. But I still think that this was Topnotch.10 out of 10.
