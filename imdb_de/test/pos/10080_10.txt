That was a great movie! It was an absolutely enjoyable youthful fantasy. What makes a movie so great? Technical details? I think if that were the only criterion, our culture would be poorer. So this movie for "The Godfather" is like New Wave music for Mozart. The point is, it's one of the best movies of its kind I've ever seen. The women are all beautiful (as you can only see on California beaches when shooting movies). It has something of all kind of a battlestar Gallactica meets Baywatch meets the Playboy Centerfold video and meets Wayne's World. There is a lot of charm and a sensible (albeit predictable) plot that keeps you interested until the next feast of the eyes graces the screen. Although Joe Estevez does not have a career as his brothers, he does a good job as a forever-young Uncle Bud. Contains many expected absurdities like a female rock band playing without guitars. (Was that intentionally?) If you are interested in the box, borrow the video, you will not regret it. As promised, it's a good, non-violent erotic fun!
