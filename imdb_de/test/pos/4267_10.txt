I watch tons of movies and have no idea that would be so good. I was looking forward to it after reading the story (though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like a lot of fun, but it was more than that. Jansen brings small touches such as books (including Kubrick book), movie posters, etc. that I like when I see a director spending time takes and his heart is in a movie. And you can really feel that. There are countless scenes and moments that I love. Now I'm trying to think of some other movies that are, and I would say that the only thing I can think about is Cameron Crowe movies. Takes small moments and makes them conspicuous and special. The soundtrack is amazing and each song fits perfectly with the scenes and the feeling of the movie. This movie is amazingly shot and the editing is superb. I could really go on and on talking about the movie. I really can not recommend that enough. If you want a funny story with great melodies from a director who obviously puts his heart into his work, then look at this.
