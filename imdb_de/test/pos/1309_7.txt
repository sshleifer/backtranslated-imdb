I've just seen that with my three kids - 12 years (boy), 10 years (boy) and 8 years (girls) - and this movie was an old-fashioned family action adventure. Although it was definitely aimed at the children's market (I would say 5 to 13), it was certainly worth seeing and as a parent, it's a pleasure to find a movie that appeals to a wide range of age groups and yet is suitable for the whole family - especially younger children. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Ricky, a bit of nerd with vivid imagination (this can definitely be seen in his daydream sequences) that thwarted a kidnapping and stopped a major art theft during that - are flying to Washington for a school trip. Ricky's dad is an aircraft mechanic, so Ricky not only knows the structure of the plane, but is also a top rifle in his computer flight simulator. This is useful when the pilot and copilot are cold due to a series of failures and no one can fly the plane. I do not want to reveal anything more about the plot.
