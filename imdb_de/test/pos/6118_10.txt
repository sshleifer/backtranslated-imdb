I loved this thing. The most wonderful thing about Pink Flamingos is that it desperately tries to have a terrible taste, but has gained a worldwide cult. Say a lot about us (we are humans), right? Pink Flamingos succeeds because Waters made the movie he wanted to do. A movie does not have to be disgusting to succeed, but it can be. When you see this movie, you see things that are disgusting, but ultimately brilliant because they are shown freely. What we have here is an honest part of personal creative expression. Anyone who wants to succeed as an artist, whether in film or other media, should watch this movie.
