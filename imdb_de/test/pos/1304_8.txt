I just found the entire 3-DVD set at Wal-Mart for $ 5.50 in the bargain basket, so I thought I'd take another look at it. 13 hours in total to see everything (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on television in the sixties. Many independent stations repeated it for many years. <br /> <br /> Better than I expected, the time was right for the obvious sincerity of their creators and the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all Allied fighting men and women. More abstract and artistic than a direct documentation, but very honest in the presentation of the causes and end results of World War II. This war was heavily dependent on sea transport, and the final victory depended on who finally ruled the oceans. The Allies were the ones who could. <br /> <br /> It was also interesting to see how they try to find a balance between big events and the individual soldiers and sailors who made them. The rating is impressive, albeit too much by today's standards. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennett as well as Richard Rodgers contributed to the final result. I imagine that Rodgers provided all the important topics, and Bennett had the task of adapting them to the pictures. Good work! <br /> <br /> Should be seen by any ruler or potential ruler. A warning to the tyrants that wars are ultimately won by ideals, determination, and supplies to support them. Logistics: Your quality and delivery determine the possible winners. The Allies surpassed and surpassed the material quality of the Axis, attacked their source and assured their later defeat. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, producer Henry Salomon has lived a very short life. The facts of IMDb were pretty close, I need to find out more about him. Before his early death, he has made some outstanding documentaries. Could have more to say at a later date <br /> <br /> Trivia: I had made all 3 LP records of background music, overall pretty well. Unfortunately, the producers decided to add to the last sound effect, which immediately became the novelty status and not for serious music listening. Too bad, because it contained some interesting, but smaller topics in the series. Stupid things like 16-inch cannons being fired, torpedoes being fired, bulldozers, planes ... mostly for kids. <br /> <br /> RSGRE
