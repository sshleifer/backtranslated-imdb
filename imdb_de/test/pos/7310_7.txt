The dutiful wife Norma Shearer (as Katherine "Kitty" Brown) is waiting for husband Rod La Rocque (as Bob Brown) on hand and foot. While she makes him breakfast in bed and helps him dress for a Sunday golfing excursion, Ms. Shearer suggests meeting with Mr. La Rocque for a day and noticing how rare they are. However, La Rocque scares her off and says her presence interferes with his play. Then, unexpectedly, Shearer finds the true reason for her husband's frequent absences? his pretty blonde lover! Three years later, Shearer is a glamorous and flirtatious divorce. During her summer in Paris, she has a friendly relationship with the wealthy, older celebrities Marie Dressler (as well as Ms. Boucci Bouccicault). Ms. Dressler invites Shearer to her Long Island home to meet with friends and ask for a favor. Dressler worries about her granddaughter's relationship with a cosmopolitan man. She wants young Sally Eilers (as Dionne) instead to marry Raymond Hackett (as Bruce). Dressler is aware of Shearer's flirting conquests and asks her to lure away Mrs. Eilers's unwanted husband. Shearer is stunned to find out that the man is La Rocque, her ex-husband. Shearer and Dressler make this game a cute, fun game. They are in top shape and offer guaranteed pop performances with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is stupid and predictable; but in a way that helps the humorous situation. And the end is pretty smart. In fact, the comic "Let Us Be Gay" may be older than Shearer's larger and more serious "The Divorc√©e," which was released around the same time. The casting is evenly fine. La Rocque is better than his movie with Lilian Gish; but his role is not adorable at all. Gilbert Emery (as Towney) and Tyrell Davis (as Wallace) are funny supporters. <br /> <br /> Those who do not know Norma Shearer may not know that she appears in the opening scenes as the crafty woman. This is Shearer as "Kitty" before her make-over. Take a close look at Shearer's light, natural make-up to catch a glimpse of a fascinatingly beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> ***** Let's be gay (1930) Robert Z.
