The brilliant spectacle of David Tennant and Sarah Parish brought me to tears, as many scenes were so familiar to me. My husband suffered from an arachnoid haemorrhage in 1977 and required a major surgery to raise his brain and plug the leak. Like Tricia, I was naive enough to expect him to return to his former self. After more than 25 years of loving and caring for me, he left me without notice to go to a woman he barely knew. He then applied for an application and I am now divorcing. I hope the program helped people understand what it's like to deal with a brain injury.
