This movie was well done. It deals with the difficulties that a returned Vietnam veteran has in dealing with the horrors of war. Unfortunately, the authors focused on a veterinarian involved in cruelty. I was in Vietnam and I only heard about one such witness from a witness once. The perpetrator was prosecuted in Leavenworth and sentenced to many years in prison. <br /> <br /> The idea that only veterinarians involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a disadvantage for all staff. All the soldiers I personally knew or knew verbally were honorable soldiers who even respected the enemy and believed that they were there to stop the spread of communism. The biggest problem was getting home to learn that many Americans were against the war. That's why many veterans felt they had taken part in something less honest. Not the way they served. <br /> <br /> The ending showed the father who acted more as a warlike tyrant than a loving, caring father. For that I gave a 7 out of 10 points. If the end would have allowed a degree of acceptance, I would have rated the rating as 9. Most decent men will come home with guilt and emotional scars from the war. They need acceptance and understanding to overcome this. I pray that the public understands our veterans today better than in the Vietnam era.
