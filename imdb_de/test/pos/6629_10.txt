As a great Bergman fan, I literally had to search for this movie (for less than $ 60), which I bought a few weeks ago. The basic premise of Bergman's films is the relationships between characters and their handling of difficult situations. So this movie is the same, but it's different because the shot is different from most Bergman movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> He plays in wartime and the heroes are caught in the middle br /> <br /> It's fascinating from beginning to end and proves again that Liv Ullman is one of the best actresses of the 20th century , Something you must have seen.
