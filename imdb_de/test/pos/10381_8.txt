It's just stories, some we want something to happen to us, some we wish never to happen to us, all about unfulfilled desires. The scenes and the naked bodies are beautiful, but after the second story I could only think, "It takes more than beauty to make a real movie". Then, of course, the film unfolds. The stories are moving, except that Sophie Marceau does not communicate her story in this film. Malkovich plays the story for both. The voiceover can not link the stories, but it helps Malkovich provoke some thoughts. <br /> <br /> I would say it's worth it and the best of Antonioni I've ever seen. Given his age - remarkable!
