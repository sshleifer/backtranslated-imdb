"Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters" is a visually stunning production that deals with complex problems with evocative ease. It is based on the life of controversial Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It's not really a biopic - at least not in the traditional sense - but an exploration of the iconoclastic work of Mishima. The film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unrestricted, totally captivating way. Paul Schrader lets you sympathize with Mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. It does not quite solve the puzzle, but it lets you understand it. An added bonus: Seeing Mishima's anger over the lack of tradition in a morally empty modern society, Schrader shows us the dichotomy between thought and performance in the cinema. John Bailey's movie is spectacularly good. The grandiosity of the work of composer Philip Glass is perfect for the project. "Mishima" is the best movie I have seen so far this year.
