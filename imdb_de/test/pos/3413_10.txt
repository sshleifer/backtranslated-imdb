From all the seasons and episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, having seen all those big, startling, thought-provoking stories, this one is right up here. Right. This story, titled THE HUNT, is at the head of a large number of the best screenplays in television history. There are no interplanetary space flights, no inexplicable temporal breaks. There is no nightmare, no sudden adjustments. There seems to be nothing out of the ordinary for our protagonist. <br /> <br /> The main character, played by Arthur Hunnicut, the veteran actor, walks out of his cabin into the hills, accompanied by his faithful dog, hunting raccoon. The raccoon is a predominantly nocturnal animal hunt that takes place in the moonlight , The man and the dog soon meet a large raccoon who jumps on the dog's back and tries to drown the dog in a pond. The man jumps in to help his dog. There is a kind of blackout in which the two are seen on the shore in a lying, almost sleep-like position. <br /> <br /> When he calls his dog by name, (Rip, I think), that's the old man going home. When he arrives, he finds the woman crying and does not respond to his conversation. He also watches as visitors come and go to his house, show respect and comfort words to his wife. <br /> <br /> The strange reception and events around the Home Cabin, the Man and Rip, take off on a long walk down the street, where it turns out loud that he does not care about that long fence in those parts recalled. He finally meets a rather tall guy dressed in traditional costumes, much like his jumpsuit, hat, and work shirt. You are at a gate that leads to an area where a lot of smoke rises freely. The Gate Keeper, in his persuasive stance as he tries to get the man to enter, is overly anxious. Rip sounds uncomfortable. The gate Man tells the old man to enter, but the dog has to stay outside and offer him the animal. The man will have none of this and the two keep walking down the path. <br /> <br /> After a little more hike you will find a second entrance gate, where the gatekeeper recognizes the man and greets him. When the old man reports what happened on the street, he told him how the man at the other gate tried to separate man and dog and added, "Dogs allowed, that must be hell!" The 2nd Gatekeeper said he was right! "That's it!" <br /> <br /> Our family had lost our first dog, Lady-a mixed lab, in October 1981. About 6 months later, as luck would have it, the wife (Deanna) and I, along with our 2 daughters (Jennifer 9 and Michelle 6) watched this episode on television, WGN TV, Channel 9 Chicago. Well, that made a lot of sense for us at that time. <br /> <br /> We are sure that everyone who has this relationship with a family dog ​​would agree. The episode still brings the now 60-year-old writer a state of watery eyes.
