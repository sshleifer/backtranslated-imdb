This is one of the best TV movies I have ever seen! The title makes it so obvious and predictable, but come on, all the TV movies are like that! <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic. It may seem ridiculous, but based on an incredibly true story. Gary Cole plays a man named Dave, who feels trapped in his marriage. He leaves his wife and children and fakes his death! So he could be with Alyson (Karen Sillas) together. How far will Dave go to keep his secret? <br /> <br /> The drama is top notch for TV movies. Gary Cole holds the film above all as a charming, flowing sociopath, who has an answer to everything, if his wife becomes suspicious. Karen Sillas does the best she can, as a woman who discovers that her husband is a liar and does not know what to do about it. Teddi Siddall, whom I believe to be Gary Cole in real life, plays her role particularly well when she cries over her husband's "death". Wendy Makkena adds a nice touch to Alyson's sister. Linda Goranson is great in her small role as Dave's mom. <br /> <br /> Predictable, but the acting and the story bring this film in different directions.
