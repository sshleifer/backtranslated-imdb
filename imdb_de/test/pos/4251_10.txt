This movie got better with time. I can not believe it's been forty years since I saw this at the age of fifteen. Yes that's true. Film ratings were not a reality so every teenager could get into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King were just killed, but the following summer a man walked on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the chance for the Woodstock nation to attach it to the man. You will see where Robert Downey Jr. got his sardonic splendor. His old man was immediately a hero for children like me. No punches will be made in this classic, and aging hippies will rejoice as they re-live this era. Hopefully new flower children will be encouraged by this, and this present era of fascism will be subjected to the same test that was imposed on my era.
