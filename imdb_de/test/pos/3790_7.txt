The film's big names were trying to make their contribution to the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandistic image is part of his contribution, although the war was almost over at the time of his release. The vagabond goes to war, performs exploits and kicks the emperor in the butt. It's a very funny movie, though I think it's not nearly one of its best. It's a better performance for First National with 'A Dog's Life' before he did his earlier masterpiece 'The Kid'. They are his first three-reels, containing more sustained, elaborate gags than he would normally orchestrate in his two-reel shorts at Mutual. <br /> <br /> It can be difficult to balance a pro-war message with slapstick antics and burlesque scenes on the front, but you would not think you're looking at 'shoulder arms'. It's also preferable in many ways to a "more serious" dramatic work with a similar message, such as Griffith's "Hearts of the World". Chaplin had become a veritable screen comedy virtuoso at the time; he makes it look effortless. He now knew very well that a movie with fewer gags-more elaboration, refinement, and careful timing-could be better than any other Keystone-like farce with a dozen Pratfalls per minute. The order in which Chaplin is disguised as a tree is a relevant example. Even when wars rage, Chaplin can raise the spirits of millions.
