I'm a big fan of the 1995 release, which I've seen many times and think it's a subtle, excellent movie. I bought that version of 1971 yesterday, a little hesitantly, but now that I've seen it, I'm glad I made it, because it's more accurate for the book and for Austen's findings. The 1995 version has a more dramatic effect, as it sharpens many of the characters. In the 1995 version, Lady Russell is snobbier, more manipulative, and less so on Anne. Sir Walter is still vain and vapid; Elizabeth is more vicious; Maria is more unbearable; Mr. Elliot is smarmy; Lady Dalrymple is much stupider, but I think the characterizations in this 1971 version are closer to the book, to Austen's vision and to the real people of the time. The 1971 version also contains other important lines and scenes from the book, especially the key scene in the area where Wentworth overheard talking to Louisa (or Henrietta?) About the importance of character strength. I found the drama more subtle and evocative than many critics here, but the play in the 1995 version is more powerful. I agree with the critics here that the actress Anne plays is too old for the role; I looked up her entry on IMDb, and she was 38 years old at the time of filming when her character was supposed to be 28. I thought her acting was subtle and effective. Wentworth is the right age and I found him very convincing. In particular, this 1971 version of Wentworth has much more sense of humor and teasing; that of 1995, more of the sense of power a captain had, and more passion. The Admiral in the 1971 version lacks the harsh presence and human warmth of the 1995 version, and lacks any sense of power that an admiral would certainly impart. I found him the really weak element in production. I agree with others that the staging of the "falling" scene was too wooden, and it did not seem convincing that she would have been so hurt by such a small fall. However, it may have hit the back of her head against the edge of the stone step, which would really cause a very dangerous injury in this case and the scene would seem more convincing than the scene in the 1995 version in which she drops you but is free of sharp edges, which could plausibly cause a serious head injury. As for the costumes that some have criticized, I'm not an expert and can not answer, but I'd like to point out that none of the Navy characters (Wentworth, Admiral Croft, Benwick, Harville) in the 1971 version wear their uniforms version 1995 all wear their fancy uniforms throughout. I suspect that the 1971 version is the exact one, and in the 1995 version it always bothered me a bit. The officers are always in uniform when the nation is clearly at peace and the officers are separated from active service. My father and grandfather were US Navy professional captains commanding aircraft carriers and submarines, and they did not spend every day during their vacation or in their spare time in their blue. I doubt it was different 180 years ago. The uniforms give a lot of excitement to the 1995 version, and I prefer it, but I doubt that it is historically correct that these officers wore their uniforms so frequently. After all, it's true that the production values ​​of the 1971 version are much lower than the 1995 version, but given the year (1971), the TV format and the budget, we can not blame the artists. Contemporary viewers who can take into account the lower production values ​​will value this version for their time.
