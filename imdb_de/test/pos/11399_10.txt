One of the things I like about PT Anderson is that he has the guts to take on talented people who push most people aside or push them aside and turn them into stars. An example, a wash ... Burt Reynolds delivers a great performance in this movie. And if the evidence that Adam Sander is a great actor (Punch Drunk Love) was not enough ... here comes Mark Whalburg ... as you've never seen "Boogie Nights" because they're anti-porn or just hate the adult industry and can not overlook this aspect of this film. But below that is a great story about characters who have lost everything and are struggling to recover. There's a nice movie ... and it's too bad that enough people see it.
