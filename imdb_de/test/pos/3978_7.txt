A great movie. The movie was even better than the advertisement. And believe it or not, it was very inspiring. I truly believe that anyone leaving the film in the end will be inspired in one way or another. <br /> <br /> It was a bit cheesy from the start, but it picks up quickly. I laughed. I laughed a lot in some places. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better than the average. I can say with certainty that it was the second funniest movie to hit the market this summer (the 1st funniest is CLERKS II). After all, I give him a 7/10 (a high seven, but not quite eight).
