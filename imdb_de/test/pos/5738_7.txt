A group of teenagers decide to bring their pajama party to an abandoned school where a terrible massacre took place 27 years earlier. Unfortunately, the person responsible for the carnage is still lurking in the halls of the run-down school and is not satisfied with their presence. <br /> <br /> This movie is not like most modern teen slashers we have ever seen. It's much darker, more exciting, not a smart killer, and so on, and I liked it for those reasons. From the point of view of the movie, it's not that great. The action is below average. The writing was pretty bad and full of stereotypes of randomly thrown references to American horror movies, some of which made no sense (like ... "Have you seen Scream 3?" Asks a girl.) Yes, I have, and it had nothing to do with going through the doors of an old school so it has nothing to do with this movie, but hey, it's a Slasher movie that's part of the fun There were six main characters (without The Security Guard), and frankly only three or four were actually used: two characters (the black guy played and another girl that was not important enough to get a label) I barely talked between them: I would estimate about five or six lines in total, and the girls (except one) were not well enough educated to distinguish them from each other end of the entire movie can replace repeatedly, and I would not have noticed the difference. However, the tempo works well as the horror starts from the beginning and rarely stops. The atmosphere is well used and the direction reveals some truly relaxing moments. , , Although the look overall looks a bit cheap, what I assume is inferior camera equipment (and operation). The end, although I liked the idea they wanted, was pretty bad. It felt fast enough and without explanation enough to make it effective. With the amount of time they had spent looking for nothing, they could have spent a little more time summing up to make sure it did not end up like a random event for no good reason (which for many a mistake is.) modern horror films are infested). However, ignoring some annoying issues and trying to focus on the first 98% of the movie instead of the end, this is actually a pretty good modern slasher that should be checked, especially if you're a fan of Spanish and / or are atmospheric horror. <br /> <br /> Obligatory Slasher Elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There is a good deal of blood and blood, made realistic, but no buckets. The violence is extremely well done, not exaggerated, but in some places quite brutal. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: A bit and with the hottest girl in the movie. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer: Well, security forces are hardly considered cool, but this guy is pretty nasty. His scary smile was daunting. <br /> <br /> - anxiety / tension: The tension is first class. , , very tense, very well done. There are also some extremely spooky moments in which fear of flying and the scary atmosphere merge. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: None at all. <br /> <br /> - awkward dance scene: Of course, in between a couple of guys and a half-unwilling woman in the flashback. <br /> <br /> - Classic quote from the movie: "Another trophy." <br /> <br /> Final judgment: 7/10. This may take longer, but fans of Session 9 might just want to check it for the similar tone and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
