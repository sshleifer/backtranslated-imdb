For some reason, I always enjoy movies that people hate, when I really do not think they're that bad - and that's one of those movies. In the case of this film, I think that it is criticized too much. I'm not that bad of a movie. I think this is one of the better sequels. "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" begins the night before Halloween, in which Michael brutally murders Jamie Lloyd (who was captured in Part 5 of "Man In Black") after giving birth to his baby. Then we get to know the Strode family, who now happens to live in the old Myers house (which seems to change in every movie). Kara and her son Danny are the main characters, along with Tommy Doyle, the now grown boy who survived the original murders. They must fight together to save Jamie's baby from a wicked cult that cares for Michael, while Michael himself is killed by an ancient Celtic ritual in which he has to sacrifice an entire family in Haddonfield. This is certainly one of the best sequels to the series, in my opinion, and I can not understand all the hatred it has received. It had some exciting moments, an interesting conspiracy (but sometimes confusing, I'll admit), a few fearsome moments here and there and lots of gore and knives to soothe all of you. Not all plays were not very good, but convincing enough for me. Marianne Hagan is the leading actress and she is very sympathetic. Paul Rudd plays an adult Tommy Doyle, is also very talented and plays his role well. The rest of the minor cast (aside from the brilliant Donald Pleasance) is not much to praise, but it was not that bad, all in all. I'm still not sure if I should explain why Michael was killed, but it turned out to be okay in the end and I was not mad at how they got everything connected. The open degree was also a bit scary, but could have been a bit more. <br /> <br /> I also saw the notorious "Producer's Cut" of this movie, the original cut of it, and I think it's better in some ways. It further explains the Thorn Curse that drives Michael, and has some extra scenes that really supported the movie, and the ending was much better in my opinion. It felt more natural than the conclusion we gave in the studio of the film. I wish Dimension would release this alternative version of the movie because I personally think it's better. The chances are very small. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" is a very good sequel and will please all fans of the series. This movie is not the best of horror movies, but definitely worth it to rent if you want to do Michael his thing. Just do not expect brilliance and you will enjoy it. 10.7.
