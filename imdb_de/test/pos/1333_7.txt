I felt cheated because I did not know the whole story. While there could be a twist, that phrase was so significant that I felt betrayed. I think it could have needed a better writer who could better connect all the elements of the story. The author could have revealed more of the "twists" throughout the movie than at the end all at the same time. Apart from that, I think the actors were very good with what they had, especially Matt Damon, who actually had a small character in his character, little quirks that were not selfish, or a straightforward criminal who always knows what he does. The other main characters were their own units, who happened to be talking to each other. The cohesion of the group in Ocean's Eleven was gone.
