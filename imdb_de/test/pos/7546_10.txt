This comic book classic from English schoolgirl antics is and was one of the great classics of Art House. Then the Kunsthaus disappeared with the arrival of videos. And the audience also for this movie. The loss does not go to the art houses or this great movie. The loss is for those who will never have a real opportunity to see this memorable, laughter-filled cinematic masterpiece. But I preach to the converts, not me. Who else would be looking for this movie?
