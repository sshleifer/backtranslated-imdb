I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to anyone, including "the boy and the restless". However, I think some of the obscenities, violence and sexual references in the movie are not suitable for all of your children. Anyway, before the sand fills the hourglass, I'd like to tell you the name of the movie: "Sister Betty." Renee Zellweger plays as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls into a trance and thinks she is a true personality of her favorite soap opera. That's why she travels to Los Angeles to talk to her supposed lover of the soap opera, dr. Rubell, to unite. To fuel the fire, she is also being followed by some reckless "one-life-to-life-hitmen" who think she stole her drugs. You could say that sister Betty spends "the days of her life" throughout the movie. This very outrageous situation finally leads her to the "hospital" of her beloved soap opera. The only problem is that Betty thinks this is all real. It's as if her mind is in another world. OK! Enough! I will wipe my mouth with soap and mention no other soap names. I have already registered my choice for Renee as the best Oscar nominee for Actress. Greg Kinnear's performance as Dr. Rubell was in his acting biography as good as it gets. In conclusion, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call Nurse Betty. ***** Excellent
