Ernesto is a man who lives on tricking other solid citizens from their hard earned money. Together with Manco, an older man with much experience, he pulls out capers that allow him to live a decent life, but that does not make him a rich man. Enter Federico, an older man who has more experience in the art of deception. Together with the younger Ernesto they turn out to be a successful combination. This only lasts until Pilar, Federico's former love interest, appears in the picture. <br /> <br /> This Spanish film by Miguel Bardem is bright in tone and pleasant to sit on. Other, better-made caper films were made with much smarter acts than this, but the movie is easy to take and sometimes there are many funny situations. <br /> <br /> This viewer will see Federico Luppi in anything, even reading the phone book! He's an actor. We had the privilege of seeing him on the stage of Buenos Aires before his international film career. As Federico, he does what he does best. It is impossible to imagine a better one in his role. Ernesto Alterio, the son of Hector Alterio, is a young actor who promises a great career. Victoria Abril makes Pilar fun as she deals with these scammers. Miguel Alexandre, a veteran actor, is also good at Manco.
