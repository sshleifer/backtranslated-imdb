The 20th animated Disney classic is often criticized by many as "mediocre" or of poor quality, but it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Too bad that "The Aristocats" does not get the deserved recognition. Personally, I consider it one of my favorite Disney classics. <br /> <br /> Although it is extremely underrated, it is one of the funniest Disney classics. It's full of funny (some of them hysterical) moments. Edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain of the movie, but he's a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favorite Disney villains because he's so funny. <br /> <br /> Every scene with Edgar and the hounds where Napoleon and Lafayette are following him is one of the most hilarious you've ever seen, especially at Edgar his motorbike drives into the river and around the bridge, with the dogs following him. That's hysterical! <br /> <br /> But the classic humor comes not just from Edgar or the hunting dogs. Other characters also have their moments. <br /> <br /> The topic of quality is not perfect, but remains at a high level. Even after Walt Disney's death, these artists knew how to stay true to Walt's spirit, and "The Aristocats" is one such example. They do not do it anymore these days! <br /> <br /> As usual, legendary Disney actors speak the characters. In this case we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. <br /> <br /> The characters are generally cool: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and her 3 kittens, the mouse Roquefort, the alley cats, the English geese, the hunting dogs and the horse. The human characters are also included: the eccentric and benevolent retired opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, the old lawyer of comic book Madame, Georges Hautecourt, and Edgar himself. There are some nice and catchy songs about the soundtrack like this as Thomas O'Malley's theme ( but I can not remember the name), "Everyone wants to be a cat" and "The aristocats" (sung by Maurice Chevalier), for example. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in Paris (France) in 1910. This is above all a joyful, beautiful and very pleasant movie. A timeless classic that is often underestimated and forgotten, but very valuable. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be on the top 250.
