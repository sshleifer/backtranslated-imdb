A political satire of a comedian (Williams), who is forced into the election campaign after the withdrawal of political campaigns and presidents. But shockingly we win and make the office a mockery. "Man of the Year" is neither the funniest movie nor the best, but it works in small doses. Williams played again with Levinson after a hit with "Good Morning, Vietnam". They both seem to have great chemistry and work each other out. I do not compare her to Scorsese and DeNiro, but you can get an idea. Although I did not want to say that I wanted to see the movie in the cinemas, I would recommend renting it. This movie is a comedy, but also has a great satire. If you like movies like "Scary Movie 4," this is not for you, take your brain with it to see it. - ***
