I see that there are already great reviews for this film. I have a few points to comment on. Reasons I thought there was something special about this movie ... <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the movie is realistic. For an adult who has forgotten what it was like to be a teenager, it does not seem realistic, but that's really the kind of super drama that's going on among teenagers all the time. Second, the good guy, the man who respects women, does not get the girls. So it is, in real life as well! he is too nice for his own good. People are just selfish. Third, it was nice to see a fat guy who had a certain amount of self-confidence. I mean, this role already has the actor's confidence, I'm not just talking about the character. All in all, I thought the film was a positive surprise, secretly hiding somewhere between crazy, party-teen sex comedies on the Leihregal. Do not get me wrong, it's not all sad, it's also a good laugh.
