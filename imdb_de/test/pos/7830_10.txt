This is one of the funniest movies ever made. And for those of you who do not understand it, it should be funny. So often, comedies try to be so deliberately funny that they're missing, but here's finally a movie that manages to be humorous in the most subtle ways. Even "parodies" lack the originality and natural feel of this film. It's a comedic classic that's certainly appreciated in another time when studios do such things regularly. kudos to the creators and a hilarious cast of actors, including Isaac Wade, whose achievements are first-rate. A truly erupting star performance by a truly underrated stage actor. It would be great to see how this guy is due.
