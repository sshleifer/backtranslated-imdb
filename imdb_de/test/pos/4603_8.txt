A good x bad movie with taste of "James Bond", "Romeo and Juliet" and maybe even "Star Wars". The evil Count of Bruno receives an English gentleman as a guest a very dangerous hunt. The pretty triangle is provided by Elga, the beautiful, simple and well-intentioned lady who had to marry the count. The number of missing eyes indicates a terrible past. The Englishman is not what the count thinks and is a terrible treatment for him. There are also terrible hunchbacks, crocodiles and even the appearance of some torture instruments. Boris Karlloff makes a strong but somewhat stiff presence here in a supporting role. The other actors (and directors) are the symbol of an era of strong representation of black and white films. From the beginning, there is no doubt who the evil is, who the good is. Even traitors and stiffs are easy to spot.
