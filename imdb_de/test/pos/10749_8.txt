This production was a surprise for me. I absolutely love obscure movies from the early '30s, but I was not prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. If you may not be confident in the first half, stay in the final. Of course, you have to consider the crass racism as up-to-date. A mesmerizing viewing experience, but I think THE CAT'S PAW is not yet available on Video / DVD. Customize your PBS records!
