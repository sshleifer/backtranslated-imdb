I did not understand what that line meant ... now I do. I did not really want to see Dirty Dancing either. I rented it but never saw it - and today I did it. And I thought it was a really funny, great movie where you want to get up and dance. Okay, sometimes it was cheesy ... but it's still a great movie. I can not believe that Jennifer Gray was 27 years old in this movie - my girlfriend and I thought she looked like 18 or 19-20 at the most. I think that's attributed to her acting talent. And sometimes she really looked awkward. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can say that he is in his thirties and looks a bit old. Still very good. I love songs from the 80's, so it really impressed me, and the love story (yes, I'm romantic) was so wonderful. I really enjoyed this movie. Has exceeded my expectations!
