I've seen the show for about four weeks, which is enough to get a feel for the show. I think she shows potential. While much is borrowed from other shows (which sci-fi does not do these days) and the characters are stereotyped, I like what they do with the stories. Despite the essentially modular nature of each episode, there is some continuity in the plot development and the build up of character interactions / relationships. Some science-related topics were explored, as well as revelations about characteristics and weaknesses. They've also added some comedy, something I'd like to see more in "serious" science fiction. Overall, this provides a balance that, in contrast to the debates between Star Trek and Babylon 5, in which I was a frequent participant and witness, can address larger groups. The visual aspects of the show are more than adequate and well budgeted for a first season. Acting is acceptable and I'm curious how well the actors manage to develop their characters from their scripted stereotypes. I see enough positive and potential ways to see where the show is going ...
