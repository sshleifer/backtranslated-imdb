Mud and Sand is one of Stan Laurel's parodies of the then popular movies, Rudolph Valentino's Blood and Sand (hence rhubarb is Vaselino). Although the characterization was partially contradictory (how he defeated these bulls in the beginning is not explained), this was mostly funny from start to finish, as one of the best sequences was a dance he did with his then-wife of ordinary law, Mae Laurel, did. Another amusing sequence concerns his reluctance to film Femme Fatale, Filet de Sole, while his wife Caramel is waiting for him and showing some of his later innocent character with Oliver Hardy. Interesting for anyone interested in Mr. Laurel's early work, in front of his fateful team that has made him popular around the world.
