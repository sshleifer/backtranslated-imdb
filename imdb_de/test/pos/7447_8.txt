Then just look at it. It's damn great. The fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool! It's kind of like a video game, with amazing close combat. <br /> <br /> This film is for the fans: "To those who once loved this world and spent time with their friends, gather again and devote your time ..." Apart from this ominous opening was The story is not very difficult to follow, and I've never played a Final Fantasy game. I think it's worth getting to know RPGs in general. The knowledge of the genre somehow helps to understand something better. I think if you pay attention and accept what the movie is throwing at you, it's easy to understand. There are many things that are not explicitly explained, and if you demand that they do, you will probably be confused and irritated. <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie, you'll be right in the middle of a big saga and put together as much of the puzzle as possible. I like this approach. They are captured by the mystery and confusion that all characters go through. But as I said, just accept. When a weird red lionwalk speaks, shows up and starts kicking his ass and taking names, and the other characters just say he's an old friend, accept it and move on. You do not need a biopic flashback or a sit-me-down. You are an observer of something beyond your experience and understanding. <br /> <br /> So: fantastic graphics and animations, great voice, cool video game style music involving story and characters, and maybe some of the coolest fights you'll see soon. It is worth seeing and although it is for the fans, it is perfect for people like me who have never played the games before.
