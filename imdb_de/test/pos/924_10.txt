I believe that I have the same psychological attitude with Kieslowski. He is Pole, I am Dutch, but we have a synthetic thinking: The world is not metaphysical, and that is no coincidence. Hardly ruled by one person or perhaps by a poet-prime minister, so that Poland as a social and cultural "depression" could play the role it played during the Second World War, critical and Christian towards the Jews, but often no less critical of themselves , In Kieslowski's world view there is innocence and guilt as symbols in Catholicism: the white against the Black Madonna. In Rouge, she is the Black Madonna that the judge fell in love with when he was a young man. Flashbacks are intricately woven into the present in a magical-realistic manner, albeit by accident, like the camera simply swung to the other side of the street, or the then-judge's red jeep, passing the young woman's car after accidentally had hit his dog with it. We will cover later that we jumped through time with the same camera movements. His love remained unanswered, so his life was not what he had planned. He lost his ability to love other humans and animals. As a judge, he actually thinks of spying on other people's lives, and when he retires, he just keeps doing this and spies on his neighbors. The innocence and sense of righteousness of the younger woman (literally) accidentally getting into his life restores his better judgment, which is why he spontaneously confesses his espionage behavior towards his neighbors and the police by accepting and even holding them Stones were thrown consistently through his windows. This story is repeated between this man and the woman he loves, although this time he is old and the woman is not the same. Kieslowski may have struggled with this piece, because the old judge is his alter ego, and it is said that he had been stunned by Irene Jacob. Both women play the same essential role in his psychology, the one (!) Who possesses heart and soul and therefore can break him or her, even as an old man! It's as if the "forces in the air" bring them together or God brings them together. Coincidences are * random * random to be just coincidence or even luck. There must be a mystical, supernatural or theological source that influences these unfathomably deep decisions. The study book opened on the exam question page is another example. Or the moment the old judge pronounced the young woman his heart, the wind in front of the opera house suddenly slams open the open doors and breaks the windows. The gigantic image of the young woman just predicts that on TV after the drowning accident on her canal crossing. These moments are accentuated by the human voice of the liturgy or what sounds like it (Van den Budenmayer).
