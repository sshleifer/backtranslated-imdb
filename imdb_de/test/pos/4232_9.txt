I'm from Germany, please excuse my writing style. When I first saw Chucky 4, I was a little surprised. I knew Chucky as an ordinary 80s movie, but Bride of Chucky was very different from the old ones. First of all there is the artwork of the very good director Ronny Yu, to whom we still think from A Chinese Ghost Story. His visual style is comparable in some ways to Francis Ford Coppola. The voices of Chucky and Tiff are also very impressive. I also really liked the script, especially the scene where Tiff throws the champagne bottle into the ceiling mirror. If you have comments on my opinion, just send me an e-mail. MFG Schawez
