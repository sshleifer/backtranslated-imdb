<br /> <br /> It's very special to see a movie in a good old-fashioned movie house, which gives every picture a huge appeal. Fortunately, I was able to watch the film forum in New York during their three-week tribute to the legendary director Ernst Lubitsch-Kom√∂dien. The double feature that I participated in was a screening of Lubitsch's 1938 comedy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife and the pre-code classic Design for Living that I had never seen before. Everything I read about Design for Living praised the movie, but I could not find a good review for Bluebeard's Eighth Woman anywhere. Leonard Maltin did not like it. Also VideoHound rated the comedy low. His IMDB score was not complementary. Pauline Kael (not a big surprise) brought the film in its scathing criticism. When I went to town on that day, I expected that I would enjoy Bluebeard's eighth wife little and absolutely love Design for Living. Bluebeard's esteemed wife (first shown) began when the eccentrics who populated the cinema took their seats and relinquished the music of the thirties. `Adolph Zukor presents Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper in Ernst Lubitsch's Bluebeard Eighth Woman ', read the title card. Then the picture opened with a funny scene: Cooper wants to buy pajama tops, but he does not want any part of the pants! He gets into a fight with the employee who is seeking the help of his senior bosses and they seem to have no end to the argument. Enter Claudette Colbert, one of the most beautiful, charming and talented people in the thirties. "I take the floor," she enters in a friendly manner. And there may be screwball comedies that are best "cute". The film kept my interest wonderfully upright. I almost always laughed. As Colbert finds out shortly before taking a family portrait that her future groom was married seven times, broke the entire theater in Histerics. If she acts for money immediately after her shock, the laughter (which has not stopped yet) becomes more intense. And Edward Everett Horton has also milked some funny reactions from the script. When Cooper drew inspiration from Shakespeare's The Taming of the Top by disciplining his wife by slapping his face, I could not control my laugh as she struck him back. And the drunken scene with the spring onions is one of the funniest scenes of Claudette Colbert. The biggest comic moment of the movie came when Colbert picked up a boxer to teach her husband a lesson. In a pure ball of balls he strikes the wrong man and puts her friend David Niven into a cold sleep. He wakes up when Cooper arrives. To cover up the situation, even in a moment of intense sex, Colbert holds her hand to Niven and asks, "Where did this man meet you?" Here? Exactly here? Exactly here?' and then BAM! beat him out again! The movie was wonderful, from start to finish he was a perfect joy. I also loved Design for Living, though I dare to say, I think, pure Lacherin and entertainment. Bluebeard's Eighth Woman was the better and happier movie. A vintage movie can be seen on the big screen. And in the presence of others who laugh, you feel better. Maybe that's why I felt the way I did with Bluebeard's Eighth Lady.
