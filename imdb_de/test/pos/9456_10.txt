When I saw the first preview, I almost fainted with excitement. I have long been a fan of Twelfth Night - it has made me Shakespeare, so a modern adaptation is a dream come true. My anticipation was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The storyline basically follows the original plot and that means: complicated! I do not even want to try to describe it, the summer action will probably cover the basics. Imagine a girl pretending to be a guy in a boarding school, thinking of all sorts of situations that might arise. I will not even pause to challenge the plausibility of such a conspiracy. The reality is NOT the meaning of the film. <br /> <br /> What it is, however, is absolutely funny. Nearly every scene makes up the comedic setup. Kudos to the authors, directors and actors. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is the star of this movie and she wears it wonderfully. She is super cute, no vixen and can make flawless comedy. I admire her so much that she is not like her in her movies or public life, as so many starlets do today. I am glad that there is at least one decent young actress in Hollywood. OK, I'm out of my soapbox ... <br /> <br /> Channing Tatum, yes he's hot and built like a Flippin gorilla, but he really makes me laugh! My favorite scenes throughout the film are when he tries to talk to Olivia by talking first about cheese and later about his training program. <br /> <br /> Even the rest of the cast did not make wonderful additions to the figures in the shapes of the inhuman debutante mother and the classic evil friend Monique. All in all a lot of fun, a lot of laughter and a very attractive cast. Maybe not at the level of the original, but it surpasses modern versions of other games, including the much-lauded 10 things I hate about you.
