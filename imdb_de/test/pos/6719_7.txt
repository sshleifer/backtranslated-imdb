Although unlike other sci-fi movie giants like 2001: A Space ODYSSEY or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THIRD ART, LIFEFORCE is a totally berserk and bizarre fusion of science fiction and horror elements. Despite the dialogue, which approaches ridiculous and dramatic, it somehow manages to work from a few very different elements. <br /> <br /> Lose, based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel The Space Vampires, directed by Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) focuses on a joint US-British mission aboard the British Space Shuttle Churchill to study the comet of Halley. Under the guidance of an American commander (Steve Railsback) they discover an extraterrestrial spaceship in the comet of the comet. And when they examine the interior of the spacecraft, they find extraterrestrial inmates who look like giant bats. Later, the Churchill reaches Earth's Earth orbit but no answer is given on radio calls from the mission's home base, the Space Research Center in London. Columbia is being called to a rendezvous with Churchill, but the entire ship is ransacked by fire - except the alien creatures, wrapped in glass and far from being touched by the fire, look absolutely perfect. The aliens are being repurchased to Earth ... and there the unbelievable happens. <br /> <br /> These space vampires flee the space research center and do not suck their victims through wounds, but through blood bite on 'life force' out of them completely. One of them is the Space Girl, a thoroughly naked vampire played by Mathilda May. Railsback, the only survivor from Churchill, is shopped by the head of the SRC (Frank Finlay) and a British special agent (Peter Firth) to pursue May who is in telepathic contact with him. But soon the vampires have turned London into a scene of pure holocaust. People are either dehydrated or transformed into zombies, and the threat posed by NATO to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation is huge. Finally, Railsback overtakes May and sacrifices herself by impaling her with a large metal saber. Undoubtedly incoherent, no doubt uneven, but still worth seeing, despite the frequent incoherence of the script and its behavior, it benefits from some of the best-in-class special effects of John Dykstra (STAR ​​WARS), among the best ever seen. The other work element, and a surprise element, is the incredible orchestral music of Henry Mancini, who is almost Wagnerian, just as John Williams' score was for STAR WARS - and Mancini, like Williams, uses the London Symphony Orchestra to boot ! <br /> <br /> Largely forgotten these days, and LIFEFORCE, a critical box office box-topping in 1985, should, if for no other reason, be seen for anyone with a sense of the bizarre. It has never been so similar to a movie before, and it will not happen again.
