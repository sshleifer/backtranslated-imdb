Every show is excellent. Finally, a show about something other than why it's a shit to be married or talk good-looking people about why they are like normal people. Too bad that it was canceled. <br /> <br /> Mike Scully and Julie Thacker, formerly of the Simpsons, wrote or proactively produced some of the funniest episodes of this series and many of the similar humor that are based here. Take Officer Steve Cox and think of Troy McClure. However, it has its own unique kind of humor, and let's be honest, a young girl will only love it from the faces alone. What is it about the television that breaks off most of the good shows and we? Are the spoons fed with such atrocities, with whom my mother has almost slept, or whatever this show is called? Please study a lesson. It does not have to be about cuteness or romantic troubles, or more about reality shows, to demystify every aspect of life. Some people like to laugh and do not have to think. Well, my grip is done for the day. Now back to the Simpsons. When is it going? Oh yeah! The whole time.
