Okay, here's the deal. There's this American pilot who flies and takes care of his own business when he's suddenly outnumbered by nasty, cowardly, non-American fighter jets (these guys are guys from the Middle East, but suffice to say that they do not like apple pie or Elvis Presley) who continue to shoot him down. Well, this American pilot did not do anything wrong, but those nasty non-Americans did not care, and before you know it, he's been detained in a foreign jail and sentenced to death. Well, what would normally be normal? Here happens that the US military bombed some nearby cities until the pilot was released, but not this time. These evil peace-loving types were probably involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre. As you can imagine, the pilot's family does not like this and the evil foreign dictator has that smug, contented look. He will make these Americans pay for it, oh yes! But he did not expect Doug Masters, the 16-year-old son of the captured pilots. You see, Doug was able to fly an airplane longer than he could drive a car (which can not be that long) and decides to fly into that evil, foreign land and get his father back. With the help of his friends, Doug and his wingman, former pilot? Chappy 'Sinclair, Doug launches a two-man air raid on the strangers. <br /> <br /> Now you think that this plan will fail, but you are wrong. Sure, these guys from the Middle East are all seasoned pilots, but Doug has an ace up his sleeve. He listens to rock music when he flies! After killing about a dozen enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery, Doug lands at an airport and puts his now wounded father on the plane. Understandably, the evil is not so complacent anymore, the dictator is annoyed with these antics and even goes to heaven to shoot down Doug. But the young guy hears more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky. HURRAY! <br /> <br /> After Doug and Chappy have shot down 90% of their Air Force, the aliens are sending their last aircraft in a rather poor attempt to shoot Doug, but in recent times US F16s' flights are appearing and driving them away , <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. It was the first videotape movie I brought, and until I was twenty, I always hoped my father would be shot down over a foreign land to save him. But he does not like flying, so it did not happen.
