Not everything, but the bulk of this story is that Buster is believed to be Dead Shot Dan, a notorious criminal. <br /> <br /> There's really no story, just a series of adventures to show Buster's physical talents that are amazing and his comic timing. The 27-minute film is basically an adventure after another, where most people are chased after our hero. Before, it was a bunch of cops bouncing down the streets on their beats to Keaton and later "Big Joe" Roberts, a plump bull - and father Buster is interested in - who chases him. These latter scenes were the best I thought, with many clever gags in the hotel elevator where Big Joe and his daughter live. That was Keaton at his best. <br /> <br /> It's just a crazy half hour that makes little sense, but does not matter? Buster is best at or near his slapstick, so it serves its purpose: to entertain us. Just think: 85 years after this movie was filmed, still people (like me) are discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics! Cool!
