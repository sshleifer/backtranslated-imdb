Because I love movies like "Central do Brasil" ("Central Station", 1998), I love "Chop Shop". There is no sugar coating, there is no attempt to make the lives of these people something patronizing or beautiful. What you see is what you get, which is often bleak and sometimes heartbreaking. But that's what makes a movie like "Chop Shop" so wonderful, in addition to the fact that the plot unfolds so elegantly and subtly. For a young brother and a young sister who are as close to homelessness as one would ever wish to work (and live) in a garage in Queens, New York is as good as it gets. Is that a good or a bad thing? That's the question that this movie essentially asks the viewer. This movie is really a fantastic piece of life that sometimes feels like a documentary rather than a drama, and that's a great thing because it looks and feels so real. In the midst of so many current films based on essentially surreal and often implausible plots, "Chop Shop" stumbles like a little gem.
