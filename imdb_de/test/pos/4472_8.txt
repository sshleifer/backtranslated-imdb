I love this movie, although I do not like how it imagines Egyptians to be an Egyptian citizen themselves! That's why it earns eight out of ten. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is uncomfortable and of course because of the loneliness and life in this cave, he develops a kind of madness and passion for this leopard. <br /> <br /> A very touching scene when the leopard dies observe Augustine's reaction. <br /> <br /> All in all, I find it pleasant and happy to read Balzac's short story.
