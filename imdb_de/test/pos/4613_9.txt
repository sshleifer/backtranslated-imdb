Good Mourning Sethrp-1, you have FULLY missed the point. The girl was only briefly seen because she was the one who would kill herself ... everyone else was so involved in their own stories that they did not notice her, and neither did we. As one of the other students say in the end, we are all so wrapped up in our own problems that we do not notice what's going on for someone else. <br /> <br /> The director himself said that if he had killed one of the others, it would have indicated that their problems were worse than those of another. The key to killing Kelly was that she was not noticed by all of us. Get it now?
