In 1931 he also presented "An American Tragedy", the original story of "With whom will he take poor or rich girls". This was a really entertaining movie. Babs Stanwyck was as pretty as she could be, as was Sally Blane. Monroe owsley unmistakably played Babs's husband. I had never heard of him, but I thought he had a good physical resemblance to Crosby of 'The Big Broadcast' ('32), even a receding hairline and winged ears. Ricardo Cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold. a real movie pioneer who goes back. The dilemma is solved in the end, to the rigors of the title and I think Annette Hanshaw had the hit recording, although the off-screen voice was very good. I also liked the dance scenes. I'm sure they were authentic. The band, one of the leaders of the time, was great. good job, Lionel Barrymore !!!!
