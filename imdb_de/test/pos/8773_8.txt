I'm a big Hitchcock fan and have seen "Rear Window" on TV since then. "Saboteur" is not the best of Hitchcock for me, it's very good, but not a masterpiece. It has its flaws, some parts are quite slow and as a result of being hastily written off, the script felt incomplete. But the direction of Hitchcock is excellent and the performances were not that bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane both do a good job, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd come very close to the show. The story is good, it's about an unbeliever on the run, very similar topics used in "39 Steps" and "North By Northwest", and he cleverly delivers some much-needed escapism. The music score was absolutely outstanding. The music in the first title sequence was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and I liked the digging in Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concerto and Beethoven's 5th Symphony. The cinematography is also crisp and smooth, the landscape and landscapes are almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes. The highlight is the Statue of Liberty, but the meeting of the circus troupe and the shooting of the Radio Music City Hall are also on the money. All in all, not Hitchcock's best, but definitely worth it. Bethany Cox
