LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very good movie, although he suffers a bit because there have been similar films. In many ways, the film is reminiscent of earlier raiding films such as RIFIFI and GRAND SLAM and many others. While director Melville and the actors did a great job, this all seems to be a case of déjà vu. That's why I found it hard to give this great movie a higher score. <br /> <br /> The unusual aspect of the movie is how the crooks come together. Instead of the usual means, Vogel escapes from prison and happens to meet Corey, a career criminal who has just been released from prison! They both go well together, but it was a smart touch to both have to work in parallel for much of the film until they met. Apart from that, most of the film is expected to be the meticulous detail in planning and executing the crime. I also appreciated how the film showed the crooks in such a cold and freestanding way - something that is relatively common in French thrillers, but has been rare in American movies until the last few years. See ... if you do not mind that it seems a bit repetitive, you will see fine acting, directing and a lot of excitement.
