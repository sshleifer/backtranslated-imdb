Tim Robbins makes a wonderful movie. His wife (susan sarandon) does a wonderful job as Sister Helen Perjean, who wants to help Mattew Poncelet (Sean Penn), who is being charged with murder and will also die from a syringe ... 120 minutes of magnificent acting and touching scenes what you get. Great show and it's a movie that makes you think! <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon earned the Oscar for best actress in 1995. It's probably one of her biggest movies ever. <br /> <br /> I did not see "The Craddle will Rock", but I have to watch more Robbins movies. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9/10 or *** 1/2 of 4. Go and see .....
