Darling Lili is a blend of perfection and magic! The stars; Julie Andrews & Rock Hudson could not have made a better attempt if they tried. It's full of the magic a young lady wants, and it seems like everything can really happen to you. The brilliance of the director; Blake Edwards is at his best. He really captured the woman he loved on the screen! <br /> <br /> The mix of each song was perfect for the moment of the movie. The film was singing with Julie Andrews whistling away in the dark and closing with the same song from Andrews ... <br /> <br /> As it is: "Inspirational ... Pure .... Inspirational!" ~ One of Andrews most memorable lines in this movie!
