THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE <br /> <br /> There are some movies that I can watch all my life and never get tired of, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was an attempt in 1987 to bring the old favorites back to the front of the animation, this time on the big screen. At a time when Disney dominated the movie industry in terms of animation quality and box office, THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE is considered one of the best animation films that Disney did not produce in the '80s. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and elemental: Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete with the Chipettes (Janette, Eleanor & Brittany) around the world. However, when the chipmunks come across exotic dangers, they do not know that they are the farmers in a big diamond raid. The CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE has never been and never will be a movie that will rocket thanks to a gripping plot. And for people who have not loved it as a child, the movie is unlikely to be more than a pleasant, yet memorable, animated film. But for me it will always be a little known masterpiece. Something about the movie clicks for me in a way that few films offer. <br /> <br /> Every song is fun, optimistic and harmless. Highlights include the Chipettes in a slightly aroused Arabian dance to calm snakes. There is also a very sweet song in which the chipmunks sing, that they travel around the world and we can see them at major sights in the world. One of the Chipmunk characters is that the songwriters have always managed to write songs that are catchy without being annoying, despite the potentially annoying vocals. This movie is no exception ... it actually offers one of the best animated movie soundtracks of the 80s, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Every joke is sweet, sincere and amusing. The pieces between the bad guys and a spoiled puppy are very amusing. And the shock of seeing Chipettes almost forced into marriage by a children's emperor is the same. The comedy manages to play with the kids constantly, so they will not miss anything, but everything remains charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to entertain them. <br /> <br /> It is really just a fun trip that is completely modest in its ambitions. CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE never aims to be something more than it is, harmless fun. I'm the first to admit that this is a biased review, because I have such a nostalgic taste for THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE that I would never be able to give a bad review ... But it still fills me up with such childish satisfaction while watching it. Everyone has their random favorite from childhood that nobody knows, and for me it's this movie. And every movie that I watch over and over, whether I'm 5, 12, 23 or older, is a great movie in my eyes. <br /> <br /> ... A- ...
