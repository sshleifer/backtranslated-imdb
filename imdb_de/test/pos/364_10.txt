This is another of Hitchcock's highest rated films and rightfully so. This is a story of two men who meet in a train and playfully exchange killer fantasies. One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously and this leads Guy Haines (Farley Granger) to problems with the law. Another Hitchcock movie with many great scenes (the carousel scene and the tennis match are worth mentioning). Not a movie to miss - it's a shame no one will re-release this on DVD with a multitude of extras.
