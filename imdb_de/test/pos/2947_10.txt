Fantastic documentation. A movie inside a movie. I'm so glad that Block faked his mother after his death. One wonders about the time and the money invested in the therapy. What could have happened if she had not had this outlet? Did the therapist help her or just nurture a dependency that sustained his bank flush? The public needs to understand that the divorce was less of an option then. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or training. She seemed trapped by the situation. I wonder if the therapist ever tried to think about her, what she could have done to change her situation and get free? Meanwhile, Ms. # 2 was just the opposite. She was out there working with his father. ended her bad marriage, braced herself and seemed to be a very confident person. Whatever the state of the marriage may be, the blocs have done something right by raising 3 children who can look at their parents' story, agree with it and share it with us, and maybe talk to us To include parents and spouses.
