A touching documentary that gives the tragedy of 9/11 a human face by showing how a small community has teamed up to honor two high school friends lost that day. The film interweaves the lives of Chris and Tom through interviews with family and friends and snippets of old photos. Through her memories, we see two tragically broken lives. The film also documents how, through a series of coincidences, an inspirational memorial garden has been created through the efforts of many people known and unknown to the two victims. Through laughter and tears (and sweat) we see the power of hope, honor and love. This film evokes many different emotions, but the last feeling is the admiration of the human spirit, which is not surprised by the tragedy.
