I had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable sci-fi network. It reminded me of the Irwin Allen TV series of the late 1960s (Time Tunnel, etc.). Excellent effects (they beat Star Trek 5 20 years later, but that was not very hard to do.) <br /> <br /> I found the script very interesting and mature for this type of production. You would have needed a few touch-ups to solve a few loose ends of the characters, but for a children's film this is surprisingly interesting (especially the look at the futuristic European politics, which is surprisingly similar to today's European Union!) <br /> < The plot is indeed reminiscent of Twilight Zone in general (as other users have hinted), but in that case it's a compliment. <br /> <br /> By the way, great sets! <br /> <br /> 7/10
