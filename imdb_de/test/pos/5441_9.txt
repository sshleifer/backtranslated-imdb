Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best comedians in the world. He really shows himself here and makes jokes like the talk show comedian Tom Dobbs. From the previous stand, it looked like it was a laughing laugh party. And it was funny. But there were many serious parts in the movie that I did not expect. I would describe it as drama / comedy. But it's still worth the money, and I still found it almost everything I expected. Robin Williams is in great shape with the famous Christopher Walken. They play a very good team in this film and I was really shocked to see how well they worked together. I recommend it to anyone looking for a carefree movie.
