I just saw this movie and made me cry. It's a beautiful drama about two brothers falling in love, and I think it's a good idea, especially for the closed ones, to see this one here. I loved the short film genre after watching a couple, because they have to make an impression on you so quickly, and I have to say that this movie has definitely put its stamp on it. It has described some things that I have never really thought about, for an incest. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the end was not too important to me. Only once do I want to see a gay-oriented movie without wanting to kill myself after the stations. They almost always end up in a tragedy. It was 'sweet' how much they had to be together, even if it was death. <br /> <br /> I have given him eight stars, and I recommend it to everyone, because I think there is 'insider-look' in the world that this movie is going to you. <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening, have fun.
