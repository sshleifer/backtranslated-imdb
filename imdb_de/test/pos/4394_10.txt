When I saw this movie for the first time, it did not seem to go anywhere. When I saw it a second time, it made a lot more sense. Give it a chance, look at it more than once, there are many key elements that shape the story that could be missed on the first and second times. The Cohen brothers brilliantly interweave the current events of the early 20th century into this story to create a credible backdrop and storyline. The combination of Clooney's lead role blends well with the minor acts of Turturro and Nelson. John Goodman's appearance in the movie is hilarious. The soundtrack is great too. This movie has become a favorite favorite for my family. 10/10, sure.
