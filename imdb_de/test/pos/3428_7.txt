An interesting comedy that took place in December 1945 on a train from Stockholm to Berlin. The poor writer / critic who quits his job and jumps to Berlin by train can not apologize. His goal is to make a difference and to participate in the construction of the new united Europe at the end of the war. <br /> <br /> I like the black-and-white format of the movie as well as the closed scenery of a movie train in motion. <br /> <br /> Robert Gustafsson makes a classic "Gustafsson role" in this film. If you are a fan of him, this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> The philosopher Wittgenstein is referred to by his adage "You never assume that anything is what it seems to be," is mentioned several times the movie.
