The first of the Italian rip-offs of the French soft-pop blockbuster (though it might be interesting to note that the boat-shaped country actually starred with Cesare Canevari's 1968 IO, EMMANUELLE with Erika Blanc) is a very different fish kettle than the sloppy sequels to the deceased, questionable Joe D'Amato. It is much closer to the now very outdated "Just Jaeckin" film of 1973, which questions a poker-side view of the relationship between men and women and so hot issues such as faithfulness and jealousy in a luxurious, exotic environment questioned. Unlike D'Amato, director Albert Thomas (aka Adalberto Albertini, who also found it hard to find YELLOW EMANUELLE, actually a sexual version of MADAME BUTTERFLY!), Shows us no predatory drug kings, snuff makers, or rampaging cannibals. For an admittedly less sensational but much more erotic visual experience. <br /> <br /> Photojournalist Mae Jordan aka 'Emanuelle' (Javanese-born Laura Gemser in her first starring role after playing as a Thai masseuse in EMMANUELLE 2 and an 'untouched native' in Just Jaeckins' part of the rarely seen one "COLLECTIONS PRIVEES" flies to Nairobi, where she shoots the stills containing an article by the well-known British novelist Anne, played by the very Teutonic Karin Schubert, who takes a butch haircut to get used to.Anne shares with her Italian husband Gianni (Angelo Infanti) has an "open relationship" (remember when this happened), which means that both jump quite a bit with one pulse, and in contrast to their later reputation, Emanuelle is positively reticent compared to their heavy breathing hosts and melts seductively at Gianni to the exquisitely tempting profit.Okay, she compensates for this lack of courage in the end when she plays a full male hockey team on the train. I do not fool myself. <br /> <br /> The production of this sexploitation classic is pretty impressive, especially the excellent film art. And Nico Fidenco's musical theme is a solid favorite for anyone who has more than a brief interest in the genre, a hilarious Eurotrash-pop-ditty (try to understand these nonsensical lyrics and have a full family fun with them) !) Turning Throughout the movie, you can move from slow and sexy to hip hip disco in every imaginable way. <br /> <br /> But this is just the show of Laura Gemser. Simply charged as "Emanuelle" (as well as another actress at EMANUELLE NERA 2 by the same director), she lights up the screen from start to finish. Not yet subject to endless rape scenarios (as it once would have been when D'Amato took power), she seems much more relaxed than in later films and occasionally even smiles, which is rarely the case when someone has seen the lady's work I know for sure. A flawless Eurasian and not as the title suggests black beauty (she comes from the Dutch India and is actually very similar to the supposed author of the novel Emmanuelle Arsan), she projects a somewhat passive, even submissive sensuality that somehow distracts her from the ' Corruption results in their morally corrupted cohorts. Unlike the French film, the cheap-kate's moralization is reduced to a minimum and thrown in just before the end of the film, when Emanuelle Gianni says he never lost her at first. I swear that you could hear the audience of the Just Jaeckin version groan whenever Alain Cuny's extremely irritating Mario appeared on the screen as we spent too many minutes with halfbacks posing as alibi for the divine Sylvia Kristel (now living in the US) by the way, the Belgian capital brussels ...) undressed, the real reasons that theaters were full for years. Gemser's late husband, Gabriele Tinti (now deceased, she has remarried), appears on the sidelines as the ever-drunk "Scottish" (huh?) Writer who temporarily forces Emanuelle amidst the African ruins, but no real sex scene though.
