When I saw this funny but very entertaining career story, I was impressed by Joan Crawford's first appearance. At first I could only think, "My God, it's the same face as Michael Jackson in his infamous posting photo!" <br /> <br /> About 34 minutes before the movie, Diane Baker and Hope Lange get off a taxi in Greenwich Village. As you walk down the street, you can see a portion of a sign behind you for the Stonewall Bar scene of the epic "riots" that are triggering the modern gay rights movement. > Speaking of Baker and taxis. I had to laugh as she rushed in and told the taxi driver: "56th and Sutton Place, please - and be careful with the bumps." Can you imagine a driver's reaction in today's Manhattan ?! She says that, of course, because she is pregnant and does not want to hurt the fetus. But that does not stop her from jumping out of a moving car when she learns that Bob Evans wants an abortion! Well, they had to find a way to lose the baby (1959 and all). Sue Carson is adorable like Mary Agnes. Why was that her only movie? There is no biographical information about them in IMDb.
