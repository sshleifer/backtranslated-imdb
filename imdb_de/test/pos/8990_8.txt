As with most sports films, it's not surprising that people who know about sports can find flaws in it. As a football referee, I have not seen a movie or television program properly portray a match. "Forever" has good actors, but I found Sean Astin a bit young to be an administrator in a juvenile detention center. I was very grateful that it was not that the main character turned his fellow inmates into rugby players and attacked Flagstaff and Highland. And that's going to be frivolous: a police car is just arriving at exactly the same time the Flagstaff baddies are leaving Rick Penning in ruins. Although rugby is not a state-recognized university sport, the team is a school-based club sport - similar to the rodeo. However, I find it hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds: this is simply not done on this day of AIDS and hepatitis. I do not care what the tradition and the macho image is. Still, it was a cool movie where teenagers were expected to act like adults (and sometimes actually). Unfortunately, far too many coaches like Flagstaffs - or worse.
