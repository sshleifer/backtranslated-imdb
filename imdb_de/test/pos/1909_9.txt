Dolemite is great. Rudy Ray Moore's mature kung fu pimp with terrific choreographed action sequences is as close as you are to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually faking. Citizen Kane, this is neither Les Infant Au Revoir, nor is this undoubtedly a genius right. The production values ​​in this film are so bad that they could qualify as existential special effects. The action is a little bit in the middle, but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu hookers is enough to get everyone except the craziest movie lovers through. The infamous omnipresent boom microphone recalls the gloriously incompetent Ed Wood and never gets disturbing. I sometimes wonder if the boom microphone was deliberately left as a commentary on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general, but I'm usually distracted from erotic scenes that lack eroticism to a lot of artfulness. Everything in this film is alive and breathing, dripping with desperate longing to be loved and reviled at the same time. It works. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
