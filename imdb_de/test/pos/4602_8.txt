There's no other word for it ... Fox let that go, no marketing at all. Nobody in the country, except for those who are looking forward to this movie, knows something about it. All red flags have flown. It must be chaos, it can not be nearly as good as Office Space, right? Not correct. Although Office Space is not, this movie definitely has a satirical bite and a joke. It is a dropout at certain levels, but who is to blame is left to a puzzle. <br /> <br /> Based on what is currently being shown in cinemas, I can say that IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's funny, sometimes funny, funny. It's effective, sometimes awesome. What it is not, as far as I can tell, is done. We'll see something from this movie again, no matter if it's a longer cut or a new shoot. Alone it can be funny. It is sometimes very difficult. <br /> <br /> When I left the theater and looked around the mall, I was surrounded by advertising and billboards, commercialization and stupidity. It's not quite as damn dystopia as it was in 1984, but this film makes an ugly future for our culture. And there does not seem to be much that anyone can do about it. Look at this, if you can, and try to figure out what happened, that it was buried so specifically.
