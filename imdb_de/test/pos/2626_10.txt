I remember seeing this movie 34 years ago and it was full of excitement and twists. It grabs you in the beginning and lets you guess the whole movie. I've been thinking about this movie in recent years and asking in video stores if it's available, but I've never been able to find it or anyone who had heard of it. I think that this kind of movie is timeless, and I know it would appeal to a whole new generation of movie watchers. I hope this will be shown on video soon, as it would be fun to see if it has the same effect on me as in the early '70s. <br /> <br /> It is very rare that a TV movie can produce so much an impression, but that was and still is so after so many years.
