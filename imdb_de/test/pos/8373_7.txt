The only reason why The Duke Is Tops, one of several "racing films" filmed during segregation, would be worth mentioning today, is because there was the movie debut of a 21-year-old singer named Lena Horne. She plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who has to leave her producer mentor Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) to head into the big time. However, Davis must have pretended to have taken the money for her services in front of her so she would not be sorry. He then collaborated with Doc Dorando (Lawrence Criner) for a series of medical exhibitions throughout the South. In the meantime, their new producers in New York have been bombed heavily for turning them into a show than just a specialty. Davis finds out from the radio and offers his services as a producer and bandleader to bring along his cast of other specialty acts, many of which have one of their few or only movie appearances here for him to have a chance at the big time with Ethel next door , Guess what happens? While the action has been featured in thousands of other film musicals at the time, making this one for a particular audience makes it one of the most intriguing features I've seen in this Black History Month. Ms. Hornes singing is shown well here and it is interesting to see her so young before her professionalism comes to fruition later in her career. Among other supportive players, according to IMDb, there is an unconfirmed performance by Lillian Randolph, Annie in my favorite movie "It's a Wonderful Life," and Amanda Randolph's sister, whom I've just seen in the musical "The Black Network," not getting healed after Doc's medication was taken before Duke explains that it is for the feet! As a longtime resident of Louisiana, I'd like to note two players in this film from here: Joel Fluellen of Monroe as a tonic customer and Marie Bryant of New Orleans as a sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax. For Lena Horne alone The Duke is Tops is worth seeing at least once.
