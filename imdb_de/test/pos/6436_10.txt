I remember seeing this movie in 1981 when I was 7 years old. It was absolutely awesome! I found the DVD only a few months ago. I almost jumped up and down with joy !! I bought it and showed it to my children. You loved it too. They asked what words the seahorse sang (but I did not tell them because I do not think the words "gay" and "ecstasy" are very good parenting for 6-year-olds). The songs are brilliant. I can still remember everyone. I'll remember her when I'm 60! There or in the vicinity. Tommy Pender is such a brilliant actor. It's a pity he gave it up. <br /> <br /> If you find the movie, BUY IT! You will love it!
