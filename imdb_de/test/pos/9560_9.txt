This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I looked for about 20 minutes, a little confused by what was going on. Then I started to laugh and did not stop until the movie was over. Such a panic satire is indeed rare. Christopher Guest has a real eye for the humor of those who have no sense of humor (at the beginning about 90% of white heterosexual men). As in "Waiting for Guffman," Guest nailed the idiotic self-importance of America to the wall. I can barely wait for his next movie.
