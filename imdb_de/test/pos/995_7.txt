Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller play the story of two women in the life of Dylan Thomas. Knightley is Thomas's childhood friend, whom he sees again during the lightning. They meet again in a bar, but it gets complicated when Thomas brings his wife (Miller) with him the next time he meets her. The women did it and things go on until the trio get together with the man who becomes Knightly's husband. This makes things even more complicated as jealousy begins to show their face. <br /> <br /> Nice to look at, exceptionally well written and wonderfully played (everyone disappears completely in his roles), this is a rich feast for eyes and ears. It's so nice to see a movie about adults as adults. On a purely visceral level, I really enjoyed the movie, because the film is so artistically appealing. Rarely have I ever seen a movie that is so beautifully designed. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that I'm not sure what happened. There seemed to be something missing, and a few times I had to replay the movie to see if I missed something. It is not bad, but as a result not completely satisfactory. (I tried to look up online to see how much of the movie is true, but I could not find anything.) Still, I think this is a worth watching movie. It's a beautiful adult movie that probably plays the best role the leads have made.
