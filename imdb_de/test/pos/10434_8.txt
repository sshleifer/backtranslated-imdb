The Last American Maiden (1982) was one of the few teenage comedies that I really enjoyed. The theme and acting were far beyond the usual tripple Hollywood had (and is) these days. For a while, the smaller studios produced films about teenagers that were not toned down for the kids. The men who pull the strings behind this production were from your Cannon friends. Three teenage friends are trying to lose their virginity while still in high school. They will do anything or anything to reach their dream destination. The sensitive of the group (Andrew Monsoon), what to find the right girl while his two best friends will take whatever they can get. One day the boy finds his perfect girl (Diane Franklin). But fate would play one of her evil pranks. His best friend moves on and sweeps her off her feet. After she pushes her up, the sensitive child helps the girl get back on her feet and pay for the abortion. He still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart. Meanwhile, his best friend has a fierce argument that she has received her dream wife. Nevertheless, he tries his best to make her love him. The night comes when he asks her the question. But his heart is shaken as he sees her dancing with his former best friend. In tears the child leaves the party. <br /> <br /> What I enjoyed about this movie was that it did not hit me. Instead of being filled with wrong situations, it was very realistic, honest and brutal. The movie is full of funny moments and hysteria. I have to recommend this movie for fans of teenage comedies. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
