I thought it would be a lousy movie. Honestly, Rupert Grint, RON, who plays in a movie other than Harry Potter, was really hard to understand. But when the movie started, it turned out that this guy has talent, I mean, is the best actor of the HP trio, for reference, have you seen Emma Watson trying to act? Or what about Daniel? Both lack experience, though they have starred in one million Harry Potter films. Ben, his character, is a very shy boy who is unable to show his true feelings for everything, his contempt for his parent, and the angry anger at his father, who is unable to find his unfaithful wife to confront. Julie Walters was absolutely awesome! Her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past while trying to remember Shakespearean sonnets is absolutely wonderful! It also seems that many teenagers are being wasted in religious stupidity.
