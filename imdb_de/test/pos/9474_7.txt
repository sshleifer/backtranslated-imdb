Five years later, after teaming up with James Cagney on The Public Enemy, Mae Clarke reappears, this time as his fiancee with Cagney's character on the other side of the law. It seems that she has demanded more from them in her relationship and tries to make Johnny Cave a bit more practical with his money and career. They had to imagine that they would come together again after she had given him the boot because she had challenged her crooked boss. These things have a way to train in pictures. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching Cagney in this movie. Usually I do, and here he looked as if he had played the characteristic shoulder-and-shoulder movement he had successfully used in "Angels With Dirty Faces" with Rocky Sullivan. It was right after he threw Cavanaugh (Robert Gleckler) out of his office when he made the first attempt to bribe the new boss of Weights and Measures. He turns to the camera and goes upstairs, as if he's completely satisfied with his reaction to the crooks - very cool. <br /> <br /> I understand that this was not one of Cagney's Warner films, but it could have been like that. Warner often took up the cause of the common man, and the exposure of crooked merchants and the politicians who protected them would have been in their alley. They also have these great street scenes in New York City showing cars and shops of the era, with homemade signs that cost flour for eighteen cents a pound. Hey, how about the furniture store that sold the living room for one hundred and sixty-three bucks, you could get a single floor chair today for that price. <br /> <br /> The best part of the picture could be this meat counter scene, as Cagney, James Burke (Aloysius) and the butchers play with an underweight chicken. One of the movie's lighter moments, but you get an idea of ​​how tense people can become when caught cheating. The same is true for the truck driver, who was urged by Johnny to sign an accurate delivery. he was just not used to that. <br /> <br /> All in all a nice distraction from Cagney's typical gangster presence, even if she does not conform to the standard of his feature films. It's easy enough to get one of the few publicly available Cagney images that are often found in relatively inexpensive compilations.
