I suppose that's called Southern Gothic. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci and Justin Timberlake play a role in this. Timberlake does a good job, much to my surprise, I did not expect it from him. <br /> <br /> If you're lost and can not find your way home, that's the black moan of the snake. <br /> <br /> <br /> The people in this film are definitely in many ways lost, mentally and emotionally damaged, deceived by those they trust and who they loved, and in pain. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson plays a blues singer / musician - whose wife played around with his brother and left him behind for his brother, along with the abortion of a child he had hoped for to be her. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci's character is a woman who was sexually abused at a young age - which has made her a self-destructive nymphomaniac; Allowing men to treat them badly. <br /> <br /> The story is at the intersection of these two characters. It's a love story, but not a sexual love story, between them - the older black man and the young white woman. <br /> <br /> It's different from most Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
