Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny / Daffy Duck / Elmer Fudd in a war of words and jokes about whether it's a rabbit or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy evoke "pronoun problems," with Daffy always being the victim of Elmer's shotgun, causing his beak to be dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's crossdressing, which always puts Elmer in his love mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are my favorites in the category of "Writer-Director-Team" because of these funny trilogy animated cartoons that I've been laughing at since my childhood. And at least two of them end with Daffy's exclamation on bugs: "You are despicable!" That can not be better!
