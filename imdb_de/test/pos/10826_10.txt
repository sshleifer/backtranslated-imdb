When I visited Bon Voyage, I expected a good, clever multidrama commissioned by Grand Hotel (1932) and Les Enfants de Paradis (1944). It was better than that. With few exceptions, none of the characters were totally good or totally evil - just like in real life. The acting was wonderful, especially those played by Frédéric, Raoul and Camille. The photography was astounding as it recreated the epoch perfectly and was filmed during a period of recent public works in Bordeaux, but had the "look" of June 1940. There's so much in this movie that it's worth a second look. It's exciting, funny and ultimately touching. NB .-- Be sure to see it in a theater with good projection quality. It's in widescreen format, and in the theater I saw it in (the Clairmont in Montclair), the subtitles were in the foreground for the first 30 minutes, but the faces of the actors were a bit blurry! This was eventually corrected, but affected the movie's enjoyment.
