Everyone who has worked on this film has done an amazing job. To be honest, this is one of the best lesbian movies I have seen in a long time. The acting, the writing, the cinematography, the music, the visuals, everything was first class. As an avid fan of the genre (both lesbian and gymnastics), I was so excited about this movie. It really gave me so much more than I expected. To hear the Q & A with the cast and the crew was great. The lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and gracious. And the author did a great job, directing and editing it was great. Thanks for a great movie! Thanks also for the line "If you give yourself a label, it would be bisexual". I am so tired of films in which characters who have a relationship with both genders are abused as gay or heterosexual. It is wonderful to see that bisexuals are recognized for their existence, and part of the gay community is even necessary in this film. What an end! Just when I thought it could not exist anymore, it did. Nice work and my applause to all. I will spread the word, this is definitely a movie that should not be missed!
