I have to be honest, I really had a good time to see you is the man. Although it's a typical teenage comedy or if you want to change the sex movie, there were some decent laughs that I think anyone could get. Adults and teenagers would enjoy this movie above all else. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is a typical, rebellious teenager who dresses and acts like a guy, and when she is turned down to try on the boy's football team, she decides to change her brother's appearance to prove himself worthy in the boy's football team. Of course, love shows when she meets another man who considers herself to be her brother. She also has a girl chasing after her. Well, the tagline says it all. <br /> <br /> This is a funny little teenage drama that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes has been able to prove in the movie that behaving like a guy is really hard. : D Well, that's right! <br /> <br /> 8/10
