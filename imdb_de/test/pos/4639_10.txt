As many of the other comments I've read have noticed, I fell in love with this movie when I was a kid. My sister and I had a copy of the movie in beta (before VHS) that we had worn out. Of course, it did not help when our parents sold BetaMax at a flea market. Since then we try to find a copy. Like another commentator, I finally found a rental copy in a local video store. The owner did not want to part with the copy after trying to beg, bribe and cry to own the tape. GOOD NEWS! I bought a brand new, newly released VHS copy of Midnight Madness for $ 9.99 on Amazon.com two days ago !!!! Finally, Disney woke up. Well, if they just release Song of the South ... If you love the movie, grab it. If you have not seen the movie yet, this is worth checking - totally silly humor, but a lot of fun (Stephen Furst is funny).
