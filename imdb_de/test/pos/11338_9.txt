Like many Wong films, many people find them boring and confusing. Well, I like her and I like this movie too. I went out and rented it on DVD and I saw it 3 times. It is a very subtle film that provides an intoxicating experience. For those who did not enjoy it ... they wereted only 2 hours of their lives ... too bad ... muhahahahaha.
