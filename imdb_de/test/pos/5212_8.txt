This is a movie that I come back to again and again for a variety of reasons. As evidence of the suffering of a common soldier on the Eastern Front during World War II, it is a powerful one. The film contains a series of very powerful scenes that help capture the horrors of war, such as the tank battle. From all that I can see, the experiences documented in the film are by and large "true" - if you read A. Beevor's book "Stalingrad" you will know what I mean. The film is also successful in that the character or plot does not allow it to dominate - it's simply a survival story that seeks to portray the battle primarily from the perspective of a common (German) soldier. I read somewhere that the original script had to be toned down, which does not surprise me at all - if they really wanted to show what the fight was like, it would have been almost impossible to be sure. Still, there are still some moments that are hard to observe - this was done before Private Ryan, but may be even harder in some places. Just a word of caution - do not buy the English version of the same name, it is pretty awful and will break the movie - try to get a copy of the original (English) version with English subtitles, it is much more powerful. In that case, you may need to buy a Region 1 DVD of the movie, just like me.
