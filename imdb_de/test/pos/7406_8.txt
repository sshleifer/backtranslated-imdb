This movie was my first acquaintance with the talents of Chris Cooper. I was deeply impressed by the character he played. When I saw the movie, I knew there were more great things coming from this gifted actor. He is playing a Union Captain, who is foraging with some men in Eastern Kentucky. They pass on the farm of a "Sesech" woman whose husband has decided to join the Confederation. <br /> <br /> The depiction of Eastern Kentucky and the seriously divided feelings during the war are very accurate. If you are looking for a war movie with a lot of blood and courage, this would not be the case. If you are looking for a drama that actually and philosophically explores the psychology of peoples at war, this is the best study of how shared loyalties affected the interaction of peoples in the frontier states during the American Civil War.
