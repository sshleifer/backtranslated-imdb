For his latest film, John Huston referred his daughter Anjelica in this adaptation of the story from James Joyce's Dubliners, and he gave us one of his finest achievements to remember him. Joyce is Impossible to film like any other, but "The Dead" at least has a traditional narrative to work with. Many (almost all) important information in the story lies in the spaces between the lines, in the thoughts and expressions of the characters - there are big moments, but they are cerebral - they are not the stuff of making movies. But somehow Huston manages to do it right, and he creates a nearly flawless adaptation. <br /> <br /> Anjelica is awesome and the movie is haunting and powerful. <br /> <br /> Note: A
