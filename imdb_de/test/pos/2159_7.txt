Night Hunter is a B-style action movie. Get a life and grow up people. Don "the Dragon" Wilson is a kickboxer (Hall of Fame) and not an actor. If you're looking for an Oscar, he's not here, brother. In the search for action action films with lower budget this is the case. The plot line is a bit thin, but what B movies are not. I understand that every critic is and how a man's trash is the treasure of another man. Get real people and rate every film as an Oscar contender, just stupid. Great fighting scenes mixed with a new twist on vampire moves. See it, if you're a fan, hire something else if you're a hater.
