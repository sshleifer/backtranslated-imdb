That this movie flopped at the box office and still fights for the recognition it deserves today is a pity - but somehow appropriate. The commercial suicide that the Monkees have committed with this film is reflected in the metaphorical suicide they commit on screen. To brutally destroy her carefully constructed image as a healthy American alternative to the Beatles is courageous and courageous, as well as the admission to be in the entertainment industry only peasants who (in the movie literally) sit in their own prisoners artificiality. The Monkees television series was not that conventional, but HEAD is completely without a plan ... although in the end there is a sort of circular logic behind it. The unreal sequence of events that is not slowed down by a real action is alternately funny and rather disturbing. The biggest irony is that the Monkees effectively signed their death warrant as a trading power when they reached their artistic high point. Her exploration of psychedelia reached its peak with the soundtrack to HEAD (all songs are woven into the film in a memorable way), one of the most popular albums of the sixties. The Monkees began to disintegrate after the movie box office failed, but HEAD serves as a noble legacy.
