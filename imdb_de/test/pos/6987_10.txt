I saw "Into Pitch Black" on TV. and so I had to see that. I have to say, I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Not only has David Twohy's style improved since he wrote "Critters 2". Sure, he was in "Into Pitch Black," but here he was cruel, weird, and intense. I have not seen such charisma since Schwarzenegger in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough, but it's the characters that make this movie interesting. Then something happened to the female lead. Unexpectedly. The dark humor helps the movie, the effects are not great, but when Riddick fights the aliens, he blew out all my complaints. This movie would interest me, but I'm really looking forward to the sequel.
