First of all - I'm not the one who is mad about movies. I saw friends in the 70s when it was first published. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at 50, I can still remember some scenes. The movie is cute and sad and maybe too tame for teens today, but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of two young people to live a better life than they had at home. At the time, it was pretty risky to have a movie about some young outlaws who have successfully built a house and have a baby on their own. I'm not surprised that the movie and Elton John's soundtrack are almost unknown today. The music is beautiful. It was unforgettable.
