It was a fascinating story waiting to be told. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY brings us into the investigation and tribulation of a group of top American researchers who have delivered a high-level mission during World War II: Beat the rest with the atomic bomb. Trapped in a tightly guarded New Mexico complex, the illusions slowly transform the idea from an ambitious concept into an immense reality. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is one of those films that require your special attention. It's a real movie for thinking people, not just because of the scientific aspect of developing a seemingly impossible weapon, but also because of the moral implications of making a massive contribution to killing. Characters are constantly torn between this reality and their warfare as an American. The film is never a sermon, but we can marvel at the enormity of the inner turmoil of these men. The performances also deserve a special mention. Paul Newman is delivering one of his great, unobtrusive achievements as the Pattonesque General responsible for delivering the ultimate big stick to the Allies. <br /> <br /> Where FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY loses much of its traction is unnecessarily romantic component. Dwight Schultz, as the leader of the scientific team, is struggling with his affection for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project. Director Roland Joffe apparently felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story, but the romantic overtones serve primarily as a distraction. Moreover, it is the interaction between the scientists and their military hierarchy that gives us the greatest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is hard to recommend. It is a largely forgotten jewel that puts a human face on one of the most fascinating stories in human history.
