I first heard about this show in 2005, first online and then by watching (and of course buying) the typically great BBC tie book. Then I got the DVD; it did not disappoint! For years, I had hoped someone would do a science fiction program focused on exploration rather than aliens, laser gun battles and other Hollywood boogieman gimmicks! Thank you, Joe Ahearne (also for your work by Dr. Who and Ultraviolet - the miniseries, not the crap movie of the same name)! What compelled me to write this now (2 years later) was that I just saw SUNSHINE last night. And what was in the same family as SPACE ODYSSEY became (about two-thirds of the way). Freddy Krueger meets in 2010! That was when SPACE ODYSSEY really was a positive example of how to make a REAL science fiction movie. more science, less fiction! ODYSSEY (like SUNSHINE) also looked at astronaut shortcomings (Zoe's failed EVA, Ivan's effort on Venus, muzzle checks) and the sheer danger of exploring new planets with unfamiliar dangers (the deadly radiation spike on Mars). I would have easily paid to see this in a theater (I-Max, anyone?). And as a coronation, not only the views of the universe were beautiful, but also the characters were beautifully drawn. I found the interaction more realistic than the breakneck histrionics of the Icarus 2 crew of SUNSHINE (Icarus, stupid name for a solar mission - did anyone read the mythology of Icarus?). Sometimes it takes a not so good movie to watch a better movie again. As an armchair astronaut, I would exchange my passage for Icarus for a seat on Pegasus every day. In all fairness, the visuals of SUNSHINE are stunning and memorable. That's why I've been so committed to making it a science-to-goodness science fiction movie. Although this review is almost a backdoor review by SUNSHINE, I hope it's read what it should be. Strong support for a BBC movie that succeeds where most bloated movie glasses fail on a large budget. SPACE ODYSSEY (a.k.a. TRAVEL IN THE PLANETS here in the States) makes you want solid, SCIENCE fiction and hosts a banquet. I also really enjoyed the pseudo-documentary approach. As for the time delay / speed of light, they are addressed if you pay attention. Where SONNENSCHEIN melts, ODYSSEY remains cool. If you want to take another dose of SUNSHINE in the film, stick with it. Instead, choose a true SPACE ODYSSEY!
