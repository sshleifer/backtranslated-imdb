If you're one of the IMDB viewers who place high fidelity among the top 200 ever, this movie is probably NOT for you. This movie is as unhip as Steve Frears self-confident hip. Renee Zellweger is an excellent journalist who retires to her urban magazine. She returns to her nest in the suburb of Bucks County to look after Mother Streep (who will deliver yet another Hall of Fame performance). William Hurt is ideally staffed and the discouraged, loyal and selfish husband. If this movie does not make you cry and laugh, you're way too hip to enjoy it.
