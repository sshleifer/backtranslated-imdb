This movie was fabulous. It's definitely a top 5 Hitchcock movie. The direction and camera shots are almost flawless (apart from the dog scene, when he licks the man's hand, clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very credible that an innocent man could fall into such a trap. <br /> <br /> I would classify Bruno as Hitchcock's second most interesting character (of course, Bates is the first). Robert Walker plays a very credible madman. He did not overreact the part, which made him credible (much like Perkins did not overstate his part). Overall, this is an excellent movie, an absolute must for all Hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> <br />
