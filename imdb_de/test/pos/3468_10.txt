I'm looking forward to seeing this movie since I caught the trailer for the first time, and I'm so happy I have that now. It is really a wonderful movie. The actors are great, the writing is fresh and genuine, the whole thing was just perfect. I love James McAvoy in this movie and I can not wait to see him in "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" in December. Romola Garai is also wonderful. Take a look at two of my favorite movies in "I Capture the Castle" or "Nicholas Nickleby". All in all, I think I liked this movie because it did not come out. It's a tough topic to tell a story about because you're likely to insult or mess up many people and turn them into an overly sentimental sugar-sweet love affair. But they completely avoided it and instead made a film that is real, honest and touching, yes, but never overdone. Very well done. Amazingly well done. Go out and look at it, and you'll know exactly what I mean.
