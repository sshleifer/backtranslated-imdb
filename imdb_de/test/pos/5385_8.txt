I recently watched this 1918 film in our local Helsinki film archive. It seems that the Danish Film Institute reconstructed it in 2006 to celebrate the centenary of Nordisk Film Society, which was one of the largest in the world at the beginning of the 20th century. I believe that there are currently several copies of English translations being distributed throughout Europe. <br /> <br /> I found the movie intriguing and the journey to Mars well thought out. The plot is certainly original, but right now I really do not want to reveal anything about it, because there is a real danger of spoiling things for you ;-). <br /> <br /> The movie is also ask the DVD of the Danish Film Institute (Det Danske Filminstitut) on dfi.dk for 'Celestial Tibet' for more information.
