The Cure is an outstanding real drama that deals with a very sensitive topic. It is the story of the deep and loving friendship between two boys, Eric and Dexter. The latter has received AIDS through a blood transfusion. Thus, he and his mother (Annabella Sciorra) have become outcasts, shunned by the public and labeled as a dangerous company, largely due to a lack of public knowledge about the disease. When Eric (Brad Renfro, known by The Client and Apt Pupil) and his mother, who moves in next door, he has to deal with public insults and the fear of AIDS itself. However, Eric overcomes his fear and risks everything. He begins talking to Dexter first, then climbs over the fence and joins the funny boy (played by Joseph Mazzello of Jurassic Park) and his games. Very quickly, he develops a real friendship with Dexter, who is delicately built and frail due to his condition. <br /> <br /> The central theme of the film? the theme that makes it completely authentic and tragic at the same time? So Eric and Dexter try to find the ultimate remedy. First, do you experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves? This is very naive, but also real at the same time, because it shows how young children deal with such vile diseases and how strong they still believe in the magic of the world. When they hear of a purported remedy developed in the South, they will not hesitate and embark on an adventure that will bring them closer together, symbolizing the ultimate search for hope. <br /> <br /> So board a raft and head south on the Mississippi River. What begins as a true adventure becomes a dangerous endeavor that is both emotionally fascinating and instructive at the same time. The scene where Dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe, where everything is dark and cold. Eric gives him his sneaker, a symbol that the boy, wherever the boy has to go, is Eric and always will be with him. he will never have to be alone. This one of the most convincing sequence in the film is characterized by a very compelling interaction between the two actors who manage to avoid uncomfortable and stupid dialogues and deliver a very authentic performance that ultimately breaks down in their tenderness and honesty br /> <br /> I will not outline the plot further because I do not want to divulge too much information. The end, however, is emotionally tough, making the audience so much a part of the tragedy that anyone watching the movie will feel personally affected. This aspect makes this movie so strong, so outstanding and so convincing. The emotional stress of each character is so real and so stunning that even the harder spectators need a few handkerchiefs. <br /> <br /> A 10 does justice to this movie and is not overpriced. There is hardly any other movie I have ever seen in my life that deals with such an emotional subject with so much wit and sensitivity. It's the story of two boys making each other's lives rich and teaching each other lessons in life. So Dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness, and Eric learns what really matters in life. and both know how much a gift is true friendship when it comes to the toughest moments of life. <br /> <br /> This movie is tragic? but her message is pure inspiration.
