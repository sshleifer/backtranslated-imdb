I can not remember exactly where I first heard of it, but I listen to a bit of a song and I like it. Went and bought the CD and finally found the kind of music I like. I heard about this video and knew that I had to have it. There are many clips of them playing in concert. Let me tell you that the reputation of this video is not even comparable to the concert. I have seen her twice in concert and never want to miss a chance to see her again. The other two things are an interview and even a video for one of their biggest songs. a few small notes ... I saw them at ozzfest 2001 and they ruled there, but seeing them in a smaller inner stage was much better (they had some really cool things to do with turning off the lights) In case someone wonders, Votary means a devout follower.
