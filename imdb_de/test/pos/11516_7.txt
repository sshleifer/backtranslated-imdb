"Lights of New York" originally began with an experimental two-reel Vitaphone shorts that eventually became the first All Talkie feature film. Helene Costelle was supposed to be one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood and the sister of Dolores Costello (in my opinion the true beauty), who apparently got all the breaks. Poor Helene is known to have been involved in this pretty bleak movie that has bought a revolution in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Two bootleggers on the Main Street flames convince a few small barbers out of town to try their luck Broadway The barbers Eddie (Cullen Landis) and Gene (Eugene Palette) do not know that her barber shop will soon protect illegal bootlegging activities. They soon realize and regret the day they left their little town. The only thing that keeps them going is the loan Eddie's mother gave them, which they absolutely want to repay. Eddie meets Kitty Lewis (Helene Costello), a girl from his hometown who has done well on Broadway. Kitty worries about "Hawk" Miller (Wheeler Oakman), who always hangs around her, but Eddie thinks she's exaggerating, since "Hawk" already has a girlfriend Molly (Gladys Brockwell), but to reassure her, he admits Give her a little gun to scare away unwanted admirers. "Hawk," who killed a police officer and gets close to the "Feds," opts for Eddie. Meanwhile, Molly is pretty fed up with her "Hawks" treatment and after a showdown in which he tells her he's looking for a chicken and not an old hen, the stage is for - Murder !!! The fact is that it is not terrible, except for gangsters and showgirls who speak in their best voices, and that was also the case in the 1930s movies. Gladys Brockwell (albeit a bit melodramatic) and Eugene Palette (of course) were fine were the most seasoned actors in the cast. There was no John or Ethel Barrymore - Cullen Landis and Helene Costello soon returned to the darkness from which they had come. I also did not notice much of the "hidden microphone" - where people had to be grouped around different items, like a phone or sitting on a couch, before they could talk. The people who saw it in the cinema probably believed that all the policemen in this flat monotone were talking, as this trend continued in many early conversations, such as "Little Caesar" (1930). In any case, they were probably fascinated by the novelty of a full - fledged talk show - with some 1928 singing and dancing films. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
