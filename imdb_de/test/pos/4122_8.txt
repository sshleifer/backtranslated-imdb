The original members of Black Sabbath have lost nothing even after nearly 20 years. In this concert, they play their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including "NIB", "War Pigs" and "Paranoid". <br /> <br /> Also included is priceless backstage material with interviews and retrospectives in their days as the best hard rock band in the world. The comments by Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are as interesting and intriguing as the fabulous stage performances. <br /> <br /> A must for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans.
