The third film of the Polish brothers is the best, most beautiful, imaginative film so far. Although many viewers will have a problem with Northforks' lack of traditional dramatic structures: "Stay tuned, Jack!". The plot is difficult to summarize. All you have to know is that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, god in a cowboy hat, selling angel wings, and a sick orphan (but it all works). M. David Mullen's extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and beautiful to look at. The performances of the actors who work with the inspirational Offbeat script of the Polish Brothers, are loss-making and give the film its emotional impact. The strong-willed audience is moved by the mythology and folk history of the story, the comic and moving actors, and the incredible courage and command that Michael Polish shows behind the camera. Again, all of these incredible and seemingly disconnected elements unite into one of the most incredible things you should experience. A great, great movie !!!
