This show is almost brilliant. It is a modern day, married to children. The scripts are funny because they are sprayed with smart sarcasm. They are also realistic and deal with problems that many parents of young people are facing today. Besides the ongoing stress that you may not be the largest mother in the world, how can you best handle it? At the same time, however, it is possible to stay carefree and funny. What with all the drama and the action on television is a very pleasant and welcome change nowadays. It's something to sit on for 30 minutes to relax, laugh and talk. It's not the weirdest comedy in the world. but you'll make an episode laugh at least a handful of times. Michael Rapaport is brilliant at the top as Dave. He fills the big shoes that the hard sarcastic font needs, and more. He and Anita Barone (Vikki) have fantastic chemistry and stand out very well. This show has a bright future if it is marketed to the right audience and in the right time frame. When Fox releases it on DVD, the following becomes stronger and bigger. (What is a classic example with scrubs.)
