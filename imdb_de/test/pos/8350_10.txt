I think the scamps adventure is a good movie, but I think the first lady and the tramp movie are better because it's the original one and I think the original movies are better in comparison to the folks. Lady and the tramp ii takes off from the original, but this time it's junior's turn. The boy of Lady and Tramp (scamp) always hates the things that have to be done with him, obeys the rules in the house and takes all the baths. The time and the things that are easy and relaxed, scamp gets angry and runs with one Pack of dogs that are lying around freely. Scamp meets another dog named Angel, they get along well and do the things that Scamp's mother and father did by making Italian food (spagetthi and meatballs etc). Afterwards, Scamp realizes that he is especially loved by his family the baby, Scamp comes back and Angel is accepted into the family. I give this movie 10 out of 10 points.
