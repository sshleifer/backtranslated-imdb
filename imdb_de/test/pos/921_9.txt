This is a classic sequel to Bleu, the equally excellent movie starring Juliet Binouche. She is also a cameo here in Rouge, at the very end for a second. But this movie, really red and very cute, although he is very sad, is a real winner. The main hero, played by the always great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full, active life, only eclipsed by her traumatic relationships with her strange friend Mike, who lives in England. Fortunately, she befriends the old judge, who spends time listening to his neighbors' private phone conversations. The story begins to evolve, and we see him in court because he is almost universally condemned for his free time. She is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his cute puppy Rita and her puppies, and for all the people around her. We also see the dissolution of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his wife, and the dispute is also fueled by this phone scandal ... But in the movie, it's not about it either. It is mostly about the loneliness and deep gap between people, near and far. When she sails on a ferry to England, with this lawyer as a chance passenger, as well as the aforementioned Binoche, who starred in Bleu, the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of The Judge as he watches the news, guess what if she survived. She did, and yet we feel very heavy in our hearts. Mr. Kislowski managed to paint a great, subtle story about loneliness, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. Deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely. Brilliant movie.
