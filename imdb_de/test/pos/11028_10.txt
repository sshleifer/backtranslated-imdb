Another "must have" movie. Henry Brandon is a favorite! I was so surprised when I learned years ago that he was from Germany because he sounds and looks so typically American! And was not he great in "The Searchers" as Chief Scar ?? !! Another of my favorites, I have it and watch it again and again. If I could add that to my collection now, it would be my day! This is a great animal story and a movie for all ages. The landscape is so beautiful and the plight of the endangered snow leopard is told with so much emotion that it will arouse interest in endangered species, especially children. If I could, I would hand over a copy to all my grandparents and great-grandchildren!
