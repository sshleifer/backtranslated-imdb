I have to admit that I had low expectations for this movie. But I was surprised that it was entertaining, interesting and funny. It's a fun thriller rather than a horror movie. There were moments when my hair straightened up! Even better, however, were the amusing, occasionally hysterical, comic moments in the movie (you know which one I'm talking about). There are also a few great special effects (and the humor and special effects are not necessarily separate). <br /> <br /> The drama is on the whole very good - much better than a typical low budget horror movie. In particular, the main character (Jackie) and many of the minor supporting roles (like the lawyer, the next-door couple, the pizza guy) are well played. If that had not been the case, the film would not have caught my interest and I would have lost my faith in the story. This is a good, interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth the rent!
