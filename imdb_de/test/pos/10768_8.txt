In the second of his historical martial arts films, Chiba portrays his real life sensei Mas Oyama. The movie even portrays Oyama's incredible achievement of killing an angry bull with his bare hands. Dynamic fight choreography with authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically, this is one of the rare Sonny Chiba movies in which he does NOT rip or tear down enemy body parts. A must for Sonny Chiba fans is definitely one of his top 5 films
