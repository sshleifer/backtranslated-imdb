"Everything is illuminated" is like looking at a fine museum-quality work of art. It absolutely flooded the emotions through a very broad spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer is played with openness by Elijah Wood. He is looking for his paternal inheritance in Ukraine. His travels bring him into contact with Alex, played very well and with extreme humor by Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most emotional connection to this film and is appropriately portrayed by Boris Leskin. If you find little humor in the human figures in this movie theater, all you have to do is address Mikke, a real dog named Alex and his grandfather Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. They also call him the "seeing eye bitch". The cinematography is spectacular. The colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film. It is a movie that is worth the time and the emotional investment.
