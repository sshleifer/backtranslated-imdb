"Admissions" is a nice drama, even if there are problems with the end. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie, who tries to avoid college. So that her overworked mother does not notice, she makes poems that everyone thinks her mentally disabled sister has written. The acting is first class, especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. Both have shown great performances. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. The first is the character of Stewart Worthy played by Christopher Lloyd. His part is underdeveloped. The other weakness is the end. It's going around in circles, which I did not expect with the 84-minute runtime. Apart from that, the movie is definitely worth watching.
