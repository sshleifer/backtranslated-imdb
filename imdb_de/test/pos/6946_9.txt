Even a decade after "Frontline" was aired in the ABC, "topical affairs" programs still use the same tricks. Time and again, "Today Tonight" and "A Current Affair" are hiding behind the facade of journalistic professionalism, yet they feed us tired tales of weight loss and dodgy artisans, shameless network actions and pointless celebrity puff pieces. After I was often exposed to this entertaining gap between "The Simpsons" at 6:00 pm and "Sale of the Century" (or "Temptation") at 7:00 pm, I was only too aware of the little tricks that these were to attract reviews. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, four up-and-coming comedians ?? Rob Sitch, Jane Kennedy, Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner? They were too aware of all these things, and they turned their frustration into one of the most vicious media satires you'll ever see on TV. The four entertainers already had a comedic success. Her most memorable television stay to date has been "The Late Show," the brilliant Saturday night variety show that ran for two seasons from 1992-1993, and comic-comedian Mick Martin of Tony, Jason Stephens, and Judith Lucy. <br /> <br /> "Frontline" features an ensemble of colorful characters, each with their own unique personality. The current show is directed by Mike Moore (Rob Sitch), an ambitious, overbearing, gritty narcissism. Mike works under the illusion that the show plays an important role in society? he is always anxious that they "preserve their journalistic integrity"? and his executive producers have made him believe that. Mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to people; Occasionally he suspects that he is being carried by the nose, but usually this idea is annulled by appeals to his vanity or promise of promotion. Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) is the older female reporter on the show. She's always worried about her looks and public profile, and if you want to believe the rumors, she's had a romantic relationship with just about every male celebrity. Another equally amoral reporter, Marty Di Stasio, is portrayed by Tiriel Mora, who played the foolish lawyer Dennis Denuto in the Australian comedy classic The Castle. Emma Ward (Alison Whyte) is the line producer on the show and the only luminous lighthouse of morality on the set "Frontline". Then there is the extremely funny weather man Geoffrey Salter (Santo Cilauro), Mike's best friend and confidant. Geoff lives from the fact that he always agrees with Mike's opinion, and laughs at his jokes before he admits he does not understand them. <br /> <br /> For each of the three seasons we will be working with another EP executive producer. Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence), who unfortunately passed away in 1995, directs the program in season one. He has a decent morale and is always civil to his employees. Nevertheless, he is more than ready to put them aside in favor of high ratings. Sam Murphy (Kevin J. Wilson) arrives on set set 2 in the second season, a die-hard, handsome producer who knows exactly how to bring Mike along; The final episode of the second season, in which Mike finally defeats him, is a classic moment. Graeme's "Prowsey" Prowse (Steve Bisley), EP for the third season, is rude, uncomfortable and outrageously sexist. It is therefore remarkable that you like him at some point. <br /> <br /> With its distinctive, exaggerated characters, "Frontline" has a great deal of fun with current satirising programs and their dubious ways of getting ratings. Many of the episodes were shot quickly and inexpensively, often with many ideas for action taken from the current situation, but that would not really affect the timeliness of the show after ten years. Celebrity cameos come in abundance with some of the most memorable performances, including Pauline Hanson, Don Burke and Jon English. Watch Harry Shearers hilarious performance in the second season of the episode "Changing the Face of Current Affairs" and play Larry Hadges, an American commissioned by the network to reform the show. <br /> <br /> Especially in the third season I noticed that "Frontline" had an extremely cruel form of black humor that is unusual for such a carefree comedy show. Really funny moments are born because Brooke was secretly bribed to have an abortion, to have committed a murderer by a crazy gunman, and Mike insidiously betrays the hopes and dreams of his best friend, only to find out he is a good friend. The last minute of the series? less an extra scene during the credits, which was probably added in case a fourth season was to be produced? was probably the biggest, blackest end of a comedy series I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Below is a very preliminary list of my top 5 favorite "frontline" episodes listed. Half an hour is absolutely funny and punchy satire. <br /> <br /> 1) "The Siege" (season 1) <br /> <br /> 2) "Give 'em enough rope" (season 2) <br /> <br /> 3) " Addicted to Fame "(Season 3) <br /> <br /> 4)" Basic Instincts "(Season 2) <br /> <br /> 5)" Adding Sex and Turmoil "(Season 1)
