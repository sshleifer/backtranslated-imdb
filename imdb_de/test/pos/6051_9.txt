Since I was Marine, I can tell you that the D.I. is a close-up picture showing Marine Corp's bootcamp and how boys turn into men. Jack Webb is honored as Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough but fair drill teacher in Paris, North Carolina. The film revolves around a recruiter who "apparently does not seem to be dealing with the program". A recent film, Full Metal Jacket, also shows the life in the basic education and is worth seeing.
