There is this whole theory of horror that some people hold true that the monsters and violence should be kept away from the screen. Park Chan-Wook throws this concept completely out of the window and shows straight what he wants - and what he wants to show is pretty much everything he can think about. Leaving it to the actors and the dialogue to create subtlety, Park seems to do almost anything stylistically to convey his point of view. Whether it's ensemble scenes with the camera whirring around a mah-jong table, or whole weeks limited to a single shot between two other scenes, dialogues from the scenes before and after the overflowing park stops Not Focusing on a Specific Structured Style However, the emphasis is more on telling the entire story of a couple's relationship from virgin distance to extreme side-dependence to total self-destruction - using vampirism as a link and priesthood as a drama. It's that simple and complex at the same time. <br /> <br /> You must give him credit. Too many people are willing to compare any modern vampire movie to Twilight, where Twilight is almost always the lesser of the works, but here the stories are actually comparable, but this is more raw and honest. None of this sparkling emergence at night to talk about crap, but everything from the dirtiest, most desperate and virginal sex scene to possible abuses by the wife as the two heads seek power over each other. It's the same business - man and woman meet, girl finds out that man is a vampire, decides to join him anyway, but with no happy time afterwards, just a straight limited time as they are forced to get closer and closer together There are no options left. The girl's motivation is particularly interesting as she desperately craves power and attention, a mistake blighted by the guy who just wants to live a good life under the circumstances, but a hypocrite who can not admit that he uses only his own girl vampirism as an excuse to crack down on his moral education. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect and tends to stretch (there are no three, five or other acts, scene by scene only) of character formation and dysfunctional romance), but the great thing is that Park Chan-Wook is willing to show everything openly and honestly while captivating the horror sensations of tension and anger. He also offers a professionally selected soundtrack to hit the emotional high notes in a fairly effective manner. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
