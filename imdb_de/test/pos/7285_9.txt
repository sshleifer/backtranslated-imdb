I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. Whether you are a bloody or hovering fan; You will love it. I did not like horror movies, she thought they were stupid. But nevertheless I make exceptions. I find something really out of the ordinary in this movie. Seldom have I ever seen a movie that made the fuck out of me, but I'll tell you the truth that shook me this movie. Unlike most horror movies, it deals with the development of the characters. I highly recommend this movie and I am glad that Asylum is finally releasing good horror films nowadays. <br /> Enjoy!
