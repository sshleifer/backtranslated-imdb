I just want to point out (in addition to the plea that the series will be released on DVD) that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining. With all the blood and blood in the news and thrillers, reality shows, etc., it's nice to lose yourself in a good, cheesy show with entertaining characters. PWOG fits the bill. Was it Emmy material? No, but it was fantastic. <br /> <br /> I also have to cast the second cast - they were more charismatic than the first season cast. I would definitely agree that first season had a more serious atmosphere than the second two, but the latter was definitely more excited. Although the series has not been available for years, I never stop hoping that it will be released for purchase.
