This film was a masterpiece of human emotions and experiences. I think a lot of people get entangled in Leland's apparent mental illness as an act, but I was drawn into the relationships of many characters and what they reveal about the power of human emotions. The message of the film is often that we never know good without evil, which is a small clich√©, but what makes the movie so good and original is that it very eloquently depicts the crushing and destructive power that evil has Whether you see evil everywhere like Leland or experience the complete helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that just will not work, no matter how badly you want it. This film shows how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any other movie I've ever seen, and it's just as depressing as it is good.
