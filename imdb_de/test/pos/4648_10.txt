I would hope so and how can I participate? <br /> <br /> This movie is classic and mature with laughter, adventures and an all-star actor from the 80s! What if you meet a group of jocks and sororiety, a group of nerds, a group of outsiders and a couple of coelelors? <br /> <br /> A lot of laughs that will beg you for more! <br /> <br David Naughton plays the lead role as Adam, the leader of the Yellow Team, a friendly and hip college counselor who helps students with everything they need to learn from the classes they want to get their first date on , <br /> <br /> His nemesis is Harold, the leader of the "blue crew", played by Stephen Furst of "Babylon 5", who was not a good loafer of a wealthy, former college jock with enough trophies to go around each hall to make the famer jealous. <br /> <Compete against each other and throw a "red team", a "white team" and a "green team", "an incredible" view "of an observatory, the consequences of a mini golf scam, a supertour at the Pabst B lue Ribbon Beer Factory and a hateful old landlady among other adventures, and you have everything you need to think of a night! <br /> <br /> Look for performances by Michael J. Fox, Eddie Deezen and director Andy Tennant In one of the last movies he starred in before becoming a director, you have a weird all-star cast. <br /> <br /> The only downside of this movie was the performance of Debra Clinger as Laura, she is terribly overpriced, but the rest of the movie is so good that she can just be ignored. <br /> <br /> I own this movie and can never see it enough! <br /> <br />
