The focus is on the lives of four women, all good friends and their male companions. Everyone has a story, including men, everything connects everyone to everyone and everything is brought to a quick change after a girls' journey to Palm Springs. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie is not different from this movie other genre, but I liked the details. Brooke Shields is a divorce that fears loneliness. That's why she beats almost everyone to have a "warm body" next to her in the morning, but she can not really commit herself to it. As a man, I find that these women are a blessing :), but she is not a happy person. Everything else that happens is about this crazy woman, but in the end we get more clarity about life and relationships, which is good. <br /> <br /> I can not say if the spectacle was bad. It did not seem to me. The script was a bit inconsistent, but nothing more than a romantic comedy. It's a bit depressing than most, which is good because you do not get dreary romantic comedy every day ...
