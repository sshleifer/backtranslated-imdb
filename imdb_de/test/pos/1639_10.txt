Okay, that was awesome. I wish the rest of the first season had been so strong. It really needed more episodes like this. <br /> <br /> The cast worked perfectly, even if they were all classy at the time. The writing was fantastic and the editing too. Great work in all accounts. <br /> <br /> The episode was exciting, exciting, and just kept you guessing until the end. Which was what most of the MOTW episodes tried, but failed so far. <br /> <br /> The first FIVE star episode for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I could not remember that it was so good. I think it's even better than the great horror movie "The Thing".
