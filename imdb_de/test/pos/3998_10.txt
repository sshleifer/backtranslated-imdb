This movie might be a bit boring for some people, but I find this movie very interesting in terms of trying to reveal a tradition. Director Lim has made two films about traditional music in Korea before this film. The film before this film showed the music throughout the film, and this film tries to achieve similar things by having backgrounds like a painting in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that the story is written by both the director and a philosopher, Kim, who is a well-known scholar in Korea (many degrees - including the doctor in Havard) - I'm not saying That educated people make better movies, but the philosopher is an expert on traditional culture in Korea so there is more value on this film.
