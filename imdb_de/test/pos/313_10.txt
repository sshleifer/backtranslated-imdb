Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" is not a film from the Vietnam War. Do not confuse it with one. It is behind the war, but is a metaphorical illustration of the worsening effects of the war on the human psyche. It is also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced, or even conceived (in addition to the trilogy's rule of the rings, to call a masterpiece) would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's stages of production. <br /> <br /> Open with no credits and a memorable first scene that is played to the sounds of Doors "The End", while Martin Sheen's captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates on images of helicopters and napalm is the plot Essentially arranged in the first part 15 minutes: Willard's mission is to "end with extreme prejudices". Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has invariably walked the vast expanses of the Cambodian Jungle AWOL and, as his general says, "operates outside" humane reserve, completely beyond all acceptable human behavior, and he is still on the field commanding troops , "Kurtz is an insane colonel now worshiped by a large group of followers who call him operati on seem a little more manageable than the actual fight, but the journey he will undertake will be a personal quest, challenging the limits of his human behavior. <br /> <br /> When they team up with a small crew, they head down the wide rivers in a shaky boat, learning about Kurtz on the way In a ragged voice he tells in detail about the abundance of material he reads Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret, a normal man with a family until part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and led the way himself The descent into the jungle is marked by a fascinating aura that echoes the battles that are not far to be fought out. After all, the power of experience is important to the group as drugs and some sort of solitary confess their feelings. But Willard seems unimpressed and desensitized to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythical figure, it draws him into the power of the man and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decay will match Kurtz's. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: incomparable. His genius: undeniable. For those who are unfamiliar with his acting skills and not used to his physical nuance, Brando can be seen as a hack in the eyes of an uncompromising film viewer. He certainly is not. It was difficult to work with Brando, difficult to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for incomprehensible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing, even if we did not. His Colonel Kurtz is a creature of unlimited delusions and perpetual profundity. If the film is an indication of travel to hell, then Francis Ford Coppola's actual experience of making this masterpiece is a true life story of a man's fanatic struggle for a movie. It is reported that Coppola considered suicide during the film's over 200-day main photography schedule. The movie was not just an indisputable fight. It's a grueling movie you can see. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of steaming locals and his involvement filters through the openings of Martin Sheen's pursued soldier Willard. I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this kind of movie. At the beginning of all that was original and unprecedented, films that were both challenged and stimulated were commonplace. Apart from Audacity, Apocalypse Now is a pure filmmaker. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But I shudder to return to the standards common to today's film standards: lack of innovation. It's not just the unoriginality of today's cinema world; It is the fact that nobody cares to tell a story or to tell one with a heart. But we still have the greats, like Coppola's masterpiece, a film that floated in its ability to give us more depth than what we could understand. This depth in the Apocalypse Now the step is insane. The killing can disturb. The loss of innocence can be solved. But it is the damage from within; the countless image worms that plague, disturb and separate our everyday world, and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts, that ultimately separate us from humanity and drive us into the realm of instinct, savage, and animal. If the thought of killing does not provide food, the act of death provides the basic catharsis of man.
