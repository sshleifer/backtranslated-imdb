"Never Been Kissed" is a real movie to feel good. If you have not seen it yet, then rent it. I will buy it when it is published because I loved it. Drew Barrymore is again excellent, she plays her role well. I felt like I could do something with this film because my school days were just as bad. I found the plot well written, there was comedy and romance, what kind of movies I love. I loved the end, because although you know what's going to happen, you're still sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for you.
