When TV shows are broadcast on the big screen, they often lose their appeal. Not in this case! The historical accuracy of the costumes, the equipment and the general art direction like the TV series is outstanding. A good example of comedy and farce with excellent script and comedy actors in the right parts. Based on a classic television series that stands alone in the history of British television comedy.
