Great horror comedy by Michael Davis. I laughed so hard that I almost peed! Great spectacle of Eric Jungman as a good guy saving the day and great performance of Jack Black-erquire, just like Justin Urich. He was just divine in this movie. This guy deserves to be a big star. Aimee Brooks was also good in the film and the girl in danger together with the boys of a murderer, reminiscent of Jeepers Creepers. The thing was abundant and I loved it. I just hope they release an unrated version. Great low budget horror comedy. The dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just scary funny! ***** out *****
