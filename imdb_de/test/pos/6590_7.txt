So far, Miguel Bardem's career has been one of the most frightening in recent Spanish cinema. He did nothing but rubbish ... until now. "Incautos" was a surprise: It is a serious movie with rhythm, great cast and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> The art of the robbery, that's what "Incautos" is all about. A movie that resembles David Mamet's "House of the Game" and so on. A thousand spins in the script and a story in which nothing looks like it. <br /> <br /> The flaws in Bardem's latest film could be the American language that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural (especially Victoria Abril's.) She's a fucking actress, but in "incautos" Ernesto Alterio is not so bad, but he is not half as good an actor as his father ... And what can you say about Luppi Well, he is the MAN. <br /> <br /> In short, a good movie, the best Miguel Bardem has ever done, I hope this is the beginning of a new stage in his career. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
