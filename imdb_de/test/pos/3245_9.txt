A gloomy Australian movie with all the elements for success. Two Hands stands for the ability of Australian filmmakers and actors to produce high quality and popular material. The film has a fresh perspective and contains in a unique way drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this movie entertaining on many levels - but I also appreciate that maybe it's not for everyone. ' The film has a pronounced Australian sense of humor as it depicts the filthy underworld of Sydney and explores the lives of a young man (Ledger) and a young woman (Byrne) who were swept away by the local crime scene. <br /> <br /> Two Hands deals with the subject of good and evil, both interpersonal and personal, and looks at the consequences for "our" actions. <br /> <br /> The camera work is chic and the dialogue is humorous. With Bryan Brown, who plays Pando and Heath Ledger as Jimmy and struggles in the most bizarre situations on the screen, this Aussie movie is certainly no shortage of acting talent. <br /> <br /> This subtle action / comedy has become something of a cult favorite and one of mine too.
