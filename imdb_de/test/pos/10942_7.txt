A funny mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit mixed up and the actions of those who have baptized the voices are bad almost everywhere, but the premise is appealing, the fighting scenes are fast and flashy and the movie is often amusing. It's a shame that history is such a wreck. There are some places where I had no idea what just happened. It was almost as if five minutes had been interrupted, and you were suddenly in the next scene, not knowing how you got there. The movie is bad at explaining things, and some things are not very useful, but the film moves along so smoothly that its flaws are barely noticeable. Not a great movie, but definitely a fun one.
