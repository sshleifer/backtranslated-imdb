(This has been edited for space reasons.) <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire, the film contains elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analogue of the viral invasion of a body), romance and some other things. It's a movie that has almost too much in mind. The film takes its own affairs and mixes them with classical European literature, in this case Emile Zola's "Thérèse Raquin". It's a strange mix that does not always gel, but still has incredible power. It's been almost 24 hours since I saw the movie at Lincoln Center (with a follow-up discussion by the director) and I find my cage increasingly rattling. It is not so much what happens is disturbing, it is more that its far-reaching story and its themes in retrospect ring many bells. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film has a willing-will priest who chooses the best way To help humanity, you must volunteer for a medical experiment to cure a terrible disease. Infected with the disease, he eventually succumbs and dies, but due to a transfusion of vampire blood (which is not explained) he actually survives. The miracle-priests priest returns to the hospital where he served the sick. Unfortunately, not everything is good. The priest finds that he needs blood to survive. He also finds that he has all the typical problems of a vampire, and he is unable to go out during the day. It gets even more complicated when he finds a friend from his childhood and his family again. The priest, who aroused some of his animal passions, is taken by his friend's wife. From there everything goes sideways. <br /> <br /> An ever-changing movie, a story that revolves around different genres, as it tells the very human story of a man who realizes that his life has been radically changed by a coincidental event and states that he is no longer the one he thought he was. It's a movie where you have to stay until the end, because the movie is forever something else. It's also a movie that has a lot in mind and the themes it plays with are constantly explored in different ways. <br /> <br /> The movie has enough to offer, and people will probably do it. Writing books that discuss the film. <br /> <br /> The two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance. The vampire part of the story is brilliant. It's something about the way it fixes the ground rules and the kind of "suffering" that makes perfect sense, somehow putting the old vampire ideas aside. When I was in the theater last night, I was surprised how impressed it was at how well it worked. I think the fact that it's more or less straightforward is what shakes the earth. Here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life. Contrary to what happens later, it becomes clear that it will not work to hunt down people. It's not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, it's something else. Personally, I think the movie transforms the playing field from a cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible. (The order in which the forces begin, is just cool) The romance is also handled wonderfully. Sure, the sex scenes are hot and well done, but it's the other stuff, the looks, the entertainment, the out-of-gender gestures that make it so special. I love the looks, the quiet glances as the forbidden couple seek each other hungry and unable to act, the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal, both real and supposed, and the crazy passion of a possible consummation. This is one of the greatest screen romances of all time. It perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of a deep passionate love (and lust). If you've ever loved deeply, you'll probably find some of your hearing on screen, I know I did it. The statement "I just wanted to spend eternity with you" has a sad meaning. It is both a statement about the intention and the depth of the emotions. The tragic romance will break your heart. <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you and say that the movie is perfect and great. It's not as good as the pieces and almost all of them are great (especially the actors, whom I wrongly did not praise as amazing). The whole thing does not always come together. The different genres, thematic elements and sounds occasionally rattle against each other. Often I wondered where the movie would go. I got stuck there, even though the movie seemed to be wandering around aimlessly. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie. I loved the pieces more than the movie as a whole. It's been ringing in my head since I saw it, and I think it will take a few more days. Like or love is irrelevant, as this is a movie that should really be seen as it is so busy that it provides enough material for reflection and talking for days after. One of the meatiest and most abundant films of the year.
