I do not think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is crazy. Every time I see it, I find something new and make it even funnier than before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected end to break. Every character is great of Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way and never get tired. Watch it !! <br /> <br /> If you liked Cary Elwes in this movie, you need to see the princess bride.
