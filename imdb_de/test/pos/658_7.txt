** SPOILERS ** Beautifully photographed Slice of Life home front WWII love story with Norman Rockwell imagery at the beginning and end of the film about how a "war hero" is not just someone killing for his country, but also someone who thinks for itself, and not by the war propaganda that is constantly being drummed in its head, corrupts. Marine Corps-born Marion "Hedg" Hedgepeth, Jan Michael-Vincent, is thrown out of the boot camp after five weeks and forced to put on a Baby Blue Marine uniform that shows he simply did not have the corps humiliated and despised wherever he went, when he went home to St. Louis and was afraid of what his family, which was his father in the Marine Corps in World War I, would think of him as if he could not as US Navy " cut the mustard ". <br /> <br /> Hedg stops in a bar and finds a marine member of the fearless and deadly marine raider Richard Gere sitting next to him, buying a beer from an admiring hedge. Getting in touch with Richard Hedge is shocked to find that not only has he been sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles he has fought and the fight with medals he's got, but that he is the completely gray hair and the middle of the thirty-looking Richard sees 21 next month! That's what did him in the Marine Corps and World War II! Hedge buy some drinks Richard takes the drunk Baby Blue outside and beats him out, takes his baby blues and leaves his impressive US Navy uniform with some money left over for hedge. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hedge Richards puts on a uniform that suits him perfectly, he faces this big, drunken US paratrooper who calls himself Cement Head, who wants to fist fight with the Marine Raider. Hedge does everything he can to avoid trouble, and Cement Head forces him to put it on after he himself has cracked two beer bottles over his cement head to fight for the big fight between navy, hedge and paratrooper, cement Head. Unbelievably hedge the ground with the mighty buffoon that hits him cold in one fell swoop! "I guess the trick does not hit him on the head," says a stunned hedge, his Cement Heads colleague G.I. <br /> <br /> Hitchhiking to this little town by Bidwell Hedge This US military detention center for Japanese Americans who are there because they pose a threat to US security. Later in the film, Hedge shows everyone what a true hero he is, not the one people in the city take for him, risking his life to rescue one of the hated "Japs" who, thoughtlessly, together with two his friends fled the interment camp, where the hell did they think they would go anyway? Hedge risked his life by saving the frightened Japanese from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the city. Hedge in his actions taught the population of Bidwell that not all "Japs", even those who are American citizens, are evil and treacherous Banzai who scream suicidal Kamazazes as if they were thought by the magazine's newspapers and magazines that they there were. <br /> <br /> Hedge leads a conversation with the very cute and pretty waitress in the local diner Rose Hudkins, Glynnis O'Connor, who's just crazy about him, that even Hedge first thinks it's not his uniform she impressed. Later, when Hedge acknowledges to Rose that he and her parents do not think A US Marine Raider is Rose, he had come to know the sweet and caring laundry so well that she did not care. All he should be, a Marine , a paratrooper or a postal worker, that's what really counted in his heart. The film has a series of touching and beautiful scenes in between. Hedge and Rose shows how films were made in the past, without all the sex and obscenities we see and hear in films today involving two people in love.

"Baby Blur Marine" does it best not to be too politically correct if you do not show the heroes or the leading actors and actresses in the film the same feelings and perceptions that then most people have today, which has been proven to be spurious would be as a three-dollar bill to those people who saw the movie that was living at these historic and significant times when the movie was about to take place.
