"Challenge to be free" was one of the first films I saw as a kid. It was also one of the first VHS tapes I owned. I had not seen the movie in years, so yesterday I decided to bring it in and watch it. Impressive. The story is now as powerful as the first time. I think now that I'm older, I can better gauge the values ​​that are being implanted in the movie. (Confidence, the value of freedom and the love of nature) Although it is a "B" movie, you will remember this movie for years, especially if you see it as a child.
