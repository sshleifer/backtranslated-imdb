Ray is one of those movies where you take a break. You are actually thinking about what you have read or read about this man and it does not even come close. When I saw Ray for the first time, I forgot that I saw a movie that seemed to me to be seeing this man's life through a window. So convincing is this movie that it captivates you and includes all of your emotions through an emotional rollercoaster ride, and when it's over, you do not want to make it back so soon because it's as emotional as other films are missing. Jamie Foxx deserves his Oscar, and his performance is truly spectacular, and he should be the standard for anyone who wants to take a biophoto soon. This movie is as good as it deserves the theme of classic and legend.
