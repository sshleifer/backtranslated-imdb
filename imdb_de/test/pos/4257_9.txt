I can not say how many times this one line made me laugh or how many times I've described this scene to people who do not know this movie. I saw it in the year it was published. I was 19 years old. I do not think there were a dozen people in this East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. It's nice to see that others found it as hysterical as me and that, despite the time that has passed, it's of lasting value. Rent, buy or steal ... a must.
