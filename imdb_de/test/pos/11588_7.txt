THE SEA INSIDE A film by Alejandro Amenabar. <br /> <br /> Almodovar has been the flag of Spanish cinema for years. Out of nowhere, Amenabar came to reinvent the genres and inject new blood into the otherwise malfunctioning Spanish industry. Now he is switching from psychological terror to social drama in a big game. Well, the big ones, is the audience ready to embrace the momentum, and more importantly, can it hold the flag? This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor who was paralyzed from the neck down in his twenties in a marine casualty and his struggle with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has the tracks of an afternoon for the TV melodrama. The only way to achieve this is through words and honest performances, and both come in spades. Mateo Gil and Amenabar write in a manner that does not blindly lead the audience to a death, but encourages them to decide for themselves, and that is a brilliant stroke, this is not a film pro death, but a film in favor the last illusions of our time LIBERTY. There are a few laughs that go a long way, such as when the church comes home in a wheelchair to deconstruct the faith of Sampedro, but it is usually a valley of tears, and blows come from all fronts, though They think you are safe with their father. Up to this point, it has not made any sense to start with the most moving line in the entire movie. It's a heartbreaking experience, especially when Sampedro seems to be full of life than most people who roam the streets, and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life, even those that help him die ? but if you deprive a man of his dreams? The film is built almost exclusively on close-ups and conveys a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with Sampedro. This is a big challenge for the actors, who have to build their entire performance with their eyes and their eyes do not lie. Bardem was not given his second Oscar nomination, probably for Eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could outsmart Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, where acting looked effortless, and I think Bardem has reached the status where the line of acting and reality is blurry. I never liked his early work, but since Almodovar's LIVE FLESH he's on the rise. LOS LUNES AL SOL, THE DANCERS AND THE Oscar nominated BEFORE the NIGHT CASES made him an international star and although he and Banderas are from the same Almodovar The background is fascinating to see how different paths they have taken and how Bardem has become a real reference has become for the Spanish cinema in the whole world. A golden ball, 14 Goyas, jury award in Venice and probably an Oscar with the permission of THE CHORUS BOYS. Amenabar conducts, co-writes, edits and brings music to a high-caliber drama. What about some science fiction now? Whose life is that?
