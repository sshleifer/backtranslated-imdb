What has to change in today's attitude towards films like Boogie Nights is the approach. The approach is terrible! When you compare it to Pulp Fiction, you only see pornography and all its aspects. When people come, there's more to it than that in this beautiful movie. And for all skeptics, Paul Thomas Anderson has always proven to be worthy? Magnolia is one of the main reasons why I watch American films and still believe in this "industry" where filming takes place today. And what about There Will Be Blood? This is a movie that will stay in movie history, whether you like it or not! Yes you! The so-called consumer .. you know something: F # * k you! you do not deserve that, you do not deserve anything. So many artists today have difficulty gaining recognition and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious films, even mainstream, because people only want to see celebrities doing stupid things. That was very painful for me to say because I did do not want to see. I do not want to believe that everything that counts today counts adding numbers. Sales and sales. I want to see magic, the magic that Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa have created and created through the language of cinema. Because that's what PTA does. He creates magic !!
