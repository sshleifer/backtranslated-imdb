Hmmmm. I'm kind of at a loss here. I mean, I know that I liked Death Bed. I know, I will spread the Gospel of the Death Bed to all my friends and acquaintances. As you read this, I urge you to see Death Bed, but I can not say why. Maybe that's the secret of his charm. <br /> <br /> act? Well, that's about it. There is this bed that eats people (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, suitcases, and other things that come near by) by sucking them into his mattress filled with digestive fluid. Bed is almost unlimited, and Bed has the ability to keep the spirit of Aubrey Beardsley behind a picture to watch and tell the story of the movie. Various people then land at Bed's abandoned mansion (Bed's habit of eating something that moves, giving the place an unappetizing reputation) and lie down to have sex or take a nap or because they do not feel well and eaten become. sometimes first trippy dreams. And in the end we have the explosive final confrontation between Beardsley, Beds mother (you had to be there) and bed. <br /> <br /> Seems pretty straightforward, if I say so, right, well, except for the Aubrey Beardsley part. But something is constantly outlandish, and the story seems to be slipping sleepily from one scene to another, even when she indulges in cheap laughter or strange gore effects. Imagine that Bunel had crossed with Bergman and was then immersed in a large tub of Herschell Gordon Lewis. The tone of the story changes from horror to fairy tale, to comedy and existential meditation, without breaking the pace - an incredible feat for a no-budget student film filmed in the Detroit area. <br /> <br /> All in all, a stunning little movie that will probably never fully meet any review. See for yourself.
