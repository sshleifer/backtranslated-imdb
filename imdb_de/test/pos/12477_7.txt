Should we take the opening shot as a strange picture? I think we have to. Anyway, two women stand behind a final umbrella, they go up to the talent agency and we go with them ... and then they will never be seen again. Okay, how come, that INSIDE the place, at the piano or even outside with the SOUND of the piano, then inside and out, a la Hitchcock ??? I think Clouzot already tells us, in a rather subliminal way, that we're following a part of postwar society, especially how he uses a Citizen Kane song cut into about five pieces to show the lady how she travels from talent agency to her first roses and applause from her vaudeville debut. After that, we are relentless observers of more or less disgusting details of a defeated country coming down from war-torn, torn knees. And with little disgust no one was better off than Clouzot. Too bad he had never tried Sartre's nausea. Almost everything we see after the first few minutes, makes us a bit queasy. .... okay, okay, I'm exaggerating this completely, let's just settle for the general feeling of much of the movie. Take a close look, and you'll even see one of the police pull his nose. And in how many movies has anyone ever done that? Then there is a very loud nasal bubble in front of the lesbian photographer by the Chief Policeman, noticing that she is not literally blinking an eye or raising an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> The sense of all this It seems like an almost feverish immersion in the adjacency until you can smell, see and feel virtually any scene. <br /> <br /> As for the other aspects of the movie, others here have talked about them much more than I did. But do not forget the mystery here: This is the ultimate McGuffin. Clouzot is about as interested in the real killer as the two women who came in from the rain in the first seconds of the movie and will never be seen again. All he wanted was to follow from start to finish, a group of people who were not even particularly interesting, and say, here you see the twitching of this woman, the hacking of the man on his pants in all their insignificance Years and years Tina Turner sang, we do not need another hero. <br /> <br /> Even the enforced lightness of the end is bleak in a rundown part of Paris and in a cool, bare, bricked apartment. If only the couples love each other to see through them, then you have to say that there are two or three million like you all over the city, who work their fingers off every day for a little love at night. <br /> <br From here it was only a small step to Wages of Fear and the ultimate despair. <br /> <br /> They do not even know how to shoot films like this in the US. At that time in France, they did not even know how to do it, certainly not at all. The relentless detail of the gesture makes even Italian neo-realists look like bad psychologists. Which makes Clouzot probably a kind Rosselini. <br /> <br /> Very nice nonsense, this movie. The only mistake seems to me, and as some other viewer noticed, the main woman is somehow not quite right. Everyone else in the movie is as good as perfect.
