Had not heard much about this movie except that it was a national award and an Oscar post. It's a Marathi movie, and I can not spot an orange apple in Marathi. But when I saw the movie on late Sunday night on DD1, I just taped it. Now I can not judge film techniques and acting skills. But I've watched a lot of different genres of films, and for an average audience, I highly recommend this movie. The feeling is very earthy and realistic, although there are some melodramatic moments. Watch it to feel human. Lately, I have not seen a movie that touches the heart, especially in Hindi cinema. The culmination of the film is the return of the child home. The camera moves to the child who wears black glasses, has lost his eyes, the child hears the other children splashing in the water and clapping. I was awesome. And the two hours I spent with the movie - it was worth it :-)
