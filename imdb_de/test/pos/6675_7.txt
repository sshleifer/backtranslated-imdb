Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a psychiatric patient who claims to be at home on a distant planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist, dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) tries to help him while trying to understand Prot and finding out if he's really from K-PAX. <br /> <br /> This movie does not really fall into a particular genre. Much of K-PAX is drama / science-fiction, another fantasy part and a dash of comedy, and you begin to understand what K-PAX is all about. The story (as you see above) is not too complicated or deep, but it still offers some good twists and turns of action that can still surprise you the way you did. No special effects or graphics accompany this movie and it is not necessary to have it. The music in the movie is great though. A techno soundtrack together with a great piano tune makes K-PAX a sci-fi and makes certain scenes fascinating. Kevin Spacey is at the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien (prot) from Planet K-PAX, emotionally with great facial expressions, doing Spacey a good job in the lead role. Jeff Bridges is Dr. Powell. He helps and tries to understand Prot. Bridges is also honored in its part. Bridges and Spacey go together very well, and they should both have a lot of experience. The wife of Dr. Powell is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays her role well and shows the frustration she has caused by her husband's gone, devoting himself to his patient. Alfe Woodard plays dr. Powell's colleague Claudia Villars, we do not really like Claudia too much, but overall she does a good job. <br /> <br /> K-PAX is rated "PG-13" for a sequence of violent images, short language and sensuality "and that covers it. As for" violent images ", we do not see much few people who have quite a lot of blood, but that's all.The language is as follows: 1 "f" word (wow, just one!), 11 "s" words and some uses of the Lord's name in vain The "sensuality part" is just from the moment Dr. Protell explains how the reproduction on K-PAX works, nothing bad, just something like "your nuts in a vise." Not bad for The content of a PG-13 movie, it could have been a lot worse. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, K-PAX is not a bad movie, it will not daze you, but it's fun to watch some funny parts, sad parts, really sad parts, and you know what I mean, it's a story of a psychiatric pa served, what do you expect? All in all a good rental for those who are looking for a good drama to sit back and relax. K-PAX is a successful movie. <br /> <br /> Bonus! If you have already seen this movie and are considering buying the DVD, I would highly recommend it. It has a lot of extras to look through, and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes. 8.10
