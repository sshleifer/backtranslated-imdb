The Hindi version of the movie lasts 121 minutes. Based on Tagore's novel, Bengal's early twentieth-century film draws an analogy between India's British colonization and the subjugation of women. Binodini, an educated and beautiful woman, widows within a year of her marriage, but does not accept the constraints imposed on her by her society as a widow. The film has a beautiful look, but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is not exactly portraying Binodini's strong character with his subtle combination of idealism and cunning. Binodini's idealism does not come up, and so the analogy between women and colonization remains spilled.
