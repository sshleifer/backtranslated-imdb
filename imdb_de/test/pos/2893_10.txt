Rush in Rio is without doubt one of the most exciting DVDs I have bought. Although I have been an avid rush fan for almost 20 years, I found this performance to be impeccable. The music is heavy and sharp (which sounds great on every surround sound system), the band is energetic, the audience has a constant smile. For every Rush fan, this DVD is a must; If anything, just to see the "Boys in Brazil" documentation (which reveals the travels of this rather isolated, personal band). For every fan who is not a rush, this DVD is an entertaining concert. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians. We have been stuck with them for years. I have shown this DVD (or at least parts of it) to those who have never heard of Rush, or to those who consider Rush to be less good because they are the pessimistic masses of rock (ie, sex, drugs, and a drunken frenzy). The bottom line is that this DVD is worth every penny and worth more than the time to watch it.
