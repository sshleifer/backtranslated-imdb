I saw this movie for the first time at a queer film festival. Ten minutes after the movie ended, a gay couple approached me and asked if I needed help - I was still sitting and crying like a madman. The film is kitschy, it's bizarre, it's overkill, it's gay - but it's amazing. I think every character is plausible. Everett's character is meant for a woman who just tries to help, he brutally throws out his (terrible) friends, he has a temper, he can harm a fly, the "fly" that has killed the love of his life. Bates is a miracle, she's perfect, just like a character. A woman whose love and admiration are so strong that she even loves the homosexual lover of her idol is for me the essence of true love. I even understand Max (the husband), he's bored with his life, he has a mid-life crisis. He's moving out, trying to live an exciting life just to a) realize that he's the really boring part of the relationship and b) that he loves his wife. I think it's great that she comes back to him in the end because I think the movie finds the right balance between dream and reality. In the end he is her husband and he may not be as exciting as Victor, but he really is, he is the man she loves down to earth. I have seen it about 50 times and I love this movie, all unconditionally. By the way, I've just read the autobiography of Rupert Everett, and UL is the only movie he talks about as one of the best movies he's ever made. For me, it's the best movie he's ever done.
