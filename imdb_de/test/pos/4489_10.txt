This is one of the classic TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, in which the viewer is drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict in the simplest situations, only to find the solution surprisingly and strangely acceptable. In a container / prison are five figures: a major, a ballerina, a bagpiper, a clown and a tramp. They are certainly an odd selection of types that are in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (anyway) trying to figure out why they are there. What do they have in common? Nobody can find out. Gradually, however, the major organizes her to sit on her shoulder. And the major who goes to the top of the series reaches the entrance, and ... I'll leave it that way, though one of the other reviews in this thread actually tells the story. <br /> <br /> The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS in search of an author, Pirandlo's famous play. Whether the actual purpose of the show was to fake this game is debatable: Pirandello's characters analyze their roles and relationships. But the five characters here, while trying to understand their situation, are completely in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six characters in Pirandello who know their current situation. This uncertainty about what is going on makes viewers believe that it is an abstract drama. The actors William Windon as Major and especially Murray Mattheson as Clown give good reports about themselves. And the conclusion, whether planned as a parody or not, is quite effective.
