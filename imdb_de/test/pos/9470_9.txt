She is the man was everything I wanted and maybe even a little bit more. I love teenies "Chick Flick" movies and I knew this would be great !! As well as 10 things I hate about you (one of my favorite hits): She's The Man is a unique, well-written, well-played comedy with some of the funniest lines and a physical comedy I've seen in a long time. It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year (with the exception of the funny Pink Panther). But She's The Man is actually an intellectual joke, and humor mostly depends on the funny story of Three's Company, false identities, mixed messages, and the performers. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is a star !! Even since the days of the terrible camping (but strangely entertaining "The Amanda Show") she has shown a brilliant talent for the comedy. She's probably one of the most talented comedies out there. Her style of physical comedy, imitations and witty dialect was hilarious. Previously, her big screen debut (where she was the star) was the pretty funny and well done "What A Girl Wants". If this was not her breaking vehicle, She's The Man takes care of those hands. Bynes is really the ultimate girl next door. It's a shame she does not work on the big screen anymore because she might be the next "it" girl. She is the All American, sweet, down to earth, bubbly teenager (though she is now twenty) and whether or not she can pass her talent and style on to an adult actress remains to be seen. For the purpose of this film, however, it is perfect! she imitates her twin brother and makes it believable. Not quite ... but believable enough. Most of the script is based on the comedy of their mistakes trying to be a man, but it's just weird and laughs without end. Channing Tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in 2005 "Havoc" by Duke. He is the jock, the captain of the football team and finally Bynes' object of affection. Unfortunately, he is also Sebastian's roommate (who is Bynes.) He is a good leader and the chemistry is perfect. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who happens to be attracted to Sebastian (who is Bynes). She's also good, though her role is low and she does not really influence the rest of the cast in one way or another. James Kirk is great in his small role as a true Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is amazing ... They are absolutely believable as twins and from afar you could understand that someone believes that Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast fit in and their roles range from short to supportive, but essentially they all support the story between Bynes and Tatum, but all more or less support Bynes' great performance. She wears the movie without hesitation and makes it worthwhile. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that shows so much in the trailer, and yet he is not one of those movies, if this part is not funny anymore. The parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even funnier in the movie. Andy Fickman, director of newcomers, does so incredible work in this film. He interweaves a possibly complicated plot, lets it flow naturally and collapses everything. The story, loosely based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, is remarkable for how much they've translated into this modern movie. It seems to be completely out of the wall, but more accurate than the classic comedy than you think. There is not much to say about a drawback, unless the last half hour draws a bit and may be predictable, but does not change the hilarity of the first half of the movie. Nevertheless, you will laugh to tears and it is one of the funniest movies in the theater, which is now down !!! 9.10
