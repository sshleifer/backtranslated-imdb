For all American Deneuve fans, this little gem is a bit hard to come by. Luckily I found myself wrapped up in the short pieces that I saw on youtube.com in the preview that I was ready to do anything. I found it on ebay.com, ordered it directly from France and changed my laptop to play Region 2 DVDs. Let me tell you that it was worth it. Be forewarned - there are NO subtitles (unfortunately, Pathe should not have released this on DVD, Cook Lorber should have - they are good with the subtitles). I do not speak a word of French. I can pronounce a syllable here and there, order a drink and so on. Nevertheless, this movie was a treat anyway. I could not properly assess the supposed "bawdy" humor or the witty dialogue. Watching Deneuve and her cohorts was enough for me. I understood what was going on without dialogue. It really says something about a movie when those who do not speak the language enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is wonderful. London is charming as a lost son-in-law. Loved the lesbian mother. And what can I say about our dear Mademoiselle Deneuve? She is unique. Those eyes, that smile. I could watch her films all day. She really goes beyond beauty. People always say that she is beautiful. Well, that's it. She is also very talented. I believed her every second. Your conversation about chocolate and vanilla with London is too sweet. Her figure is even arrested for smoking with a 15-year-old on the street. NOT TO FORGET! Fly to France and buy this if you have to. Great. 10
