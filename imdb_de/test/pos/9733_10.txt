First and foremost, I hate sci-fi stuff, and although this movie got a bit of sci-fi sometimes, that's fine because he's at least concentrating on Andre Toulon. Andre had somehow been mentioned in the last three years, but the stories never really focused on him, which drove me crazy. What makes me angry is the number of 0's on the voting table. Give him a break, people. If you have seen and liked this movie, please vote for it. You're welcome. What I loved so much about this movie is that it returns to where it all started. When Andre got to know the secret of life. I would recommend renting if you have ever seen a Puppet Master Movie before and liked it. But do not rent it the first time you view one from the PM collection. Mainly because you think that all puppet masters are as boring as this one.
