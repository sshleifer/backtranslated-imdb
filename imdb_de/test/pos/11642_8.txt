I have just seen this broadcast on Channel 4. After seeing some of the earlier comments here, I would like to say first that I am not in favor of the death penalty. I did not think much of that, I expected great things from this movie, but it just did not quite work out. Dead Man Walking is very clean, with good performances and a good script. In fact, it is hard to fault it artistically. However, I felt that while trying to deal with issues of capital punishment, it was distracted from the religious / moral attitude (not surprisingly, since the main character is a nun). Although I'm not a heartless person, I could not empathize with any of the characters in the story. If you do not take religion seriously, you probably will not see much in this movie. I think Peter Medak's Let Him Have It was a much more powerful and moving movie, and I would recommend to anyone considering considering to see this.
