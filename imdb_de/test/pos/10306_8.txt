I agree with Andy, that's a good movie. Kevin McKidd's character is credible throughout the movie. We are forced to hate him and ultimately sympathize with him. Paula Sage, who plays Roberta, also performs well. It is thoughtful and emotional, without overproduction. Thanks to the director Alison Peebles and the author Andrea Gibb. A very rewarding visit. The tempo of the movie is just right, just arousing enough interest in the subject to irritate you instead of bombarding you with facts in a documentary style. Nice little soundtrack for the movie, again used sparingly, so as not to distract you from the plot. Recommended.
