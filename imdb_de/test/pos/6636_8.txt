The war meditation of Ingmar Bergman refers to a couple living on a small island off the coast of an idyll (of which country not specified). Raging in the distance is a war they only know from the news. In the course of their day, the war comes to them and it soon becomes a struggle for survival, since both sides obviously do not seem to care about them. A bleak look at the human cost of a war and those who were not readily involved in the battle but were still caught in the crossfire. It is a movie that was ahead of its time about 40 years ago, when it became the concept of armies at war, where most of the victims have become the civilian population. This is a dark, disturbing film narrated from the point of view of the average person, with the feeling of hopelessness and confusion best expressed in the thought that ran through my mind, "What am I doing now?". As an intellectual exercise, the movie is top notch. This is a movie that makes you think. As an emotional film, it touches, but never moves completely. I was never emotionally moved, even as the horror of the situation caused my brain to flip-flop. (I should say that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas he brings to the table, although his films have never moved me.) I'm not a "fan." I've always dealt with Fellini in the old film class Who was better, since he had more emotions in his films, apart from the reservations, this is a sightseeing required, especially as we live in a world where for most of us war is just a matter on a television screen.
