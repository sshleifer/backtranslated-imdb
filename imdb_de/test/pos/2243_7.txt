Doctor Who, Rose, her alternate father, Mickey, his alternate colleague Ricky and Mickey's little rebel gang are where they left off, this cybermen reality version, this second installment of the 2-episode Cybermen arc, feels more at home like a Doctor Who episode, unlike the previous part, which honestly felt like a sequel to the late show Sliders, which was a great show in itself. The bow as a whole was gratifying enough because I am one who subscribes to the maxim ANY Who Who Good Who, but at the same time it is inevitable that this will be compared to the Dalek episode of the previous series. And these comparisons made this seem like a less work. I just feel like this story could have been made in an episode. Remember, in the first part of the meeting, I said that these kinds of stories dealing with alternative realities usually have no lasting impact. Well, that's not the case here, but what changes overall feels addressed and not really in line with the character /> <br /> My Note: C +
