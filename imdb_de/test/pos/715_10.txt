I looked at a local station the other day because I did not feel like seeing trips like 'American Idol'. Peter Strauss does a great job as a convicted man named "Rain" Murphy, who stays to himself. He admits his crime and does not bones that he feels no shame for it. His cell is free of all the comforts that other inmates like books and pictures have. He only feels like running in another zone. He does it often and can walk a mile in less than four minutes. When a college coach learns about it, he wants to prepare him for a shot at the Olympics. "Rain" does not want it at first, but when his best friend is killed, he shows interest. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, period. Strauss is very good (what did you expect, a little less?) And Michael Mann shows signs of greatness that would blossom years later. This movie had this bit of realism (probably because it was shot between convicts). It almost feels like this is a true story. The extra casting is good. There are many famous names like Brian Dennehy, Roger E. Mosley and Richard Moll. <br /> <br /> My heart sank when a pompous board of directors did not let him go because he did not feel bad for his crime. His last act made me get up and cheer. When they took his dreams, he took them back hard. That was when TV movies were good. "The Jericho Mile" is a jewel of a movie. ESPN Classic, please show this movie !!!
