"The next Karate Kid" is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises. It has a wonderful plot and morality that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job to achieve the role of Julie. I've seen the actor playing Mr. Miagee, and I think that's one of his best performances. The movie is funny and charming and I can not stress enough how interesting the movie is. I definitely rated this movie 10 out of 10. I recommend the movie to anyone who likes a good movie.
