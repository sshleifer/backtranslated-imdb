This movie is a fascinating drama about the making of a movie. The actor and the actress really can not stand each other, but we are building ourselves up to a scene in which they should have sex - for the first time by script. The actress shows little emotion on or off the camera in the action, except that she freezes on a beach in the early scenes. The actor is self-absorbed and increasingly resists Jeanne's direction. I could not help thinking in the drama "How will these two possibly make their way through a sex scene?" This drama itself is more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay of the cameras. Not that Roxane Mesquida is not beautiful and naked worth seeing! There is, however, a pretty young stage hand that goes through some scenes as an extra. I think that's her left in one of the pictures (2 of 9) here in IMDb. I do not even know if this girl is credited, but when she passes (dressed, of course) in self-assured indifference with her short blond hair - SHE is sexy! WHO IS THIS GIRL ???
