Jack Black and Kyle Gass are working together to promote their band Tenacious D in this rock classic called Tenacious D In The Pick Of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invent their own rock opera. It was like a rock'n'roll opera. Some of the most twisted events took place in this movie ... the big foot part ... the mushroom part ... and in the end, when they wiggled against the devil. A classic from Tenacious D ... one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The last few things I saw in the theater were stupid ... but this movie rocks. That really made me laugh. The whole base is Jack Black, who is looking for his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and a man who has always been bald. They work together to find this magical selection that can make the most terrible musician play. They finally make it to the Rock 'N' Roll Museum and steal the selection. On the way they meet The Stranger Played By Tim Robbins. They manage to win their prize money in the club when the owner makes the choice and was the devil all the time and he fights the D in a rock-off. The D does not win, but the devil's horn falls off and sends him back to hell. That's why LONG LIVE THE D !!!!!!!!!!
