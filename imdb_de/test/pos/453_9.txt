As a great Dostoevsky fanatic, I was always disappointed with Hollywood's half-hearted attempts to enter into Russian romantic aesthetics, Yul Brynner, as Dmitri Karamazov. I thought the whole problem was a bad casting decision, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind. When he got a clever script he could work with, he suddenly came to life and was as noble, sexy, and conflicted as you would have ever wanted a neurotic Russian officer to be! So he was a better Dmitri than Major Surov than he was Dmitri. The reason for this is that the writer Tabori Yul, as a Conflicted Russian Officer, has actually given the kind of Conflicted Russian Officer line that is worthy of true literature and has a true meaning and a real pathos. For example, a suggestion of folk music, he says thoughtfully, "You hear a man crying in the dark, and if you listen carefully, you know what he's crying for, you look surprised, Lady Ashmore, in spite of everything you might Tractors and Marxism are not the only things that the Russian cares about, it's always time for music. "<br /> <br /> Brilliant !!
