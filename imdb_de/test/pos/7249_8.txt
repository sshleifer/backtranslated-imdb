Therefore, it may not be accurate historically. And there is little or no real character development. But for Jake (son of Ridley) Scott's first try, it's worth the ticket price. <br /> <br /> Captain James MaCleane (Jonny Lee Miller, who looks as good as ever), may be a gentleman, but he has not gotten the money or clothes to prove it. Plunkett (Robert Carlyle with all his clothes) is a pharmacist who has banished himself to the public. The circumstances of their strange encounter include a corpse, a ruby ​​and finally a partnership like the Gentlemen Highwaymen. As the Tagline says, "they rob the rich ... and that's it." There is not really much background or profound development, but the goal seems to be to free the aristocracy from enough money and jewels to pay for the passage of the two highwaymen to America. A little problem: MaCleane falls in love. With the Department of the Chief Justice, Rebecca (Liv Tyler). Who also became aware of the Thief Taker General? <br /> <br /> The plot is original enough, the casting is excellent (especially Alan Cumming as Drag Queen Lord Rochester, Carlyle and Miller - also) together in "Trainspotting" they have not lost their momentum), the Costumes are fantastic, make-up is outrageous and the music is hard-coded techno with a strangely classic undertone. Jake Scott has an eye for light and shadow, a good balance between drama and action, and he is not squeamish when he shows the more uncomfortable side of 17th century London. And fortunately for us, he likes close-ups of faces, especially eyes. Jonny Lee Miller's eyes. And Liv Tylers too, but who is this movie about? Rebecca? No, Plunkett and MaCleane. But this movie offers more than just beautiful faces. At the risk of sounding a cliché, it's a quick, furious and sometimes frustrating ride with the most noble roadmates since Robin Hood. Decadent, sloppy and violent, Scott's debut film makes for an entertaining evening in the cinema. As MaCleane says, "I was great and it was a damn good laugh!"
