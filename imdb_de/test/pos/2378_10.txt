Four unfortunate women leave dull London and spend an ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth von Arnim's novel comes alive in this charming little film that miraculously demonstrates the virtues of a literary script and an ensemble of acting. All the elements come together to produce a film that, though almost forgotten, still evokes a sense of appreciation at the appropriate resolution of the story. <br /> <br /> The actresses are convincing. Ann Harding is the free-spirited woman who longs for "wisteria and tranquility" away from misty London. Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife and wishes the elegant responsibility to act as hostess in the castle. Jane Baxter is the pretty young nobleman who has temporarily fled from male admirers. Jessie Ralph steals every scene she's in as an old lady who just wants to be alone with her memories of the past. <br /> <br /> The men in the story are also well-staffed. As Miss Harding's husband, Frank Morgan has a rather complex role as a mouse explorer who undergoes a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. Reginald Owen is wonderfully pompous as Miss Alexander's husband as a man well-equipped to bore for England (his comical attempt to take an English bath in an Italian bathtub becomes even funnier with the support of Charles Judels and Rafaela Ottiano Servant). After all, Ralph Forbes, one of the most beautiful forgotten actors of the decade, is happily more eccentric than the carefree landlord of the ladies. <br /> <br /> Film crew members will spot unrooted Ethel Griffies, the owner of Hampstead Housewives Club.
