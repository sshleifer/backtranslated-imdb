Why are the IMDb reviewers who hate this movie so scared? It's not a masterpiece, but if you look at it twice, it acts as a compelling drama in the world of Network TV. Robin Stone is the epitome of every Dan Rather, Phillip Stone and Brian What-his-name on NBC. A mannequin of a man without love, who is successful in his career but fails miserably in his personal life. I worked for eight (8) years in network news and Robin Stone's DO EXIST! <br /> <br /> The side cast works for me from Cannon (who may be annoying but not in this movie) to Greene (who plays just the right pathos) to Wexler (the young in love model with the image of Prince Charming scores and can not reconcile this image with the true ugliness). Also noteworthy is the end that some IMDb reviewers claim is a cop-out. It is not! Listen to the song "He's Moving On" to find clues to the bow the Robin Stone character travels, making him finally face his problems. He realizes that the answers are not with the life he has lived, and that the symbolic path of those with whom he has connected himself is ultimately perfect.
