To be honest, I would give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to make up for the 5 pages of imbecile, unjustified 1-star ratings. This is an interesting story, the whole acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning bimbo role, but she plays well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is reasonably creepy. It is a good moral game and there is no reason to explain the origin of the god / supernatural being / alien / whatever "the show is going on" so I'm glad the movie is not trying. It's really irrelevant to the story, which is relatively long, but pretty convincing and, in the end, rather satisfactorily summed up. <br /> <br /> Before you decide that this movie is terrible (or really, anything below ~ 7.5), read some of the dozens of 1 star reviews that "hated" and youthful criticism , Maybe the trailer was misleading or something - I did not see it - but some of those reviewers apparently were expecting Terminator 4 or Saw 5 (a reviewer actually compared this movie to Saw! How totally inappropriate and unrelated!) <Br /> <br /> Seriously, most of these reviews read like Du-tube comments - according to these "critics," this movie is too confusing, but too predictable, too little action, but it's too much going on, too smart, and too stupid. Explains too much, but leaves too much unexplained ... oh - and it seems to be a "waist (sic) of time". Take into account the quality and source of reviews before you take them to heart. I'm afraid these 1-star kids did not understand the term "altruism coefficient" and were therefore completely unable to understand the premise of the movie (though they stubbornly claim that they "understood" it before explaining how confusing it was!) If you know What these two words mean, it will not be difficult for you to understand (and enjoy) this movie. <br /> <br /> I really wish there was an evaluator reputation system here, so I could be sure to ignore the rating of anyone who gave it movie 1 star forever. <br /> <br /> See for yourself and enjoy the beautiful presentation of an interesting couple who are doing an interesting moral "test" and facing the consequences. In my opinion, it is a good time.
