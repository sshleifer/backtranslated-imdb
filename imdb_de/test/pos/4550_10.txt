I've watched this movie pretty much for most of my life, and he never gets old. "Tommy Boy" has a huge heart for all the vile comments and insults (mostly from David Spade). And that makes the movie after all these years funny. <br /> <br /> Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), a car parts master, and has lived through all of that. But after his passing away on his wedding day, Tommy learns that the company is in debt and is to be bought by Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), the owner of a major auto parts company. To save the company, Tommy has to sell the company's new brake pads. On board is Richard Hayden (David Spade), a former classmate of Tommy's right hand of Big Tom. The film tells the story of the chemistry between the two SNL stars (and real best friends) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duo has enough comic energy to power the world. It's the big, stupid guy against the smart little guy. It works and some of her scenes are memorable funny. Farley and Spade are actually decent dramatic actors. Although the movie is primarily a comedy, it has a fairly large amount of drama, but Spade and especially Farley are as good there as when they make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Excuse me, but I have to talk more about Chris Farley. I read his biography ("The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts" for anyone who cares) and understand who Chris was in real life, who made this movie special for me. Chris Farley was a really good person who had trouble and ultimately could not overcome his addictions. Although this was the first movie he starred on, it's his best movie. It really showed who he was and how talented he was. Knowing Chris's story adds another layer to this movie, though it's no less funny. <br /> <br /> Farley and Spade are compared to a good screen cast. Rob Lowe is appropriately slimy as Tommy's "new brother" and Bo Derek is a stepmother. Brian Dennehy is great as Big Tom. Dennehy makes it easy to believe that they are father in son. Big Tom is as crazy as his son, though he is smarter and more mature. Dan Akroyd does one of his best as Zalinsky and gives Tommy the hard truth behind the ad. Julie Warner is also good as Tommy's love interest, Michelle. <br /> <br /> For me, Peter Segal is one of the great comedy directors. He keeps the pace fast and energetic, but above all he knows how to make fun of comedy. He does not scold the jokes, and he understands that funny actors know what they're doing and he allows it. But Segal goes one step further. He gives "Tommy Boy" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that tickles both the heart straps (real) and the funnybone. <br /> <br /> Critics did not like "Tommy Boy". Shame on you. A movie does not have to be particularly sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny (God forbade that Farley and Spade had to make muted comedy a la "The Office"). This is a great movie and one of my absolute favorites.
