Black comedy is not always easy to sell. Now and then you get a black comedy, which is very successful, such as Fargo. But usually they do not often find a big audience. People seem to choose either for the comedy or for serious chaos. There does not seem to be a big market for a good mix of both. The throwing mother from the train was a pretty decent hit, but few people seem to remember much nowadays. Danny DeVito has just beaten this out of the park in 1987. <br/> <br /> DeVito plays a strange mom named Owen who wants to free himself from his overbearing and unpleasant mother he still lives with. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who died shortly after her release, and she is quite a caricature. She is loud, ugly, rude and overbearing. Although Owen hardly seems to care for himself, he desperately wants his mother to kneel. He fantasizes about it in some really strange scenes, but obviously he does not have the guts to do it himself. This is where Billy Crystal comes into play. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid wannabe novelist who claims his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions out of it. He is trying to write a new one, but he can not even come up with a decent first sentence. "The night was ..." Owen hears Larry wishing his ex-wife was dead during an outburst in the school cafeteria. Owen borrows the idea of ​​strangers on a train and decides to travel to Hawai'i and murder Larry's ex-wife. As soon as it seems he did, he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny and even poignant. It is certainly never boring and often full of surprises. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is extraordinary, even though Ramsey was a bit over the top. Crystal is as good as he can get, and DeVito has always been underrated as a performer. The film is based on quite a lot of physical comedy, which usually works painfully. The film uses some really cutting-edge editing techniques in some scenes, and the off-beat tone is really refreshing. I was often critical of the late eighties, as a time of artistic discomfort and lazy filmmaking. Momma risked throwing off the train. Both in the representation of the characters and in the general presentation. How many comedies revolve around a son who murdered his mother? The movie is not too long and he is full of laughter. Writers find it more interesting than the general public, but it can still be enjoyed by everyone. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
