"More" may be remembered for the outstanding soundtrack of Pink Floyd - in 1969 they were not superstars. Actually, they have made an album with the film music that no fan can miss! <br /> <br /> But this is also the first film by German-French director Barbet Schroeder: It's a cult movie. When it was released, censorship cut off various scenes of sex and drugs everywhere. It is also one of the first films that explicitly deals with drug slavery. <br /> <br /> A German boy travels to Paris and meets an American woman: they fall in love. Together they search for sun and exoticism. But it's too high a price love: it introduces him to drugs. <br /> <br /> In the sixties, anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there was not much information. On the contrary, in many milieus, drugs were a kind of spiritual experience ... Therefore, it is quite surprising to see a film from this period that describes a nightmarish heroic experience at all vulgar and turned on in the cinema-verité style. The actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Grünberg are very convincing. "More" is a document from the end of the 60s - and also a document from the end of the Hippiesillusionen.
