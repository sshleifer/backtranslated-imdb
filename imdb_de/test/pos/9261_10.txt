Homicide: The Movie proved to be a great complement to a well written, well directed and well played series. There were loose ends that were not addressed properly at the end of last season. The entire series, and especially the film, gave a vivid insight into life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate. My pull on the show began long before I moved to Baltimore, but when I experienced life here, I realized how realistic it was. And the movie has kept that spirit. I certainly will not miss any new original episodes of the series, but I'm very grateful to NBC and the producers for giving us a last glimpse into the dark side of Charm City.
