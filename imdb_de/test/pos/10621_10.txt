Yes, I felt as if I had been disappointed when I saw it for the first time. But only the next day I could see the true brilliance of this creation. I will not repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is a new area that I would like to address ... ** SPOILERS ** Why exactly is the teacher holding the broken glass in the student put bag? Most reviewers have stated that this only reflected their cruelty and reaction to unsatisfactory performance. I do not have to agree. Watch the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears when she sees her students playing on stage. The student is an expressive girl (crying and expressing his fears) - exactly the opposite of Huppert's character. There is a scene later in the movie after the girl was injured when Huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. The mother says visibly annoyed: "We have given up everything so that she can learn piano", and Huppert snaps immediately: "You mean, She has given up everything or not." <br /> <br /> So it was my thought Huppert just saved this young expressive student from her own destiny. She did not want the girl to end like YOU, oppressed and hardened, condemned to a recital life ... the gradual killing of the soul in the pursuit of perfection. Maybe she saw herself on stage years ago, before things got worse. Maybe she wished she had escaped when she was so old. Does it ruin the life of the student or does it just free her? <br /> <br /> This realization made the difference for me in what I experienced through this film. Brilliant.
