Outstanding special effects make this disaster movement very plausible. You can see that the producers have taken the trouble to properly display the displays on the computer screens - all of which makes it very convincing. The sets also look very authentic. A good selection of music completes the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is good and the presence of David Suchet adds some weight to the cast. Compared to other films of this genre, Flood is among the best of the best. Fortunately, the aspect of "human drama" has not been exaggerated, as is often the case with this type of film. Human suffering is presented in perfect balance with the actual flood scenes. <br /> <br /> And of course the film confirms what many of us suspect anyway: weather forecasts often do not do it right! :)
