When I saw this movie, I was amazed at how the perception of the media can influence a celebrity's opinion. Karen Carpenter was a carefree but very unconscious young lady whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard climb the charts with wonderful songs. Like all celebrities of today, they were often criticized for their music, looks, style, and so on. This had a huge impact on Karen, who launched a fight against her food and lost weight drastically, eventually leading to her death. This heart-felt movie was not anything I thought at first. But when I started to look at it, I was addicted. In the same way as the story of Tina Turner, this film enlightens you and gives you an insight into the lives of young artists. The drama was great and even after nearly 20 years of being done, the direction and dialogue are still entertaining. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone who has not seen it yet. It is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged.
