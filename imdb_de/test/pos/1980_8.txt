This movie is stunning and stunning. But I think it may be appreciated only by hardcore RPG games. It's like a game. One problem is that the plot is too game-like and just has too many twists. The twists are over the top. Jude Law delivers a very good performance. I really like him in this movie, as well as Jerome in Gattaca and Gigglo Joe in A.I.
