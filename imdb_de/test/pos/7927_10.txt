Tom Clancy uses "Alesandr Nevsky" in his book "Red Storm Rising". In this book Nevksy was shown as a prelude to the Soviet invasion of West Germany in the theaters of Russia. I felt like I needed to check it. It was excellent! The cinematography was great and the story was amazing. I do not regret watching this movie and added to my collection.
