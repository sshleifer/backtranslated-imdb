Deathbed: The bed that eats. <br /> <br /> Judging by the title, you can guess what this movie is about. And yet there is much more (background) story to this film than you might suspect. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the main thing is that a bed eats people and food, but there are also some subplots. I will not spoil you for you, but they are a nice touch. Unfortunately, the acting in this film is very mediocre. The fact that most dialogues are not even spoken by the actors does not really help to improve the overall quality of the film. <br /> <br /> Because there is a lot of voice-over work. The thoughts of the characters are also revealed to the audience. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. <br /> <br /> The effects are ok. Sure, it could be a lot better if you compare it to today's movies. But you really should not do it. Just judge the movie as it is and do not take it too seriously. You have to admit that a killer BED is pretty creative. If you are easily scared, do not look at this movie. You may never want to sleep again ... <br /> <br /> Death Bed: The bed that eats is a weird horror gem on a low budget, but I would still recommend it to fans of horror movies /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this movie 7 out of 10 stars for its creative story and unexpected twists here and there.
