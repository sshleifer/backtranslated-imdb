WOW I love this movie. This is definitely added to my list of ghetto movies. <br /> <br /> Juice - Performer Tupac 'I giva F ***' Menace II Society - O Dawg 'I'll smoke everyone, I just do not giva F ****' New Jersey Drive - Hey, she steal cars in bright sunlight. They obviously are not giva f *** <br /> <br /> New Jersey Drive is the best movie ever. It's high on the list, the second threat company is third, and Clockers is really stupid. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for New Jersey Drive is Pwnage to Mac Mall & Young Lay - Everything about My Fetti can be heard throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Lords of the Underground - Burn Rubber, another good song, and also Ill & Al Scratch - do not make a player <br /> <If you're a fan of GTA-SA, you love it this movie AND the amazing soundtrack. The soundtrack is essentially rap about the theft of cars ^ _ ^ SWEETTTT Movie!
