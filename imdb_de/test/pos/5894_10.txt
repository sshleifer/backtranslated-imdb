Blue Ribbons, Stars and Stripes Forever, Decorated Generals and Unconditional Surrender of the Enemies, which required tons and tons of radiation. This was the charge of the victory of the United States during World War II !! The celebration in Times Square and other places in the United States suggests a national zenith !!! America is up right !! One thing, a torturous and embarrassingly perverted thing ... The time of adjustment !! .. The actual celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was ready. You have to get a new life ... the old life is over forever ... Polite and friendly smile had a fragile facade with a long life of ice cubes in boiling water !! Each of the characters in the movie is ruled by original doubts and can not pretend that nothing was seriously wrong for the simple reason that it was not true !!! As soon as NCOs and generals and their wives and daughters and sons and virtually all other Americans touched by World War II were exposed to disabilities, nightmares and World War II retaliatory measures, no one succeeded in doing the same !! At the moment, social and moral issues had an interest in themselves ... Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start from scratch !! Dana Andrews realized that he should never be married to Virginia Mayo !!! Theresa Wright has become painfully aware that she is constructively selfish !! Last but not least, the character Homer is about to marry, and he thinks everyone around him is just as hurt as he is, basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to cope with it! ! <br /> <br /> The reason this movie is so awesome is that a happy ending has been reached the hard way, once everyone has recognized the new beginning of the new United States and the new world as a whole Tragedy from the Second World War was recognized and emotional things were torn apart and taken in step and treated accordingly !! Frederick March and Myrna Loy need to return to Chapter 1 of their marriage. Homer has briefed his new bride on what it takes to be married to him (ie half of the cases make her feel like a nurse) and Thresa Wright Dana Andrews means that her entry into adulthood is a partial responsibility for her Dissolution of a marriage has led ... This is equivalent to learning how to drive a car to get the driver's license in the Indianapolis 500 ... The characters in the film are the typical Americans after the Second World War, in which they through the Rude awakening obsessive changes in their lives have come to a dead end ... Happiness is no longer the luxury of Adjective Cop aesthetics commanded ... it is now about terrible conditions and good results evil by the less ugly choice !! ... The Second World War did not happen easily !! It will henceforth dominate the social patterns of American life. The total catastrophe of World War II has expressed the feelings of most Americans regarding personal inadequacy of human beings. I love this movie and also AFI probably for the reason that it caused problems that were unjustly taboo. Conclusion, see this movie! Nightmares about the struggle, dilemmas about marital misery and / or re-adaptation, coping with your life, if you are handicapped, and basically just acting human, are constantly being portrayed in movies and on TV today, HOWEVER !! that is 1946 !! Very new for Americans then .... Remember it !! Director William Wyler has shown how Americans feel about the aftermath of World War II when the film industry left him with one hand behind his back !!! Take that into account and you'll probably find how sensational this movie really was !!
