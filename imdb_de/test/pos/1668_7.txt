After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin), I was more than excited to see his "Masterpiece" (O-Word Criterion) RIFIFI disappointed in the story. <br /> <br /> So I have at least these five questions in my head: <br /> <br /> 1. In the last countdown, Louis Grutter shot the main character Tony le St√©phanois out of a house. He did not know if he was alive or not, but he did not care about it and ran right out to get his car. Of course, Tony was not dead and shot at him. BIG QUESTION MARK. <br /> <br /> 2. In another important scene, right after the robbery, Cesar, the specialist in safes, gave a diamond ring (which was part of the robbery) to a woman who worked for Louis Grutter in a night bar. Stupid, because before this character was not stupid. And of course, Louis knew right away that Tony was planning the jewel robbery. SMALL QUESTION MARK. <br /> <br /> 3. Following the murder of the gangster behind Louis Grutter, Mario Ferrati and his wife Tony and his best friend Joe were planning revenge on the Louis gang. At the same time, they do not care about the safety of Joe's wife and his five-year-old child. Of course, Louis Gang kidnapped the son. CHEAP and easy. <br /> <br /> 4. The perfect robbery: Of course this is the best 30min. long scene in the entire plot, without a word being spoken all the time, but was this a perfect robbery? Compared to other films dealing with the subject, I could only smile when Tony took a fire extinguisher to turn off the alarm. Too easy. <br /> <br /> 5. The Grutter gang went to Mario's house because they knew the jewels would be there. Then they murder Mario and his wife. And then? They are not looking for it! NO. They ran straight out of the apartment. And more. After not observing the apartment, after a while (which was the same day) Tony can go in to take the jewels. BIG QUESTION MARK. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good movie. Because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene. Because of the very good cut (The final scene in the car through Paris is breathtaking). Because of a very good actor named Jean Servais. Because of this black and white fever you get it while you watch it. For other reasons, other users have written about it, but please do not tell me that this is an amazing story.
