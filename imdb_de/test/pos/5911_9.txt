Stewart's age did not bother me at all in this film, though he was a much younger person. I still remember my fascination for Lindbergh's story, and when I was quite grown up at the time this biopic was made, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> This is not only a great achievement from Stewart, but also an outstanding performance. Many fascinating technical data that are understandable for technically demanding people like me. And the look of the plane itself was great. <br /> <br /> I loved this portrayal of a time before I was born and brought the childhood love I had for planes and the idea of ​​air traffic back to life.
