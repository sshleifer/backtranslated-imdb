This is definitely Nolan's most intimate and thoughtful post. Not to say that Memento or Insomnia are bad, but they were definitely more Hollywood standards ... while the episodes are more of an indie strip. The story is very brilliant and very well developed. All in all ... look at this, if you're a fan of Nolan's work, I'm sure you'll appreciate it more.
