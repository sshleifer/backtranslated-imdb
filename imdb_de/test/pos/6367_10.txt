I saw The Couch Trip (1988) for the first time years ago on late night television and immediately fell in love with it. The funny part is that I usually do all comedy, but I never heard of it until I saw it. Dan Ackroyd is a simple and silly time in which the hills move. He made some great movies with Belushi and did not forget Saturday Night Live. But I think the couch trip is probably the best and funniest. With a good cast of Charles Grodin, David Clennon and Walter Matthau, this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. Ackroyd's wife Donna Dixxon does a good job here. My favorite moments in the film are Ackroyd and David Clennon's character Lawrence Baird. The two played well. So if you have not seen a good comedy yet, make a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy The Couch Trip. I just did it, Amazon 78 cents. What a bargain, too bad that I was hit with a shipping fee of 2.50. Well, it's still worth it. Every man will love this strip, check it out.
