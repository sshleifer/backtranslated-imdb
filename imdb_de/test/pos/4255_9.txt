I thought I might be disappointed to see this movie after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with honesty and bold humor. In 1969, the transition between Afro-American groups from a prevailing policy of reconciliation and integration to confrontation and self-determination was still fairly new and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to depict both the establishment and the anti-establishment as caricatures that often bring them very close in real life. Particularly noteworthy is the achievement of Arnold Johnson: He has successfully avoided that his character falls into sociopathy or frenzy. I would rather watch this as "To Sir With Love" every day!
