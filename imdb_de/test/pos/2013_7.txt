Jon Cryer reiterates his role as a neurotic guy in Two and a Half Men, which he perfected in this series. He longs for a good relationship with a girl, as his colleague has developed, and the Tet-a-Tet between him and his partner's best friend is pretty funny. Then they realize that they are attracted to each other and date. In one of the funniest lines on TV - I think in the last episode - he and his partner discuss that he wants to make a suggestion to the girl. <br /> <br /> His partner prepares him for the moment and suggests, "What's the worst thing that can happen? She says no." Dinner. What she answers, <br /> <br /> "GOD, no!" <br /> <br /> I laughed so much that I cried.
