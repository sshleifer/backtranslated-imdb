I absolutely love this movie. Everything It almost felt like watching myself and my friends on the screen. The way this movie was shot was a pure masterpiece, very original and creative. I referred to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some. I'm really glad that I met this movie. If only there was more genius than it was out there!
