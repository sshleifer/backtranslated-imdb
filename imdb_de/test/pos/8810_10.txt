It takes a lot of time for a movie to reach the already numb particles of my brain that have not yet been exhausted due to the overloaded and resumed copy-copy world of the movies. But this movie made it on my "Magic Movies" list. To become a "magical movie," he must leave behind every chain of my being in what I can only define as "bliss" and "complete satisfaction." This film has the fascination of what my mind thinks, and if not for the deeply personal attachment of my head and the head of those who made those parts, it would look like another Dead Rave Scene movie of that time than the 90s with its exploding ecstasy madness. So the movie did not come to me at all. It got into me and pulled up something that I thought was dead for a very long time, pushing me so far that it's my own criticism. I forgot how long it has been since I saw something that made me feel so good. I strongly recommend to watch this movie.
