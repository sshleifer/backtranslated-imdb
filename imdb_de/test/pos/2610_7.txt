"Please, do not kill me, I'm just an actor!" "Can you play dead?" It's hard to describe this show. It's like a criminal. Where the bad policeman is a donkey. Literally. What's great about the show are some of the awful one-liners from Assy. Assy Mcgee pops out gems like "Adios, Blimp" and in some places makes for a big laugh. At other times, unfortunately, the show seems to move slowly, making it almost impossible to watch. This is definitely the kind of show you will love or hate. There is essentially no middleman. It's not the best show on {Adult Swim}, but it has some strengths. It pays to see if you enjoy it. I know that I did it.
