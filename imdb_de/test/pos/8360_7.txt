As a fan of time travel stories, I was surprised that there was no "device" that sent Russell Johnson's character through time. He just appeared in 1865. It was a disappointing part of the episode. I have enjoyed the premise of changing the future by changing the past. Other Twilight Zone episodes on time travel, such as "No time like the past," "Once upon a time," and so on, appreciated me more about using time travel equipment. If Russell Johnson's character was the same character he played in "Execution," it would have been more acceptable to fans like me. As sci-fi fans know, no figure has to "die" in time travel episodes. In this kind of stories all kinds of plots can be applied. That was the only mistake I could comment on for this episode.
