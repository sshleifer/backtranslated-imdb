I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I've gone down many times to see it over and over again ... I think 9 times in total. It's just great, as I would describe it ... I was fascinated by the soundtrack, the beautiful panoramas of the South of France and the way the children started their own lives. An ideal way to live is what they set up ... of course the forces that you have to use, but if I have forgotten this part, I want me to be in the movie and live that way! So good that it is now available on DVD ... not been there for years! <br /> <br /> TLW
