This is probably in my top 5 list of funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was different! It made fun of Robin Hood and was HILARIOUS! I was very happy with the compilation and the good behavior! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; "We are men in tights!" If you have a good sense of humor you will love this movie!
