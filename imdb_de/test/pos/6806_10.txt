My daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my application ... but I want to add a few more words. <br /> <br /> ?? National Velvet was one of my two favorite movies as a kid. (The other one is' The Wizard of Oz ??.). The cinematography, the acting, the script, and the music that came together was such a wonderful little heart drama that it still brings tears to my eyes. Based on a book by Enid Bagnold, the script followed the book very well. The characters are created so thoughtfully. It's easy to get emotionally involved with the whole family and the quaint little Irish village they live in. The premise ... the complete outsider believes in her horse and herself enough to try the biggest horse race in the world ... is impressive for any young person, especially a young girl in her 40s ... one Time when girls were sometimes ignored as people, let alone athletes. You would have to be terribly hard-nosed to not appreciate it. <br /> <br /> But the perspective I appreciated most about this film is the unabated innocence in its moral message. It's almost magical how "mom and apple pie" the movies were back then. I was really impressed by the IMDB reviewer who asked ... "Was the world ever so trusting?" and then went on to chastise the director overnight with the two main characters because of his complacency with regard to "uncaperoned". My answer to his question is a clear YES! The world of film was the confidence in the 40s. <br /> <br /> My grandparents remember when they took my mother to this movie when it was released. Then my mother brought me with me in my youth, and my daughter was fortunate enough to be born at a time when she repeatedly saw it on videotape. Now we have it on DVD. It has been a favorite of the family for generations, though generations of horse lovers. It was never about sex ... it's about growing up! It's about believing in oneself and working hard to achieve your goals. So old-fashioned, it was not even about the prize money! It's about the girl who has understood that his horse has what it takes to be the best. And yes, the director was indeed concerned about Elizabeth Taylor's lack of physical development, as the book made it difficult for Velvet Brown (Liz Taylor's character) to cut her hair and tie her breast so she could pass as a male jockey if she went through to the Grand National Steeplechase. Back then, it was just a guy for guys ... I think there were only 12 women in the race so far. It's almost insulting that anyone would bother to think about the Lolita thing about this movie ... Besides, anyone who had anything to do with a growing girl and his horse could have known that the only thing what they think about stars in their movie The eyes have four hooves and a tail. <br /> <br /> And now for a few little things ... the stunt riding was done by Monty Roberts, the famous horse whisperer. I think he is mentioned for his riding in the movie credits. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 out of 10 points! I never get tired of seeing it again.
