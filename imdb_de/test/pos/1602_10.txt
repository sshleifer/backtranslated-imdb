Visconti's masterpiece! I admit that I'm not familiar with many of his works, but I can not imagine his other work surpassing this fabulous movie. Last night I saw death in Venice after an absence of about 25 years and was totally fascinated by everything I saw. This fascination was a pastiche that consisted of many elements: the extraordinary photographs of Visconte, first and foremost his love for long, weary shots of people eating, swimming, walking, and having a significant character walking through this crowd; the brilliant interpretations of Visconti's shot selection; Acting according to the principles, without exceeding the dialogue and communicating the complexity of the scenes only by facial features. <br /> <br /> It's true: teens who are seeing this movie for the first time need to be aware that they are seeing a unique movie, a movie that could not be shot in 2006. A film whose time was in the few years of the sixties and early seventies of the last century, was granted as an artistic license to film directors, and money men took over supporting roles. As many of the recent IMDb commentators have written, this film is long, boring (too little action) and overbearing. I suppose, by the standards of Hollywood Pap, these comments contain benefits. Unfortunately, they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and other of those years. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen the death in Venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in a movie and a story from another era. You will be rewarded.
