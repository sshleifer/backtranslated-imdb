As Mr. Bean almost never speaks, I strongly advise you to use a DVD player while the teacher holds his finger over the Pause / Play button. At the end of each lesson of an age group, you should spend only 5 minutes pausing and playing the DVD. Students are asked to respond to "What's this?", "What's going to happen?", "What's going on?", "What's going on?" ? "or another question that elicits answers from the new vocabulary and the new grammar of this lesson. <br /> <br /> Because everyone is watching the TV, shy students usually become vocals because the DVD starts at any point or can be stopped, she is a perfect "filler" for the awkward "times" in which the students leave and arrive. <br /> <br /> I've tried other DVDs, especially "Tom & Jerry" "Cartoons and Red Skelton DVDs, but no one else was as good as "Mister Bean", that drew the attention of the students.
