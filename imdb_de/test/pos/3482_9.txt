I do not usually comment on movies because I'm a movie salesman, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The drama is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of people with disabilities to make this movie more "Hollywood". James McAvoy is such a great actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was also impressed by Steven Robertson. I can not believe this is his first real movie. Brenda Fricker plays a small role, but as usual she is outstanding. In this movie everyone can see how lucky we all are. If you like awakening and mask, you will enjoy this story. You owe this movie.
