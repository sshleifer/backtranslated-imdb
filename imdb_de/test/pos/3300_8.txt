I've just seen this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence of High-Brow, NYC, or any other mid-century big city. The colors, the <br /> <br /> cars, the clothes and the coming of the women's movement. It reflects the <br /> <br /> comf-coziness of relationships between men and women in the corporate world <br /> <br />. In a way, things have changed and in others they have not changed. Women still want what men have today, but now they have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. In <br /> <br /> my opinion, beautiful women will still be with men in <br /> <br /> pursuing their goals! The laws that we now have against the insult, and <br /> <br /> all were adopted by unattractive women who wanted an equal chance to compete with prettier women who could possibly get the positions alone /> based on their looks and get out! The real competition is not between men and women, but between women and women! I liked the look and feel of the movie, but the world has not changed as much as it really is
