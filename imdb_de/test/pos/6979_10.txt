For avid sci-fi fans, this movie is just what you've been waiting for. If you watch this movie, you lose yourself in the characters, especially in Riddick, the bad guy in the movies. This is the case where you are looking for evil and want to see it live and win. As you watch the survivors struggle to stay alive, you will see for a long time who lives and how they survive these unknown creatures that have conquered this planet. An excellent movie, Vin Diesel did a wonderful job because he condemned Riddick, and the acting and the excitement were gorgeous
