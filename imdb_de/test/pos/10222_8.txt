For a film like this there will always be something to follow in the coming years. Clive Barker, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a horror movie that's part Goth, part mythology and all the horror in between. "Nightbreed" are a series of mutants that only come out at night and roam the place called Midian. Now, a man named Boone (Craig Sheffer) claims to be hallucinating. He goes to this shrinking Dr. Decker (David Croneberg), who "helps" Boone with his problems. Since Decker is unaware of this situation, he claims to be a purist, and he is just a disguised hater. Boone, however, goes to Midian and claims that he is one of the mutants there. But a mutant named Peloquin (Oliver Parker) sees Boone as meat! His bite spares Boone, however, after being killed by a bangle with firearms, he is now one of them. After being led astray by Decker, Boone does everything he can to protect Lori (Anne Bobby) from him. Lori rescues a mutant from the sun and helps the others as well. I liked the lady mutant who gives a smoky "kiss of death", and the porcupine woman who dreamed Boone shows her power that is so seductive and deadly at the same time. I definitely enjoyed this horror movie, and the rule is: Never trust a shrink! Rating 3.5 out of 5 Stars!
