The Stepford children not only show that they are very good at television, but also show the very disquieting result of indoctrination. It is a pretty meaningful statement of how action within the limits of what is considered "good" behavior can destroy anything that makes a person unique and an individual. I think this is a movie that parents who want a sense of the idea that clay in the hearts and minds of teenagers should look at with their children, discuss what the movie says. I do not know if this was in any way the intention of this film, but I have always thought that this is one of the best filming devices against the desire to make children claim an unrealistic and domineering claim to what is in the film Movie is about to suit the best interests of other than the children themselves. I hope I can watch this movie someday on DVD. I'm at the start gate ... I'm waiting.
