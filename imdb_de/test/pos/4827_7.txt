May contain spoilers !!! In no way, shape or form, does this film break the horror film form. By far not. However, it offers a spooky atmosphere, credible enough characters and gore. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and does not bother to develop further than necessary. A few children are killed in a salvage accident in the early 1900s. Since then, they have persecuted and killed the residence of their sleepy little PA town in the mountains. <br /> <br /> Simple: You want to take revenge on the man who caused death years and years ago. Of course, his great-grandson, the great-grandson, is in town and he's a real idiot. A mother and her two daughters inherit an old house after the husband's death. The eldest daughter is rebellious, disgusting ... a typical teenager. The younger one is curious, with bright eyes and comes in contact with the ghost children. <br /> <br /> The scariest part of this movie is the sheer emotionlessness of the kids, and they hack from victim to victim. Excellent acting. It was so scary! I mean, the Children of the Corn-Flicks are one thing ... but this has crowned most of them (as for the creepy kids). <br /> <br /> What does it look like? I bought it before I saw it, and I was not unhappy. But I'm a horror fan through and through.
