Let's get this out of the way so that those on this site who are looking for information about anything related to the word "breasts" (and you know who you are, Googler) can move: this is in no way pornographic. On the contrary, if this has value as a masturbatory material, the filmmaker does not seem to have done a good job, as it aims to preserve the theme and experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and about health and such continue. I would indeed be a bit cautious of someone who has found a DVD or, if he is ever played again, until late in the night on HBO or Cinemax and has used this as a means to enjoy. You might as well go to the supermarket and pick up some ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them together and um, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> No, this is a semi-serious movie. Making for premium late night viewing, but it should not be just for the late night types. This is intimate in attitude, but not in tone. All women, in all their different shapes and sizes and races, and even with a man thrown in with false breasts, have something of the most life-giving value in the most direct manner. When I say, half seriously, this is due to the many small segments that the director considers necessary, with archive footage of old "how-to" videos about puberty and sex as well as breasts and extremely rare cartoons with flying knockers about. This is not a problem, but an advantage: we need a few small visual ways to switch between these interviews. Nothing is slowed down and we see it as feminism in a liberating form: they do not cover you up, and even if they do not choose to take off their tops, shirts and bras, they are still open as it is a natural part of her body, the subject of sex, surprise, consolation and discomfort is curiosity, motherhood and, unfortunately, cancer. In this last part, there is another bold step when we see a woman who has survived her cancer with just one breast. You know that you're grown-up and grown-up if you can see this woman who has somehow led a semi-normal life with a breast (the bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother says she could have a wish) around she would have to think about having two full breasts), and you do not giggle or go "eww, disgusting". That's the test, people. <br /> <br /> It is not filmed under the best of circumstances, but for TV it is handled at a tight pace. It's never boring for a moment, and we never feel anyone hold back, especially when a man hears the hard truth that breasts may not really be erogenous or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men. Breasts: A documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and revealing the mind and heart. If that is worthy of a "I was alone" session, then I appreciate you more power, though it's not the intention.
