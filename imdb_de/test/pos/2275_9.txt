I went to the movies and had no expectations of the film, which I had in mind: "Everything is lit". I went with a joy that I hardly feel in American films. In the directorial debut of actor Leiv Schreiber, the film follows a man on his journey through the past, accompanied by an eccentric group that includes a brake-dancing, barely English-speaking punk of the eukraine, his grandfather, who believes he is blind, and their crazy dog , The first half of the film is witty and clever, with an extremely European flair of using small but wonderful characters, while the second half of the film goes into a grim story of discovery and the Holocaust. This little film brings so many emotions and colors to light and is more than just a story of enlightenment, but also of relationships and connections. The drama is incredibly powerful, the story mysterious and interesting, and the artistic appeal of cinematography for which one wants to die. With some brilliant and absolutely moving scenes "Everything is Illuminated" has conquered my heart.
