This movie is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien movie (which is awesome). It borrowed the main premise - a man was poisoned and spends the rest of the movie trying to find his killer. But I think it's good that the authors chose an English professor instead of a private tail as the protagonist. The plot is also very original. In general, the movie moves fast enough to keep you awake. But what makes this movie is a strangely outdated quality (probably due to the gruesome original music of the '80s) associated with a "noir" feel. Inexplicably, Dennis Quaid grins inexplicably throughout the movie, but he's still generally convincing. Meg Ryan is good as a student helper / love interest. If the movie gets kind of bad, then Dex (the pro) meets the British bodyguard / chauffeur and their duels are pretty ridiculous. The bodyguard works for the wealthy widow (played by the lovely Charlotte Rampling), but these scenes are too selfishly "noir" to help the movie, even though the family's "plotline" is pretty interesting. Dex always reappears in the same place and finds this bodyguard, which is rather random. In the last part of the film, a man is shot from a window, and from the outside you can see him jump out - that was a pretty bad direction. But apart from some of these obvious flaws, I still think it's alright. I certainly did not predict the end, so that was good - there is a twist and although some posters here think they were misleading, I thought it was a nice and believable ending. Dennis Quaid is more likeable in The Right Stuff, Great Balls of Fire, Inner Space and Cold Creek Manor with his funny grins and black eyes. But he's supposed to be a bit of a jerk here as Dex, so he got along well. Pretty decent movie.
