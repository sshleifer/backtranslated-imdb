This is the most difficult movie I have ever seen ... the emotional content is terrible but memorable. A woman accused of being a political activist is interrogated. The whole movie is about her interrogation. Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have intense and powerful roles, earning Oscars for their performances.
