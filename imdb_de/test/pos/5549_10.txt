This movie just felt very alive. I liked the end, which, of course, seemed to be resolved without great moments, but with many little moments. You could say it's an honest love story. It does not matter what sexual orientation the main characters have, it is still a story of love and understanding. <br /> <br /> There were many scenes in which the family was involved. The attitude is a very stressful time for some people during this time. Namely "the holidays". Christmas to be exact. <br /> <br /> Like most good movies, this one deals with issues of love, attitudes, expectations, and insurmountable prejudices. In the end, Alexandra and Casey make a choice because they know that love is difficult and that they give. Well done.
