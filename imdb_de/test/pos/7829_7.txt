"Snakes on a Plane" was such a well-hyped film that it was inevitable and a bit crazy to release another movie with almost the same title in the same year, let alone the same week. When I read the other comments here, I see the results. Many people are crazy. Crazy because it does not have the best special effects. Crazy, because it has no star. Angry because they wanted to see how Samuel Jackson said, "I'm sick of having this M ^ * & * &% - He F * ^ (^% - ing snakes to this M ^ * & * &% - He F * ^ (^% -Ing Train "! <br /> <br /> Well, that's certainly not the Samuel Jackson version, and maybe that's good. <br /> <br /> Snakes on a plane were in between Cop movie and horror lost, a family action movie and a bloody Gory movie of death: Saturday Night live actors laughed, while Jackson vowed so much that a grandmother could cover her ears and as far as the kids are concerned would they be traumatized by the violence <br /> Snakes on a Train knew exactly what it was all about: this was a cheap horror movie on a train, sure it had snakes and many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with false ones Clatter Effects One step in his action or intention is missing, as the "on a Plane" version from the first scene on itself stumbled. <br /> <br /> I had to offer the exaggerated fun that Snakes makes on a plane, and I admit that the "... on a Train" version was a bit dry. But in the trade, it was a cool and unexpected story. This little horror movie could have gone a lot more wrong than it did. <br /> <br /> He gets a 7 out of 10 points.
