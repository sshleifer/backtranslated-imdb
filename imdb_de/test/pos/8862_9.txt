Antarctica, Winter 1982. The team of an American research station is surprised by two crazy Norwegians, who follow a dog with a helicopter and try to kill him. All Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing but a dog, a few corpses and questions. This is the beginning of the greatest horror / thriller movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end you can feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone in no man's land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I do not know, because as far as I can see, its result is simple, scary and very good. That really puts you in the right mood. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog, which is just unbelievable. As for Russell and the others on two legs, I can not say anything else. <br /> <br /> You may think in 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You did not see everything until you saw that. Bodyparts fall off and creatures change their shapes ... Rob Bottin has done a great job, which today is considered a milestone for makeup special effects big screen due to other alien films at the time and therefore not very well known. You can almost see it as an unknown movie. Nobody I asked has heard about it. However, the film has managed to survive over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the hairstyle, the film is still pretty up to date. This movie is a classic. <br /> <br /> The film is without doubt one of mine, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time. As a Norwegian, I do not like the fact that MacReady calls the Norwegians Sweden!
