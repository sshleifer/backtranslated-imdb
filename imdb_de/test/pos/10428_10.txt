I'm a big fan of this movie and I found the TV miniseries "Children of The Dust" that fans should look for. At least 20 minutes or more will be cut on the DVD version of this movie. <br /> <br /> I would also suggest to viewers who enjoyed this movie to read the book. There's a rounder story with Corby / Whitewolf and Rachel, more on Black History and Buffalo Solders. There were two big storylines for the series or this movie. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier just shows that he gets better with age. The talent continues to grow. Between his character of Gypsy Smith and Regina Taylor, chemistry has continued to improve. I also enjoyed the Billy Wirth / Joanna Going story, which seems to be playing well. Of course, Billy Wirth is the "Model of Indian Vision". The gaze, the attitude, the dream of every woman who wanted to be swept away in this romance by a local hero. Worked for me too. Much more could have been done with this plot, but it gave the viewer a glimpse into the racial issues of the 1880s, white takeover of the local school, lack of black pioneer towns in the west. Michael Moriarty (Maxwell), as always a great actor, looks like a very caring and confused teacher who is not sure if the "whites" are going to interfere with native culture. <br /> <br /> For those who like to deal with characters and watch them Change this movie for you. I found the chemistry between Poitier's character and that of the orphaned Whitewolf very moving, thinking that Wirth and Poitier work very well together. Billy Wirth made some of his best scenes when working with Poitier. <br /> <br /> Going sometimes annoyed me when you just wanted to stop and shake her or give her a "wake up call". But on the whole, it was a great evening of entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan you will really see the difference.
