"Landscape after a Battle" begins with fleeing prisoners over a snow-covered field full of fences - in rather merry movements, accompanied by Vivaldi's Four Seasons. A touching opening. But we soon get to know these prisoners as mobs, and if they bury a man alive (treated with humor), the protagonist stops for a moment, but soon finds himself busy finding books from the former camp rather than around to take care of his neighbor. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film takes place in an American camp where the prisoners are not released, in a kind of semi-freedom, half camp. A perfect set for a study of war criminals, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholicism, grief and human misery in general. <br /> <br /> Film makes an important turn. In comes women, and with them film changes light, color and temperament. At the same time, it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in the Holocaust. I think a central political theme of the film must be the treatment of Jews by humanity during and after the World War, and not just the annihilation of the Nazis, but also the fact that humanity allows it - and even after the war Europe supplanted. Emotionally, the film is about grief and the problem of grieving, how the environment makes grief difficult, and how difficult it can be to share grief with people who have different experiences. <br /> <br /> But the film is a carpet of contradictions, humor, irony and sudden beauty. A few times during the film, a gypsy prisoner plays on a harp, an emotional melody that the protagonist brutally (cinematicically speaking) rejects. This example picks up on an important essence of the style and theme of the film. When it comes to humor, it is very funny how the protagonist constantly loses and finds his glasses, in crowds, in haystacks and so on. <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand Spielberg's respect for Wajda when you watch this movie. The great treatment of light can be compared to Spielberg at its best. The Grunwald Intermezzo speaks for itself. Narrative it brings only the film from the warehouse, but cinematically he brings the film with the deepest beauty in dreams and eternity. But there is also another scene that I can not let go without comment. It is the Christian supper. Undoubtedly ironic and at the same time profoundly religious, we see the transsubstantiation moment. All fall to their knees, while the protagonist is rescued by the priest from isolation to serve as a comic altar. His bells mock the scene, but also give him emotion and love. When Nina gets her bread, sunlight falls on her and bells sound spherical, this is the highlight of the movie. Leading actors are outstanding in their roles. Olbrychski as a perfect Wajda protagonist - the doubting reflective mind that is unable to bring all aspects of his mind and emotions to life. The beautiful Celinska is a great body that debuts in a figure that can not express all its interior in its proud movements. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to describe everything often can not consider anything. That succeeds Wajda. His films are either very moving, deep or beautifully filmed, but they take into account the peculiarities of life and society. One moment of joy for one is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of mourning for the third, a moment of nothing for the fourth. <br /> <br /> There are at least two reasons to watch out for Wajda's films of that time. First, the remarkable free expression is profound political implications. This country was the first to overturn communism twenty years later. Second, there is the development of a cinematic and narrative language that has made Kusturica into greatness.
