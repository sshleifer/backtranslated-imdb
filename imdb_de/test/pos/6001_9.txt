Lemuel Gulliver (Ted Danson) is a doctor who is missing at sea leaving behind the pregnant wife Mary (Mary Steenburgen). Eight years later, he appears disheveled and seemingly wobbly about his adventures in the lands of the small Lilliputians, the giant Brobdingnag, the floating island of intellectual Laputa, and the Houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent, talking horses to deal with the Yahoos - a race of beastly people - in addition to many other adventures. The not so good Dr. Bates (James Fox), who designs Lemuel's wife, has Gulliver imprisoned in an asylum, and Lemuel, Mary and son Thomas (Tom Sturridge) must find a way to prove his sanity. <br /> <br /> A wonderful adaptation of the satirical novel by Jonathan Swift. This movie is a great adaptation on so many levels: the story, the satire, the characters, the visuals, the brilliant cast. It's just a pleasure to see, and it's almost amazing, considering it's a TV movie. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent job to capture Swift's evil satire, which pulls like a hatchet through the British society of time, but still resonates today. The wise Brobdingnags and the Houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals, who find it virtually impossible to understand why Gulliver speaks so proudly of the vices and corruption of his society. The scenes in which Gulliver tries to prove himself to be something of the Yahoo's are perhaps the best, with biting satire in which they describe how they choose their leaders ("they seem to choose the worst among them ... who governs until he finds someone worse ") go to war (" We go to war only for a very good reason - maybe because they are weaker than us or we want their whole country ") etc. The scenes with Laputa are also done effectively - the intellectuals are included in their specialties, they have no time for anything else and actually have little common sense. And the addition of the Asylum Plot Line dramatically improves the story. Bates is a really unpleasant character, and when he talks about Gulliver's alleged vices, it's clear he's describing his own mistakes. <br /> <br /> The film uses beautiful and pretty convincing CGI effects, which show the very different settings of the novel with great effect. The difference in size is accomplished in a very skillful way, and all the worlds depicted in the story convince in their own way. The cinematography (especially the asylum question) and the costumes are brilliant. Editing the present with Lemuel's memories is a device that could be uncomfortable but works very well. <br /> <br /> The cast is really wonderful; a true who's who of British and American talent. Ted Danson does an excellent, multi-layered performance as Gulliver, effectively showing his transformation from a person confused by his alien environment to the madness he was in when he reappeared, to his rational, intellectual personality at the end. Danson is best known for his work on sitcoms and shows he is more than just Sam Malone. Mary Steenburgen is effective as his wife, and James Fox is absolutely repugnant as Bates. The rest of the cast consists mainly of cameos. Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Warwick Davis, Kristin Scott Thomas, Geraldine Chaplin, Alfre Woodward, Edward Fox and Sir John Gielgud are the most memorable - but even the smallest parts are very well played. <br /> <br /> "Gulliver's Travels" is not 100% true to the book, but it's a triumph of history and images. It is not to be overlooked. <br /> <br /> 9/10
