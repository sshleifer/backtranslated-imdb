Do not even try to figure out the logic of this story. But take the 10-year-old Gus on one of the most bizarre road trips you've ever seen. Stranger characters and implausible situations than a Twin Peaks meeting! Nothing makes sense, but it is impossible to watch Motorama! Where can I find the 'R' ????
