This is a cute little silent comedy in France about a man who tells another that he can not stay in this castle for an hour because he is being persecuted. And once the guy enters the house, it looks a lot more like a crazy house or maybe the after-effects of LSD !! While there are ghosts and skeletons, there is a strange amount of animals, strange special effects and gags. It's terribly hard to describe, but the visualization alone makes the movie worth seeing. Understand, however, that the selfish director also had many "funny gags" that totally collapsed and hurt the movie. His "camera tricks" were not that difficult, but annoying and stupid. IGNORE THESE AND KEEP WATCHING - it gets better. The movie is fast, funny and worth seeing. I especially enjoyed seeing Max Linder acting and attacking - he was so expressive and funny! A pity that he is practically forgotten today. An interesting but very sad reading can be found in the IMDb biography.
