If you are interested in war between states, this movie is worth it. It's a great historical story. No blinking sabers, no cavalry charges, no slaughter - just the story of a sad group of Union soldiers who stumbled into the farm of a Confederate woman and her son and seized as much as their captain's conscience allowed. This crowd moves up and down as events evolve that affect his sense of humanity in conflict with his sense of duty to his men and his cause. Ultimately, he comes to a compromise that each of us would be difficult to achieve. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the historical treatment of the war in Kentucky, a slave state that had tried to remain neutral, but eventually settled under mysterious political circumstances that led to the imprisonment of certain legislators. About half of the Kentucky soldiers fought for each side, but there was never much talk about what it had been like to spend that time there. This film simply adds to the look and feel of time and place.
