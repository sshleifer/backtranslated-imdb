No, that has nothing to do with the sitcom "Seinfeld" or her eccentric and funny character Cosmo Kramer. In fact, "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a good drama movie, undoubtedly one of the best of its kind and one of the greatest films of all time. I am glad that he has won more Oscars than "Apocalypse Now" because he really deserves such a fame. This is not changed in any way. There is nothing wrong with the movie. It is a film of the highest quality. And it's also the test of time. Not only does it not look outdated, but its cultural impact is long lasting, and its realistic history is as significant as it was when it came out in 1979. A timeless classic. They do not make films like this today. <br /> <br /> This movie is dramatic, realistic, simple but brilliant, intense, powerful, sweet and sometimes even tragic and depressing. But it also has good humor. It has no special effects, but who cares? This is neither the movie nor the place to discuss such things. For a movie like this, this would be pointless and absolutely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. The chemistry of the actors is just perfect. All the actors are great, but the three most important ones are the best. Dustin Hoffman, a brilliant actor, has his greatest accomplishment here as the endearing, but distant workaholic Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is great as Ted's wife Joanna. And the cute little Justin Henry is great as the affectionate, but sometimes stubborn Billy, son of Ted and Joanna. The soundtrack is all instrumental and wonderful. The opening song (by guitarist Frederic Hand) is brilliant. The rest of the soundtrack consists mainly of Antonio Vivaldi's classical music and is simply mind-blowing. <br /> <br /> This movie also has an incredible evolution of the characters. See the character Ted Kramer: A workaholic who becomes an amazing father after having no choice but to take care of his son, and tries to reconcile these new responsibilities with his job after leaving his wife Joanna was abandoned. Ted gets to know the most beautiful things in life, but also realizes how life is, with the problems in his job and the return of Joanna, who wants to have custody of her son. But even Joanna is getting better and the end is an unexpected surprise when you see this for the first time. <br /> <br /> This film also has some thoughtful things, such as: For example, court scenes in which both Ted and Joanna have brutal character assassinations unleashed by lawyers. Another thing is when poor Billy falls off a climbing frame with his toy (a plane) and is seriously injured in the face. On the other hand, the scene is very well done and what comes next is intense: his father runs fast and crosses blocks, ignoring the traffic to bring his son to the hospital. <br /> <br /> All in all, a movie that is a good lesson in life. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be on the top 250.
