The episode begins with scenes of a dead bather on the shore, a lost Jim wandering along the beach in daydreams, and a night drive home ending in murder and mystery. Yes, this is an atmospheric little number with a super-twist in the end. Jim is well advised to unravel what a priori is an inexplicable case in which a woman is missing 20 seconds after entering her home. The final explanation, however, is a bit far-fetched. Why, for example, so much time was spent on replacing a woman half way through a car ride, if she simply rubs her AND her companions, would have been just as easy and left fewer marks. Aside from these Niggles, this is a memorable TRF episode full of inventions, even if Jim is getting put back in the middle by an ever-suspicious police department. How many of their files have been solved by dear old Jimbo?
