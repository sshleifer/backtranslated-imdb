"Christmas in Connecticut" is an absolute gem and a must for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, a precursor to Martha Stewart, is a columnist for a magazine and the ultimate plus for housewives - the perfect woman, mother, and house goddess. The only thing is that she is not one of those things - a total scam. Unfortunately, she is about to find out. Their publisher, Mr. Alexander Yardley (a brilliant comic turn of Sydney Greenstreet), comes up with the idea of ​​inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeth's "perfect farm" for the Christmas holidays. Only, there is no farm, "perfect" or otherwise. The comedy is about how Elizabeth keeps her true identity, so she does not lose her job. Elizabeth's colleague John happens to have a farm in Connecticut to solve this problem. He wants to marry Liz, but she does not want to marry him. He offers her marriage, although he knows she does not have the same feelings with him as he does. He makes the offer anyway and assures her that he is ready to wait. And here, as Liz, Barbara Stanwyck delivers one of the most devastating defeats I've ever heard. With perfect innocence, she replies: "Could you wait so long?" OUCH! In addition, the scenes between Una O'Conner and S.Z. Sakall are funny. They do not seem to like each other (though they suspect they're really doing it). They are rivals in the household and S.Z. Sakall's mutilated English is offset by Nora's strangled pronunciation of his name (Mr. Basternook). "My name is Felix!" It's amazing how Christmas these black and white films are. Great character work from all involved. Do not miss these!
