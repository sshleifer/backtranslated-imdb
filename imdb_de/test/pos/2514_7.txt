A boring title disguises this solid carved example of old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment. This film proves a largely successful mix of several different elements: a historical play, a romantic drama, a detective story and a political thriller. Interestingly, although made by Fox, his protagonist? Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck? were usually associated with other studios; Her chemistry on screen is palpable and led to marriage in a few years. While Taylor is a little too young, he's an insane hero (a Marine personally appointed by President McKinley to find the culprits behind an organized reorganization of numerous banks). Not surprisingly, he barely tracked them down (led by the slick Brian Donlevy and the crazy Victor McLaglen), that he falls in love with a Chanteuse (of course Stanwyck), who threw her lot with the gang? Although the truth is told, singing is far from being the strength of the actress! Similarly, not only does he have to prove his worth, but he must also fight with McLaglen for Stanwyck's attention. Incidentally, the practical joker personality of the first reminded me of Charley Chase in SÖSEN DER WÜSTE (1933), which incidentally was also directed by William A. Seiter. Later, Taylor has doubts about implicating Stanwyck in the upcoming bait and is trying to offer the president his resignation while struggling with the girl? but the jealous rival disturbs his plans. The robbery went awry, we find Donlevy dead and the other two in jail; Taylor hopes for McKinley's intervention? In the meantime, have learned the identity of the elusive and obviously prominent "inner man"? are seemingly beaten if the president murders himself (a big conspiracy of the plot, although the resulting eleventh hour feels dizziness)! To return to the film's quirk of style, even though the variety sequences are a matter of taste, the romantic triangle slows things down and detracts somewhat from the thriller aspect, this actually does produce a nice production. with the aforementioned actors supported by John Carradine (who disappears beyond recognition after one scene!), Douglas Fowley, Sig Rumann, and two American Presidents Sidney Blackmer (the vivacious Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy (McKinley).
