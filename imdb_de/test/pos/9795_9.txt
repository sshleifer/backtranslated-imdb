"Radio Flyer" is one of my favorite American movies. <br /> <br /> The really great job of two boys, Joe Mazzello and Elija Wood (despite the awful performance of T.Hanks at the beginning and end.) ... with wonderful DMEvans script and powerful and emotional directing by R.Donner plus Absolutely unbelievable music score by H.Zimmer allowed the "Radio Flyer" to win one of the first places in the movie review of my family. It is a pity that this very good movie was underestimated by some movie critics. <br /> <br /> I can not help but wait for DVD.
