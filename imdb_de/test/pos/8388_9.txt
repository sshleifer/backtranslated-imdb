Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gorgeous. Inglorious Basterds builds on the framework of The Dirty Dozen and digs the lengthy training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to immerse themselves in the action right away. In doing so, Tarantino fixes one of Dirty Dozen's biggest mistakes by giving the bad guys time to remind us how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time will end up becoming the most humane characters in the film, ironically making them even worse monsters. <br/> <br /> If you skip the training sequences, Tarantino can also give us a picture of the entire war, which not only shows us British, American and German soldiers, but also insights into the world of French and German civilians, both Collaborators as well as Resistance, offers. Tarantino goes without saying The film will have a fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino made the decision that the French characters speak French and the Germans speak German, apart from a certain degree of authenticity, Tarantino has somehow ensured that his dialogue in French as sharp and witty and wise as English dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this example, the Nazi hunter Hans Landa (Christian Waltz), the Nazi hunter, interviews the French dairy breeder Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite hides a family of Jews. While Landa presses LaPadite subtly, he asks for a glass of milk. After Landa greedily swallowed her down, Landa congratulated LaPadite on his daughters and his cows. In French, "vache" means cow, but it's also a vulgar name for the vagina. If Landa was reprimanded for this vulgar pun, he could argue quite convincingly that he did not understand French well enough to put it that way. And LaPadite understands its meaning only too well. <br /> <br /> This is a really subtle play and pun that many viewers would never capture or at least understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The movie is so detailed. All French and English dialogues are chosen with the same attention to detail, and although I can not swear to the German, I would guess that he has a similar level of craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> Inglorious Basterds begins with the phrase, "Once upon a time ... in Nazi-occupied France." Personally, that reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and movie, another comic fantasy in a war-torn occupied France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is very funny in places, though the movie gets dark too. <br /> <br /> In its more serious moments, Inglorious Basterds recalls that the first victims of the war are compassion and the ability to relax. As in almost any lengthy film sequence, Tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tensions on almost unbearable levels , <br /> <br /> Tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous, even flammable, and that its power deserves respect. <br /> <br /> If you can watch this movie as I did in a crowded theater with interesting fans making a joke, you'll see this masterful movie the way it should. If you're not so lucky, you'll just see a great, great movie that delivers a hilarious punch.
