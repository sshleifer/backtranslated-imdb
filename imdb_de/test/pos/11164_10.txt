I have just seen this movie in a preview and can only recommend it. It was about 90 minutes and when it was over, I felt it could take hours. The stories of the protagonists are so realistic and you really feel at home. The movie basically consists of dialogues, but I was not bored for a minute. 18 people with very different characters and each of them has done so well. I had to laugh, felt awkward, was sad, and still felt happy. All in all, it is a film that shows the different types of people in our society, how they communicate and how love has changed and is now treated as an economic matter. Dating becomes something akin to an audition. The entire audience loved it. So please be careful if there is a possibility. You will love it!
