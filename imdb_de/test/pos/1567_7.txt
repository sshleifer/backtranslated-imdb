There is not much to the story. A young woman steals some money from the desolate Vermont supermarket she works in, decides to flee to Florida, where he dreams to go to school with her friend Julie, and encounters a strange couple on the highway. If you remember the older couple from "Rosemary's Baby," you have an idea of ​​what those two look like. Bill has a funny face and left the army. Sandra is an ex-stripper who has now become a truckstop whore, although we can not find out right away. They are loving, helpful and with common sense. <br /> <br /> They more or less accept the girl Alice and promise to take her in her sophisticated camper, even though she does not drive directly to Florida. <br /> <br /> Here the film could be 100 percent crooked The filmmakers just had to make the older couple personify the evil, they took the virgin Alice (handcuffed to the bed or whatever) and sold her body to every Greaseball rider who has lots of money and loves hard sex (Alice would have had an escape with many aborted attempts before the final shootout.) But no, the couple is really nice, and Alice is anything but virginal Alice listens to Sandra with a customer, asks about the deal, and tries herself Bill does not want anything to happen, and insists she does the job right, if she's going to do it at all, they do not persuade her she. <br /> <br /> Alice earns several hundred dollars, which is several hundred dollars more than she had met. Bill and Sandra keep their money in the safe where the customers will not find it. Alice understands it wrong. She does not find whores a very pleasant job, and she thinks she never gets paid, because every time she's asked to be dropped off, Sandra says, "What, not here, honey, not in the middle of nowhere." However, after being persuaded to hand over the weapon to Sandra, the couple gives her the money she wants and releases her rather lovingly to continue her trip to Florida. Moment in the movie? It had nothing to do with prostitution or theft. Alice expected to book a room with her friend Julie after she arrived in Miami. After all, Julie is a legitimate student. But when Alice calls her friend from somewhere in Alabama to reassure herself that she's on her way but comes too late, Julie hesitates and says, "Well, my mother does not think you should stay with us, my roommate It's not cool, either, I invited you, sure, but I thought it would be like a visit for a week or so ... Go back to Milford, Alice "There's a long silence before Alice hangs up. <br /> Only one shot is fired (some white movie images) and no one is hit. Tears only appear once. Nobody hits others. In a fireball no car explodes. No cop chases them down the interstate. <br /> <br /> The direction is sometimes awkward. Too much cross-section between Sandra trying to disarm Alice and Alice's hand holding the staggering pistol. There are hardly any music notes. There is short male and female nudity and it is uncomfortable as it should be. Alice is not unattractive, but she's not shabby either. It has Asian eyes, a kind of robust version by Molly Parker. The cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out. The direction is an uncomplicated story with some lighting flashbacks. Nothing is wasted. And everything around Danbury, Connecticut, was apparently filmed. The city remains in my memory because I drove through the city after a flood and remembered the cars with mud film to the door handles. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Alice found (I'm even afraid that the answer to the puzzle is that she found herself.) Acting is not bad at all. Judith Ivey is better than that. It's definitely worth seeing, a quiet, orderly film that treats the audience like adults.
