One day I found The Last Stop in a video store and they sold it for only $ 2. I decided to give it a try and bought it. It was pretty good, I enjoyed it. The story is about several people caught in the middle of nowhere because of a furious blizzard. There is a policeman, nancy, his ex-girlfriend, two brothers who have just come out of prison, an older man and his lover, a black man and the couple who own the cabins, and their reunited son who never speaks. Suddenly it is found that someone is being murdered and a bag of cash is found. Everyone is suspicious. The Last Stop is a pretty good thriller, I would give it 8/10
