This existential thriller, in Portuguese with English subtitles, is a modern version of the American Noires of the 40s with a surprising twist at the end. It is fascinating from beginning to end. My only criticism is the bad production values. The movie looks cheap, and that was probably the case. Therefore, Godard's black-and-white cinematography is far inferior to Vivre Sa Vie to cite another Film Noir over thirty years ago. Most subtitles are often hard to read. When do filmmakers learn yellow subtitles so they can be read against a white background. I would give a total of 8, although it could have been higher with better production values.
