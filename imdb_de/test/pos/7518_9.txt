Everyone who goes to the Manhattan Hospital Center takes their lives into their hands. This includes the staff of the hospital. I had never seen the hospital before, and I was intrigued by how similar the characters and situations of the conspiracy were to this other Paddy Chayefsky masterpiece, Network. There are elements in George C. Scott's character that both Al Schumacher's and Howard Beales have. <br /> <br /> He is the administrator of the hospital and he is crazy and will not take it anymore. He is completely alienated from his wife and children. It takes a character from Faye Dunaway in the person of Diana Rigg to snap it out. A role in the hay with her and he is shocked back to reality and the fact that he can still contribute to the world. <br /> <br /> But first he has a real problem. Someone kills hospital staff, four of them within 48 hours. And the beauty of it is that her death is largely attributable to the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy. This is where the comedy comes into play. <br /> <br /> In the person of Barnard Hughes, Diana Riggs father, there is a real Howard Beale figure. His ending is not quite as dramatic as that of Beale. <br /> <br /> Back then, it was part of my job to pay for medical suppliers. Some of them could be as big monsters as they are displayed in the hospital. The black comedy satire had something snappy for me. George C. Scott was nominated for Best Actor, but after winning and not accepting the previously awarded Oscar for Patton, he did not get a second chance. He lost to Gene Hackman for The French Connection. Nevertheless, his handling of the role is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to look at The Hospital back to back with Network and see how many similarities you notice.
