I saw the movie on May 1, 2003 at the Nashville Film Festival! It was wonderful! All the things I read about Stuey were unbelievably well presented by Tony Vidmer (writer, director, producer, publisher), Michael Imperioli (incredible work as Stuey), and everyone else involved. I am glad that he (Vidmer) did not take Stuey's bad habits in the routine "Leaving Las Vegas", but instead stuck in his life, his family and his gift. Tying the story from the motel room he died in was a great vehicle and showed his ability as a scriptwriter. A big "thumbs up" to this!
