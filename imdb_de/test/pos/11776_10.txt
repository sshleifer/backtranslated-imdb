<br /> <br /> Fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid. This short parody is at least as much part of the Star Wars saga as Phantom Menace and far more entertaining if you ask me. Hardware Wars was the first in a long line of SW parodies, which today form their own subgenre. I hate to describe it too much - it's so brief that the premise is about the whole thing. Suffice to say that many of the most popular and well-known aspects of Star Wars have been fun. Domestic appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners show spaceships and robots, the figure of Princess Anne-Droid wears real buns instead of the famous braided hair, and Fluke Starbucker is even a dork if not possible. Ernie Fosselius is a crazy son of a bitch - he is also the source of Porklips Now, the parody of Apocalypse Now.
