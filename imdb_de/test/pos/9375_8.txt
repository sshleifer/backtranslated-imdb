A bigoted soldier kills a man for being a Jew and tries to attach him to a fellow soldier. Not as good as the novel he's based on ("The Brick Foxhole") in which a gay man was killed ... but Hollywood did not want to touch that in 1947. Anti-Semitism is handled very well, but the public is of the opinion that bigotry is bad ... well, duh! However, this was 1947. The picture is well represented by the entire cast (especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan) and the sound is very dark as it should be. Very atmospheric too. A deserved big hit of its time ... worth seeing.
