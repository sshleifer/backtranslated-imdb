A documentation about a nomad tribe in Tibet going to a dry lake to get salt does not sound very appealing. However, this is not a popcorn movie, but a visual cultural festival where you participate in a quick-disappearing bite of humanity. Superstition, epic songs and poems, the faith of a people who truly believe in following their own unique patterns of life is something that the West had in Homer's time, but unfortunately that is unfamiliar to most of us today We have lost the spiritual serenity that results from following established patterns of life that often have fatal consequences in our increasingly soulless society, and the filmmakers have woven us intimately into the fabric of these materially poor but spiritually rich and dirty saltmars And let us see that life was more than a shopping mall and pop culture, so disconnect your landlines, turn off your cells, turn off the lights of the driveway, and sit back for a timeless adventure.
