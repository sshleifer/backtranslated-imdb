Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are as brilliant as Sir and his dresser. Of course, the piece is brilliant from the beginning and nothing can be compared to the immediacy and collegiality of the theater, and I think you hear better in the theater. But on the screen we become more familiar, we are closer than in the theater, we experience subtle changes in expression, we "see" better and listen. Both the play and the movie are wondrous: moving, intelligent, enlightening - from the backstage story of the company, from the historical context, from the two main characters and from the parallel characters in "Lear" itself. If you do not see it in a theater can (I can not imagine that it is produced much nowadays), please do yourself a favor and get the video.
