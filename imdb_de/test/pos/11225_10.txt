It is a rare and beautiful spectacle, an allegory of death and transfiguration that is neither preaching nor Mawkish. Northfork is a work of mature and courageous insight that avoids artefact discrimination by refusing to be a species. In contrast to the most memorable and accomplished film, which compels an obvious comparison, Wim Wenders' 'The Sky over Berlin' 1987 holds an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum that extends from the everyday to the supernatural. This story of earthly and heavenly dominions in the American West follows the fairy-tale spelling that characterizes her German predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels who cast their wings with submissive sentimentalism. His heavenly transcendence, whether driven by a sad faith or by a feverish dream, never separates from coarse and rottenness. This company is a great merit to the writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish.
