This is definitely an outstanding musical from 1944 with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of Charles Vidor. Rita Hayworth (Rusty Parker), "Charlie Chan in Egypt", sang and danced with Gene Kelly, (Danny McGuire), "Anchors Away," Danny McGuire, who owned a nightclub in Brooklyn, New York, and was in love with Rusty Parker Dancer in his club, along with Phil Silvers (Genius), "Coney Island," who was in this image the comedian and also worked with Danny, Rusty and danced. Otto Kruger (John Coudair), "Duel in the Sun", played the role of promoter of a Cover Girl magazine and decided that Rusty Parker would become his top model. Jerome Kern's music can be heard throughout the picture and the song "Long Ago & Far Away" is the theme music for this musical. This film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during World War II, which kept people from the war that was going on at that time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were an immediate hit and their career exploded on the screen for many years. Great musical and a movie you do not want to miss is really a great classic movie. Enjoy
