I am not a golf fan. At around 10:30 pm on May 26th, the movie began with a scene in the late 19th century. Old movies that I like but no golf, in the first scene a little boy (Harry Vardon) is awakened by the voices of the men. He goes outside to ask what they are doing and they tell them they're going to do some golf ... So, I turned off the TV, but something touched me and it was on again. The movie is excellent. We now see this boy as a man; professional golfer who is followed with visions from childhood. Then we meet the true focus of the film Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet his mother and father, who want to protect him from the lesson thing that is so obvious during this time. Then there's little Eddie Lowery, his caddy, with encouraging words and small spurts that are crucial to winning Francis. I do not want to betray too much. I was until 2 o'clock in the morning. That's great please see the movie.
