Stephanie Meyer will be so excited! Now her book "Breaking Dawn" will not come first with this title. Sorry, Twilight fans. <br /> <br /> Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is a medical student, Eve, who is assigned to interview the psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I had the suspicion, and when she found out that they both had grown up in the same city, I was sure. She was getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point where I felt a split delusion continued. Sometimes she behaved as if she had PTSD. I really thought she would lose it. <br /> <br /> Well, she did not lose it, and when the end came, I was down. My whole suspicion turned out to be wrong. The phrase was even more amazing than I thought. Overton was fantastic and the story is so much better than what Stephanie Meyer would imagine. Something you must have seen.
