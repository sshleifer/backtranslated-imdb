This solid black-and-white slapstick comedy with a dark (but hopelessly fictional) plot is a real crowd pleaser that will make you cry with laughter (and roll your eyes in disbelief). <br /> <br /> It's the old psychopath in a train history, but that's not of much importance, since the thriller part of the movie seems almost a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian Robert Gustafsson. His unfortunate, almost incurably optimistic soldier evokes both compassion and glee in a manner that is almost equivalent to Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> The thing about the film that appeals to me the most is the one between the improbable and the improbable. The weird are the well-described everyday pleasures and troubles of the train journey. They add a very welcome feeling of realism and appreciation. <br /> <br /> This thriller comedy has borrowed most of its "suspense" from Hitchcock and in my opinion should only be watched on its comedy value (which is high indeed). Besides Gustafsson, Lars Amble's solid performance as a delightful cynical misogynist alone is worth the price of the recording. <br /> <br /> Recommended by heart.
