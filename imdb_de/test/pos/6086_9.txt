It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see "The English Patient" after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his work is dedicated to a harrowing point. The endless moral struggle of those who deliberately go a very narrow line. In "The Talented Mr. Ripley," Minghella walks away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In "Breaking And Entry," Minghella gives Jude Law's character the urge to confess, and the rewards move coolly. Here in "The English Patient" the love figures are never too far from their corroding guilt feelings. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are exceptional. They undress their characters in any compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is just spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a "Minghellian" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were, in one way or another, that elusive mixture of art and commerce. He was faithful, but thought about his audience. He knew how to press our buttons without betraying his own. Minghella's opus is clear, honest and amazing. I already miss him, but I am grateful for the reflection of his left-behind soul.
