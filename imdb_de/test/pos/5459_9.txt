The Late Shift is a great book. I read the book a few years ago. I was in the damned debauchery when Johnny Carson retired, and Jay Leno and Johnny Carson tried to take his place. When the movie came out, I grabbed a VHS copy of the movie, and after reading the book recently, it's hard to say what I enjoy more because they're pretty much the same in the amount of information they've shared. The two leading actors, John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, two actors I have never heard of and have not heard of since, convince Leno and Letterman, even though Letterman rejects his portrayal as poor. They play the roles quite well, although many people are looking for an imitation of the two. I did not care that much. The story is important. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates, playing Helen Kushnick, IS this movie. She plays this evil bitch of a character, so threatening that you realize how this woman can control herself, let alone a national television program. Yikes! There should be a sequel !!
