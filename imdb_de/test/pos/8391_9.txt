While I agree with Drvn below that Mary McCormack is flying a milk bag on TV, the rest of the show is awesome! Phil Hartman was great and taught the celebrities the ins and outs. Foley is a nut, but in a good way. You never know with what self-deprecating humor he will come next. As far as the game is concerned, it's entertaining, full of funny bantering and great for any newcomer who may even have an interest in the game. Too bad it's not working anymore :( I've checked all the way through to August and do not seem to be planning in the future Bad Bravo!
