It stopped me on the edge of the seat. There are a few storylines in the story, but the tension that the director keeps questioning is simply fascinating. José Coronado and Adriana Ozores are two of the best actors in Spain (see La vida mancha and Héctor) and here they appear as a happy upper middle class couple. The truth is that the whole life of Coronado is a lie. He is not an economist, has never attended college, or does not work in the Spanish central bank reserve, as everyone else believes. We get a glimpse of how it seems or how it manages to do it, and although it's not very plausible, it's still believable credible because Coronado is a source of confidence and assertiveness. Not only does he believe in the fraud, he also believes in the film premise, and that's why he wears it. Sure, it tests the belief that a woman would almost not know the inner workings of a marriage 10 years, but again, as he is supposedly a brilliant economist. In a nationalist tone, it was said that the film is not "uniquely Spanish", as if this was a litmus test forever movie. True, no castanets or queer Kabbys in this, just a tense thriller. You want to know how this story ends as soon as you start looking.
