When I saw this movie for the first time, I just thought "what the hell?" a 10-year-old kid who drives bizarre places, meets bizarre people and pursues a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yes! I really liked this movie! <br /> <br /> Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped acting. He interprets his character Gus in the film very well. <br /> <br /> Gus loses an eye, gets tattoos and goes to the craziest cities where he plays with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? <br /> <br /> OK, do not even try to understand the story, but why does this movie need one? Just open your mind and let Gus take you on this journey. <br /> <br /> "Motorama Gus, you won Motorama"
