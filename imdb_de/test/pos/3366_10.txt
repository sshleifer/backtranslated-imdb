There's nothing obvious about this Perry and Croft masterpiece - as good as one of the best episodes, fortunately it was shot in time before the late James Beck died to be included in his talent br /> It shows from the beginning, how the train is formed from the national emergency and the guys under Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and Sergeant Wilson (John Le Mesurier) are as incapable as they normally go through the series. <br /> <br /> On the way, Mainwaring makes its usual longing for authority, but the boys can not help but abandon it at every opportunity, at war games, and in suspected invasion. However, they have a chance in the film to save themselves if they actually capture the Nazi airmen who take the church hostage. That was a nice finale, especially since Mainwaring proved to the general, one last chance to shape up. A great movie, lots of good lines and laughs, it's another one for the DVD cabinet - I'm glad that the BBC repeats it - and on that day 2.8.08 they rightly had the "Dad Army Night". Not to miss!
