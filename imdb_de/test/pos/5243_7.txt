John Wayne is one of the few players in film history who failed on his first big break and then succeeded the second time. Of course everyone knows that for the second time the classic stagecoach was directed by John Ford. <br /> <br /> But we are here to talk about The Big Trail. The director of John Ford, Raoul Walsh, discovered this big kid on the set of one of Ford's films and thought he had potential. He wanted Fox to star in a Western budget. The planned film would be a tribute to the famous Western classic The Covered Wagon. <br /> <br /> Looking at The Big Trail, I noticed how similar Wayne's character from Breck Coleman is here to the Ringo Kid in Stagecoach. Both characters were sympathetic young cowpokes, but both also had a mission of revenge. And of course, both films were shot on location and show the cost of their production. No studio product here with western background. <br /> <br /> I also do not think it was a coincidence that Wayne got this break at the beginning of the sound era. I think Raoul Walsh looked around Hollywood and probably did not think that a lot of movie cowboys would have a lasting sound. That's something else Walsh discovered in Wayne. <br /> <br /> According to what I read The Big Trail, it flopped, because after spending all the money to shoot the film in an early widescreen process, some geniuses at Fox recognized this Their theaters were not equipped with a widescreen to show it. And when the global economic crisis broke out, there would be no money to expand these screens in Fox cinemas. So The Big Trail got a limited release, even in a form we would call a formatted version, and lost money on Fox movies. <br /> <br /> Marguerite Churchill is doing well again by Ian Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens and F. Tyrone Power are the trio of villains Wayne struggles with. <br /> <br /> F. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous movie legend Tyrone Power. He was a big stocky man with a great background in classical roles on the screen and on stage. I would not be surprised if his son, who was 15 years old at the time, did not hang around the set. <br /> <br /> Also look for Ward Bond, though you may have difficulty finding Bart under a large bush. <br /> <br /> If you look at The Big Trail, it's interesting to speculate on where John Wayne's career might have been if The Big Trail had been a great success.
