As a previous reviewer said, Travolta stole every scene he was in. Do you recognize the character? It was Vinnie Barberino, very grown up and still a bit run down, but still sympathetic, oh yes! <br /> <br /> Disappointing were William Hurt and Bob Hoskins, perhaps because their characters were poorly written or simply did not care. I kept seeing one of the Baldwins (can never remember which one) in the Hurt Roll, so Hurt's incredible talents were not wasted. <br /> <br /> Andie McDowell is a sweetheart but not very believable. partly the writing. The character development was simply no big deal in this movie. Just watch Travolta, sit back and enjoy it.
