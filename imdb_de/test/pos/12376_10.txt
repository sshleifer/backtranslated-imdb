Okay, that was not what I expected. I rented this movie just to see what it would be like to watch the first one anyway. But this movie had B-movie everywhere. When I saw it, I realized that it was very funny. In the first 30 minutes It was just like the snowman kiiling people and a man losing his mind. But the first few minutes had some funny liners. As he whirled the first of his little henchmen, I knew it would be very funny. They all behave like the Gremlins in the eighty-four hit Gremlins. They looked like they were faking them and made me forget that it was a B-movie. So if you like to laugh, rent them here.
