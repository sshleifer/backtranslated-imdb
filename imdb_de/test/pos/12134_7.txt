Has anyone ever read or heard comments from Scorsese or David Chase (Soprano's Exec Producer) on Death Collector / Family Enforcer? I bought the DVD after not seeing it for a while on cable (like 20 years), but seeing "Goodfellas" and all the "sopranos" until today. In retrospect, both guys must have seen the Death Collector / Family Enforcer and taken in the taste, perhaps inspiring the tone for their masterpieces, which are both the polar opposite of the romanticized godfather trilogy. As a jersey type, it's interesting to see how Jersey's grasslands have developed since the mid-1970s. It is not the boggy garbage dump that it used to be, though now and then a corpse will appear in a local waterway. It's also a bit bittersweet when you see a newly built World Trade Center on the other side of the river in the opening and closing scenes. Who could have imagined it?
