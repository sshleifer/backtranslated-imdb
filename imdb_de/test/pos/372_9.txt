If I look at this movie again, he is one of the best films by Hitchcock. The first time I saw it, I was overwhelmed by the excitement, the action and the images. It has the gripping end, the confused murderer, the innocent man framed by the circumstances or sacrificed, some great shots on the spot, e.g. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. It also has great support for actors with Hitch's daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister of Ruth Roman and the brave Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock films. The carousel episode at the end is one of the most nerve-wracking works in Hitchcock's work. Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony (his last full-length movie) delivers a great performance when disturbed is a stranger on the train interfering in the life of the unsuspecting tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger). Granger plays the nice guy who is in a messy divorce. The film begins with the camera showing the shoes of two separated men as they leave their taxis to board the train. Eventually they meet and the story takes over. The stranger is unusually interested in the tennis star, and as the movie continues, the stranger becomes a stalker. The action shifts from place to place, including Washington, the fictional town of Metcalf, the Forest Hills tennis championship and a passenger train that carries the two leading men back and forth on separate missions. Towards the end of time, the pace of a tennis match is spun into the storyline. The camera cuts off the faces of the athletes as they play and serve volleyball in a remarkable series of punches. When the highly competitive competition is over, the hunt takes place. Hitchcock has a penchant for trains and it's great to see Penn Station, which has long gone. Trains are seen in the 39 steps, the Lady Vanishes, Shadow of a Doubt, Spellbound, North by Northwest and this movie. <br /> <br /> This classic Hitchcock thriller was the beginning of a period of great excitement for the Master of Suspense - in the '50s, and I'm sure it will one day take its toll in the Hitchcock Hall of Fame ,
