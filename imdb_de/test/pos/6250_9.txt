I love this movie! When I saw this movie on TV when I was a kid, that scared the hell out of me. Probably because mannequins frighten me too. chuck Connors is awesome as Mr.Slausen. I'm glad he played such a different role. The other actors in this movie are great too! Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Robin Sherwood (Eileen) are great actresses and I hope to see them in future films, especially in Jocelyn Jones! <br /> <br /> So if you love spooky movies but like the same old thing, watch this movie!
