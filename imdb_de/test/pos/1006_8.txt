[UNCOVERED SPOILERS !!!] <br /> <br /> Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. They basically had no life at all. Everything they did was lying around and counting the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer for color and fabric. He needed a life. So he consults a book on the subject saying he should meet a woman. A single bar was a great starting point. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon entered the dance floor, we see what made the disco die: Jon killed her. Next, Jon tried to pick up girls in the video store. In the end, he felt in his mouth. Literally. The laundrette was also not priced when Jon and his future date got a glimpse of each other's underwear. Jon tried to do anything on the beach, but soon he annoyed a real guy who made Jon feel like he was in his mouth again. Literally. Jon then tried to track down girls who walked by and jogged. No success Jon pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately, when he mentioned that his cat was fat, a fat man stepped on Jon's guitar. It was hopeless. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Jon, an ad flashed on television: an ad for Lorenzo's school for disabled people. It guaranteed a lifeless person to lead a life in a few simple steps. Jon and Garfield attend the class. The building did not look exactly like it did on TV, and Lorenzo did not look as smart as on TV. Jon was sitting next to a pretty girl named Mona. While Lorenzo taught his lessons, how to introduce himself, checked his pulse and pretending to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona get to know each other. They go together and forget about Garfield. At home, Jon and Mona were just sitting on the porch, talking. Garfield was jealous of Mona for fear she would take Jon away from him. Garfield envisioned the future: Jon and Mona marry, she moves in and soon she gives birth to a little Arbuckle, who is overjoyed to tell Garfield's story. Back in the present Garfield would not stand for it. He tried to get Jon to get rid of Mona until she scratched behind his ears. Then Jon learned that Mona was allergic to cats. So that was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other, and Garfield was safe with them. <br /> <br /> Another funny Garfield TV special! This was done during the run of TV's Garfield and Friends. Garfield was slimmed down a bit. Something. Cartoons since the early 1980s. The scenes in which Jon tries to pick up chicks are funny, as is the one where the fat man encounters Jon's guitar. Good old Lorenzo Music has returned as Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (the third man with 1,000 votes) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (The Woman With 1,000 Voices) is Mona. If you like Garfield, I suggest you check out Garfield Gets A Life today! Together with Here Comes Garfield and Garfield on the Town they have just been released on DVD! So look at everyone today! You are guaranteed a good time. Hey, has Garfield ever disappointed you? <br /> <br /> -
