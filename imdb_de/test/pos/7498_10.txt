For those unfamiliar with Paddy Chayefsky, this is a very good introduction. While Chayefsky grapples with the reality behind the myths of many things, including medicine, this work is surprisingly prophetic of today's development of medicine, two decades after the creation of the film and more than a decade after its death. In addition, some insights into Chayefsky's view of life are generally "pushed" into the film. The 20th century may prove to be the first and last century of the United States in the history of the world. If it turns out that the United States contribution to the arts was in the dimension of "film," this is a prime example of this art.
