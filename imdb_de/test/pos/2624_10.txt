This film has been remembered for years as one of the best movie mysteries I have made for television. The spectacle is great. I have seen it twice and am still confused in some places. I would like to have a copy so that I can play certain parts over and over again. I'm interested in buying a copy of this movie, but I can not find it anywhere. I've tried E-Bay, Amazon.com, Internet searches, and am completely frustrated. I did not see it at Turner Classic Movies or American Movie Classics, and even put flyers in our community and asked if anyone had a copy.
