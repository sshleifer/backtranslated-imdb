It is quite obvious that many of your nights have been spent alone. If you had watched five minutes of the actual show instead of watching the commercial, you would have seen one of the biggest television programs in Canadian history. It's a pity you saw it alone. Probably the reason you hate it ... no game. The keys to the VIP are funny, light and funny. Guys will eat this show. My game is in short supply and I can not wait to participate in this show. The chicks were HOOOOOT and the clubs kicked their asses. I will watch every week. I wonder why such great shows like these are not made. Now it's clear that the talent in Canada has the ability to produce American-quality television.
