It's sometimes difficult to watch subtitled movies (in this case Danish), but it's well worth watching. As the story progresses, the rationale for choosing two sisters to look after their father is questionable, but their society is different. Her choice leaves her alone until a French woman comes. It may be a question of why the Frenchwoman came to her whereabouts, and this is never fully developed. The festival, which later comes from unexpected means in France, is an unusual pleasure for all involved and something they have not experienced before. It is a fitting thank you for the friendliness of the guest. Filmed with a dark aura and depiction of poverty this is a wonderful experience for the viewer.
