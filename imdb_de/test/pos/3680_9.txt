This movie is the most moving and funny movie I have seen in a long time. As a housewife ("housewife") and fan (Rupert), I found that likeable. Anyone who misinterprets Dirk's angry outburst has a mistake. Kathy Bates is not really an actress that I know, but she is perfect, the whole cast is perfect for her roles. Julie Andrews was sewing me. I look at it after reading Rupert's autobiography, so taking her more fun. It sometimes moves awfully. I'm not really a fan of the kind of music in the movie, but you are attracted to the romance and find out that you sing the songs for days on scene includes Dirk and a gun and his pants, watch and see you!
