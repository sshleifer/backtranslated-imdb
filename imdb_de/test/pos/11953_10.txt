I really love everything that Savage Steve Holland, the author / director of this great movie, did. See also "Better Off Dead" and "How I got into college". Wonderful! Nevertheless, this movie is very funny and delivers unexpected things. Where else but in this movie can you see Demi Moore as a talented singer and Bobcat Golthwait as a twin? I recommend it to anyone looking for an old-fashioned slapstick comedy, not to mention a really well-written sarcasm (the Christmas tree on the roof of the car). This movie keeps throwing you unexpected things, even if you've seen it 100 times like me! Enjoy!
