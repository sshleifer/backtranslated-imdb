Love and war were on the other side of the Iron Curtain, and by looking at them, love was as strong as in the West, and war was often more poignant (should I be more realistic?). <br /> <br /> This film is about war and love as well as about the Soviet thaw from the time of Mr. K. It also reminds us that the best war movies are not necessarily rivers in the 1990s of hemoglobin and millions of dollars were made for special effects and marketed actors. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic of Soviet cinema and an outstanding image of one of the greatest human tragedies: war. <br /> <br />
