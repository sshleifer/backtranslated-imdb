This was / is an incredible movie, with incredible cast, music, song, story, etc. It's a tragedy that some arrogant families (the Gerswhins or Premingers) can prevent it from being available generation by generation. I wanted to see it again all my life. I just found this page and read why it was not available. Shame on these families for their pettiness. My wife is from Germany and has never seen the movie before. Neither my stepchildren nor my grandchildren. It is very sad that a film of this depth and quality is not available for them. Where do these families come from to make such a conceited, self-determined, selfish, condescending decision to ban generations from enjoying this movie, these stars, these performances, this music! Let the video go and let them judge and enjoy the world!
