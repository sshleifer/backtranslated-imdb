I saw a TV movie about the destruction in Waco, Texas. Obviously, the claim was that David Koresh was a murderous, raped cult leader who tended to kill as many police as he wanted and send his people to heaven on a blood-stained staircase. > The film was little more than propaganda that described in detail what we had already read in the papers. I've been more and more confident since watching the great documentary Waco: The Rules of Engagment. Not that every allegation made in this film should be considered God's truth, but it tells the whole story rather than just what the law enforcement agency has decided. For those who have forgotten, Koresh was the spiritual leader of the religious movement called The Branch Davidians. Charges for drug use, kidnapping, possession of illegal firearms and legal rape (I'm sure among other things) led to suspicion of local police and later to federal prosecution. In an attempt to issue a search warrant, the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) and the Clan participated in a shootout that left both sides dead and wounded. Then it was the federal office The Bureau of Investigation (FBI) participated in it. The communication between the two was lively, but collapsed. The FBI was preparing for an invasion by attacking the building with lightning grenades and gas. When the building burned to the ground and killed many people, including Koresh, the FBI rejected the responsibility that the "cult" inside must have set it on fire. This made pictures of Jim Jones and other violent religious organizations. <br /> <br /> The image puts on many masks to tell its story. It begins with a selection of congressional hearings, perhaps the "truth" as far as the recording is concerned. Eye-opening is how partisan the politicians also remained in a difficult and serious situation. The Democrats were concerned about nothing but defending every single prosecution. It was the Republicans who were open on the other side. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to describe all the new information and analysis contained in this documentary. Additionally, a list would take away from the movie opening if it goes on. An example would be the heartbreaking fact that children died on the grounds. The filmmakers tend to be close to the Davidians, but remain relatively open on both sides. In this case, the authorities seem to blame them for abusing a situation involving innocent children. On the other hand, parents also have to blame for bringing their children into this harmful situation when they could have given them to any number of local authorities. <br /> <br /> Probably the most damaging new information comes late in the movie and includes the FBI's claim that they did not shoot at the building. This is left to interpretation, and I will say nothing more than to say that it is disturbing and shocking what can and can not be said. The federal officials are not kept in a critical or corrupt light more than Koresh. The biggest condemnation seems to hit the media, as she is not ready to tell both sides of a story. This element seems to be prevalent in recent documentary films, in my opinion. It's time for the media to continue to tell news and abandon this relentless pursuit of what attracts the largest audience and highest ratings. <br /> <br /> It's hard to mess up a documentary. In most cases, it's common to turn on a camera and work on interesting parts of life, and it tells a terrific story. What few can do is shed such a new light on a topic that the way you think about it is changed forever. Waco is such a movie. *** 5 of ****
