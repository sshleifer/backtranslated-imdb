Hehehe This was one of the best funny road movies ever! I laughed and fell off the chair. Many Norwegian and foreign celebrities play themselves. Harald Zwart is the producer known for films like Agent Cody Banks and, of course, One Night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> It's about crazy Norwegian fans who went to the Football World Cup in Germany in 2006. And everything else of crazy fun that goes with it. It was funny. I could not stop laughing. I have not had so much fun for ages. Rumor has it will be number two, but I do not know. It will be hard to beat this one. <br /> <br /> recommended to everyone! It is a must see movie. I was supposed to see it in the cinema, but I had work at the time it was shown. And I've been trying to rent it for a month but rented it all the time. Got it on DVD today. It is worth it
