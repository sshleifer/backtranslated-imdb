I think this movie is the most misunderstood movie in Jerry Lewis' career. It's not very slow, but once it starts, it's very funny & Jerry's use of irony like never before in his earlier films a ridiculed Dirty Dozen, instead of turning death row soldiers into a suicide mission, as in this movie, there are 4, 4-f & 2 tags. Including the former All-Star Centerfielder of L. A. Dodgers, Willie Davis as Linc! HILARIOUS! Love this movie!
