I have just seen Jean Renoir's wonderful movie French Can Can. It's a visual treat and a great conversation. The recently produced Moulin Rouge fades in comparison. I have not received all the praise the last movie received. Now, more than ever, I'm convinced that my assessment was correct after seeing a filmmaker like Jean Renoir's version of the same story. He managed to achieve great performances from his entire cast, and the great French actor Jean Gabin was in rare form. The dance sequence in the end was one of the most exciting I've ever seen. It was a long time, but I did not want it to end. This movie deserves more recognition than it is.
