I have awarded 9 out of 10 points. I was in tears for most of the movie because I had to laugh. <br /> <br /> Of course the story was not excellent, but not boring either. Erkan & Stefan are to become bodyguards for the beautiful Nina. In this work, they are between the frontlines of BND and CIA. Of course, the two are neither bodyguards nor masters, so they run from disaster to catastrophe; and they do it in such a funny way that if you watch some scenes, you can not stop the tears! As actors, these two "stupidly grinning" characters are pretty good, better than some so-called professionals. <br /> <br /> Do you think the speech of the two heroes is strange or "pseudo-foreign"? If you hear so many Turkish-German people in Munich who speak the same way, you will remember Erkan & Stefan. And perhaps in ten years it has become the ordinary speech of the youth. (God forbids!) <br /> <br /> So if you want to laugh, watch this movie!
