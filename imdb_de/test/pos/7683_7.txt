I waited 30 years to see this movie. I played the soundtrack album as a teenager and in my 20s. I recently found a reasonably priced DVD drive that I saw this morning. It was in widescreen format, probably even a 70mm print, stereo, the colors were pretty good, hardly fading, certainly not remastered, but I am very pleased with this clean copy. Now for the movie. It is very good. I would not say it's great, though there are great scenes in it. Maybe Premminger was not the right director, but I say that. For me, the heart of the movie was the hurricane scene. Wonderfully staged by Premminger. One of the greatest weather scenes of all time. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would say that the drama scenes are better than the music scenes, not that the music sequences are bad. Not at all. They were missing ... something. Maybe it was the fact that there are no close-ups and very few medium settings. It was almost like filming a stage production. Maybe that was the feeling that Premminger was following. In the end it might not have been the right choice, but that's the way it works. It is anything but a ruined movie. <br /> <br /> Not everyone loves the singers on the soundtrack. I have always. They are perfect for this movie. I love the voices. The cast member clans are for the most part excellent. I only wish the songs were more resourceful. The two numbers from Sportin 'Life are fine, but the intimate numbers do not even feel intimate. They just feel ... far away. Nevertheless, you can not deny the power of music. And in the end this comes through clearly and clearly. Maybe that was what Premminger was trying to do to avoid the incredible music he was working with. I think he had the right idea, but maybe he went too far in that direction. <br /> <br /> The acting is great. Kudos to the great Brock Peters, who plays and sings the role of Crown. He is the ultimate agent. We just want him to leave poor Bess alone, and he does not. As proud, arrogant and evil as he is, the classic Sportin 'Life version of Sammy Davis Jr. is the sleek devil himself and a very charismatic one. Probably Davis' best movie act. Poor Bess just can not handle two bad men. I'm glad that Hermes gave Pan Davis a tap dance number. <br /> <br /> Dandridge and Poitier, who are supposedly unimpressed by the movie, are really very nice together. I know nothing about chemistry ... there was more chemistry between Dandridge and Peters than between Dandridge and Poitier. Still, it worked well for Dorothy and Sidney. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I think they should both be proud of the work they have done on this film. Both managed to bring more than a tear in my eye. Their characterizations were very 3D and believable. Sidney Poitiers Porgy, however, seems almost out of place in the catfish series. I could not help but think that he was Mr. Braithwaite in "To Sir with Love", very educated and good-natured and spoken and in difficult times. He probably would not have been my first choice for Porgy's role, but hey, he was a big star at the time, so why not? Dorothy's Bess was as perfect as her Carmen Jones, in fact even more vulnerable. Carmen was probably the more noticeable part for her. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, two strokes less than I would call it a classic. It just is not the ultimate classic. Nevertheless, there is no reason why the Gershwin Estate has decided to withhold this beautiful film from the public, despite all its shortcomings. As a director, Premminger may have made some strange decisions, but the film is nothing to be ashamed of and ashamed of for everyone involved. It's what it is and there are far worse movies than these that are embarrassing on DVD and in theaters today. Porgy and Bess are not among them.
