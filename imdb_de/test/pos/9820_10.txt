In this unlikely triangle, playing in nineteenth-century Italy, "The Beauty and the Beast" is turned upside down, and then some: Giorgio, an army officer and the image of male beauty, is taken away from him (married ) Lovers Clara and sent to a small garrison somewhere in Piedmont. There - at first much to his horror? Fosca, the grotesque ugly cousin of his commander, develops an obsessive love for him. He suffers from her passionate and demanding affection for compassion and concern for her health (she is seriously ill), but is increasingly fascinated by her. Do not miss this most unusual love story, as twisted as it may sound. Valeria d'Obici, who has rightly won a prize for her portrayal of Fosca, is as worrying as it touches.
