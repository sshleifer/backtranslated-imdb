After 20 years in China, a young missionary refuses to become THE CAT'S-PAW to become a band of hoodies in his hometown. This movie was a bit of a departure from the previous films of Harold Lloyd. The more out of dialogue comedy is often more serious than the distinctive gag that propelled Harold's classic past. There are, however, some great moments that make visual fun when Harold follows a convertible through a crowded street or desperately tries to keep a nightclub stripper from losing her clothes. There is also the climate scene in a Chinatown basement, where Harold jumps with pleasure into the darkest comedy. The humor comes, however, largely from Harold's refusal to be the criminal of the criminals who have been running his hometown for years. <br /> <br /> And there are a lot of crooked politicians and thugs confronting Harold by a bunch of fine character actors: George Barbier, Nat Pendleton, Grant Mitchell, Edwin Maxwell, Alan Dinehart, Warren Hymer and stuttering fuzzy Knight. Pert Una Merkel is present as a tobacco stand girl who draws Harold's eye and fascinates him with her straightforward attitude to life. <br /> <br /> Film lovers will recognize Samuel S. Hinds as Harold's mission father. Charles Sellon as senior Stockport clergyman; and Herman Bing as a German gangster - all uncredited. Even Noah Young, a familiar face from Harold's silent films, who appears as an attempted kidnapper for only a few seconds, appears here in a Lloyd picture. <br /> <br /> Fox gave the film a good production values, especially in the opening scenes in China.
