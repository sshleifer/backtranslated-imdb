This Norwegian film begins with a man jumping over the subway apparently committing suicide. However, the next scene shows him on a lonely bus in a desert. He meets a man and is shipped to a mysterious city where he works as an accountant in a modern, aseptic office. Colleagues seem to be nice, if they are kept, he soon meets a girlfriend, but the city looks very strange. The food has no taste, alcohol does not make drunk, and there are no children around. Is this a dream or is it in paradise or in hell? While sometimes the films look like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone (even with ninety minutes the movie appears a bit long), this seems quite provocative. The best scenes are those in which the exaggeration is minimal, when people talk in banal conversations about interior decoration and shy away from deeper topics. I have always thought that in the advanced capitalist societies there is something inhuman in the way they try to suppress the basic needs of human nature. And this movie is best for devastatingly criticizing this lifestyle. Unfortunately, the film ends very long, and the director does not seem to know how to finish it, but most of the time is worth watching.
