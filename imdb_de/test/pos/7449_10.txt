What is there to say about this movie? This movie is just great. A true eye candy. Just as the game set the standard for 3D role-playing games 7 years ago, this movie sets the standard for future CG movies. Many of you have seen the trailers and amazing details in each frame and let me tell you that this movie will not disappoint. You can actually see the fibers in Clouds Pulloverweste. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. The film features several newly arranged video game tracks that fans will definitely recognize and appreciate. <br /> <br /> The film's main weakness is its story. It's not a bad story, but this story is aimed exclusively at people who played the video game. First-time viewers sometimes feel lost or fail to notice the meaning of certain events. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone, even if you have never played the game, because this is a special movie. Look at it and enjoy the nice show.
