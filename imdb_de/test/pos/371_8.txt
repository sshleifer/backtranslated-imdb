I knew the premise of this movie and of course I can not miss a good sounding movie, especially from "Master of Suspense" director Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Basically, tennis champion Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets eccentric stranger Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train that travels from Washington to New York. Bruno speaks of a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife and Bruno hates his father, so "Bruno" suggests exchanging murders. Guy obviously did not take him seriously until, of course, Guy's wife Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) was found murdered in an amusement park. Guy is the prime suspect, of course, and Bruno "keeps pushing him," reminding him of her "plan" and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants to see dead. This murder investigation and Bruno's stalking threaten his tennis career and his relationship with the daughter of Senator Morton (North of Leo G. Carroll from the Northwest), Anne (Ruth Roman). Bruno realizes that Guy will not commit his murder and decides to use the evidence at the scene to convict him. Guy is a monogrammed cigarette lighter in the amusement park. After his tennis match, Guy and Anne (who have obviously found the murder plan) run into the amusement park to stop Bruno, and they fight with the raging runaway carousel. With Patricia Hitchcock (daughter of the director) as Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne as Mrs. Anthony, Jonathan Hale as Mr. Anthony, Howard St. John as Police Capt. Turley and John Brown as Prof. Collins, and Hitchcock's cameo is the man train with a double bass. Some interesting dialogue and character interactions, some exciting moments and of course the unforgettable carousel finale, a good classic movie. It was awarded the Oscar for best camera. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 of the 100 greatest pop culture icons, the movie was number 32 at 100 years, 100 thrills. Very well!
