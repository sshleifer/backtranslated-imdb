This movie was definitely written only for FF VII fans. I am someone who has never played the original game and seen it with a friend who was a serial fan. From a visual and technical point of view, this movie is as good as "The Spirits Within," if not better, but from the point of view of history, I was pretty much lost. One of the main weaknesses of the conspiracy that struck me was the scene in which "all" children who died of geostigma were "reunited" by the three Jenovites. I thought this geostigma was a pandemic disease ... I understand why they did it (time, budget, CPU), but it just seemed cheesy after all Explanation of how the wicked had to collect all who owned Jenova cells so that Jenova could be reborn. The subtitle version we had (some fan submarines from the internet) was a pretty direct translation and therefore probably added to my confusion hours in the FF VII wiki, where you read about the main characters and the storyline. After reading the Adventist Wiki, it was much more useful. If you're a video game or sci-fi fan, this movie is a pretty good movie, but like in a previous review, it looks like a 90-minute fight scene. You never really get to know any of the characters, and the story just seems to jump from scene to scene without much explanation, though perhaps an explanation might be needed. Thank goodness for Wikpedia.
