I do not understand all these bad reviews. I think this movie was one of the best in the Puppet Master series. With a low budget, you can understand why the special effects and the spectacle were not spectacular, but they were not completely disgusting. Greg Sestero put a lot of charisma in the role of Andre Toulon. He has a lot of potential and I hope to see more of him soon. And although the cinematography was not excellent and there was minimal violence and blood, this movie was a lot of fun. I'm a big Puppet Master fan, and I've been expecting blood and blood in the films in this series, but I can say I never got bored during the whole course of the Retro Puppet Master. So if you ever have a chance to see this movie, do not automatically consider it unworthy of your time. Give it a chance. Maybe you like it.
