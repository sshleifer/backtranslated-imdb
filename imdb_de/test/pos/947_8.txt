First of all, you should only observe this if you are not interested in the lack of subtitles, pornography, dirty sex and absolute, horrible and really shocking spoilage. I mentioned kinky sex, but calling sex "kinky" in the second half of the movie would be a great understatement. It is more of a slap in the face if you are not prepared for this type of illness. Apart from that, I can once again look back at this morbid piece of pseudo-snuff genre that our Japanese have brought us. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be pretty simple, almost non-existent: a girl is hired to perform in amateur pornography. Do not expect much in the first 30 to 40 minutes. There are some dialogues - if you do not speak Japanese, that does not mean much to you - that seems to be an occasional chat between the girl and the crew and the actress, then there is some porn (direct sex) and then the scene is over , the cast and the crew take a break. And then ... it starts. <br /> <br /> It seems that the girl is persuaded to perform another scene - this time connected to the rope. The abuse begins: hitting, hitting, hot wax ... In the end, the girl breaks down and cries. They solve it. <br /> <br /> Then we see the cast and crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened - except the girl. She is visibly shaken and looks as if she wants to leave. She goes to the door, sits down on the floor to put on her shoes ... and then hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> She is hit with a baseball bat on her head, her wound is treated, she is tied to the bed. What follows can be briefly described as rape during dismemberment (I will not spoil everything for you). Think of "flower of flesh and blood," mix it with porn and you'll get the idea. It takes about 20 minutes. SFX are very good, also make-up. Everything is shown without mercy to the viewer. They were warned. <br /> <br /> I thought "Visitor Q" was a very sick movie. After seeing "Niku daruma", it looked like a fairytale to me. This movie is so sick, so spoiled, so twisted, so disgusting, that the harsh words pale in comparison to the finale. Too bad that it only appears on VHS, so no subtitles are available. But the movie works without it. So if you are dealing with ultra-illness, extreme sadism and other beauties of this popular genre, you should check this. I hope you have no nightmares .8 / 10.
