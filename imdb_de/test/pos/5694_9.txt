WARNING: I advise anyone who has not yet watched the movie not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> This film was in a movie store on the shelf, and since I had seen a handful of very stupid horror films there had really low expectations for this one. Well, I put it in, and almost immediately I was sucked in directly. As I watched, I went deeper and deeper into the story and pretty soon I was totally interested. This movie is surprisingly spectacular and I loved every second. The story is about a boat trip in Australia. It seems safe enough that her boat is attacked by a crocodile ready to eat. When I looked at the back of the case, I thought this movie would have crappy visual effects like Lake Placid 2 and many others, but when I saw the crocodile for the first time it looked amazingly real! Do not laugh when I say that because I'm serious, but this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I really knew how to create exciting and exciting tension with his intense situation, I think, think about it; You were stuck in a tree, nowhere to go, nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water. You can not tell me you did not freak out a bit. I even managed to give a few shivers in my arms, as if Adam had been seized by the crocodile and Grace and Lee remain confused. This is a very responsive movie. There were maybe one or two parts that I found to be EASILY uninterested, but otherwise I would say that this is my favorite attack movie I've seen.
