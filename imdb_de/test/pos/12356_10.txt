Yeah, I think this movie is a bit boring compared to other movies by Pam Grier. The plot is too familiar, the dialogue stilted and some of the acting is not so good. But it's worth seeing for the long stretch at the end of the film, where we see Ms. Grier in a sexy blue wetsuit, with the zipper half open. Yes, it seems a frivolous point to talk about an actress of Pam Grier's talent, but she is also an extremely great woman, and at the time she had a body that would not give up. It's nice to see it presented in a tight wetsuit. Borrow the DVD and tell me I'm wrong. Can not you? Because you know that I'm right! :-) And yes, I really only gave a 10 for the wetsuit scenes! ;-)
