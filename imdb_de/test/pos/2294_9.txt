I agree with BigAlC - this film actually prepared me for many cultural differences and practices before I went to Japan for a year in 1993 to live there. Tom Selleck does fantastic work here as usual and the film is extremely humorous instructive. I'm a big fan of Tom Selleck and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma, bringing the movie to life in a way I can not imagine another actor can do. <br /> <br /> There were some first-rate Japanese actors in this film, and it was extremely entertaining to see them interacting with Selleck. I imagine that the fun he had while filming the movie is fun place to go, whether you're partying, sightseeing or just trying to take everything with you.
