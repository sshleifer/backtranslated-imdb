Lifeforce (1985) was a Cannon-funded film by Tobe Hooper. It's a very interesting movie about two space vampires accidentally brought back to Earth during the last Space Shuttle mission. Steve Railsback is the only survivor of the tragedy. But really, folks, the movie is just a showcase for the natural beauty of Mathilda May. She smokes a hot number. The director was a big fan of female vampires (including erotikill). Miss May recreates Lina Romay's title role. The film is beautifully photographed and staged. There are many gore effects to make the genre fans happy. <br /> <br /> I have to give this movie a very high rating. Tobe Hooper was the man. During this time, he made three interesting films for Cannon (Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars). If you like science fiction / horror movies, Tobe Hooper movies or Mathilda May, this movie is just in your alley. <br /> <br /> Highest recommendation! <br /> <br /> Did I mention that Mathilda May smokes hot?
