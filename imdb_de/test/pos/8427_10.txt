I finally found a version of Persuasion that I like! Anne does not look like a washer-girl in this version, just a very thin, aging, pretty woman, just as she's described in the book. Captain Wentworth does not look like he's 50 years old, nor does he look angry all the time, but he's not as aged as Anne and looks pretty good, as described in the book. And they play their role with such conviction and realism ... That's what actors are all about. They were believable. They created real characters and it was as if the characters in the book came to life. If you have not seen this version, I urge you to find it, order it, or request it from a bookstore or library. It is well worth the price and worth the wait. <br /> <br /> I looked at the 1995 version, the 2007 version, and it tops the other two. Why it is not rated higher, is beyond my understanding. The book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this film brings the book to life.
