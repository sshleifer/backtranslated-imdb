* Minor Spoiler * <br /> <br /> Inhabited is not scary, but it's scary. It's an interesting "little" story with good acting and great special effects make-up. Basic plot: A little girl accuses the strange things that happen to her friends in the new home of her family and in the accompanying playhouse. <br /> <br /> The movie does not waste time getting moving, though the end could be more involved. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone looking for hardcore horror, but I recommend it to those who want a cooler and not necessarily a thriller.
