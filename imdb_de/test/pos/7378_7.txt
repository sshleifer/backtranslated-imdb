Teenager Cliff (Jay R. Ferguson) has a car accident in a dangerous zigzag manner on a lonely road at night with his friends Lauren (Christine Taylor), Alex (Kim Murphy) and Eric (Christopher Masterson). While they spend the cold night in the forest around the campfire, they burn the time and tell ghost stories. In "The Honeymoon", Rick (Ron Livingston) and Valerie (Jennifer MacDonald) travel to Las Vegas in their motorhome for the honeymoon. Rick takes a shortcut to visit the Clayton Caverns at night, but stranger Cole (Hawthorne James) advises them to leave because dangerous creatures attack humans in the full moon. In "People Can Lick Too" on the eve of her twelfth birthday, Amanda (Alex McKenna) tells her internet friend Jessica that she's home alone. Jessica is actually a psychopath. In "The Locket" the motorcyclist Scott (Glenn Quinn) crosses the country on his motorbike. If he has problems with his bike, he finds an isolated house where the beautiful stupid Heather Wallace (Jacinda Barrett) lives with her dad. When the man returns from his herd, Scott finds the truth about Heather. <br /> <br /> "Campfire Tales" presents three good horror stories with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts and a surprising twist at the end. The weakest segment is "The Hook" with Eddie and Jenny, but the other stories are great. The plot is completely unexpected and gives this above-average horror movie a great deal. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazul): "Contos da Meia-Noite" ("Midnight Tales")
