"Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a highly bizarre horror movie that truly has to be seen to be believed. There is an ancient four-poster bed that loves people and always does when it lures someone to lie There is also a long-dead artist who is imprisoned behind one of his paintings, and who delivers a vocal narrative. George Barry's first and only film offers some truly surreal moments, such as the bed, which mysteriously absorbs its victims sea of ​​yellow foam and liquid. The atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a bit of gore, unfortunately the premise is pretty stupid and the acting is amateurish. As a fan of unusual cinema, I enjoyed this low-budget curiosity. Chance. 8 out of 10.
