I really like this series. His witty and unique style of the wall, sometimes controversial comedy, is a new interpretation of the genre. Although it is a sitcom, it is characterized by the unpleasant topics. <br /> <br /> Every aspect has a comedy twist, and the show is really good. My favorite part of the program is the strange comments of the dad, Dave. His tenders break up the program and allow a really good flow. not perfect, because the comedy sometimes does not laugh loudly and the actors sometimes seem to wait for an answer from the audience, but otherwise this program is good. <br /> I am very sad that it has been canceled. please make another series and finish it properly
