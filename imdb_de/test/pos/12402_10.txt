I just looked at the DVD version of BORN BAD and found it tense, dark and in the end too graphic for the faint-hearted. Justin Walker (unaware) and Corey Feldman deliver outstanding performances. For a low-budget movie delivers this picture. The depth of the character and the clever dialogue are two things that are not usually seen in a Roger Corman image. Watch it on DVD!
