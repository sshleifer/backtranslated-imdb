I just want to say that I was thrilled to find these comments about the show. In the past, I've tried searching online for information about the show to no avail. I loved the show. It's hard for me to get motivated, but this show was fun. As another comment it was mentioned that today it was not as complicated as the routines. It was an ideal workout that did the job! I would give anything to buy a copy of a workout. I remember many of these features, but not nearly everything. Someone please try to resend it and make it available on DVD too. It's great to know that I was not the only one who loved this show! Thanks for my day!
