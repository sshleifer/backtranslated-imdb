I love this movie. At first, I did not expect much from this film because I had not heard anyone talk about it, and it seemed like he had gone to video in the cinema shortly after the opening. I also did not think that David and Minnie would be a good couple on screen. (I've been expecting a lot from the screen pairs since I saw "You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) I personally think Joely Richardson should have played Minnie's role, and vice versa , I do not know, I just think Joely should have stayed longer with David in the movie. They seemed perfect for each other. But it's just that in a movie, the girl next door always gets the guy. :) (As in "While you slept.") But I was very wrong. This movie was fantastic !!! Everything was done superbly. Bonnie Hunt has done great things. The lines were perfect with the wise jumps everywhere. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!! *** <br /> <br /> I love how everything is intertwined. For example, Elizabeth and Bob initially talked about going to Italy, and in the end Bob met Grace in Italy. Sydney (the ape), who does the hand-thing with Grace, as he did with Elizabeth, is also an example. <br /> <br /> *** NOTE: SPOILERS END NOW !!! *** <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like about the movie was something unreal. Well, I just do not believe that a man could overcome his wife in a year when she was the only woman he had ever been in his life. You'd think he would isolate himself from the world for years before he even came out of his house to talk to someone. Instead, he goes on a blind date a year later and instantly falls in love with a woman he has never seen in his life, but he feels a connection to him. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a great movie. I had to cry two or three times and laughed countless times (the scene in the restaurant with Bob's spicy date for bottled water was hilarious!). It's definitely up there with great romantic comedies like "You've Got Mail," "Sliding," and "While Sleeping." <br /> <br /> GO RENT IT TODAY !!
