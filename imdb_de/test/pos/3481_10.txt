I've just seen a movie that was supposed to feed MOW on Lifetime a second time ... but I trust the Irish that they are anything but sugary. The set-up except SCREAMS "Here's a message about what's really important in life," but the execution was part of "Let's see what we can do here." <br /> <br /> It helps have two fantastic actors in the lead roles - James McAvoy (as Rory) and Stephen Robertson (as Michael). While Rory is offered as the almost saint - no matter what language and attitude - he is the "life force" in this piece and could have been unbearable in his ultimately "caring" attitude - McAvoy keeps him so sharp he can hold it is too cute. But the revelation is Stephen Robertson as Michael. Not since Leonardo Di Caprio in "... Gilbert Grape" has anyone captured a person so well with a suffering that I began to believe that he really is an actor with a cerebral palsy. And his eyes ... my God, he can tear you apart with them. <br /> <br /> This movie is, to tell Rory, f **** n 'startling. Look at it. Take a box of Kleenex and enjoy every well-deserved tear ... and laugh.
