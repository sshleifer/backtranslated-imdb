I recently read the story to see how these two fit together, and if you can believe it, Balzac's film improves. I think the story is being moved to bring home the idea that Colonel Chabert is a man who suffered a lot and yet comes home, not a hero, but an outsider. <br /> <br /> As someone mentioned I was initially confused when Chabert was related to The Return of Martin Guerre. No. It is firmly anchored by Balzac that Chabert is the right one. However, it is not interesting that he is or not, but how his wife and his company treat him. <br /> <br /> I think this is a timeless story of men fighting for their husbands and when they get home, time has left them behind. Chabert is a tragic figure, which makes the amazing Gerard Depardieu all the more moving. I do not care that he has participated in 1 million films, he is fascinating. <br /> <br /> Fanny Ardant has a terrible character. Once a prostitute, Rose rose to the social ladder with her female cunning. Are her feelings for Compte Ferraud true? I think that's what they are and maybe they mate with their social status at the time, and you feel some kind of compassion for them. <br /> <br /> Fabrice Lucini slowly snakes its way into my heart. He is exceptional here as Derville. <br /> <br /> I think if you get your hands on this gem of a movie you will not regret it. French cinema at its finest.
