I can not believe that people are making bad reviews about this movie! I wonder why ... maybe because of the book ..... I have to admit, it does not really follow the book ... sure ... the book by dean koontz is much better .. but the movie is good too! !! It has the excitement ... the acting is good ... especially Michael Ironside, who gave an outstanding acting in this film !!! <br /> <br /> Come on a guy ... give this movie a chance. There's still a lot more film than this .... like the sum of all the fears ... phantoms ... the da vinci code ... these are some of the worse movies I've ever seen ... really boring When compared to viewers who have really great elements in the movie ... this movie contains great excitement and non-stop action !!! I'm looking for this movie ... but it's really hard to find on DVD ... <br /> <br /> from there ... I really recommended this movie to everyone ... have a look! !!! You will never regret it! <br /> <br /> 10/10 *
