This film tells the story of Ramon Sampedro, who had been lying in bed for 27 years after breaking his neck and fighting for the permission of someone who can support his death. > Javier Bardem is one of the best actors of his generation. Remember this: he just has to wear this movie with his face! Unbelievable that he did not even receive an Oscar nomination. Now we can all see that the academy is a joke! The side occupation was great! The optimistic Rosa, his lawyer Julia, the rest of the family ... Everyone has their own opinion about Ramon's wish to die. <br /> <br /> Whether you are for or against euthanasia, your opinions aside, because this movie deserves to be seen by people all over the world! After half the movie I started to cry and it did not stop until the credits rolled. This movie is so heartbreaking, but also wonderful to watch and I can not wait to see it again. I give him a 9/10 and in my opinion is by far the best movie of the year.
