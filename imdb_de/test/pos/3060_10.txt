How dare one say something bad about this movie? Forgive Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that's always funnier when you look at him. <br /> <br /> When I saw this for the first time, I cried so much from laughing. Everything about it is funny. <br /> <br /> Although "Robin Hood: Men In Tights" is not my favorite comedy (this ad is taken from "Real Genius"), it's high in my book. So look at it! If you do not laugh all the time, you spend at least all the time drooling over Cary Elwes.
