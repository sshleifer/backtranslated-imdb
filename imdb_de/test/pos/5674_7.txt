"Black Water" is a movie that somehow surprised me and definitely exceeded my original expectations. "Black Water" is a really well-structured, unpredictable, exciting, well-directed and scary movie. The plot is actually a bit original and will fascinate you in any case. One thing I love about this movie is the direction, especially because it exceeded my original expectations. My original expectations for "Black Water" were that it was a crazy, twisted, director, pacemaker and boring movie. It really was not like that. Well, there is nothing to praise for acting, because there were times when I felt I was not showing enough emotions, and there are a few lines that feel so scripted. I love the direction, because all the shots seem predictable, but they are not. As if to say that the camera gets a slow picture of the water, and it's going pretty well, as if the crocodiles are attacking. However, the attacks of the Croc are very unpredictable (which was bad for me who does not care too much with such films), and that makes you jump. Also, I just love the fact that it's one of those horror movies that does not rely on the sudden big sound effect to make you jump, but the actual movie. I also like how the story is about people trapped in these trees. She made it very real and definitely looked on the screen. I have to say, I do not think the first 20 minutes were good, and I think they made the boat a little harder than in real life. Also, I did not like how they did their best to make the character's situation completely hopeless, if it was not really the case. I also do not think that some actions of the characters were realistic. For example, I would not have gone near the water, knowing it was a crocodile, let alone a murderer. However, these problems are really not that big and I could still enjoy the movie. Overall, as far as movies are concerned, I've seen better ones, but as far as animal attacks are concerned, the horror movies (a genre where I easily get scars) are one of the better ones you'll see. And surely it's not perfect, but that does not mean it's worth a try.
