"Steamboat Willie (1928)" is often falsely praised as the first Mickey Mouse movie, though this title actually means "Plane Crazy (1928)." The source fueling this widespread misconception is probably an episode of "The Simpsons," which is the origin of Itchy the Mouse in a short cut-off called "Steamboat Itchy" from 1928, obviously a parody of this cartoon. Interestingly, 'Steamboat Willie' itself was a spoof spoofing the latest release from Buster Keaton's 'Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928)', though the connection barely extends beyond the title and overall story setting. In this Walt Disney Shorts, Mickey Mouse takes responsibility for a river boat, much to the annoyance of Captain Pete, the cat who casts it off. But Mickey is not bad to beat. Far from the pleasurable, healthy Mickey that younger generations have enjoyed, this little mouse only looks after Numero Uno and adds pain and discomfort to a series of farm animals to provide music for its own entertainment. <br /> <br /> First, there is the laughing parrot holding a bucket and a big potato on its head. Then a goat is cranked off its tail to deliver music ("Turkey in the Straw") from a guitar that has swallowed it. A cat is swung around by the tail, a goose is throttled around the neck and a piglet is brutally booted. For a kid's cartoon, Steamboat Willie, directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, certainly has some mean humor, though I've noticed similar elements (like Gulliver Mickey) in some of the later Disney shorts as well (1934). 'Let's not forget, of course, Minnie Mouse, who is suffering from a treatment for which she could sue today for sexual harassment! The jokes may be crude and the animation may be even more, but this cartoon provides a bucket of laughter and it's easy to see why this little rodent became one of the most popular figures in cinematic history. If you're a fan of Mickey Mouse or Disney in general, you can not miss this steamboat.
