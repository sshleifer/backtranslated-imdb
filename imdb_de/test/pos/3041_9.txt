John Voight plays the title character in this film, based on the autobiography of the author Pat Conroy (Prince of Tides). A good teacher movie. It tells the story of a naive Pat Conroy, a young English teacher who initially works in a primary school on a rural island. As the only white man on the island, he has to fight against internal and external pressure by teaching education and values ​​to children who have systematically denied such things for generations. A solid performance that makes you think.
