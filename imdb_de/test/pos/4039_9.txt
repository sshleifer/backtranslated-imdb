I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not usually into fairy tales or stories of faith, but this movie caught my attention. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time on the UK channel Hallmark ... which usually shows some sticky films ... But then came the Snow Queen ... and I loved it! I really admire Bridget Fonda in this movie ... She plays the Snow Queen brilliant and glamorous. <br /> <br /> I will not explain what the story is about as other people have already done so, so there is no meaningful repetition. <br /> <br /> I would only suggest if you want to take a fun fairytale trip ... get this movie ... but if you want to buy it and you live in the UK, you might have a hard time. I bought it from South Korea brand new (English edition of course).
