This is definitely an excellent show. I do not have a cable, so I rented it because my friend recommended it. I thought it was a teen soap, you know who's with whom, something like that. But it was not like that. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very funny. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes that catch you every time you look at it. It's a comedy drama, which is rare when executed well. It's about the relationship between Rory and Lorelai. Instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship, it is the story of the best friend relationship - mother and daughter. The characters are perfectly staffed and they all do a great job. It's definitely the best TV show I've ever seen.
