Fires on the Plain (Nobi) is a shattering masterpiece about the sheer madness and despair of war. It is not to everyone's taste: this is a war film in the truest sense of the word, which neither puts on flag waving patriotism or saccharine sentimentality. Nobi cuts deeply, it's ugly, stubborn and bleak, as there will be few things ever with celluloid. This is a war behind the guns, without triumphs or heroes, no moral victories or defeats, only a handful of gaunt and terrible-looking men scattered across a land ravaged by a war like penitents facing a cataclysm flee. The characters oppose the moral judgment because they are creatures affected by a great suffering, a suffering that does not allow for questions of a moral nature. War and survival. Play the will against the other in a battlefield arena. The loser is simply removed from existence. <br /> <br /> Tamura, a soldier of the Japanese Imperial Army, is released from the train and reported to a nearby hospital because he has hemoptysis and is not liked by the others on the train. He should never come back and commit suicide with the hand grenade instead, if the hospital refuses him. What it does The hospital is nothing but a cabin made of wooden planks and the surgeon just tells him that he is fine when he can walk. In this shabby apology of a hospital, one of the most shattering scenes of the film takes place. As the area is bombarded with rugs by American aircraft, doctors and those who can run and feed themselves flee the hospital to the forest. Moments before the hospital is torn to pieces, the sick and injured figures of the sick and injured crawl in every pose, clad in their sick white robes, as if the building is an animal spewing out guts and dirt on the earth. <br /> <br /> This is the greatest success of Nobi; the crass and brooding portrayal of the suffering of war in simple but evocative images, without melodrama or pseudo-heroism. Soldiers cross a swamp silted knee-deep in the mud, moving across the opposite bank and into a field to spot only enemy tanks hiding in the forest. Their lights glow like evil eyes as they probe the darkness. A procession of injured soldiers, dirty and half-crazy, crossed a street and fell to the ground at the sound of enemy planes. Buzzards feasting on a pile of dead bodies. An abandoned village. A crazy soldier who thinks he's a Buddha sitting under a tree, covered in flies and his own excrement, offering his arm to be eaten by Tamura when he's dead. These are the images that conjure up Ichikawa for our eyes, ruthless and unyielding in their dignity, but honest and raw. <br /> <br /> Nobi does not want to go anywhere. It is content to follow Tamura's travels through the war-torn country as he attempts to reach the Palompa regroupment center and observe the madness and obscenities of the war. The film meanders slowly and brooding through the mud of the war of war, just like the characters he follows. The last thirty minutes in which Tamura took refuge with two deserters who feed on "monkey meat" come closest to Nobi if he sticks to conventional narratives and they are no less powerful. Conspicuously photographed in black and white, with great performances by the actors and the sure direction of Ichikawa, Nobi is not only one of the best war films, but also one of the best Japanese cinemas.
