On its surface, this is one of the classically most entertaining action / comedy / romance films I've seen in a long time. It reminds me of funny old "Saturday Afternoon" movies that had just the right balance of unexpected twists. Timed humor and integrated action. In addition, there is our knowledge of the context of this film. It has the same elements as "Casablanca", but it is set right before many of the characters really understand the seriousness of what happened to their country (and the world) and the consequences of their own behavior. This adds a strong irony to the humor (we feel that one of the female characters has a radical change in the hairstyle in her future). This is a movie you will not regret.
