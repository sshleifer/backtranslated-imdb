The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting, and I was really excited about the mother-daughter relationship. It's a family story that is not marred by bells and whistles and special effects. a story as it really is. I could not help but sigh at the end of this movie, unfortunately it's a well-told bittersweet story where you grow up and connect with family and friends. The acting was pretty exquisite and I hope we will see both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles.
