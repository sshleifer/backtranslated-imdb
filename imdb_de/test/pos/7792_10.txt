I've probably seen this movie more than 20 times. The jokes are now 10-15 years old, but every time I see them, I fall off my chair. Two of the best actors Salman Khan and Aamir Khan play the lead roles here. Although Aamir Khan is a much better actor and plays the better role (smart guy) in the movie Salman Khan and sometimes even performs better as a stupid guy. All characters are memorable. This movie is full of funny one-liners and funny situations (probably a bit too stupid). Do not try to look for logic in this movie. Let your brain relax for some time. I promise it will be an unforgettable experience.
