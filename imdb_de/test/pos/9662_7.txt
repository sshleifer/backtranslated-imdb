I have to say that I did not expect this movie to be that good. Usually, 90% of Eastern films show the communist past in 90% of the films. However, this film surpasses the Romanian cinema and earns more advertising. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is real and not exaggerated, the plot is simple and complex as it presents life in the Romanian suburb, the sound astounded me, the direction was good and what else can I say. .. <br /> <br /> This "Crash" of Eastern Europe pulled me into the movie at any moment. I even felt a desire, a craving for adventure, after I saw it. <br /> <br /> Take a look! You will definitely enjoy it! <br /> <br /> 7/10
