Since the last dreadful Astérix film and the fact that we are only getting the Swiss German version in theaters, I have looked at it with some concern ... Unfunded when I was glad to discover, _______ br /> <br /> The film is funny and modern, has good gags, a good animation, an amusing character interaction, a good voice (Note: I can only speak for the Swiss German!), With the exception of the daughter of the Viking boss Abba (her name is great, despite the uninspired spokeswoman) ... <br /> <br /> I especially liked the character Justforkix (Goudurix in French, Grautvornix in German, he is the young man who should be set in shape ...). He is a very amusing portrayal of an annoying urban teenager. But he is very likeable, despite the youthful behaviors ... XD The interaction between Astérix and Obélix and their young man is fantastic and thoroughly entertaining. <br /> <br /> It should not be compared to the old films One thing is very different ... Which is surprisingly not bad. On the other hand. Twelve years ago, when they tried to modernize the last movie, they completely blew it away. But this movie has proven that it works well ... ^ - ^ <br /> <br /> I came out of the theater happily ... Always a good sign ^ _ ~
