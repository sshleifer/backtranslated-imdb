After traveling around the world, I realized that there is really something missing in Australia that other countries have: history. Luckily or unfortunately, Australia was not established after a war, it had no civil war and most of its political history is more ... boring! There was nothing "big" that marked a turning point in Australia's history ... until the departure of the Whitlam administration by the Governor-General of Australia - John Kerr. <br /> <br /> For those who are Australian, you can skip this paragraph and continue with the next one. This is for the sake of curious non-Australians! Australia was colonized by the British. By the time it became clear that Australia could stand on its own two feet. Accordingly, the UK gave Australia permission to set up its own parliaments, laws, courts, etc. The law and politics of Australia would no longer be provided directly by the British. On the contrary, Australia is run by the Australians themselves, although the courts, precedents, parliament, etc. are largely modeled on the British system. This shift has been enshrined in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the constitution lawfully establishes Australian governments, legislative procedures, courts (but for the curious - no fundamental rights), there are two "pro-crown" sections that have been and still exist today. These are more or less regarded as the "Reserve Powers of the Crown (King / Queen of Great Britain)". The first group of sections concerns the creation of the post of Governor-General. In short, the Governor-General is considered the principal representative of the Queen in Australia and is referred to as the "executive" of the Australian Government. When a bill is passed by the Australian Parliament, the Constitution states that it will not become law until it is signed by the Governor-General. As such, the Governor-General is considered by some to be nothing more than a rubber steamer, who exercises an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function for the crown. Theoretically, the Governor-General may refuse to sign a law passed by the Australian Parliament if he considers it appropriate. For example, if Parliament passed a law allowing the police to kill any Australian older than 50 (of course hypothetically), the GG could refuse to sign it and would not become the country's law. This power, however, is theoretical and never (until now) exercised. By "gathering" (which is the buzzword of the events that led to the dismissal), the Governor-General acts at the behest of the Australian Government, and therefore, when the Government passes a bill and the Prime Minister instructs the Governor-General to do so, almost always without question. In fact, the Governor-General acts through "Assembly" in accordance with the advice of the then Prime Minister (and the Prime Minister alone). The second aspect is Section 64 of the Constitution, which states that government ministers have the "pleasure" of the Governor-General. The events of 1975 - which are discussed in this film - set a precedent for this particular section: If the Governor-General of the Government and / or the Prime Minister in any way displeases, it seems as if this section lawfully allows it to dismiss the government ( the title of the film "The Dismissal".) Whether "to the delight of the Governor General" can be understood as "the full right of release" is a controversial point for a rather heated exchange among the Australians at that time - especially given the fact that the Governor-General is not elected by the inhabitants of Australia. <br /> <br /> Now that this background aspect is out of the way, let's return to the discussion The Movie. It was well done. The pace was patient, but did not diminish at all. The drama was good and very realistic. The events were not overly dramatized and above all, the point of view was not presented from a political perspective. On the contrary, I find this to be fair and balanced, although the closing text before the credits indicates that the filmmakers probably did not approve of the Governor General's decision to dismiss the Whitlam government. But I would not call the film a prejudice in one direction or the other. <br /> <br /> In terms of accuracy, he was almost exactly right. The filmmakers have certainly done their homework and obviously read the books and writings of all the major players involved. There were a number of finer details that were skipped, mainly because they took a long time to explain and ultimately did little to influence the events of 1975. That's why I forgive them. I also believe that it was hard to recreate the public sentiment of this post-Vietnamese wartime, but Noyce has pretty much done it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was pleased that the movie has tried to change the individual politics of Both sides are not analytical, obsessive or judgmental about them. In addition, every project we've raised, such as Connor's Pipeline, had a great relevance to the story. The filmmakers realized that it was their job to tell the story of the events that led to the dismissal, and not to present any political support or opposition in terms of politics and views. That was wise, because the film could not be accused of misrepresenting the politics of a site. The release is probably the most incredible piece of political history that Australia has experienced in its short life. I am glad it was crystallized in celluloid. Essential consideration for every Australian.
