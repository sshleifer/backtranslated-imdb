I looked at this movie again and still think it's pretty good. Chloe is one of the few hardcore stars who can really act. She occasionally appears in a soft core like "Body of Love" and "Lady Chatterly's Stories" on Showtime. I thought Nicole Hilbig was also fine with her beautiful body and charming accent. Too bad she is not in more movies.
