Milos Forman's original HAIR was the perfect film that actually showed how life has changed in those years, not just in the US, but above all in this country. One of the actions in the film should be used in other films to come to Hair, for example, American Graffitti, etc. It was an original story with a touch of generational sadness. The characters in the movie were like lonely "cells" in a "body" that changed everywhere. Overall a very good movie, maybe a bit underrated. Annie Golden's role was low, but she behaved very well. It was the movie that practically brought John Savage to life as an actor. One of the members of the Chicago played his role well, though it was a minor role.
