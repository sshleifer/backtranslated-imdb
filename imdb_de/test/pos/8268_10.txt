I knew and loved this book since I was eleven and I was scared to see it as a movie. What if they made a terrible mess of it? In that case I would not have had to worry at all. Everyone was very well staffed and the acting is great, they followed the story very well, except for the strange addition of the scene in the jail, which did not add anything to me at all. It's the loveliest love story, though, and I'm so glad I shot it as a video so I can watch it again and again. My only criticism is - why did not they give Kester a green vest that made him such a likable man? So easy, if she went to so much trouble for everything else. If you get the chance, you see, it's excellent.
