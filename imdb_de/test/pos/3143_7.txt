Perry Mason: In the case of fatal fashion, Perry and Della Street are awarded a prize in New York by the American Bar Association. An undefeated court record should be appreciated, I would think. Anyway, a friend of Dellas fashion editor Diana Muldaur is arrested for the murder of a rival, Valerie Harper. In fact, Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale witness a confrontation between the two in a posh eatery Two rivals have one thing that makes Hedda and Louella look like schoolgirls. Of course, Harper has a number of other people who love her as much. <br /> <br /> The same offender also ran down a fashion designer who might have exposed the person. This throws Perry into a coalition with some gangsters with his trusted investigative lawyer, William Moses. Seems that the designer was a cousin of a mob boss who also wants to expose some justice in the usual way. <br /> <br /> One thing I could not get is when Moses and gangster Robert Clohessy track down the culprit. I can not believe that the police did not follow the case vigorously. Of course Clohessy has access to sources that the cops just do not have. <br /> <br /> But the best part of this Mason entry is Scott Baio, when the young, fairly full of his own Deputy District Attorney Raymond Burr said he was studying all his cases and was looking forward to beating him. Foolish boy. <br /> <br /> In fact, my favorite scene is Burr and Baio in a sidebar with the judge. Baio wanted to resume his case and add a witness and came with precedents ready. Burr catches him off guard and says he has no objection to the new witness. Then he breaks off the witness at a cross examination. Absolutely priceless. <br /> <br /> Scott Baio is the best in this Perry Mason movie and should be seen alone, if nothing else.
