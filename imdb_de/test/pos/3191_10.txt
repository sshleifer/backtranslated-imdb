I can not believe it ... after all those years have found this goal, it should be referred to in the production phase as "The Great Pretender". I was living in Oz at one time and through a friend I took care of one of the house locations by filming ... I showed the boys how to speak Scottish, and after all that time, I've just noticed that one was Russell Crowe !!! It took me all those years to track it down. I was even unsure if it ever went on the screen when I left Oz the following month after the graduation party. At the time, Russell Crowe was not the requested actor that he is now, and I had no idea that it was him until I had seen the previous comment and then thought about the days during the shoot ..... amazing. .. I'm really excited about myself now! !!
