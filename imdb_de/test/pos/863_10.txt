When I first saw Stella in Comedy Central, I thought, "God, that's awful!" But I loved the Wet Hot American Summer. So I knew that something did not make sense. There was nothing left to do but look for the Stella shorts I'd heard contain more dildos than any other comedy troupe. When I found her, my dildo expectations were not only met, but I probably found the greatest comedy scene I've seen in years. The set of twenty short films took me to the edge of my seat, water pouring over my legs. Not only did I laugh at my ass the first time I watched her, but also violently when I watched her over and over again. It is a pity that Comedy Central had the limitations of cable television for the Stella series. It would have been much better on HBO or Showtime. Their kind of humor can not be limited by censors or popular culture. Even if it were HBO, I would be sure that the "masses" canceled in one season or less, but it would still have been fantastic. Needless to say, I am now in love with Stella and all her individual members. Every Stella fan should visit the website of David Wain with all his short films. They are as enjoyable as Stella. My hat goes to Michael Showalter, Michael Ian Black and David Wain for the incredible comedy they did with Stella. I hope to see much more of the troupe in the future.
