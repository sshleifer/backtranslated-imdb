To put it bluntly, Matthew Poncelet was not a real person, but a character combination of two murderers who were both convicted and sentenced to death for murdering two teenagers. <br /> <br /> I read the user comments and they react as if Matthew were real. The character is based on a mixture of two assassins, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie (who murdered separate persons), and the murder itself was based on Willie's. The conflict in which Willie is present with someone else and both parties have sworn that the killing took place is also incorporated into the story. <br /> <br /> Prejean's approach is unique in that it not only serves the convicted, waiting for their death and helping them take responsibility for their actions. She also attacks the families of the victims to let them know that the convict actually did, and in fact felt remorse for what they had done to effectively support both parties. <br /> Everyone posting here seems to have a firm record To have faith in the death sentence. It is not my job to say that it is right or wrong - in the theory that death is punished with death, it makes some sort of karmic sense, even though it denies a person their freedom for the rest of their days, even though they are it makes more sense for me to put in a jail small room 23/7 (with one hour of exercise) for the rest of the day to be reminded of the cruel thing they actually felt was a more appropriate punishment - they are technically alive, but they are denied their lives. Suppose someone killed someone so that he could evade the responsibility the person he killed killed (like Susan Smith killing her poor children by shoving her car into a lake). I find it fittingly ironic that they would not get the "freedom" they crave, and they would now spend the rest of their days in prison. <br /> <br /> Prejean's point of view comes through the story very well. She has my respect - she manages to find that balance - she does not support a murderer, she leads her to accept what they have done. If they did not feel remorseful, they would not ask for a spiritual guide. <br /> <br /> One final remark when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix's parents for killing his son, the girl's parents, also mumbled something about why he did not apologize for her death. I think the point was that Poncelet denies having killed both children throughout the movie. There is doubt in Prejean's mind that he committed both murders - there is a friend who was convicted, but not sentenced to death. My thought is that Poncelet killed the Delacroix boy and the other man murdered the girl - so Poncelet took responsibility for what he did. If he had been responsible for the girl's death, he would probably have apologized for it.
