What a great movie !! It's a touching story about four high school friends who grew up in the 1960s. Throughout the decade, the friends are somewhat disconnected, but they want to see each other occasionally. There are many tragedies, but there are also many happy moments that make you laugh and smile. It's a hearty story about life, love and friendship. Definitely a must for drama fans.
