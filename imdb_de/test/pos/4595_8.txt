I've never seen a movie that had a worse release than this one. And that's too bad, because it's the funniest movie of the year! You'd think an ad with the line "From the Office Space Director" would be enough to justify a big release! But there are no ads, no posters, no website, I doubt the stars even knew it was coming out this weekend. What does 20th Century Fox think? The science fiction comedy by Mike Judge was shot in 2505 but could be completed in about ten years (if things stay as they are). Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph freeze to death in a top-secret army experiment and watch zombie in-tooth delays in a future full of consumers. The movie reminds me of Woody Allen's "Sleeper", "RoboCop", "Planet of the Apes", "Blade Runner" and "Network" and the late big "Futurama". Try to see it before Fox burns all the prints!
