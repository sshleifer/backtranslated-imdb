This movie is totally stunning. It manages to be thoughtful, funny, tragic and cinematic yet claustrophobic. <br /> <br /> Although the flashbacks are not necessary, the film retains a Pacific, punchy feel and the performances are all excellent, especially Alec Baldwin. and the mesmerizing Eric Bogosian as the film's anti-hero, Barry Champlain.
