So Keira is chivalrous in it ... So we compare this movie automatically with Attonement. Apart from the fact that this film is also wartime and its appearance is unmanned, these films are completely different. <br /> <br /> The actors work well, I think one good thing is that there is no memorable person, they are a team. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie in which things happen, I advise someone else, because the story of this film is about human interaction and their physches who have been damaged by their experiences and how their lives are connected is. > <br /> This movie has real interaction, perfect moments of rest that will make you hold your breath. No, that's not exciting, but it's exciting to empathize with these characters. In a few moments I wondered if this film would have been better as a play than a movie. We expect a lot from movies because anything is possible and yet we allow interaction with theater and rely on faith. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a blockbuster, if you're not looking for anything, it's wrong and let the movie take you in, move around, let those stars forget you, and do not judge them as actors but let them become humans. You will feel really moved. <br /> <br /> GO BEFORE! ! Try it!
