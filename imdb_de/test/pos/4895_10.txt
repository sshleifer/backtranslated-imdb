I have to admit, when I first heard about the apocalypse movie, that was a worry. <br /> <br /> I mean, they have a lot to do, right? When they played a stage show for the first time, they won the Perrier Prize and the radio a Sony Award. When they ventured on our tellys, they won a Bafta Prize, a Royal Television Society Award and the Golden Rose of Montreux. When the first series aired in January 1999, it was amazing! A real fresh breeze in British Comedy, and when the second series aired a year later, it built this foundation and sealed the cult status of shows around the world. Our internet statistics show that we have received visitors from every single country in the world! The "Local Show for Local People" showed the gents' talent for live performances and opened doors for the gentlemen to make more live performances like "Art" in the western end. <br /> <br /> The favorite of the fans has always been the Christmas special, less a sketch show and rather a tribute to classic horror movies, yet in a delicious league style. <br /> <br /> And then of course there was the "difficult" third series, still a matter of course for the loyal hardcore fans, but maybe a little earlier than a mainstream TV crowd. <br /> <br /> As I said, there is much to do. <br /> <br /> Now we have the movie and ... Well, a movie is different, right? It will be seen by much larger numbers than on the radio or television programs and with the third series in the back of my mind I was worried. <br /> <br /> Well, as you know, I was fortunate to see the movie in a movie yesterday in London, and all my doubts were (literally) blown away in the first few minutes! I'm not going to give away any storylines, as some reviewers have, and I will not tell you the buzz words (though there really is only one), but I'll try to tell you what they've achieved with this movie! When I left the cinema on Monday night, I could only imagine writing, "Oh my God, it's brilliant, it's amazing, it's the best thing they've ever done, better than the first, second, and specials in one! " Of course I owe my visitors a much better explanation! Why is it brilliant? This is a movie for everyone, the occasional fan, the obsessive fan, the occasional fan and even someone in the wrong movie theater! You did not have to watch the show to enjoy this movie. It works on so many levels. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me why I'm a fan of League of Gentlemen! It can be said that the film was also a true love work; The attention to detail is incredible. The sets for the TV show have always been very detailed, but I have to watch the movie again to see the background! The story moves fast, the storyline that leads us from Royston Vasey into the real world, where we meet the "creators", who of course are the league itself! On the way we manage to catch on favorite characters from the show, but in contrast to the TV sketch show always within the central story. <br /> <br /> I was glad that the movie was dark in some places, a bit scary and a bit strange ... just fitting for The League of Gentlemen. The gentlemen also managed to avenge themselves on the BBC's censors, with the word "Mongoloid" slipping less than screaming from the rooftops! Some may find the gents' presentation a little lenient to themselves, but that's the joke, and that's my only concern. The jokes I mentioned below might confuse some viewers and they might be a bit too smart ... but I should not be careless, there is always a poo joke waiting around the corner and talking about jokes, they are coming thick and fast, and in a mixture of wise hints, wig jokes, bum jokes, visual jokes and Schwanzknebel! I did not laugh out loud in the cinema ... well, I can not remember! The fans, who joined the league from the beginning, are rewarded with a variety of jokes, some of which work on two levels. A mainstream audience can laugh about a reference to a CD for one reason, while fans of the Local Show will laugh together for a different reason! The cameos are genius! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg are the strangest double act you've ever seen. Simon gets one of the biggest laughs of the movie just by making a sound! I was a bit worried about the aspect of the film from 1690 when I heard about it for the first time, but as a story in a story, I was just thinking about it as ... but that would say! All I have to say is that it fits in wonderfully and enhances the overall feel of the movie! I am not a professional film reviewer, so I find it difficult to put into words how much I liked this movie, but for now I just want to say if the supposed benchmark for British comedy films in recent years is the outstanding " Shaun of 'was the dead' then I'm sorry, but the inventive, witty and sometimes a little scary ... new scale was set ... The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse. Jason Kenny 2005
