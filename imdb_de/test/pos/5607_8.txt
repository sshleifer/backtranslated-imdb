One of my favorite Hartley movies. (As if there could be a "bad" one.) This may be a little more on the religious side of things than we would normally expect. Still, it still claims that Hartley has become accustomed to bias. First picture Jesus and Satan discuss their ideas, opinions, hopes and regrets about the imminent end of civilization. Now imagine the entire conversation taking place with a few drinks in your neighborhood bar. And as an additional distraction in the conversation (not to mention the visual) distraction, let's throw PJ Harvey to Mr. Chist as a sultry companion (alias Magdelena). Then, just for the grin, in the background an ever-present Salvation Army band (played by Yo La Tengo), which serves as an additional distraction. The road to moral justification has never been a pleasure. <br /> <br /> More questions than answers, but that's the fun. And Mr. Donovan is, as always, subdued brilliance.
