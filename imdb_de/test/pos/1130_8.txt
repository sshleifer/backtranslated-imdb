I have seen the pilot with high expectations after graduating from college and moving into "real life". I was not in a brotherhood, but many of my best buddies were, and I was able to attend many parties they hosted in their home. So I know what goes on to some extent. <br /> <br /> This show is obviously a dramatization, not a documentary in any way of Greek life or college life for that matter, though it contains a lot of truth, though it's largely exaggerated. If you watch the show for the value that it contains as a television show, and nothing more, it's very entertaining, much like movies like Old School, Porky's, Animal House, etc. If you see it and expect all your movies to be recorded Experiences in your own college life, you will probably either want more or crazy that they over-dramatize a lot of events.
