This is the best work I've ever seen on TV. The story is convincing - even more so than it is true. The authors have done their homework - the accuracy of the events is well documented. Acting is great. This must be the best role Sam Waterston has ever had. And the black and white camera was extraordinary. My only regret is that it is not available for purchase. A few years ago I contacted someone who was involved in the production (either PBS or in England) and I was told they did not intend to release them on VHS (back then). This was a BBC production and ran in the US on American Playhouse. There is such an interest in seeing this - hard to believe that no one can provide it.
