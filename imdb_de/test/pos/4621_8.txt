Yes, 2:37 is in a way a rip-off from Gus van Sants Elephant. It's about some students who are dealing with their problems leading to the suicide of one of them. Yes, it's full of stereotypes, but that's life. There's no denying that creepy nerds, handicapped or popular students, who have problems despite their popularity, exist in the real world. <br /> <br /> But that's not what this movie is about. It's not about high school life. It's not about the misery of life itself. <br /> <br /> If you look beneath the surface, under the soap-like social relationships that are being shown, you'll find a gripping, thought-provoking critique of our society. <br /> <br /> Why do people commit suicide? Do we really understand their motives? Or are we just trying to understand after it's already too late? And why is it always someone you never expected? <br /> <br /> This movie does not answer that question, but it does throw it up. And very intense. All the way you guess whose blood it might be, you see at the very beginning. They follow the paths of some students, all of whom have more or less good reasons to end their lives, only to be forced to see the cruel act in the finale. <br /> <br /> Did you know who it is? Or were you surprised like in real life? <br /> <br /> At the end the message is verbalized by one of the surviving children. We are so fixated on our own problems, we forget to see those of others. There could be someone, a colleague, a friend who does not want to live anymore. But if you do not open your eyes, you never know until it's too late. <br /> <br /> This film gives good results. It could have some shortcomings, but they are not important anymore when it's over. Either you see a reflection of society or you are blind to reality.
