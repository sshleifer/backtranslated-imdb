I really liked this movie ... and I still watch it from time to time. I used it in my music lessons at the school where I teach. The kids seem to enjoy it, even though they wish they were in color. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film for me, who grew up after the death of Heifetz, is the chance to truly see Master Geiger work his craft! I was surprised how "current" the story is. However, references to "Reform School" are outdated. A boy whose father died and is raised by his mother and stepfather. Most of our children are raised by step-maids today, though the film seems to make most step-members cruel. I get very angry when his mother does not step on his side and defend his actions against his stepfather. <br /> <br /> Also the musical selection is hard to believe. I find it unbelievable that a child about eight years old can play the "minute waltz" or that a 13 year old girl could sing an aria from Rigoletto. Otherwise, it's a really funny, good movie, and I recommend it. I wish it would come out on DVD.
