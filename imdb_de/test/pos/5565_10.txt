I have to tell you that I have been a fan of Star Trek TNG since my childhood. Well, some time ago, I gave some DS9 episodes to a friend of mine and asked him, "Hey man, what are you looking at lately because I watched all TNG episodes," he said. "Well, I have these episodes from Farscape". I said, "Okay, let me try it" Back then, I was pretty sure I would not like it because I just finished TNG and thought it was great. "<br /> <br /> I had 3 episodes, but this one did not really impress me, I thought it was childish in the beginning and I thought it was just another TV program, beautiful adventures but regular The actors are not complete penetrated into the skin of the characters. <br /> <br /> I looked at three more episodes and thought that 3 Eps are not enough to decide if I like or not good understanding of the action and wanted to see what next to poor Crichton happened ... the rest is history. <br /> <br /> I think I like the freedom of the characters in the context of action unlike Star Trek, where everyone has been sleeping when they do should, and far too much high-tech bullshit. <br /> <br /> The show got better with each episode, very interesting s tory line ..... what can I say, this movie is like poetry. < br /> <br /> I highly recommend !!!
