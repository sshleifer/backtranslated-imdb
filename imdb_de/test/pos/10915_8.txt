I have seen this movie many times and never get full. It's about a man who comes out of the closet and does not know he's here. Kevin Kline's character is a teacher, and when one of his former students indicates that Kline's character is gay, people in his town speculate whether he is straight or gay. Kline's character wonders if he's straight or gay. The play is absolutely fantastic and hilarious with all actors. I found the movie very funny and heartwarming. I love this movie, it makes you laugh and you feel good when you look at it. I recommend this movie to everyone, you will have a great time to see it.
