The Betuiled was one of the few early Eastwood films that I had not seen until the DVD was shot today. And from the opening of the sepia shot to the macabre climax I was totally thrilled. Nowadays, too many filmmakers replace special effects, fast cuts and dizzying camera work instead of character-driven stories, but director Don Siegel knew how to get the maximum effect with this relatively simple storyline, and the characters are believable and engaging <br /> <br /> The story is about a ladies' graduation school that happened to be on the brink of various battles during the American Civil War. The south-supporting ladies find a heavily wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood); When he feels well again, he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women for his own purposes. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page is an excellent role in the role of the headmistress with a secret, and her descent into insanity is subtly conveyed. For a movie that plays virtually in a single place, he never loses the visual interest. There is even a chance that the normal status quo, which was abandoned for a long time when Eastwood's machinations were revealed, could return. But the mistresses are plunging onto a darker street ... <br /> <br /> This is a completely different style of filming from Dirty Harry the same director filmed that same year, and they are both equally great. Eastwood is great at playing against his usual stoic anti-hero image, but there is also something puzzling about his character. We never really know much about him before his imprisonment, and the viewer can freely decide on his well-shadowed person. Villain or victim? Whatever you think, all I can say is that I really liked it.
