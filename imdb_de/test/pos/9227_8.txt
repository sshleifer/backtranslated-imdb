Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer is not for people born before 1980 or after 1989. Most of these people would not appreciate the great things that make up the 80s cartoon. The fact that Rainbow Brite was turned into a movie is a guilty pleasure for many of us who remember watching the TV program as a kid. Granted, much of the dialogue is quite amusing and stupid, and the plot is not pointless, but it's still a very cool movie.
