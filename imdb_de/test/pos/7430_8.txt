Errol Flynn had a great talent for a comedy, which unfortunately was rarely exploited. Given the right material, this film shows that he was happily at home in the Cary Grant style, soft comedies. Of his various forays into the genre this is certainly the best. Patti Brady shows a great performance in the children's section and Eleanor Parker just looks stunning in the movie. An added bonus is the wonderful Hattie McDaniel, who unfortunately is little used in this film - a welcome presence. Flynn performs his comic duties with the same simple style he brought into his audacious roles. The fact that he makes it look like it's easy does not mean it is. A super little family comedy, great for the Christmas season or anytime you feel like cheering up.
