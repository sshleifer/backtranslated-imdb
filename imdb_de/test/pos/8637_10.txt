Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is the master of cinematic expression. At the screening last night, I experienced a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. The performances are amazing, the score rousing and the photography fascinating. David's ability to translate the many elements of filmmaking into a unique and impressive cinematic experience is one of a kind. When I saw Mullholland Drive, I could not help but realize that we are truly blessed with David Lynch in this world. Cinema is also blessed, as David Lynch's films show that the vision of a man can be realized with amazing results. We know that blockbusters are not the only way. We know that a true movie artist has a chance in this world and that we are truly blessed.
