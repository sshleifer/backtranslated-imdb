House of Dracula works from the same assumption as the House of Frankenstein from the previous year; namely the three most famous monsters of Universal; Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man appear together in the movie. Of course, the film is therefore pretty messy, but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to make sure the 67 minutes of the movie are not boring. It is obvious that the idea of ​​making another monster porridge came into the mind of the writer before there was an actual plot, since the yarn we receive is not without holes. In the plot, Count Dracula arrives at Dr. Ing. Edelman to ask for a cure for his vampirism. What then can only be called coincidence sees Lawrence Talbot a.k.a. The wolf man appears and asks for a cure for his suffering! It turns out that Dracula is hunting for Edelman's daughter, but Talbot is really serious. When it turns out he can not turn himself into a wolf, The Wolf Man throws himself into the sea ... where he finds Frankenstein's monster. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not seen. As good as the former Frankenstein house. The 1944 film put its action together better than this entry in the series, as the plot here does not give the same time to any universal monster. Dracula's conspiracy is initially the biggest, but is soon relieved to eventually reappear. The Wolfman is the star of the show, but his story never really develops and is essentially just another version of the storyline he finds himself in again and again. Frankenstein's monster gets the coldest hand because it only appears as an imitator in the movie and an obvious excuse to make sure all three monsters appear in the movie. The story of the doctor who unites all three is the most interesting, but this is a bit disappointing, as he is not the reason why people will see this movie. Acting is good enough. John Carradine shows his scary side and Lon Chaney Jr makes sure that his character is immersed in a tragedy. Glenn Strange has nothing to do, and Onslow Stevens proves to be Dr. Edelman the true climax. Overall, this movie will not do much for anyone who is not a fan of Universal Horror. But as silly monster movies go, House of Dracula is worth seeing.
