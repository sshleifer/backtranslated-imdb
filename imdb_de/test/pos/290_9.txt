Breathtaking in its best form, fascinating in its worst form. The groundbreaking epic "Apocalypse Now" by Francis Ford Coppala is one of the most famous and famous movies of the 20th century. In my opinion, the biggest movie that has ever had anything to do with Vietnam in the US has been <br /> <br />. What I like most about "Apocalypse Now" is that it clearly differs from all other films of the same genre. Grown up as a film fanatic and with a particular interest in war films, I have seen many films that have attempted to portray the "images" and "feelings" of Vietnam, but were unsuccessful. Films such as "Hamburger Hill" and "We Was Soldaten" fall into the category of trying to capture Vietnam's atmosphere by depicting "heroic battles", which are mostly affected by the zeal of Hollywood film production /> <br /> In There are no battles, no heroes or villains, nothing in the film suggests that it is intended to reflect Vietnam's images through the physical aspects of the war. Rather, it is a film that vividly explores and explores the human psyche, plagued by the absolute "horror" of the darkest military conflict of the last century. The sheer brilliance of The Acting (in particular the interpretation of silent captain Willard by Martin Sheen) and the spectacular cinematography (shot in the Philippines), which gives the film a decisive realism, make 'Apocalypse Now' an unforgettable epic. <br /> <br /> Awakening a variety of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation, 'Apocalypse now' is not for the carefree moviegoer. It is a masterpiece that requires multiple views in order to be fully appreciated.
