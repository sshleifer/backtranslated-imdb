This film is a gem ... an undiscovered Gerry Anderson classic. <br /> <br /> The origins of "UFO" and "Space 1999" are evident in this film, including the cast list that includes the late Ed Bishop and George Sewell, both of whom have gone on "UFO". <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Anderson, despite his many TV successes, had no chance to develop his talent on the big screen. Imagine what he could have done with the movie version of "Thunderbirds" (which he rightly discredited!). <br /> <br /> I'm sure if you give "JTTFSOTS" / "Doppleganger" a fair you will appreciate it's good grades.
