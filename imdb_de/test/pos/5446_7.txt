"Man of the Year" tells the story of Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), a political comedian (like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert) who has his own television program. In his show, he talks about all sorts of things, but his main focus is on political issues that he very much believes. One day on his show, a fan of the audience came up with the idea that Dobbs was running for the President of the United States. Millions entered the Internet after the broadcast to submit various petitions and express their opinion on why Dobbs would make a great candidate for the President of the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to run for presidency and win the election. Everything seems to go as planned until a woman named Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) shows up and starts a controversy about her position. A funny yet serious political thriller is emerging? <br /> <br /> If you go into this movie and expect to see a mindless comedy, you will be disappointed. I always wonder how some people are movie marketers when I see how misleading their marketing campaigns are. "Man of the Year" is an excellent example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from posters and trailers to online advertising makes this movie look like a comedy. I have to say honestly that 1/3 of the movie is funny, while the rest plays as a political thriller that provides good arguments and makes the audience think. In that case, I somehow wonder if the marketing was intentional, as this film addresses fairly serious issues between its comedy routines. <br /> <br /> But enough about marketing, let's take a look at the movie itself. <br /> I really liked "Man of the Year," though I expected to see a comedy instead of a serious movie. One of the many things I owe to this film is that the movie does a decent job of switching between comedy and drama, even if it seems a bit awkward at first. I truly believe that once you find out that the movie is more of a political thriller than a comedy, you feel comfortable with it. Some do not like it because they think they see a comedy and do not understand what this movie is trying to say in the end, but for these people they can blame the marketers for not properly promoting the film. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" talks about many things and seems to have a very strong opinion. While Tom Dobbs is talking, he says things that need to be said, and it's not about sweets they cover. I also think the whole political plot, while most critics say the film was probably hurt because of the misleading marketing, was very good. The idea of ​​computerized voting has been thrown in recent years, and given the problems computers have, the problem in this film has become quite realistic. The control that large companies have on voting is also addressed. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, I believe everyone involved has done a good job. Robin Williams had the chance to be funny at the same time by playing Tom Dobbs. Some say Williams has outdone his greeting as a comedian, but personally I still think it's funny and he's also a good, serious actor. This is probably one of the few occasions when we see it going from serious to funny, and I think it works well. It's also nice to see Lewis Black's co-star in a decent movie. Again, I like Black when he appears in The Daily Show and gets up, but most of the movies he was in were awful. This was a good movie for him, because I think his political views fit the story that director Barry Levinson tried to convey. Laura Linney is a good addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and, after all, Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are both doing very well as usual with the roles they are given. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who brought us films like "Rain Man", "Good Morning Vietnam" and "Wag the Dog". Levinson has done a good job of writing and directing the film. As I said, I know that many critics did not like the whole political thriller aspect of the movie, but I thought it would fit well. It was really nice to watch a mainstream movie where I could think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson has done a good job with this film. <br /> <br /> In the end, do not go into this movie and expect the movie the commercials sell to you. It has laughter, but at the same time it plays more as a political drama. It's not as stupid or stupid as the marketing campaign makes you believe. I thought it was good that this movie was not a typical Hollywood movie. At the same time it tried to be a comedy and a serious drama and at least worked for me. I like the fact that the movie did not really mitigate the issues raised and did not have a typical Hollywood ending. I tried to call the end from the beginning, but surprisingly it did not end up the way I thought, which made me happy. It's a movie that will make you laugh, but then you can think about it a few minutes later and ask what's going to happen next. I think it's a good movie that gets hurt by its bad marketing.
