Oliver Stone hits the bull's eye with this film, thanks largely to the electrifying screen presence of Bogosian and the biting, brilliant screenplay. Every moment crackles with an ever-growing tension and creates a truly memorable cinematic experience. If there ever was an indication that a writer and a director can combine two very volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is the right solution! The result is a powerhouse that may now become more contemporary, perhaps because of the disturbing fascination of our culture for celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame. <br /> <br /> An ultimate charge of increasing morbidity in our society and self-starving hunger for the next big thrill. <br /> <br /> A movie that is not easily forgotten. I can recommend it to anyone who is interested in the dark side of human nature.
