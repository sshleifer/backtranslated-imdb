I have always enjoyed Frank Sinatra's music and recently I wrote a homework about his life story. I was fascinated by the life and legend of Ol 'Blue Eyes. However, I have never seen one of his films. So I wanted to see if his acting was as good as his singing. Well, it was like that! I was thrilled with his performance in this movie! He really does a great job as a heroin addict Frankie Machine, who tries to reunite his life and acts as a drummer for a local band. <br /> <br /> The direction of Otto Preminger is also great. I have not seen any of his other films. I read his biography in the IMDB. He seems to be one of those directors who were painfully misunderstood, and people had conflicting thoughts about him. Seems like a person who appeals to cult lovers the most. I have not seen enough of his films to know for sure if he's really brilliant, but now I'm curious. I want to see more of his films because this man has talent after trying "The Man with the Golden Arm". I also loved the music for this movie. The score definitely contains the kind of music I remember when I ever hear it again. Then you know that you have a great score. <br /> <br /> The supportive services are also fine, including Darren McGavin as the local drug spotter, Eleanor Parker as Frankie's wife in a wheelchair, and Kim Novak as a lover. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how filmmakers deal with the issue of substance abuse, as opposed to modern attempts in films like "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream". In 1955, the mere mention of the word "drugs" sparked controversy, and if you look at the film, the topic was kept at a very discreet level. There's only one scene where Frankie actually gets heroin sprayed in his arm, and they showed a close-up of the reaction of his face instead of the needle sticking graphically in his veins. But it has conveyed its message without feeling confused. In such dramatic drama with powerful performances and direction, you do not need graphic depictions of drug abuse to thrill the audience. <br /> <br /> "The Man with the Golden Arm" is a dramatic gem that all movie fans should watch. It is really an amazing job! <br /> <br /> My score: 8 (out of 10)
