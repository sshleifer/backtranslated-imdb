OK. Anyone who invented this movie hates humanity and wants them all to cut their throats. This "movie" was absolutely and absolutely dirty. What the hell was going on with those weird old bag eyes? Seriously, did she have any horrible drug and thought she could just control people? She ran around with her damned evil eye and it was like? Do I have a booger hanging out of my nose? What are you staring at? Are you like the sea witch or something? All in all, I thought the graphics were a top-notch old guy. I would give it ten for that alone. Just cover your ears when you see it. The pure and complete evil that comes from this movie makes your ears bleed and your eyelids fall off. Who knows? You could even get a knot in your small intestine. You better take care of fools.
