I saw this last night at the London Film Festival, apparently the shorter version. James McNally's summary of the content of the film is very good. Nossiter very cleverly integrates his study of the wine business into further concerns about globalization, homogenization, the impact of the mass media, the power of capital, and the need for diversity. The film is shot by hand. DV thought some of them awkward, but this allowed Nossiter to surprise people on a number of occasions that would probably not have been possible with conventional equipment. <br /> <br /> Despite the stretched feeling of the film, the editing is very sharp and not only gives us a parade of dogs in the world, but also undercuts some of the respondents' comments with somewhat contradictory visual imagery and gives others enough rope to to hang up. To a certain extent, this reminded Michael Moore's recent work (though Nossiter works in a more subtle way), but the roots of the film probably stem from Marcel Ophul's The Sorrow and the Pity, both in terms of film and composition the emergence of the "salt of the earth" French peasants as the stars. De Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF screening and answered questions afterwards. In fact, we all need a little clutter - Bravo Hubert! All in all, a great movie whose impact goes beyond the world of wine to the way we construct ourselves and organize our world.
