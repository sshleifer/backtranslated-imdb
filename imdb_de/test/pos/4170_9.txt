My friends and have been through a period of renting movies none of us ever heard of. The only good thing was this movie, "Take it to limit". Right at the beginning of the film, we realized that we had a real classic. The music is probably played by rural white guys from Colorado, but sounds just like the rap of the early '90s. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad boy so well, especially because he has given the whole movie a big punch. This movie is based on climbing, and I'm not a climber. Still, I find it funny when the climber has difficulty climbing and there is a guy in the background who basically goes up the cliff. You do not want to miss this movie, you will see the same clips over and over again. You will experience surprises at every turn. You will find that you quote the memorable lines. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Take it snow. Disclaimer: This movie is done badly, but that makes it great
