An exciting, surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students who flatten themselves and then revive them to share their death experiences and what lies behind them. Joel Schumacher stages with some skill - both very scary and especially beautiful scenes. The visions of death are neither what spectators expect, nor what we all expect when we leave - thanks to screenwriter Peter Filardi, who has done a great job. While the story's creativity is impressive, the story also has many holes, especially in the logic department and credibility factors. Despite all this, Flatliners is a very good movie because of the script, the direction, which in turn is sometimes very surreal, and the acting that brings together four very talented actors and William Baldwin. This core of actors acts and reacts very well to each other. Keifer Sutherland has an impressive job as the head of the group - the one who comes up with the idea of ​​dying and being born again. He also manages to portray a man - a young man - with a damaging, destructive secret from his past. Kevin Bacon is the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group. Oliver Platt is really good as the voice of reason and human fears. Platt has some really good lines and plays paranoia well. Yes, Julia Roberts is here too and very good. The actors do it best by playing each other out and making us believe that they are such good friends. I was very impressed with Flatliners, but most of all, the story touched me the most. The scene in which this dog hobbled on the street was just one of those powerful images that were created like many of the "flashback" scenes.
