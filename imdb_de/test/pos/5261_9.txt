I am a 58 year old man. On a rainy afternoon, my wife suggested that we visit The Women. After reading the reviews, I thought it might lead to a nap. Wrong: This movie kept my interest from beginning to end. It was great to finally see Meg Ryan look great again. Honestly, Meg looks a lot better with long hair. Annette Benning looked different in every scene she was in. Candice Bergen shows her age as does Carrie Fisher. The daughter Molly was played by the young India for once. I could understand the dialogue that is hard in many recent movies due to the quick speech. Cloris Leachman and the woman from Finland were great housekeepers extending their regular duties. The NYC scenes were nice to see. Oh, and Bette Midler had a short role, but as usual, was terrific. So I gave this chick movie a 9. Guys-Go, see yourself for the feast of the eyes like Eva Mendes. It will not disappoint.
