Dekalog Five was an interesting visual experience for me, because Kieslowski seems to subtly ask the audience. Three men are at the center of this chapter, and Kieslowski presents the two involved in the murder with both good and bad qualities (almost overwhelmingly bad in one case). With such vile characters, I was almost glad that they would receive some kind of punishment. However, when the time comes for the murder (and its impact on the killer), Kieslowski takes an interesting view and seems to ask those of us who have shared my view, "Are not you as guilty as this man?" This kind of indirect approach to the audience makes the finale of Decalog Five all the deeper as Kieslowski (as usual) does not stay within the boundaries of his theme. Just as the other parts of the Decalogue do not take the subject of the commandment in the true sense of the word, so did not Dekalog Five. It asks us what is murder, who is guilty of murder, and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any? It's a fantastic movie and absolutely typical of Kieslowski.
