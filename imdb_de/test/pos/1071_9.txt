At first I loved the documentation. It represents a new school history / theory in which an issue can reflect a variety of social and historical problems. <br /> <br /> I'll clear the camera and the dogs first. I hate the Blair Witch quality of the camera, but also understand the advantage of such a casual approach. In fact, I agree with the other reviewer that he offers us unprecedented access. Dogs: Warning, I have a doctoral degree in literature that I DO NOT use as a profession, so it may be that part of my training is being used Leakage: The dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of man's great efforts and our need to find the work to reach her. The dogs could reflect their owners, as one reviewer suggested. But they also serve as a substitute for the workers we see in the movie. While this may point to the Marxist problem that was addressed by a reviewer, it also shows, in my opinion, how difficult it is to globalize labor issues. No Mondovi's in Italy can not translate so well elsewhere. (Yikes, I'm a Marxist at heart and I hate to hear my cynical resignation waver!) It's a remarkable bait and a change. The dogs are a family, the workers are a family. But in the end, the dogs are the workers (the last scene with the poor farmer). Even if you disagree with politics, the artistry of analogy, coupled with the film's more open politics, is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Only Faulkner (I am from Alabama) had the power of film beyond the Hollywood market, which would have told interesting stories.
