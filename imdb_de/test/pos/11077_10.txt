I do NOT like these anime cartoons (eg Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Naruto), but Zatch Bell is different in my opinion. Zatch Bell is more exciting, has better characters, and does not focus so much on some sort of weapon or mamodo, as well as the episodes I've seen. Zatch Bell really focuses on the life of stranger Zatch, the clever Kiyo, the Clueless Suzy, and the Weird Ponygon. Zatch Bell is probably my fav cartoon For the time being, but I encourage others to watch 1 episode, you will most likely like it! <br /> <br /> -Robbie H. (aka Vectorman)
