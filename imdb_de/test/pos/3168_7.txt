I found that very "different" compared to most modern Shakespeare interpretations and I liked it a lot. It would not be useful to those who study it at school because it does not show the traditional Shakespearean interpretations (ie, Miranda is rather punky compared to your traditional Shakespearean lady), but for the understanding of the game and for the Basis of the game story is a very strong piece and fantastic to look at. It also does not contain the right format, as Miranda is currently being played in a production of Acts and Scenes and most of her lines have been cut and some scenes have been split and mixed, but it is very useful and I would definitely do it recommend it as a must, even if you just saw it! Shakespeare fans would love that!
