Someone I know said there was this movie called Flatliners, which was probably in my street. I was told about this movie after watching Final Destination 2 and seeing the added feature of Near Deth Experience. <br /> <br /> I bought the flatliner DVD for the modest price of 5 pounds. Come home and seen. And I could not help smiling and wondering that this movie had not been in my life before. The film is about a group of medical students trying to see what it's like after death. But then sins come back in reality and can physically harm them. <br /> <br /> The actions of Kevin Bacon and Keifer Sutherland are great as you would expect from a couple. And Joel Schmacheur made this movie into a great movie, as he did with the lost guys. <br /> <br /> This is a nervous and stylish thriller that is not another type of movie fan.
