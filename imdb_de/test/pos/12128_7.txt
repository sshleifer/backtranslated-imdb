A very accurate representation of the filmed in New Jersey small mob life. The story, the characters and the script are believable, but acting drops the ball. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile, especially for the strong pictures, to have some of them still with me, even if I looked at this 25 years ago for the first time. A young hood enters and starts to do bigger things (but tries) Things keep going awry and the local boss suspects that his end is being skimmed off. It is not a good place if you enjoy your health or your life. <br /> <br /> This is the movie Joe Pesce introduced to Martin Scorsese. Also present is the perennial screen man Frank Vincent. Strong on characterizations and visuals. The sound is confused and the acting is complex, but a great story.
