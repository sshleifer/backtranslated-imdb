I consider saboteur as Hitchcock's first "American" movie because the story plays completely in the US. <br /> <br /> There are brilliant scenes in this film. Statue of Liberty, Barry Kane jumps from the bridge into the water, waterfall scene is amazing. It's not Hitchcock's fault that he did not get the actors he wanted. Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper for the lead roles in Foreign Correspondent and Saboteur. But Gary Cooper was not interested in a thriller. Another reason why Hitchcock did not get big stars was that he was not one of the top directors. Although Rebecca was a great success, most of the film's success went to producer David O. Selznick. For example, David O. Selznick received the Best Picture Oscar for Rebecca. And Hitchcock did not get a Best Director Oscar for Rebecca. Hitchcock began to attract some attention after the Foreign Correspondent (1940). But Universal gave him a low budget for saboteur (1942). Hitchcock tried to win Joel McCrea for this movie because he was willing to work with Hitchcock again for a low salary. He liked working with Hitchcock in the Foreign Correspondent (1940). But he was not reachable. The role went to Robert Cummings. Hitchcock called Robert Cummings "a competent actor". I thought he did his best. He was a lesser known actor willing to play a role when many great actors refused to take the male lead role. As a female lead Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwyck as the lead role. They were not interested either. So Universal decided to give Priscilla Lane the role. I read in a book that this is one of her favorite movies. <br /> <br /> I also liked the scene in Blind Man's house. This is my favorite scene. If we look closer at the dialogue in scenes that occur in Uncle Philip's house, we will see how intense he is. Uncle Philip (Blind Man) studied Barry Kane's character the moment he entered his house. The moment Barry entered his house, he heard Barry's handcuffs. Through a conversation, he realized that Barry Kane is not a criminal at all. We also see his hearing through these scenes. For example, Barry hears the sound of a car: "Is the car coming?" Uncle Philip says "2 cars I think." Uncle Philip was right. We see 2 cars in the next scene. Priscilla Lane has done her job very well. She was not a big star. But I really liked her performance. Another brilliant scene in Uncle Philip's house is the scene in which he asks Priscilla Lane (Patricia Martin), "Are you scared, Pat?" I thought Otto Kr√ºger had played the villain brilliantly, Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey as the villain, but he did Declined Harry Carey is famous for his role, Mr. President in "Mr. Smith goes to Washington. "I'd like to mention more about this movie, but I think my contribution is going to be too long. <br /> <br /> Every Hitchcock movie is special in its own way, I'm sure Hitchcock Fans like this movie, I rate 10 out of 10.
