One of the best-known, lesser-known occult-oriented horror films of the seventies. It's dark, exciting, scary, surrealistic here and there, and sometimes even very clever, which can not be said of many films of this kind. I can not help but see some piercing symbolic and metaphorical points in the 70s when the movie was completed. The scriptwriter obviously cooked, while he also provided some good old scenes from the tomb. With a good job of a creative director, the result is entertaining and thought-provoking. The simple but effective ending highlights how these things are handled correctly by those who can. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast was mostly unknown to me except LQ Jones as a moody but funny sheriff and Strother Martin as a city doctor. Not surprisingly, Martin always steals the movie. With this voice and his skills he is for me one of the biggest loons in the cinema anyway. What an actor! <br /> <br /> So it's a bit of a mystery to me why this movie did not gain much recognition. I think that besides Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, it would have earned an almost equal place in the occult horror canon. A Helluva movie!
