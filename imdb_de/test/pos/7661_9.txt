Hercules the Avenger is by far the best single entry in the Muscleman genre that I can remember. The critics' charge - it's a cut-and-paste process from two previous Hercules films, has been updated with new material to make it look fresh - and it misses the fact that this cut- and paste approach one of the key issues of sword and sandal films. For most of these films, the middle third sagged horribly - usually a juicy love story or an Arcane political intrigue or both (the queen falls in love with Hercules and her evil brothers' plans against her, etc.) to see the exciting finale. Hercules the Avenger cuts all the crap out of the original films and adds a rather vivid narrative of a Hercules impersonator battling his way into power. (It should be noted that this episode is also a distant but clearly critical comment on the rise of fascism in Italy.) This is also a fine wrasslin match between the real Hercules and his impersonator. <br /> <br In In a closer focus, I would like to add that the further processing has improved the single scenes borrowed from the other films. For my money, the mutiny scene here is much better than it originally came to Hercules and the Captive Women, as it has been exacerbated by the reduction of some characters and their complications. <br /> <br /> There are also diskettes monsters, creepy underworld atmospheres borrowed (literally) from Mario Bava, a whole ruined city, and the usual crowd of pretty babes in revealing dresses. Since no one expects any of these films to compete with The Seven Samurai - or even The Magnificent Seven - it seems a bit fussy to hold the film's bond against other films.
