I feel privileged to have seen this movie by mistake. I actually came across this movie by accident. I recorded another movie on Showtime overnight and shot it overnight, and that movie started after that. So I sat and watched and boy, I was blown away. The spectacle is absolutely great. Kathy Bates ..., who has been my favorite actress since Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes, did an amazing job as a domineering mother desperately trying to uphold her old school values ​​(religion, family) with the risk of estrangement from her family. Martin Sheen excels as a "tough" patriarch who really does not control anything in his life or family. What I really loved about this movie is how he tells what happens when the heroes come home. It shows the real harm inflicted on our soldiers after they have waged useless wars for political and financial purposes. This movie just blew me away and I feel blessed to have accidentally recorded and seen this movie. This is a must for anyone who wants a true drama, this is not too melodramatic and preaching, but draws like no other at your heart
