Would you like to know why Frenchmen and Italians love / hate each other? Would you like to get an insight into the history of our lives? Watch Virzi's film (in the original language, of course) and watch a wonderful Monica Bellucci, who eventually speaks her mother tongue from Citt√† di Castello (Umbria, on the Tuscan border). And the rest of the characters speak Livornese (the lovely Sabrina Impacciatore and everyone else). Daniel Auteuil is definitely in his shoes with Napoleon. Have fun, a real fresco of the landscape of Elba Island and a picture of the political reasons for killing or keeping a tyrant alive (good for all time).
