Growing up in the late 60's and 70's, I could not help but become a fan of science fiction. With America's top-of-the-range space program, science fiction books, movies, TV shows, and comic books have brought my imagination and opened up the possibilities that the universe offers. Farscape is more unique than any other sci-fi show, but it contains all the ingredients that make up Star Trek, Battlestar Gallatica, X-Files, and Deep Space Nine shows. One of Farscape's criticisms is that the random viewer can not just go in and see an episode and understand what's going on. There were other very successful shows that used several episode stories and intricate characters. This is one of the charms of the show for me. I do not need or want the story to be neatly connected at the end of each episode, as the various incarnations of Star Trek have done. All in all, Farscape has wonderful and witty characters and a flowing storyline that says that while humans are the least developed or most advanced intelligent species in the universe, they still have unique qualities and abilities. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the shortsighted people on the sci-fi channel canceled Farscape Season 5. You have stated that the cancellation was based on declining ratings. Only a few years ago it was her best rated original series and a critical favorite. It's a shame that all the artists involved in this show will not be able to continue their love work because the control issues of each channel / company made it possible. <br /> <br /> Hey, do not take my word for it, look at the show, look at the repetitions and decide. Help save Farscape!
