This is the ultimate and I mean the ULTIMATE, ADVENTURE CLASSIC! The action is good against the evil. There has always been an abundance of films showing gray areas, and not enough about the basic good against evil to explain the real cases of good versus evil in the real world. Recently, filmmakers have tried to balance the odds. In real life, well over half of the situations are black and white, but only a fraction of the films make it appear that way. This movie is the best example of a white background. It is best to see in black and white. The hero is in the worst situation. He is in the territory of a man who wants to murder him, and between different enemies. The film gives the feeling that he is hopelessly inferior and can not count on help. His enemy (The Count) has many resources. The Count's wife was forced into marriage with him, and she knows from his past that sooner or later he will kill her, like all his wives. She and the hero become allies and fall in love with each other in the distance, who could convince every onlooker (unless this person just wants to be an opposite brat). Everyone who helps them is killed. You have no escape. The situation is hopeless. Will they survive in the end? You will not guess, unless you've read spoilers. The movie also has a lot of great atmosphere, adventure and intrigue, along with Lon Chaney as the villain and Boris Karloff in his best role, as a decent guy. Karloff, who is usually cast as a villain, was best when presented with more complex roles like this one. Chaney rarely got a complex role, though he brought his stuff in a couple of films like "Of Mice and Men." That is little more than a cameo to him. Nevertheless, the tension never stops. There is tension and danger everywhere. Perfectly written, perfectly staffed and perfectly directed. This is what a movie should be, pure escape, pure adventure.
