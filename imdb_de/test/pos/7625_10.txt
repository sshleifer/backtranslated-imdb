Once a wise man from India said: "First they will laugh at us, then they will hate us, and then they will fear us." Know that the budget of this movie was a bit worn, but even then, with its story, it will be interesting many years later, no matter what it looked like. But soon to know, "Mast Thrust" will appear again on the big screen in due course. Then he and the redesigned T-Rex will more than shock you. It will scare many for many centuries !! This movie is in the current pre-production and will not be anything you've ever seen before! <br /> <br /> This goes beyond the THX format ... directly into 4-DX format. <br /> <br /> "Fear, be VERY scared!"
