Footprints is a very interesting movie that is difficult to categorize. "Psychological Thriller" is the most appropriate description I can imagine. The protagonist Alice Cespi discovered that she remembers nothing of the last three days. The only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel. She is also being followed by a recurring, very vivid dream about a sci-fi movie that she believes she saw many years ago. In her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia, she does not trust anyone, but gradually it becomes clear that she has visited the city in which the hotel was previously located. This is an exciting film whose main advantage is that it is virtually impossible to predict how events will evolve and, in particular, how they will end. The unusual loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of all the other people ensure that the good old feeling of the paranoid in the entire film is present, while beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this film visually attractive. The important part of the one and only Nicoletta Elmi, the ubiquitous red-haired, vile child star of Italian horror, is an added bonus.
