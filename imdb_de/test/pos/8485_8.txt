Let's not go crazy: Taylor Hackford's undoubtedly glittering film has little to distinguish itself from the biopic genre, except for Jamie Foxx's extraordinary performance making career. Do you remember the year they presented the Special Effects Oscar to Terminator 2-Boffins, undisputed? You should do the same with this year's Best Actor Gong. <br /> <br /> That Ray Charles's story is deserved is not contentious. In fact, the many flashbacks to his traumatic childhood are well treated and used wisely. But for such a unique life, the film seems incredibly formulaic and familiar. It follows the "story of a faulty genius" almost to the letter: hardness and exploitation, women and drugs, inclusion of disputes, gang fights, rehab, yes, yes, yes. And there certainly was more humor in his life than we are treated here. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Charles' music, but where neatly cut medleys would keep the story going, Hackford spoils himself with almost full-bodied rendition of too many songs - in gin joints, in the recording studio, in concert halls, infinity. Narrative and non-devotees look like a cinematic brake. This may sound like a tough judgment on a musical biopic, but with a catalog as extensive as Ray's, we need a taste, not the whole dish. Otherwise we would buy the albums. <br /> <br /> As fascinated as I was, I looked at my watch several times. So for all Foxx brilliance, Ray might have been better served as a HBO two-parter?
