I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck, who was perhaps the hardest working actress of the '30s and' 40s, though few of her film roles are memorable. Today she is most remembered for the television program "The Big Valley". Stanwyck worked so much because she was permanent; It seems she will accept almost every role and make the best of it to make the film a success. The directors loved her and many ordinary images became more believable through her presence. <br /> <br /> And so it was for "Christmas in Connecticut" is a very ordinary effort whose conspiracy weighs on the faith and is not even really Christmas. However, there are Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan, as well as some outstanding actors such as Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall, there are twists and funny moments that in 1945 seemed undoubtedly more real than today. Initially, the storyline is a magazine author (Stanwyck) who the magazine's readers believe is a house goddess, married to a child and living on a Connecticut farm, but is truly single, living in New York City and nothing about cooking and nothing knows housework Could someone get away with such a scam even then? Apparently even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived, although one would think he had seen the deception long ago, but the story continues and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, a sailor, recently survived from his sunken ship (Morgan) and Stanwyck's restaurant friend (SZSakall) spends Christmas in Connecticut on a farm owned by Stanwyck's bourgeois friend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities while the fraud is going on as it has to. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the regent, but one wonders how she can endure it. Morgan and Stanwyck fall in love, but he should be engaged and she should be married. Regardless, they begin what appears to be an affair, dancing their cheeks on cheeks and stealing them in a horse-drawn sleigh. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who saw Stanwyck and Morgan go together but still does not understand that one of the neighbors takes back a child borrowed as part of the deception, and calls on the police to report a kidnapping , Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sled, and the dizziness begins to spin. <br /> <br /> At this point the film is weird as ridiculous or absurd, not funny ha, ha and it routinely ends up doing screwball comedies as usual The good one gets the girl and probably they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie every Christmas, to see these character actors at their best, in a story that reflects the way of 1945 a long fascinated fascination with Barbara Stanwyck. Fortunately, it was shot at Christmas or like 95% of Stanwyck's films, it would have been forgotten, and we would not see it every year.
