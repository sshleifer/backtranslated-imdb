An entertaining, funny film about the German spy of the Second World War (Julie Andrews!), Who falls in love with the American pilot (Rock Hudson) while trying to get secrets from him. For some reason, critics attacked it in 1970 and shunned it - I can not understand why. It is beautifully shot, has wonderful costumes and interiors, and exciting aerial combat. In addition, Andrews has a striptease (strictly PG material) and sings a beautiful song - "Whistling in the Dark". The movie has problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the shoot - and that shows. Their love scenes have no spark and they have no sexual chemistry. Nevertheless, they turn in OK. The movie is a bit long (even in the 105-minute Director's Cut I've seen) and ends up being too dark and serious. Still worth a visit. See the directors cut ... the other half an hour longer!
