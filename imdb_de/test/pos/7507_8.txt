Dr. Bock teaches in the hospital and he's pretty good at it. The thing about him is that he is depressed. Dr. Bock and his wife split up, his children are dismissive, he can not perform in the bedroom, and he feels he is not doing a good job of healing people. He becomes suicidal, but meets Barbara, who changes his ideas for the better. Around this story there is a crime-scene murder and a group of angry demonstrators outside. <br /> <br /> The film is well done and the character of Dr. Bock is well played. It's a bit sad, a bit funny and a bit of a drama. It was nice to see some stories about the hospital, even if they had no relation to what Dr. med. Bock did. Great movie.
