The film deals with universal themes, with no specific country being called context: it could happen anywhere - and essentially, if not in shape. Those who are concerned with issues of 1st Amendment, censorship, etc., but who do not want to be bored with lectures, need art like this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire a subconscious character actor; He shines in this movie and shows several acting talents you need to see (but I have not seen him perform poorly, even in not so great movies). Stowe may show her best performance (and proves that she owns one of the most eye-catching pairs in Hollywood) - in two words: stunning and convincing. The set design fits perfectly with the situation in function and mood. The sound processing increases the corresponding effect. The overall contrast conveyed by the animated sequences is a perfect symbolic tool - and the welcome and only relief to most of the necessary site of the story. The script is close and indispensable with a dramatic yet realistic dialogue (ie how it could be and should be). Perhaps the most amazing aspect to deal with is the fact that 1) the director is out for the first time; and 2) he is the writer. In a sentence: a tour de force - with three recommendations: you see it, you have a copy, you see it again and again, to fathom all its secrets and to capture all genius.
