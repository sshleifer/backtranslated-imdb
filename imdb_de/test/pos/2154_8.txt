I saw this great documentary at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. It is extremely poignant and well-crafted, drawing you into the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960s and 70s. While I was familiar with his more familiar compositions ("One is the loneliest number", "Without you"), I learned of this brilliant writing and the beautiful singing of this man. If you love music, you will be plentifully involved in its world, which unfortunately got out of control as its success increased and its past pursued it. As sad as he was, he was totally devoted to his family and you will be so happy to meet this man. The profile is effectively narrated by Nilsson's own words and those of his friends and colleagues (a virtual Who's Who of Rock) who have loved and respected him. Do not miss this!
