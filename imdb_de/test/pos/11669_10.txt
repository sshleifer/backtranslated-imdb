I'm amazed how a filmmaker notorious for his political zeal can make such a subtle, non-sacred image. If you are for the death penalty, you will still be in favor after seeing this. If you are against the death penalty, you are still against it. Whatever your attitude, this movie will at least make you think about why you feel the way you do. There is no wrong sound in the movie.
