Vidor shines as Judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family. Her brother David is so depressed by her father that it's a surprise that he's even able to put on his shoes instead of asking daddy to do it for him I will not cool it down; However, I would like to point out that even Nan, who is pregnant by David, is married to him. This is not an extramarital pregnancy that would have been dreadful by the 1921 standards. The two are secretly married, but Nan's father, who was paid by David's father, rips her marriage certificate. Nan's death scene with Judith is a truly heartbreaking experience charged with emotion. Just for this scene, it's worth watching the movie, but the plot has much more to offer. Why on earth are modern films not made with the same attention to history?
