I totally loved this movie, I tried to buy it and can not find it. A must, a movie that you can see again and again, funny, but also a tear wanker in one. really good album for the movie. It's a really good movie from the 80's, I wish I could find a copy to buy this movie, because I would do it, the actors have really acted well movie as well. So, go out and try to rent it, you will not regret it. It's an older movie, but worth it to see it. I would not be surprised if he did a remake of this movie soon, but I'm sure it would not be the same. If you have not seen it yet, you can rent it.
