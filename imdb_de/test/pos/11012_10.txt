When I saw this movie for the first time, I was very impressed with the atmosphere the director creates. It is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in 1974. When you see the movie, you will see many sets and customs that today are referred to as crazy and modern. The theme of the film is the old question "What is real and what is illusion?". If you see "The Matrix", you will see many similarities. The two films are not comparable at all, because "Welt am Draht" is art and "The Matrix" is entertainment. If the first one is dearer. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I lost my video copy of it. <br /> <br />
