There must have been a sale in this story in the 1940s. An epidemic threatens New York (it's always New York) and nobody takes it seriously. Some may say that Richard Widmark and Jack Palance did better in Panic in the Streets, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> There's always something about these Poverty Row productions that really touch a nerve. The production values ​​are never so polished and the spectacle is a bit rough around the edges, but that's why I think this movie and those who like it are effective. Rough, grainy, edgy. And the cast. All 2nd string or A-list actors exceed their prime. No egos here. These people were happy to get the job. Whitbissell, Carl Benton Reid, Jim Backus, Arthur Space, Charles Korvin, and the melodious voice of Reed Hadley flowing in the background like crude oil. Incidentally, I was in the hospital a few times. How come that my sisters never looked like Dorothy Malone? In such movies, they do not do much with make-up and hair, but they've really managed to turn Evelyn Keyes into a witch. Or maybe they just left the makeup and hair away. Anyway, it was pretty effective. She plays a lovesick jewel smuggler who picks up on a case of Small Pox in Cuba while smuggling jewels back to ultra-villain Charles Korvin (who bitches her sister in the meantime). They were looking for her for the jewels and the health department for her because she was settling in New York. No 4th amendment rights here. Everyone is being harassed. <br /> <br /> You have to have the right attitude to enjoy a movie like this one. I have a brother who tests movies to death. If they do not meet his Orson-Wellian standards, he will mercilessly bombard them. You must have the director-excellency of a David Lean movie, the score of Wolfgang von Korngold, the sound and style of Douglas Shearer and Cedric Gibbons, respectively. That's not it. <br /> <br /> But I have the right attitude and if you do, you will love this movie.
