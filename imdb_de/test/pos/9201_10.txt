This show is great! I love all actors! It has great storylines and characters. It's the perfect drama. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have great dialogues. They can both be very funny. I miss Vanessa Marcil from the General Hospital, but she's great. James Lesure is great! He can be funny. Molly Sims plays a fool very well. The writing is great! They keep an excellent pace. The show can really hang you, which is one of my favorite elements of a show. I can not wait until the new season starts. This show makes it one of the top ten of all my shows. I hope this show lasts very long. If people know what is good, it will be so. I never want the show to end. Ever.
