It starts a little slowly, but gives him a chance. In the spirit of the "Wackiest Ship in the Arm" and the "Pink Sub," this film is a not-so orthodox group that uses less orthodox methods to outsmart anyone. Rob Schneider is invaluable as LT, who takes himself too seriously, resulting in a failed mutinous attempt, and the "pirate" crew gets him on the plank. In contrast, Kelsey Grammar (similar to Cary Grant) does not do anything extraordinary except work. This movie is more about lines than about action. From the "keen" fishermen in the port of Charleston to the decoy "whales" - their antics surprised me and I laughed out loud.
