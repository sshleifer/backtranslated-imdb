During the Second World War, two Belorussian (Soviet) soldiers attempt to be occupied by the Nazis as they trudge through snow-covered terrain looking for food and security. If you do not like black and white "foreign" movies, you might like "Voskhozhdeniye" (retiled in English "The Ascent"). Director Larisa Shepitko performs the film extremely well, although it is mostly an introspective work. Her premature death in a car accident unfortunately made the last movie of this woman Shepitko. <br /> <br /> After the opening mission has been declared, there does not seem to be much that could happen in snowy forests. But Shepitko and a changed environment make it unexpectedly exciting. The leading players Vladimir Gostyukhin (as the mentally wounded "Rybak") and Boris Plotnikov (as the physically wounded "Sotnikov") avoid being suppressed by the ever-increasing symbolism. provoke a known story. <br /> <br /> ******** Voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) Larisa Shepitko ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin, Boris Plotnikov, Lyudmila Polyakova, Anatoly Solonitsyn
