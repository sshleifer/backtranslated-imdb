First of all, this movie has no story. It's obvious that many paraphrases were made during the production - sometimes the characters refer to a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably due to the fact that the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on set, the movie is somehow awesome. Pfeiffer is amazing - and I mean, as Catwoman; She pinpoints the inherent sexy darkness of the character and the good / bad tendencies. Walking is walking - but even more unpleasant than usual. Devito does not agree with the comic book when it comes to Penguin, but he is good and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keaton is underappreciated as Batman. <br /> <br /> And the music and the style are pure cinematic experiences. The third act does not work. But the last two scenes are knockouts, and it's clear that Pfeiffer and Keaton should be in a trilogy derailed by the confused darkness of this film. It's a pity, because Pfieffer and Keaton had classical chemistry and would have played them in a third episode, you know, who might not have had the chance to destroy Batman for a whole generation of movie fans.
