Jim Henson as Kermit, Dr. Teeth, Rowlf and Waldorf. <br /> <br /> Frank Oz as Fozzie, Piggy and Animal. Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper, Robin the Frog, Lew Zealand and Crazy Harry. Richard Hunt as Janice, Statler, Beaker and Scooter. Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Dr. Hunnydew and Zoot. <br /> <br /> Charles Durning and Mel Brooks. Cameos by Steve Martin, Carol Kane, Orson Welles, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor and others. <br /> <br /> This is the first Muppet movie of the billion others that came out and is by far the best! It's about the frog Kermit going on a trip to Hollywood and meeting the other characters on the way. Not only is this movie good, it also features great songs performed by the Muppets, including Rainbow Connection, Can You Picture That ?, Moving Right Along and others. This film, in contrast to the other Muppet films, has a strong sentimental value for me. It's such a nice movie. It is also noteworthy that there are many cameos with Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and a dozen others. <br /> <br /> My rating A plus. 109 min. rated G.
