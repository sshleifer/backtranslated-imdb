A movie about two Australian girls - Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) - and what happens when they become friends of two surfers. <br /> <br /> I caught this in an art cinema here in America in 1981. Technically, I was still a teenager (I was 19), so I was interested in how Australian teenagers behaved. Scriptually, there is nothing new here. It shows the usual teenage adventures that deal with dating, sex, suicide and so on. I always knew what would happen before it happened, but I was never bored. What I found interesting was that, despite the accent and some changes in clothing and hair, these adolescents did not differ much from American adolescents. They had many of the same difficulties and problems. Again, this was based on a book by a true surfer girl and her true life adventures, and (I hear) that it was a faithful adaptation of it. The acting was just okay, but the actors were attractive and that was well done and pretty interesting. So this is not an unsung masterpiece, but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it's like to be a teenager and try to be with the beloved children. I give a 7.
