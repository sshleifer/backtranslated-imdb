Rather than seeing the recycled history of "Pearl Harbor," there was nothing new to reveal except for a few real events involving a few people. The creators of the film could thus say that they contributed to spreading the story in addition to CGI explosions fill a juicy romantic triangle. You should see Dark Blue World. <br /> <br /> This film takes place during the historic WWII era, when Czech pilots left their homeland and fought for the RAF instead of laying their arms and giving in to the Nazis. It was part of the story that should be told to the outside world at least once. A love triangle takes place between the main characters, but one of them does not die off as in Pearl Harbor, but through victims for a real friendship. The film is a tragedy after the tragedy, with not even a bittersweet finish. Our hero does not enjoy returning his land, the love of his present lover, the love of his reunited lover, or even the unconditional return of love through his lifelong pet. He is absolutely heartbroken and does not feel worse in the Russian labor camp. This kind of ending is something that Hollywood would probably change if it were her screenplay. <br /> <br /> The film is sometimes sentimental, but it also shows people's humanity. Overall a worthwhile movie.
