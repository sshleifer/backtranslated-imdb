Personally, I loved TRIS MOVIE! My best friend told me about it, so I rented it and looked at it. It is wonderful! The music, the acting, the story characterizes the emotion, everything ... except for a small fact. Absolutely no loyalty to the books. I saw this movie before the interview with the vampire, and before I even knew there were any books, I was shocked at how many people actually hated the movie. I quickly realized that the bookfellows were not happy at all with the infidelity and did not want to be hypocritical (I hate the Harry Potter films for lack of book loyalty) and remained silent. Finally, I found "The Vampire Lestat" and immediately understood why everyone hated it. It's totally different (The movie Queen of the Damned is a combination of "The Vampire Lestat" and "The Queen of the Damned"). But I still loved the movie when I saw it before I read one of the books. If you have not seen this movie or have not read the book, first watch the movie or hate it. If you've read the book, you have every right to hate this movie.
