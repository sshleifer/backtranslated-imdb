This is such a revered and studied film, a classic among the many by Hitchcock. It's no frills to want to see him again. But you think: can it last, even if the big (and clever and amazing) trick of the plot is no surprise? <br /> <br /> Yes. <br /> <br /> And for starters, there is a beginning, a profoundly beautiful and smooth narrative of really the whole story, the core of it. Two taxis, two men with shoes, each getting on the train, then sitting opposite each other, and, oops, a mistake, a little nudge, and the conversation begins, and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The tone here is typical of Hitchcock, as he's in many horror and suspense movies - happy and easy. However, we know that we are going to enter the movie, that this will not be the case, so we're worried. What goes wrong? <br /> <br /> Much. In true Hitchcock fashion, it is a purely innocent man (almost always a man) who faces injustice trapped by circumstances that threaten the most valuable to him. The innocent, the tennis player Guy Haynes, is played with a credible innocence - his polite courtesy in this first scene, for example, because he realizes that the other man is a little cuckoo, is exactly what you or I could do. The not-so-innocent man is the selfish and frighteningly spoiled Bruno Anthony, played by Robert Walker with the utmost brilliance. (This weird performance is like another Hitchcock wacko played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho.) So from the first scene, on the train (and on the train, really great!), We have the two leads and we have the mind blowing and absolutely simple and ultimately devastating plot from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote the books behind the two Mr. Ripley films. And it does not hurt that the script was written by Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economics and nifty dialogues. And crime. <br /> <br /> And of course there is more than just the first scene. What is to be considered? Well, that clever daughter of a senator (I thought she was great) is Hitchcock's daughter Patricia, who is still with us (since 2009, she also had a role in Psycho). And there's a distinctive location for a key scene in the movie - the tennis courts in the Hamptons known as the site of the US Open. The fantastic final complete scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock goes into a kind of slow and steady montage and lifts the tension by becoming surreal. The fear is positively fattened with the laughing children and the old man crawling under it. And when it collapses in a crash - all this is projected back onto a set - one of the more naturalistic approaches of a director who is known for not worrying about the realism of his back projections. <br /> <br /> The photograph is so perfectly Hollywood stunning, without being stylized (as in some Noir films), that it is a stand-alone object. Look again at the first scene or the recording (and adaptation) of Haynes entering the house for what the audience considers a murder. This is a sophisticated construction. If we are not completely surprised that Bruno is in bed, that only proves that the director is on our tiptoes. There is always something unexpected to be expected. <br /> <br /> Are there any problems? Who knows? It depends on what kind of falsehood you can accept (or embrace) as a beautiful style. The scene in which Bruno strangles the old woman at a party is both brilliant (the woman played by Norma Varden is a caricature so plausible she takes her breath away) and the fact that he is the senator's daughter was looking and deadly trance on her glasses and their resemblance to his former victim. This is an idea of ​​mid-twentieth-century psychology that interferes with many of Hitchcock's efforts. (The End of Psycho for Beginners.) <br /> <br /> The Wikipedia article on the film cleverly emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the film, from the main characters to the murder victim and the daughter of the senator. This sounds in many small things - two men follow him to the tennis court, two men accompany the victim into the amusement park and so on. It can be done too much, but it provides an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness. Do not forget that there should be two murders - it is the absence of the second murder, the inability to doubling in this case, which causes Bruno to enlighten. The actor Walker had emotional problems and was institutionalized the year before the filming of the film, and shortly thereafter he died of a reaction to a drug that calmed one of his outbreaks. Although he has participated in other films, Strangers on a Train is easily his tour. Farley Granger had a long career that never saw him completely glory, though his style may have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works, especially in They Live by Night. <br /> <br /> And if you watch this video for the first or third time, pay attention to the heinous and hilarious scene in the tennis match, where all the heads of the audience move in unison - except Bruno. He stares without aiming his head directly at us. As the trailer to the film says, you will not talk to "strangers in one go" after this movie.
