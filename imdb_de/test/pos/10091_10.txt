I have to say that I am an avid horror movie fan and currently can not get enough of foreign horror. Because the US horror really depends too much on Gore. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic. This movie reminded me a lot of M. Night's SIXTH SENSE. The way the movie was shot was great. The director took his time to set up everything. It took a good 40 minutes for the movie to be turned into a horror movie. I thought the movie was just a drama. This movie just builds up and the profit is not too much. <br /> <br /> I've never done that, but that's the main reason why I liked the movie, because a scene just scared me ... which is kind of pathetic ... but for a movie that that does, it's great.
