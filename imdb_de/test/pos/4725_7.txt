Patricia Arquette plays the American doctor Laura Bowman, who is on vacation to Burma to heal her mind after the murder of her husband and young son. She is left behind in Rangoon during a military battle and leaves the city with an aging man who works as a "tour guide". But he is not an easy guide. He is a professor who introduces her to life outside tourist traps. The two get into political turmoil and Laura sees with her own eyes how the government cheats on its own people and oppresses <br /> This film is one of my favorites because of its themes. First, it is informative (describes some of the injustices that occur in Burma). Second, it is about a woman's struggle for an incredible loss of meaning in life. Third, compassion and sacrifice and people who come together without knowing each other, to endure pain and fear. <br /> <br /> Almost every beautiful scene in this movie is important. nothing is wasted here. It's a serious and moving movie. There is also a very emotional score that was composed by Hans Zimmer and complements the scenes very well. <br /> <br /> A definite tip, especially for people who deal with human rights ... and people who want to know, "what purpose can I serve?" <br /> <br />
