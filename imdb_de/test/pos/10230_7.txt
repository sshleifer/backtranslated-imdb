I enjoyed this movie. The way these mutants looked is very good, along with the sound of the movie. David Cronenberg was also great as Philip K. Decker! I wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (apart from the murders, of course). <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the creatures for this movie, though this movie probably had a small budget. The mutants / creatures / monsters looked great, especially from 1990. This is definitely a unique movie and not a crap. I want the novel on which it is based read. This is an interesting movie because it shows how humans can be monsters and the "monsters" are the humans.
