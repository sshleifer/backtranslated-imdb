I loved this movie from start to finish. I'm a musician and I got in the way of drugs from the things I loved (skateboarding, drawing), but my friends were always there for me. Music was like my rehab I can totally relate to this movie, and I wish there was more, I could say. To be honest, this movie left me speechless. I only saw it on the Ifc channel. Usually I hate satellites, but that was an advantage of satellites. The ifc channel shows some really great movies, and without them I would never have found this movie. I'm not a big fan of international films because I find that many of the Don 'I do a very good job translating lines. I mean, the obvious language barrier just makes you think they say what they say, but it's not such a big deal, I think. I almost never saw this amazing movie. Good thing, I stayed up for it instead of going to bed ... earlier than usual.lol.I hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie I love this movie as much as I do. I wish I could type it all in capital letters, but it's the rules I appreciate again, but it would really show my excitement for the movie. I give three thumbs up! <br /> This movie hurt me!
