Genius or madness? That depends on your interpretation of this film. I responded to it on the level of a self-confident "cop-movie parody," and I sincerely hope that was the intent because I do not see anyone who takes it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd seems to chew the scenery and really get into the spirit of things! Should this film mean a departure from Rudd's core in the comedy genre? Any crazy attempt to reinvent him as a die-hard action star? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> With cheesy, almost clumsy low-budget effects and crazy over-the-top action set pieces, it somehow reminded me of the old TV show "Sledge Hammer"! HILARIOUS !!! :-) <br /> <br /> Of course I have interpreted the film completely wrong. If it was indeed an attempt of a "direct" action movie, then it was certainly an amusing failure! <br /> <br /> Look with a lot of alcohol and some friends !!! ;-)
