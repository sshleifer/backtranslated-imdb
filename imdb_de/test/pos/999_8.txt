From the beginning of "The Edge Of Love" the viewer is transported to the impressive world of World War II in London. We are tracking the lives of four people who may have been created just for this film to explore the friendship between women and the pressures of marriage and infidelity. Apart from one of the figures, Dylan is called Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but sometimes even despicable. <br /> <br /> This film is based on Thomas's writings on love and romance. These were adapted with a sharp script by Sharman MacDonald (Keira Knightley's mother). Director John Maybury claims the three other main characters were real people. <br /> <br /> All four are very strong. Sienna Miller is Dylan's wife, Keira Knightley is the cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first part of the film takes place during the Nazi air raids in London. Vera is pursued by Willaim, a soldier who is waiting for the mission. Through a chance encounter, Dylan meets his first love, Vera. From there, meets Vera Caitlin, Dylan's wife. While the three are drinking, William successfully breaks Vera's guard. <br /> <br /> The film follows their lives when Vera and William are married and he is sent to war. Vera has become pregnant and returns to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There they face a hard existence. Vera supports Dylan and Caitlin with her husband's war money. Through these times, the friendship of Vera and Caitlin grows. Dylan's surprise with Vera, too. She gives way. This creates the first test for the two women. <br /> <br /> When William returns from the war, he hardly recognizes his wife and has no connection with his little son. Things get worse as Dylan idly watches his friend fight battlefield fatigue (post-traumatic stress disorder). William realizes that something has happened between Dylan and Vera, and in a drunken rage Dylan's house shoots up. <br /> <br /> "Edge Of Love" begins as a stylish romance in war-torn London and ends in hearty life motherhood, infidelity and attempted murder in Wales. The treatment of PTSD is well done and should appeal to an American audience. One day (see end). <br /> <br /> Every star has a great moment. Miller when she pulls out stings in her head in response to her abortion from another man. Knightley and Murpy as he finally connects with his son. Oh damn, almost all scenes are great. And Rhys, cleaning himself in the stands to send Vera's husband to jail. <br /> <br /> But the real star of the film is Jonathan Freeman's cinematography and directed by John Maybury. They seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historic Thomas is, this movie is dominated by two great actresses of our time. And they appreciate their scenes with breathtaking shots. This is not the best picture material, but it is a very good movie (much more appealing than "The Dutchess"). It has a visual poetry that emphasizes the use of Thomas's poetry. This is also clearly the second best performance of Knightley in her career and perhaps Miller's best performance. <br /> <br /> I've always had a weakness for the artist in combat, whether it's Hulce's Mozart or Hoffman's Capote. But I was stunned how little compassion I felt for Dylan Thomas. His struggles with alcohol are known. But his contradiction of William and Caitlin to take possession of his first love, makes him a bad man. <br /> <br /> Is this Oscar worthy? Definitely not at least not this year. It will be published on the state side in March 2009, which will not allow it for the academies. This is 9 months after the release in the UK. Between Reconciliation, Miss Pettigrew and Brideshead Revisited, the US has filled with British pieces from World War II. Too bad. This movie is better than the others, with the exception of Atonement. But here comes Knightley's soldier, but as a shell of the man who left her.
