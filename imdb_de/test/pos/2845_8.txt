Sister Betty has this strange, but profitable combination of a repulsive, uncomfortable plot with extraordinary characters. The way I had loathed Fargo the first time I saw it, I realized that for days on end I thought about it and somehow enjoyed it, I liked sister Betty much more the day after I saw her. Hard to understand, more difficult to explain. As others have said, this is pretty much enforced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so conspicuous. <br /> <br /> Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work by Morgan Freeman (though I'm worried that he is stereotyping it as the principal villain). Chris Rock was good, but not noticeable. Rene Z. is so natural that it is disturbing - d. H. That it is "natural" to play someone who does not play well in your head. Also, the kind of "abrasive sparkle" performance by Allison Janney liked in a small part. <br /> <br /> Do not expect as much "road movie" as some synopsis suggest. (There's "road," but it's only slightly relevant.) Rated 8/10.
