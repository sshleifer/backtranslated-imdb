It's a beautiful movie. The scenes are well represented. The dialogues of Anne Revere are really well written and inspiring. The philosophy and the thoughts that this film gives and the things that it teaches make it great and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney is awesome in the movie and his role experiences many emotional turmoil as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor looks very pretty, her film scenes are naturally poetic and the camera follows her and the way you feel through the music makes every scene of her ethereally beautiful beauty , <br /> <br /> This movie has a great spirit and a popular classic. Angela Lansbury is quite amusing in her role. Though not recognizable if you have seen her in the role of "m" in "Manchurian Candidate". Donald Crisp has given the role of his father the full justice, and the script provides him with plenty of stuff to justify his role. <br /> <br /> It's a very nice movie and a must for families and kids, an evergreen Christmas favorite.
