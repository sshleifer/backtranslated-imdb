I was skeptical before going on the subject because of the terribly assembled trailer that made the movie look like a horrible movie. I was very surprised how much I did not waste my money. I think the movie's success comes from how scary he really is and how the environment around the house is. Little things like the sensor lights create a real discomfort. The shadows and the ominous cold feel of the house make it easy to say that no matter how much you know horror movies, anything could happen in the movie. Acting is by no means perfect and not bad either. The main character is convincing, even when it comes to the annoying teenage dramas that surround them. In the end, I was thoroughly impressed by the movie in most aspects. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a movie that I can recommend.
