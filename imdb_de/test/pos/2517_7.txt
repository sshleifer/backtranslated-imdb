Another decent quote from Vince Gilligan. <br /> <br /> A Pre-Malcolm in the Middle Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump, a confused man who finally kidnaps Mulder at gunpoint and drives him west at high speed. It has something to do with his strong head ringing (and possibly deadly burns - his wife has just experienced it), and the pressure seems to be eased only when going towards the left shore. Only Mulder could relate to the plight of this guy and actually band together with his kidnapper before being run all night. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Scully seems to have solved the case with a possible appeal for Mr. Crump and will meet her by the sea. Check it out to see if our Dynamic Duo can connect to the Pacific and somehow fix Mr. Crump's big problem.
