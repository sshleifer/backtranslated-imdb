<br /> <br /> When I unexpectedly rented A Thousand Acres, I thought I was interested in a fun King Lear story, and of course Michelle Pfeiffer was there, so what could go wrong? <br /> <br /> But I quickly realized that this story was a thousand other things besides acres. I started crying and could not stop until long after the movie ended. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn for bringing such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie! Thank you for choosing to represent the characters so deeply and gently! <br /> <br /> I recognized the annoyed sister. the out-of-control sister and sister in Denial. I recognized the abusive husband and why he was there and then the father, oh oh the dad ... all played brilliantly. I also recognized myself and this film was an eye-opener, a relief, a chance to meet my own truth and finally do something about it. I really hope A Thousand Acres had the same effect on some others. <br /> <br /> Since I did not understand why the cover said the movie was about sisters fighting for land - they did not fight each other for anything else - I saw it a second time. Then I realized that if you had not experienced a similar story, you would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrents of fear and fear and the deep connection between the sisters that permeate all of this. That's why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors. <br /> <br /> But one more reason why this movie is so perfect! <br /> <br /> I do not know Give a rat's ass (please my French) about the extent to which the story of King Lear follows. All I know is that I can honestly say this movie has changed my life. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, guys, you CAN and make a difference. <br /> <br />
