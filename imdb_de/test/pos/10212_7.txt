"Western Union" is something of a forgotten classic western! This may be because it is not available on DVD in the United States. However, not everything is lost as it has now appeared in Region 2 in England. This is, in a way blessing, not only incompatible, but also ironic, considering that a film showing the creation and founding of such a unique American organization as The Western Union Telegraph Company is without Region 1 publication , It begs the faith! It just does not make sense! <br /> <br /> Produced by Fox in 1941, "Western Union" was headed by Fritz Lang. This was only the second time that the great German director had committed to directing a western! He had done a great job the year before with Fox's "The Return Of Frank James" and in 1952 had only a Western trip with the great "Rancho Notorious". Lang was not a Ford or Hawks, but with "Western Union" he turned into a good, solid western, which holds up very well. Beautifully photographed in an early three-stripe technicolor by Edward Cronjager, he had a good cast with Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female lead is taken over by Virginia Gilmore, who has really little to do. An actress who never did anything out of her career. Your presence here is just cosmetic. <br /> <br /> It's strange that Robert Young has a top score over Scott! It's clearly Scott's image from the beginning when we first see him in the grand opening scene of the movie as he's being chased across the plains by a group. Young does not have much to do in the movie and seems out of place in a western. He just looks stupid as he battles Barton McLane in a shootout! An actor who has never really excelled himself - except perhaps with "Crossfire" (1947) - in the 40's and 50's, Young appeared in a series of memorable romantic comedies that led to his greatest success for seven years "Marcus Welby MD" on television was the seventies. He died in 1998 at the age of 91 years. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" tells the connection by telegraph line from Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by Western Union chief Dean Jagger to protect the line from the plundering Sioux and fight McLane and his gang trying to destroy the line for their own sneaky targets. Robert Young is the young engineer from the East who joins the company and fights with Scott for the love of Miss Gilmore. Some weird reliefs are irritated by Slim Summerville and, as some would say, presented by Slim Summerville and John Carradine in a meager role as a corporate doctor. Overall, a spanking good western, albeit in region 2, but in sparkling good quality that will delight fans. My only crib is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and the terrible cover with this boring graphics. UGH! <br/> <br/> Footnote: Interestingly, the associate producer at Western Union was Harry Joe Brown, who later partnered with Randolph Scott, who would produce some of the best Western Scott's in the fifties.
