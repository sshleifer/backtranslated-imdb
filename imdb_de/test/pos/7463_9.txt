I'm really surprised how little fame this movie had. I think it has to do with distribution companies and so on. <br /> <br /> Do not be idiots - if you're looking for fun, take this movie - this is a very nice movie to spend some hours with. Music is great. <br /> <br /> It's about ..... well girls and boys and what's between them with not too much history, but not all movies should be PULP FICTION? it is nice and sweet and gives good time. The girls also look very good and that makes the whole movie even more beautiful. <br /> <br /> Why did I only give him a 9? Well, the story could be more convincing from the middle. At some point you will see events that are a little less reliable. SMALL SPOILER: The baby is crying and the dad walks in and tries to relax him. now I'm not talking about a little cry, but no - hysterical scream, and 30 seconds later the dad goes out and "baby sleeps" - excuse me when and how exactly you calmed him down, can sleep and walk his room in 20- 30 seconds. But ignore this little selection, because the movie itself is not a docudrama - it's fun and that should be overlooked.
