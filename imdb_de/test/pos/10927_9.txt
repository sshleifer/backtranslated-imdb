I just watched this short on PlanetOut Movies. <br /> <br /> Starcrossed was a very sweet, sad little movie about two brothers in love. Both male lead roles are great and subtle. Often movies with this theme seem too involved in the controversy and shock of the plot, forgetting that there is an actual story. Fortunately, director James Burkhammer does not do that and instead plays the story with honesty. The sequences of the two boys who fall in love first are very cute.
