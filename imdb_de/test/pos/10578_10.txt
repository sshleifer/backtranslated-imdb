If you read the book before looking at this adaptation, you would think it has lost some of its thrill. The story is so clever that I could never tire of it. <br /> <br /> Sally and Elaine have really put their hearts into their roles and created so many characters. I fell in love with the story and the women again. <br /> <br /> Nice to look at, thanks to directing, attitudes and costume. Despite the plot speed of the television, I do not feel that something important was lost during the transmission. It had me all over the seat edge with many wonderful trembling moments. Enjoyed it thoroughly. I was waiting for this kind of TV.
