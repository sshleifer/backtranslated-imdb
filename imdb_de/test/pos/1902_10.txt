Although not the first black exploitation movie, Dolemite is certainly one of the best. It is a pivotal film in the Black Exploitation genre, as it led to a dramatic shift between the previous films, unlike the films that came afterwards. It was not necessarily a poignant or moving film about the black culture and it is a struggle to overcome issues like racism or something so important, but it was the story of a bad guy who with his army of hot kung fu mama es was a guilty pleasure, a lot of fun and best to see it with friends.
