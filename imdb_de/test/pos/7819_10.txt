I loved this movie, it was cute and funny! Lauren Holly was wonderful, she is funny and credible in her role. Costas Mandylan was also very good, nice to look at !! Brenda Vaccaro, as always it was a pleasure to see her, she has made her character great. It was a pleasure to watch a movie that is funny and interesting and can be viewed by the whole family. It's hard to find beautiful healthy movies anymore. Thank goodness for the Hallmark movies, they are wonderful! I wish I could buy it, if anyone knows where I could buy this movie, please let me know !! I bought several Hallmark movies and I'm very happy with that. I hope I can buy that !!
