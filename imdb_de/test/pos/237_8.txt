Another great musical from Hollywood's Golden Age! I liked this movie story about a trio of friends performing in a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all that glitz. Although this is not the big time, they are very happy with their life and the little club they perform in. Gene Kelly plays the owner of the little club and is also the girlfriend of one of her dancers, Rita Hayworth, who happens to attract attention when she has the opportunity to stand on a cover of a magazine. The problem begins for Gene Kelly, as his girlfriend now speaks the city. Phil Silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job. Of course there is music and dancing. A dance performance by Gene Kelly stands out. He walks alone along the street at night and sees his reflection in a shop window. His reflection soon starts dancing with him on the street, great cinematography. Do not miss this, great entertainment.
