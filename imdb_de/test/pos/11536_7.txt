Jennifer Egan's novel was put on screen by Canadian director Adam Brooks in a movie that makes a bad suggestion based on some comments from contributors to the forum, but in fact it's much better than you'd think. <Br /> <br /> This is a story about two sisters who loved each other. Faith, the handsome and cheerful hippie girl, takes her younger brother Phoebe under her wing. Phoebe just loves faith. As the Elder decides to follow her friend Wolf to Berkley's summer vacation in Europe, she promises to send a postcard to Phoebe every day. Faith does this until the cards stop coming and one night, some time later, the family gets a phone call to inform them. Faith died in tragic circumstances. Phoebe can not forget Faith. Therefore, after a few years, she decides to follow the same path as her older sister. She takes the cards from Faith and visits every place, from Amsterdam to Paris, and she wants to end the trip to Portugal, where Faith has met her untimely death. In Paris, Phoebe meets with Wolf, who is no longer a hippie and lives with his girlfriend. Wolf tries to persuade Phoebe to give up her journey and return home; She suspects that Wolf holds the key to solving the mystery, and when she leaves for Portugal, she makes a discovery when she finds a picture that clearly contradicts Wolf's version, which he told Phoebe. He feels guilty and decides against his girlfriend's wish to escort Phoebe to the city where Faith died. History changes at this point and we return in retrospect to what Faith has experienced in Europe and what happened in her last days. <br /> <br /> The best part of "The Invisible Circus" are the performances of the principals. something for which Mr. Brooks must have the honor. The big surprise is the series by Cameron Diaz, who, as Faith, chooses seemingly light comedy parts, when she can do some good dramatic work under the right direction. Jordana Brewster is considered the older Phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film. She is an overwhelming beauty with an apparent naturalness for acting. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and shows that he is also capable of making serious drama. The sweet Camilla Belle plays the younger Phoebe quite convincing. Blythe Danner appears as the mother of the girls. The European locations are magnificently photographed by Henry Braham. The film is also enriched by the music of Nick Laird-Clowes and Petra Haden's original song. Elizabeth Kling works with great elegance. Ultimately, this film shows Adam Brooks in great shape as he gives the adaptation of the novel the right tone and is rewarded for when the right cast causes miracles.
