Beautiful 1962 Hong Kong film about a man (Mr. Chow) and a woman (Mrs. Chan) who become close friends when they suspect their spouses are having an affair. Stylistically, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses a lot of slow motion and close-ups on body parts (feet, hands, waist). The film itself has a reserve and perseverance that implies its length of time. It is sexy without showing anything. Wong Kar-Wai also does not allow the audience to see what the spouses look like, suggesting that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan should be together. Smoking is even made to look elegant with close-ups of the smoke curls. A really nice movie. Just prepare for the end. <br /> <br />
