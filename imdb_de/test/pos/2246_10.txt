The slightly over-length setup episode last week has paid off indefinitely with an episode that has reached its highs. There was a certain Deus ex machina taste for the Cliffhanger's dissolution, but it was a good start to all of that. As is usual with this doctor, the moral, ethical, and emotional considerations of his actions were the focus. They were always in the classic series, but they were a side issue that needed to be reworked when the doctor was in the heat of the battle. This regeneration apologizes even to a cyberman during the battle! Finally, this episode shows that Mickey embraces the heroic side pointed out in previous episodes. His journey from zero to hero is complete, and it was absolutely convincing. With fear, humor and scenes that brought a lump down her throat, this episode had it all. After much deliberation, I can finally say that the new series trumps the classic series in every respect. If you come from a hard-boiled Whovian, you can not get a better recommendation.
