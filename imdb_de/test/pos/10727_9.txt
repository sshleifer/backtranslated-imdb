If you asked me about the best movies ever made, this movie is on a short list along with the tram called Desire from 1951. I can imagine that I will discover some others who qualify, but Kramer vs Kramer is an outstanding naturalist exercise. So it's a very satisfying experience at this level: you just have to watch the wonderful, weird notions of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, and especially the child Justin Henry. One of the best children's performances ever. <br /> <br /> I also find it very satisfying because it's such a pervasive story that always makes me forget my own problems. It has such an excellent narrative drive. As soon as you capture Kramer vs Kramer, Alice leaves Kramer Ted to juggle the work and her little son and tells him nothing more than to discover herself. And even if you know how things are going, every moment of the journey sounds so awesome that it's always a pleasure to see it again and again. <br /> <br /> Do not Make a mistake - Kramer Vs. Easy Entertainment: It's a very realistic account of the effects of divorce on everyone involved. <br /> <br /> 10/10. <br /> <br /> For one of the best scripts (born of conversations between Benton) and Hoffman, who divorced at that time, wrote, performed, and completed beautifully and flawlessly. Not to mention what a great story it is. Just a perfect movie.
