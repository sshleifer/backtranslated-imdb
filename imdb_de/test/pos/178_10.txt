The first time I saw this great movie and Alyssa, my star *, who played Frances Ella Fitz, was so great in this movie! It was just so real and her little dog so cute! I first saw it when I was 11, and it was the best movie I've ever seen, and you know what? I still think so! 10/10 ********** = biggest ever!
