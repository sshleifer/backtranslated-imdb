Once I saw the ad for "Changi" on the History Channel, I knew I would love it. It captured the ANZAC spirit fantastically - you would die if you did not have any comrades near you. The characters of "Changi" were strong and each one brought something else into the story, and the Japanese soldiers were not criticized, but portrayed as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right, just like the Australians. Director, script, drama and staging were all wonderful, with a clear, easily comprehensible plot. Humor was the key to survival of the soldiers, and it was great to see that a miniseries about war actually has a sense of humor, which is usually hard to do without insulting people. From what I read about soldiers in Changi PoW Camp, this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years that these Australian, British, New Zealand, American and Dutch men spent there. I would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in war or not. 10/10.
