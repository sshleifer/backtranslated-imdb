The Kid Power Hour consisted of two segments: Hero High and Shazam. Let's start with Hero High. <br /> <br /> Hero High was to be a new Archies cartoon with its superhero identities: Pureheart the Powerful (Archie), Captain Hero (Jughead), Superteen (Betty) and Evilheart (Reggie). However, Filmation could not get the rights, so they changed it a bit and came to that. Here's the breakdown of the characters: Captain California (Archie), Glorious Gal (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), Dirty Trixie (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Reggie), Director Samson (Mr. Weatherbee) and Miss Grimm (Miss Grundy) , The show featured live action sketches as well as cartoon adventures. The humor was the typical lame filmation joke, but at least he had fun doing it. It was entertaining enough for children, though not quite up to par with previous standards. <br /> <br /> The other segment was Shazam !, which was very loyal to the comics, unlike the previous live action show. All the big baddies appeared, as did the entire Marvel family (including Freckles Marvel in at least one episode). Uncle Dudley had the correct voice and dodgy character of WC Fields and his incessant acting "Shazambago". Burr Middleton, a veteran of the 70's TV series Fish, spoke the Big Red Cheese, while Alan Oppenheimer (Rudy Wells in the early $ 6 million Man episodes and Skeletor's voice in He-Man) dr. Sivana supervised. <BR /> <br /> The Marvels always had a sense of humor, so little had to be done to their adventures to meet the requirements of the broadcasting standards and practices (the censors). Therefore, the stories were very imaginative and resourceful. Among the bad guys who appeared were: Sivana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, Mr. Mind, Aunt Minerva, Ibac, and the crocodile creatures. Mr. Tawky Tawny also made his debut on the screen. <br /> <br /> Hero High is due to be released by BCI, but Shazam! is still in limbo, as well as the live action show. Hopefully the suggested film will help release it on DVD. It's worth a visit and deserves a DVD treatment.
