I saw it at a German press screening. Without betraying too much: most critics seemed to really like it. There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for this species. From my point of view and until now it was the funniest movie of the year. It retains the charm and wit of the three W + G shorts and is enhanced with many references to these and other movies. Of course, there are obvious allusions to monster and werewolf films, especially to "An American Werewolf in London", "Jaws", "King Kong" and even Peter Jackson's "Braindead" / "Dead Alive", but also to other genres , <br /> <br /> Characterization was made better in "Chicken Run," but this movie had a completely new "cast," which required an introduction. Here you can already get to know the two main characters. Well, the new "Wallace and Gromit" movie works best if you've seen (and liked) the shorts, but it works on its own. "Chicken Run" had the more comfortable, but also more "storytelling" plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece preserves the crazy and somehow "isolated" feel of the W + G shorts. Children should also enjoy it, especially because of the cute rabbits (if you love cute rabbits, this is a must for you !!!) and because Gromit has a lot to do and the show really steals (even kids love) dogs. .. :-)). However, many jokes are intended for an adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). The film manages to create high-level entertainment for the whole family, such as "Shrek 1 + 2" and "The Incredibles," adding a British and, at least, somewhat darker edge to the humor of American animated films. <Br /> <br /> The animation is ?? as expected ?? great, and they have remained true to the Aardman style because they have not recorded too many digital effects - I have seen few in Wallace's inventions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score works fine movie, even though one of the main themes is definitely borrowed from Randy Edelman's "Dragonheart" score. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is: It will probably take another six years to see a new animation Gem of Nick Park & ​​Co.
