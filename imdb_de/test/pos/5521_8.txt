A man named Jerry comes into possession of an ancient Aztec doll. Anyway, this scary little character is obsessed with the evil spirit that takes over Jerry's body and makes him spill the blood ... I've seen two more horror movies that Dripped Blood and The Kindred by Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow and I have to say that "The Power" is not disappointed too.The plot is slow, but there are some effective human effects and a bit of the scene of a female tabloid reporter who is being attacked by arms from a mattress It's a shout, I like this low budget horror movie.
