Pink Flamingos has earned me the reputation of a shocking, disgusting, repulsive, trashy movie that I expected. It really contains everything but the kitchen sink. We have almost two hours of nausea that never let up: rape, sex, chickens sex, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism, and a horrible depiction of the anus. It's about a weird couple starting a contest with a trailer garbage family and trying to steal its title as "filthiest people alive". Divine (a fat guy on the train) is an incredibly vile person who actually finds it painful to watch him. Trust me when I say that this film should not be forgotten so quickly, especially the final scene in which Divine Dog eats the sidewalk. I've always thought John Waters was overrated and I can not say I like this movie, but it's an experience if you ever get a chance to see it.
