John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is an impressive movie set, beautifully written and edited. It interweaves a personal and political history that keeps haunting me and often appears in my mind. The plot is exciting and the inner and outer journeys are arranged both kinematically and in the action carefully and sensitively parallel to each other. I've watched this movie at least six times, and that really stands up to scrutiny. It is particularly relevant today in the face of global events. Try it, you will not regret it! By the way, NetFlix is ​​not executing it yet, but you can request it.
