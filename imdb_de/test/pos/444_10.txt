Uncle Frank is every uncle. This documentary covered all aspects of aging in America, loneliness, humor and irony. Uncle Frank and Aunt Tillie were extremely generous when sharing their life experiences with the audience. The director has done an incredible job to capture the small and large pieces that make up their lives. Many thanks to all who worked on this film!
