Two hours ago, I watched this brilliant movie that overwhelmed me with its imprisoned photography. It is understandable how it was awarded the Best Camera Award at Cannes 2000. Nahaufnahmen predominated. Close-ups of walls, people and many other things. The warm colored lighting (which usually comes from the director) gave the film a warm atmosphere. Mainly only two persons are to be seen. An interesting music and especially three songs or themes almost always accompanied the film. Each of these themes represents a specific atmosphere throughout the movie. Silent and slow movements characterize the film. Some scenes were extended moments or serious close-ups. Not only does Tony Leung deserve a prize for his outstanding acting, as Maggie Cheung was so brilliant. I wonder how many dresses she wore in the different scenes. The story was somehow linked to the history of Hong Kong and the 1960s region. This mainly prevented me from understanding some details of it. In short, I would recommend fans of artistic films to watch it in the cinema.
