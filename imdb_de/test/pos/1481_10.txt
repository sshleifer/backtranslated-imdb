I liked this movie way too much. My only problem was that I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent from Michael Ironside. Of course, Ironside is only a low rent Jack Nicholson. I think Mike was busy with "Highlander 2: The Quickening" this year. Unfortunately, "Beastmaster 2" would have been a much better career move. It's certainly the best of the Beastmaster series, and in many ways reminiscent of the great classic movie "Masters of the Universe." It is not only the incomparable Mark Singer, but also a great cast, especially the second girl from "Sliders", Uncle Phil from "Fresh Prince of Belair" and the evil chick from "Superman 2". It has shaken my world and is certainly a must for anyone who has neither social nor physical opportunities. BEASTMASTER FOREVER !!! ROCK 'N' ROLL !!!
