I am amazed at the questions and problems that this documentation raises in the reviews here, especially because they are actually interesting questions. Those who could best deal with it would certainly be the creators of the film. Still, I think I can shed some light on something I think overlooks what I think is the purpose of the film, what it's about and what it's trying to convey. What is his message? At the risk of pointing out the obvious, I begin to say that the filmmakers have an intention. They try to tell a story, figure out the meaning and convey a point. With that in mind, we can shoot down many of the criticized issues, especially those that include what people expected in contrast to what the filmmakers really wanted. Causes and consequences of violence? The movie is not about it. It is not "enlightening non-Brazilian audience" on the question of Brazilian favelas? Well, who wanted to do that? Is AfroReggae supported by this or that and by whom? In this context, it does not matter. Not enough women in the movie for your taste? It's not about gender equality or the feminist cause. Any little detail about Anderson's life, mother, son, family and all aspects and how the AfroReggae movement works? Do not be so picky because it does not matter. A story can take so long before it can no longer become a movie. If the writers showed everything that everyone expects, they would have to do a 6-month TV series instead. If you expect all this, you will approach the movie in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> The film is actually two people who started a movement. Two individuals full of ideals. Two people thirsting for change. Two people trying to do something about all the wrongdoing that surrounds them. People who have reached a low point and wanted to get up again. It's about finding meaning in life, being inspired by misery, changing destiny and becoming something different than it should be - criminal and drug dealer for the matter. It's about achievement and hope, not about the cruel reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, although it's an integral part of the film as the characters are constantly surrounded. Unexpectedly, and not without reason, the film focuses much more on Anderson's course of life difficulties. This is because they were confronted with Anderson's accident when they made the film. I'm not sure, but maybe they even seriously thought about ending the shooting right there, and have left all the effort behind. But Anderson wanted to continue. And they did that when they risked losing a movie with some identity crisis, in the face of the sudden change of course, but winning as someone showed how he overcame such a devastating event. For those who see it, it's obvious that the movie starts with AfroReggae and ends with Anderson. It is very unique in this sense (the shift of action). Perhaps her only sin is not obvious, which initially raises the expectations that remain unfulfilled. <br /> <br /> As to the importance or the ordinariness of Anderson, I would say that not everyone wants to change the whole world, stop all violence, feed all the hungry, be like Mahatma Ghandi, be a mother Known to Teresa or whoever other well-known personalities are there. It's much easier to connect with and be inspired by someone who, like everyone else, tries to change their own hard lives, raises problematic children, copes with permanent injuries or illnesses, and even bills paid by the doctor at the end of the month , To understand the movie, you have to see that he has left behind a past in which he has been dealing with drugs and crime, making amends and trying to persuade others not to go the same arduous path. Although you can criticize whether the method you have chosen is effective and you doubt the methodology of the method, you can not deny its intentions. <br /> <br /> Also, the perception that Anderson has as something special or as a Chosen One part of it has to do with the fact that the filmmakers are very much involved in the lives of the characters they portray. Just as they make friends with them. There is no way to make the whole movie sound better with Anderson. If a dear friend is paralyzed in an accident, that's not just a fact, but you make a big deal out of it. And that is not necessarily bad. It is not much that they treat him as a "chosen one," as if they are doing everything they can to show him as the seed of transformation and source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Finally, you should not pay attention In this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime that is contained in it, you should pay attention to what it is much more, an inspirational story. Nike ad like? Seems to be damn good and professional for me and not to interfere with or affect the intentions of the movie. Romanticized? Do you speculate as a documentary, if you will, but why not when it should trigger and inspire a reaction? Is not it an effort to improve people's lives through music and dance - the essence of what the subjects are trying to do - to romanticize their own reality? Excuse me, but it's easy to show the pure facts of what reporters do and you can see it on TV every night. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to become a filmmaker, I wished that my first movie would be so great.
