Shame is a very credible and disturbing film that shows the impact of the war on the general public. Shame gives us a shattering understanding of Ingmar Bergman's beliefs. The lack of color and tone (as in a soundtrack) gives the film a more realistic feel. There is no soft or hard lighting or different camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect. Everything is presented very simply as it really is. Sometimes the plot was confusing, but perhaps to convey a sense of the characters' state of mind. As they now know, what happens or why. The simplicity of the film made it a bit boring, but I could understand how the director tried not to charm the story and the points. He showed the harsh and disturbing events and effects of the war. In the beginning, the characters were introduced and shown as content with the lighter settings and very long, extended shots. When suddenly the war broke down on them, they were much darker and calmer with less intimate attitudes. Bergman has done a good job by letting us consume ourselves of the war and presenting a picture of it that fits the war so well. Although the plot itself was not too impressive, the content of the film was.
