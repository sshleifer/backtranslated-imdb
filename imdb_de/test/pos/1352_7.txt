Burt Kennedy wrote and directed this western from a novel. Kennedy was a well-known, good author and director, mainly from the West. Robert Mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he did this. This role was like many he had already done. You can see why he was a big star for so many years. <br /> <br /> He filled out this roll lightly like a well-used glove. > The title character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father is a good actor Robert Walker - he died tragically at the age of 32 - his mother is the well-known actress Jennifer Jones). & although he had talent, he made only a few films. (He was in Rita Hayward's almost last movie. <br /> <br /> WALK TO SALINAS - THE SAME YEAR AND WAS VERY GOOD). <br /> <br /> He looked very much like his father, but seemed to miss his father's charm. He just shot a few movies. He still lives & I wish him all the best. <br /> <br /> Most of his scenes are great with another son of a Hollywood. John Carradines son David, who still makes movies. They formed a nice team. <br /> <br /> In Western you always have a female figure and usually she is a dance singer. (today they call her hookers), Angie Dickinson values ​​this role well. also Western Stalwarts, John Anderson & Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> It was a movie in Old Tucson) outside downtown Tucaon Az. & the scenery is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Typically for the older westerns, there is not too much action, there is good humor and the usual end that shoots out. <br /> <br /> fast pleasant 89 minutes. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (out of 10) 84 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
