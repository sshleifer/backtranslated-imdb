I just finished this movie and my only comment is "OH! WOW!". Jennifer Beals is okay as a fianc√©, but Yancy Butler as a dance teacher is pure sexual dynamite! After seeing her in WITCHBLADE, I was not prepared for the sheer, unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual arousal she throws on the screen!
