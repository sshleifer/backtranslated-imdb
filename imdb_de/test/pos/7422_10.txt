Terry and June are, in my opinion, an eternal classic blessing this house with the late Sid James and the late Diana Coupland, but Terry Scott will be sadly missed, even though he died in 1994. I have all the dvds upto press and I look forward to all 9, it would be nice to see "happy after ever" released on DVD <br /> <br /> june whitfield is still going strong and Terry Scott is getting more stay in my memory <br /> <br /> Terry Scott Rip There are not many comedies today that I think will stay in the Legend List, and yes, the middle-class bit has some problems with the Peoples, but I do not mind, I think it would be great, a celebration of the life of Terry Scott
