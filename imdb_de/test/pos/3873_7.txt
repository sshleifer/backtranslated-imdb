I saw this movie because at the time there was nothing else to see. Quickly, the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and the subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that my satellite provider's rating did not show stars. <br /> <br /> I will not give spoilers for the storyline or the result, but most of the characters had at least some redemption value. Until the last minute, I did not know how it would turn out. Often, you can retrieve the formula and predict the direction of the story. I could not do that with this movie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this as one of the finer films of this genre.
