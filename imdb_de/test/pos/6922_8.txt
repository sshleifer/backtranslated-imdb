Look Anglo-Irish, I assure you that this reviewer is anything but a bias. But I can assure you that this is an Irish movie - and not English, as the last comment suggested. This film was written by Neil Jorden and Conor McPherson and also directed by Conor McPherson - both Irish. The cast is almost entirely Irish - shot in Ireland with an Irish crew. Even Michael Gambon was born in Ireland - I remember him joking about this movie in an interview. Michael Cane was obviously brought in to boost box office revenues abroad. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, I just wanted to correct a completely uninformed comment! <br /> <br /> Now with the review - I loved Dylan Moran, was always a fan of him, he and Michael Cane made a surprisingly good double plot. It was great to see Moran's series as an actor as he plays several different fictional characters throughout the film. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in comedy - as it is a fresh, quirky and imaginative twist on Irish feature films. I laughed a lot. what could you ask for more?
