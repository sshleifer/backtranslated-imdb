One night I heard the radio and they had Leslie Nielsen in the program. He further explained why there were only 6 shows. '<br /> <br /> With TV shows like MASH you could bring a beer to the fridge and as long as you've heard what's going on, you have not missed anything. But with Police Squad you MUST watch the show. With the sight sores, you missed a lot if you had not seen them. Who could have forgotten "... the district known as" Little Italy "... with the Coliseum in the background. Even the movies relied heavily on the gag, but then in the theater you were a captive audience. <br/> <br/> Leslie also said that the show, movies and other films like Airplane are funny because they did not try to say what was funny. It was up to the audience to get the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well these are just my 2 cents.
