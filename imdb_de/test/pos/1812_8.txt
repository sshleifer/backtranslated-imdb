Romance films were never my cup of tea. But Valley Girl is one of the few romance films that has not only allowed me to assert myself, but actually enjoyed it. Nicholas Cage is great in his first role and Deborah Foreman is incredibly cute. There are some side stories that tend to get confused, but not enough to lessen this movie.
