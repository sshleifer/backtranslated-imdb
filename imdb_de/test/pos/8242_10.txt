As a kid growing up in Sydney in the 1950s, I can easily identify with the content of this beautiful movie. Every week I visited the Wynyard Newsreel Cinema on George Street to watch the Cinesound shorts (usually 3 stooges). There has never been a better mix of black and white and color in a movie. Error-free production values ​​complete an unforgettable movie experience.
