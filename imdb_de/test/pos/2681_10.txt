If you put Seinfeld aside, this is undoubtedly the best comedy ever! Just great! <br /> <br /> "The King Of Queens" has just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. In the suburbs of Queens, New York, the show features Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), a lovable deliveryman, and his wife, legal secretary Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), as they explore the daily challenges of love, life, and family Marriage. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie grapple with the everyday domestic circumstances that reflect our time and allow us to laugh at ourselves. Their love of each other ultimately carries them through every dilemma they face, be it Doug's fixation with food or Carrie's obsession with expensive clothes. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie also have to deal with the third, very dependent member of Heffernan's doubly widowed father, Carrie, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in their basement. His constant presence and often bizarre behavior contribute to their daily adventures. Doug and Carrie have come up with an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and make Arthur happy on his regular outings with gullible dog talker Holly (Nicole Sullivan). Doug 's friends Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine) complete the cast with their "guy" humor and various perspectives on The Honeymooners, THE KING OF QUEENS Inspire everyday life situations. Last season alone, Doug Carrie had "borrowed" a wifeless Deacon for Thanksgiving dinner assistance; the Heffernans suffer from the annoyance and financial burden of mold damage in their home; and Doug and Carrie strive to copy a couple whose photos are more adventurous than Doug and Carrie accidentally took away. We also saw Arthur jealous of a new dog that Holly added to her route, and Doug found that his overprotective parents replaced his dog Rocky from childhood three times behind his back. This series features James' incredible physical comedy, Remini's sharp joke, and Stiller's unique comic book presence. <br /> <br /> You can not ... you should not miss it!
