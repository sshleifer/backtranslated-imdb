A refreshing interview with the legendary Italian cameraman-producer-director who died in 1999 with almost 200 functions as a director. Much of it goes to D'Amato softcore sex movies, including his infamous EMANUELLE posts with Laura Gemser. They also briefly talk about his porno career, which has kept him afloat for the past decade. More interesting for me is the section that focuses on his horror and action efforts. D'Amato has many great anecdotes about actors and his low-budget filmmaking, including a story about a wizard who inadvertently collected real bones between the fake ones as he turned in a 2000-year-old catacomb. Other interviewees are George Eastman and Al Cliver. I would have liked a bit more about his productions at Stateside Filmirage (not a single question about TROLL 2, assuming it was not the cult movie that it was now).
