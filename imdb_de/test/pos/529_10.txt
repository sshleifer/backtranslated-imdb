I absolutely loved this movie! Since I do not want to reveal much, it's basically about a mother and a daughter and their life together. It's a heartwarming story between the battles they have. I also think that Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry throughout the movie! That is definitely worth seeing! Two thumbs up!
