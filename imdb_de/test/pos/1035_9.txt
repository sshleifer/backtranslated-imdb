I looked at this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved to be a great actor. When he started Law and Order, I was really disappointed with him because it was not that important. Unfortunately, the good people do not pay the bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and check it. It is both factual and entertaining. Everyone should see it to know what really happened. I was so moved that I bought and read the book "Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds". And he saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight. If you have a chance, be sure to watch this movie and see what achievement Mr. Waterston can really offer an audience. Enjoy the movies!
