Once upon a time there was a poor Sister of the Salvation Army in Sweden. At the door of death she asks, "Send for David Holm!" However, Victor Sjöström (as David Holm) can not be found because he spends New Year's Eve in a graveyard with his drinking buddies. The dying sister Astrid Holm (as an editor) wants to know if the prayer for Mr. Sjöström has led to results in the past year. That does not have it. In the cemetery Sjöström tells the story of "The Phantom Carriage", which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svennberg (as Georges). Legend has it that the last person to die each year has to pick up the souls of all the dead until it is released next New Year's Eve. <br /> <br /> Director Sjöström, whose main achievement is very strong, combines a visually appealing film with the photographer Julius Jaenzon. The great "double exposure effect" is often used, but never seems to be overkill. and makes the other dramatic highlights of the movie no less memorable (for example, how Sjöström rips his sewn coat and opens the door). A Selma Lagerlöf story was probably not something you could or want to manipulate in the 1920s - which may or may not be the reason why the end of this movie is a failure. And unlike similar spiritual stories, exposing your disbelief is difficult if you think too carefully about what really happens in "Körkarlen". <br /> <br /> ******* Körkarlen (1/1/21) Victor Sjöström ~ Victor Sjöström, Hilda Borgström, Tore Svennberg
