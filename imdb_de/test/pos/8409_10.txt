At first, nothing will compare to the original film, but for heaven's sake, they are not trying. It's just an opinion of a person what could have happened after Rhett left Scarlett in Tara. I thought it was a great movie and would like to add it to my GWTW collection. The scenery alone would make me watch the movie. Just look at this movie as an extension of the original and do not think it's trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable, and you'll enjoy it very much. You've really captured Scarlett's spoiled egoism in many scenes, and you can tell by the yearning in Rhett's looks that he's obviously still in love with Scarlett. The fact that you can see many of the actors in the film is another plus, even if some of them were only seen on television. I always wanted you to have other kids after Bonnie Blue died in the movie. This has completely fulfilled my needs. <br /> <br /> Lore60
