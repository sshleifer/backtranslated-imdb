Murder Over New York is one of Chan's better secrets, and I've just seen it for the first time. <br /> <br /> In this case, Charlie Chan visits New York to attend a police conference. At the same time, people involved in airplane factories are being murdered, and he decides to help out with his son No. 2 in the investigation. These killings emerge as a result of sabotage in the aircraft plants and Chan helps identify the killer ... Charlie Chan is well played by Sidney Toler and the rest of the cast includes Sen Yung as His Son Number 2 and Marjorie Weaver. <br /> <br /> I would rather like this mystery and worth it if you like these kinds of things. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 Â½ stars 5
