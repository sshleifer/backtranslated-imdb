I only saw this movie once when it was shown on TV, but I remember it 15 years later, so I have to say something about it. I thought it would be an intelligent look at schooling, friendship, bullying, and the impact this can have on adult life, or if you are good, you will be tolerated by the cliques at school and even later in adulthood - this is in one Private school located in England, but could be anywhere. <br /> <br /> The main character is bad at games, looking for revenge later in life, all leading to a martial confrontation on a cricket pitch. I have to admit that the end disappointed me - it was powerful and sad.
