I'm a physics student myself and I have to say that this is one of the best "popular" introductions to string theory. The elegant universe manages to make the whole theme of string theory (though it's actually M) accessible to a wider audience. Some popular science programs suggest that the best approach is simply to engage the public at the bottom, throwing jargon with no explanations, and presenting the theory in a boring, boring style. This program goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics and explains the problems that need to be resolved between the two so that we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe both large and small. <br /> Me some might say that it is slow and takes too long to get to the interesting things like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the thing is: that's against the point. It is almost impossible to explain string theory from the beginning without mentioning at least basic physics, and the way it is explained in The Elegant Universe is clear and entertaining. Whether you really like this program It depends on whether you are ready to be amazed by some of the ideas put forward by Greene: Extra dimensions and distortions of spacetime are not prevalent in everyday life, are they? However, if you stick to some of the more exotic concepts in this program, you will find that you get an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today. And if you're studying physics, it's a great conversation and you'll probably be able to follow it and appreciate it even more!
