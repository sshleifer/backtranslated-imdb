François Truffaut, Young Jerk of "Cahiers du Cinema", the main bastion of the upcoming so-called New Wave, hated the movie very much and even made French film mediocre. Translation: Truffaut, who was sexually endlessly oppressed, was already jealous of the way Carné could make a big hit out of a story that pushed all the right buttons of the audience and actually put them into something important with all the truffles and seduction of sensuality. In other words, where the general public and many critics in a beautiful film saw a sociological analysis of perception, Truffaut saw "Girls on the Loose." <br /> <br /> Carné finally had everything the New Wave would seriously lack: intelligence, sophistication, humor, a great storyteller talent, a good ear for dialogue, brilliant technical brilliance, the capacity to bring in its actors to do what he wanted and a good dose of good taste. By comparison, Truffaut is a provincial boredom that has nothing to say. A tragic remake of the '50s of Pride and Prejudice, the French response to Rebel Without A Cause, an updated version of Children of Paradise, Les Tricheurs, tells a story of dissatisfied Parisian youths in one Atmosphere of existentialism, sexual liberation and disrespect for traditional and religious values. Some (young) critics perceived Carné's attitude as a "moralizing bias" of an "elderly person", while I believe that the opposite was the case, that Carné was gay and one or two things about repression knew sympathy for the young iconoclasts in his story , Since this is a French film, it is no mistake that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual, something that had to be deciphered in American films like "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One". <br /> <br /> The young people of Carné are all beautiful, graceful, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent. They are gods and goddesses. They drive the latest Vespas and the right cars. The cut of their suits, dresses and duffle coats was a highlight of the fashion of the last century. Her haircuts are still plastered on the wall of your local barber. Their body shape, which they have attained and maintained without effort, is still the modern Western ideal. You hear the best jazz musicians. You know how to move, how to be sexy and how to make love? although the pill is not invented yet. They know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. Unfortunately, they are defined by the gang's code and their own heartless rituals that exclude sentimentality and turn romantic love into sin. The only thing wrong with them is that their elders do not talk to them and vice versa. The incidents presented in this film have tormented many in France about the amorality and nihilism of youth and yet made them a major public and critical success. <br /> <br /> This movie is so stylish and glorious, I suppose the older viewers wished they could be like the people depicted in the movie, and some young filmmakers or aspiring filmmakers like Truffaut developed a bad case of jaundice in which they reflected how they could never make a movie as sexy or sexy as it was popular, though they might be very good at targeting the nihilistic parts. On the other hand, given a certain clichéd aspect of the screenplay (love misunderstanding leading to a medical emergency), one can only wonder that the terribly pious and puritanical mish-mash Americans would have drawn from the same basic script if they dared to accept the subject. Interestingly, the movie was filmed in the same locations as the American musical "Funny Face" a year ago. Where Hollywood saw the picturesque aspects of Rive Gauche and existentialism, Carné restored his tragic and ironic dimension. Watch this trailer on YouTube: 19ZkKeoNjPo
