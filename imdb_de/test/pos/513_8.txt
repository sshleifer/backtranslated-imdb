If you like horror or action, watch this movie as soon as possible. If the opening scene does not pump your adrenaline, someone should check your heart rate. Great action, great casting and top deposits. This is the only movie I have seen in a movie theater in which the audience applauded every shot, punch and beat. Not perfection, but who cares if films are so much fun. It's a pure rush of dark comic action. 9.10
