* May contain spoiler * <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was when it was released on video at the age of 8. Now I'm 17 and still look at it when I have a chance. "The Aristocats" was a sweet, heartwarming movie that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs, especially those who sing the kittens on the piano. I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and girlfriend because I loved it so much. All three kittens are so cute and her mom is one of the most beautiful cartoon cats I've ever seen. The Ally cat had a great voice! <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when the kittens play the piano. This part is adorable. I also enjoy her trip home. It's incredible. This is one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen and one of my favorites. Everyone should see it. I give this movie 10/10 stars.
