I've looked at those brief moments on the Sundance Film Festival website and I have to say it's absolutely amazing. I expected it to be entertaining - like all Sundance shorts - but I was not prepared for such deep sadness and yet a sense of passion and beauty. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen any entries from this year's festival, I suggest you go to the website and watch these miniature masterpieces. I've seen them all and can honestly say, "The youth in us is the one that has touched my heart the most, I'm not the weakest on-screen when it comes to romance in movies, but my eyes flooded so much that I I'm surprised I still could see the screen. <br /> <br /> I agree with 'addicted2you' is really a masterful directorial piece, and the camera will take your breath away. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine a better way to spend 12 minutes.
