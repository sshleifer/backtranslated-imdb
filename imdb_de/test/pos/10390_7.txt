Although the story is light, the film flows so beautifully and his picture is so calm and poetic that he could almost carry the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The film is made up of four interconnected stories that all speak about different aspects of the attraction between man and / or woman and how often it is ethereal. Their true desire always seems to be something they can not hold on to, it will flow out like a handful of sand. <br /> <br /> I thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the woman was out of reach. the more the man desires her. It is a parallel to her deep love for God, which is infinitely unreachable, but never closer to her heart. <br /> <br /> A very good movie. 10.7
