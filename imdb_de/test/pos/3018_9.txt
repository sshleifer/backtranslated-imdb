When I saw this movie for the first time, I was both surprised and a little shocked by the undisguised liveliness of the story. It's a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, spectacular acting and a great job in the make-up department. Jennifer Lopez has pulled out of previous roles that have interfered with this film in her career. She is a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to get into the minds of comatose patients and treat them. Vincent D'onofrio played surprisingly well. His portrayal of a sadistic serial killer was perfect for a T. The sheer emotion that transmits his performance is amazing. Vince Vaughn is not my favorite but still exceptionally good. The symbolism and craftsmanship was intriguing and nervous, sometimes surprising and sometimes shocking. All in all, I say that this is a wonderful movie, with great acting and beautiful artwork.
