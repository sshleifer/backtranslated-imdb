Perhaps the most beautiful moment of television, at least in my memory, as millions of Shakespeare's thrilling Kings cycle (Richard II - Richard III) played on Prime Time TV (I think it was Friday night). No word was left out, and the plays aroused in me (at that time in the elementary school) a thirst for the history and a hunger for Shakespeare and drama. What kind of set would that be!
