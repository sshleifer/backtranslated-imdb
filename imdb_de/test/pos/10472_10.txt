Yes, you can view Babette's feast as a kind of slap on Puritan Christianity, but it's much more than that. The superficial story of a talented Parisian cook escaping Paris after one of her revolutions and living in Jutland in northern Denmark driven to the shore, is simply the fat with which the deeper story can develop. <br /> <br Babette is an artist, one of the small armies of people who, over the centuries, have been driven out of the pillars by fat, greedy and arrogant politicians who kill beauty for profit, something politics always does What National Endowment does is powering the arts, which institutionalize creativity simply for propaganda purposes. <br /> <br /> Babette is on her last legs when she arrives in the small village where two virgin sisters live, searching for their dwindling throng of devotees to their late pastor father. They live on cod and brown bread porridge. <br /> <br /> Babette shows these simple pious humans that God has joy and sensuality as well as behavioral and mental purity. It also shows them how this spiritual purity can lead to controlling Freakish. We all know that from the neo-authoritarians in the government who would limit our personal freedoms because they are somehow a crime against the state or, as they would say, we, humanity. <br /> <br /> Babette is preparing a French dinner to celebrate the deceased priest's 100th birthday. The daughters and their flock believe that it is the devil who comes among them and vows not to notice the food or drink. <br /> <br /> At this point, in preparing the food, paid for by Babette's profit in a French lottery, I start to rip. It is a weakness that has grown in comparison to the daily vulgarity and mendacity that floods our consciousness from dawn to dusk through the media and rulers to take advantage of us all out here in the dark. <br /> <br /> The simple sophistication of Babette's art spits in the face of all the presumptuousness that can be seen in our modern society, and it hurts to see how she is so exquisitely played in this great movie. <br /> <br /> It's my favorite movie of all time with Fanny och Alexander (Bergman), but I can only occasionally watch it because it's like a rare bottle of wine served with blinis and fresh oysters. something that should not be exaggerated. <br /> <br /> A great, great movie that should be in the library of every movie lover.
