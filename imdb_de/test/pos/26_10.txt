This movie has its critics, and Courtney's Fey Dresser can offend some people (who honestly need a good punch on the head) - but the movie is first-rate in every way: captivating, poignant, relevant. Of course, Finney is bigger than life. Courtney makes an ideal slide. I found the performances in both leading roles terribly strong, and Courtney's character offers a lot of dark humor. The period is well captured, the minor characters well chosen. This is to be seen and enjoyed as a fine cordiality. I just wish it was out on DVD ... (* sigh *) ...
