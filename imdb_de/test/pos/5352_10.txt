Coming home from my third sight of The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, I decided to jump on IMDb and see what others thought. I've noticed that many Britons love it, while Americans just do not understand it. This really is not a shock, because America does not understand what "English" is. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are very English. Central English, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity for a good measure. The movie is very similar to our two heroes; simple and modest. It has a beautiful and gentle action, so that the children do not get lost, but there is enough beef to amuse even the adults. There are a few slight allusions (which apparently have offended the evangelists - oh no, drama!), But for a brief moment, there is nothing more impolite than a floor. When people get insulted by a plasticine anus, you know that the world is messed up ... <br /> <br /> A short message to those (all Americans I've seen so far) who think Chicken Run was a better movie: Chicken Run was designed to improve your sense of humor, and I think it suffered as a result. The curse of the Were Rabbit is funny, English and intelligent. The movie by Thomas The Tank Engine was ruined because it should please the Americans, and I am glad that Nick Park did not let this happen at another British institution. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: You can keep your chicken Runs, your shreks, your Madagasga - this kind of raw, blatant slapstick comedy just can not be compared to the wit and grace that Wallace and Gromit have in the curse of Were-rabbits are. English in the core, and for a long time Wallace and Gromit are allowed to stay that way.
