Pink Flamingos is a movie that no word can explain. It was just as good, I thought. It expands movies. Pink Flamingos, which starts with a "multiple" beginning and ends with a shocking but clever ending, is one of the best films of the year. Do not miss the opportunity to see a great movie. Borrow it on video or watch it at a late midnight like me. But see it easy.
