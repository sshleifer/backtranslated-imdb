This movie is incredible. You will never laugh again. It is a goal. No, I think it's ... yes, it's a boob! This movie gets funnier by the minute - like when Jackie Chan's character finally dies in his last fight scene. This movie is velly velly seekwet like Treasha! Congratulations, if you buy or rent this. They will never return, in my opinion. I did not do it and I have not found it in a store since then. I've seen this movie once and was forever in love with kung fu action flicks. If you are looking for an amazing movie that offers high production, good or even mediocre drama and good special effects, this is NOT the movie. If you're looking for laughter and timeless wonder, get it for a dollar and probably never let it go. With friends, popcorn and drinks it's the perfect evening.
