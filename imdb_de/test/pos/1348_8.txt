I captured this movie in July 2006 at an OutFest show in Los Angeles. The edge is rough (especially recordings are shaky) and often very funny. The script is pretty loathsome episodic and ends abruptly, but Ash Christian gives the movie a lot of real heart. It's also a refreshing change when there is a gay movie where there are no underwear models obsessed with celebrating and chasing down guys. A heartfelt condolence for Jonathan Caouette as Mr. Cox, a kindred spirit for Rodney (Ash Christian), the lively and spirited Ashley Finke as Rodney's best friend and Deborah Theaker as Rodney's mother who is the best one-liners in the script and steals her every scene , The film is like its author / director / star lumpy and a bit strange, but also very cute.
