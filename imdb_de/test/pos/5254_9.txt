This movie was funny from beginning to end. Everyone in the cinema laughed loud the whole movie !! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the girl of Will and Grace) and Tanya, the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best settings, etc. Jada Pinkett played a lesbian and was really funny, she played it really well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the movie was the fact that the other two main characters were not that funny, even though the movie was focused on them (yes guys, it's a girl movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!
