Something of a curate egg, this one. I hated it, with the predictable 'Old Dark House' setup, it's a constant reference to the recent horrors of the US and regular rides up and down through dimly lit corridors. <br /> <br /> But it comes and goes These are moments of originality. <br /> <br /> I began to wonder when the killing had just begun, as they would endure with only six cast, but then we get a look back at a previous visit to the building and see a whole lot of bloody kills that are pretty effective. <br /> <br /> Naschy is fine and in the end it was a pleasurable movie. It just does not jump up and grabs one, hard enough.
