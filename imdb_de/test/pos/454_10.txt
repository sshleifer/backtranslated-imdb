a great movie with a rather unclear political message. it's shot in a theatrical style, i.c. Most of the action takes place inside. Mayor Surov and Diana Ashcroft seem equally suspicious. Emotions are high, as Western tourists and businessmen are unwilling to indulge in the mayor's Ostrussian charm, though he tries to understand their point of view. The two opposing world views are made clear, but the film also shows that human emotions can not be controlled by politics. It is powerful and has a strong emotional impact on a 50s movie.
