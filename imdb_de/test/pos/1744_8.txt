This is a very modest, very beautiful movie with a great score by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with the outstanding number "We are the couples in the castle", which is absolutely reminiscent of the epoch and reminiscent of Penthouse Serenade, as well as the opening The Premise (Hoppity's coming) could inspire Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg (Woody's coming) in Finian's Rainbow six years later. I fully agree with the posters that stated that the name Disney had attached this name. In the meantime, she would have achieved the status of "classic" and would not be forgotten. It is wonderfully inventive, and nothing more than when objects that are barely perceived in the "real" world take on a much greater significance in the insect world - for the viewer as well as for the viewer. Actually, it is a classic, albeit a smaller one.
