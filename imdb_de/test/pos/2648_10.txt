This step is absolutely and certainly one of the biggest films of his or her other genres. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey I've never seen on screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors you can attract and hold captive from start to finish, even without advanced dialogue or plot development. Only with visual aspects is it possible in 2001 to present a picture of the future that is both lofty and frightening. No doubt, 10 out of 10. It will not be much better for my money than 2001: A Space Oddysey ... well, the sequel 2010 ... that's another story.
