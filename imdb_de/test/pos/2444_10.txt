I saw it when it was first shown and then missed when it disappeared from British screens. It showed a different side of Old Australia, from which we have to see more. Good juxtaposition of old hands and young Turks. Then the realism of the hard back was fantastic. It was unfortunately missing. This show was a cold look at the old view of Australia. Live hard and work hard. The young idealist collides with the old practical head. Real Politicka is fighting with the young upstarts of New Labor. Add modern political language. <br /> <br /> This show was the first of its kind that I came across and did not try to do a tourist job in Australia. It was a great show of the realistic documentary realistic style of the show. Some good films were in similar work at that time. It would be nice to see that more of this type of television would come from Australia as it has sadly missed the last twenty years. All we got is soap of different quality.
