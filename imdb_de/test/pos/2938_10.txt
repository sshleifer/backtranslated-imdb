As if reality shows like "American Idol" were not enough, in which judges like Simon Cowell shoot down razor-sharp barbs on competitors who try to put their stamp on the music world - barbs that have even moved even outstanding singers to tears after what "Poor Performance," "America's Next Top Model" has now come up with its own version of "Looking for the Next Big Thing" in a store that values ​​superficiality and beauty concepts, conquers the boob tube, and body dysmorphism. <br /> <br /> A concept developed by Tyra Banks, who is also a judge on the show. It gathers fifteen participants from all walks of life and lets them submit to countless "assignments." They have to prove their "talent" in front of the camera and submit not only to the now deceased Janice Dickinson (himself referred to as "American's First Supermodel"), but even the equally crazy Jay Manuel and Nore Marin, who can focus on one point, a girl who is not good and carefree ri shredded as if it was bad morning coffee. Like many other reality-based shows, each week one participant is chosen and has to pack up and leave immediately (a thing she reminds Tyra every turn). Of course, there's the bitchy tension between some of the more Type A women, female ties, tears, dramatic swells of music in key moments, and some truly stunning images that once turn normal, pretty girls into unattainable goddesses. <Br /> <br /> I have to admit that the show is a bad treat. Maybe it's the state of mind I'm in, but I kept wondering where the Eritorium was, when the already skinny girls had to fling themselves to make the cut and look like the judges and photographers and many fickle designers thought they were right for the moment. Still, it attracted me in spite of my previous paragraph, possibly because I've always had an interest in the fashion world and always loved to make breathtaking women with make-up and perfect lighting even fresher. But I wonder where they are going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots. It's like they're competing with "Fear Factor." Shots that look like reenactments of battle scenes in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, are shots where the models have to pose underwater or in almost impossible situations. Next, while bound to the railroad, they pose as an oncoming Amtrak at 70 miles an hour? Or a shoot in which they are under water and chained trying to release themselves in record time, but smash them in chiffon and never forget to smile at her pearly white in front of this camera? How about a "Pit and the Pendulum" version of a photo shoot? <br /> <br /> In one thing, the show needs some kudos and is similar to "American Idol". I'm probably justifying the rigors of both shows and their judges - and essentially conflicting with my original sales. "America's Next Top Model" is a show that, like "American Idol", is an extended casting. In it, the girls will receive the kind of test treatment they will receive in the real world, where aspiring designers and photographers are as monstrously fickle as they can be crushed to pieces at the end of a hat if they are not others will replace them with the necessary conditions, as they have expected, and where one is asked to leave; So it's a miracle that every girl wants to go in such difficult media, but that's what dreams are made of. <br /> <br /> In the fifth season, it is a big disappointment after Janice Dickinson left; During her run, she was a pretty tough barometer as the girls walk, talk, express, express themselves and eventually present themselves as a living product that sells. With the cold addition of Twiggy, I wonder where it will lead - Twiggy just can not replace the exaggerated temperament of Dickinson. With Janice's absence, the show has lost some of its edge and may even have signaled its slow demise, but in the meantime, it's still a catchy treat to watch rash entertainment on weekdays, if not for the beautiful visuals. If anything, it's the show that put Adrienne Curry in the limelight. Curry has made a name for herself through facts less related to modeling than her theatrical love affair with former children's actor Christopher Knight in her own reality soap opera.
