My mother and I went to the Ft Worth premiere, mainly to see George Strait, but in the end we got the chance to see the premiere of the movie in the Bass Hall. What a wonderful, beautiful movie that not only shows the beautiful landscape of Texas, but also had a good action to feel good. It was well written, staged and produced, and my mother and I loved it from start to finish! Thank you, Jay, for giving us the opportunity to attend the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was a night we will never forget. As if the movie was not enough, we were fortunate to sit in front of my favorite singer, George Strait, 4 rows. Thank you thank you thank you!! Keep up the good work and thanks again! <br /> <br /> Debbie McClendon & Maureen Daugherty Ft. Worth, TX
