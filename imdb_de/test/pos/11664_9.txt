"Dead Man Walking" is one of the strongest movies I have ever seen. I find it hard to believe that after seeing the movie, someone might feel indifferent to the movie or its message. Tim Robbins does not seek to impose his ideas and beliefs on viewers, but manages to make a film that is a death penalty in both directions in both views. I have always known where I stand on this issue, even as a child, and this film has made me - despite the fact that it does not claim any real sides - even safer in my conviction that it can never be right to kill anyone *. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet, his nomination for an Academy Award was well deserved. Even if Nicolas Cage does a great job in "Leaving Las Vegas," I would have been happier if Penn had won the prize. Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and she won the Oscar she won. And Tim Robbins certainly deserves the voice I gave this movie: 9/10!
