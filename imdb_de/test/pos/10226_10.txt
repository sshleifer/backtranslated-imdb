I absolutely love this movie. I just managed to get a copy and save it on my birthday. This movie raises some questions. One is Who are the monsters of this world? Being different is just that. Different. The real monsters hide behind masks of ordinariness. These are the ones that everyone considers "a nice, quiet guy" who "did not bother anyone". Or they are worse, they are the characters that Croneberg plays. Men who enjoy carving people and creating their own blood books. I love shapeshifters, people with gifts, and people who displease people when they look at them. This film touches and explores what is normal. Who are "others" and what kind of fear makes some? Even though I've given this film, I'm still sick of women who either scream or behave in ways that they can not see what's happening and are a vehicle for the things that have destroyed the median. My other complaint was why they never did a second movie. I would have liked to see a continuation of this fascinating story, which captivates me from beginning to end
