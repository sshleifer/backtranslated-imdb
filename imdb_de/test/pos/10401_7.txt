Another horror in the hand means another movie in which the fans should still go. <br /> <br /> Imagine a cross between The Blair Witch Project and The Grudge content of this movie. It's another horror that was shot on video, but this time most of the work is done together to complete a video document that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who has disappeared. <br /> <br /> I certainly had a sense of fear watching this movie (does someone feel terribly better than our Asian friends?), but the scary moments, the really scary moments, were a bit less and farther away, as I had hoped. I also felt that I was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when seemingly "revelations" emerged, so I certainly can not recommend that as highly as [* Rec]. <br /> <br /> After that said, it was the It would be a must of me not to recommend a movie that deals extensively with ectoplasmic worms, contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made me see the lights had to turn back on for a while when the sun went down. <br /> Check to see if you've seen a few other genre releases of handhelds lately. And the finale is a hair-raising sucker. <br /> <br /> See this if you want: The Last Broadcast, Pulse, Angel Heart.
