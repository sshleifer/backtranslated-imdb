I found the film as real as Saving Private Ryan and gave a first report from a German point of view. The graphic action and the individual characters gave this movie a lot of cause to interest me throughout the movie. Stalingrad was a very brutal battle, and the scenes gave this movie the stark reality of this battle. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in military history. This was my second visit to this film in a few years and was again fascinated by his realism. The weapons, the uniforms and the German listening to the subtitles made it good for a good military film. In fact, since this is a German perspective of the battle, I chose the Germans, even though they were the aggressor and the last loser of the war.
