Anyone who has ever worked in a hospital or medical facility must appreciate this movie. The plot is absolutely wild, but entertaining from start to finish. The spectacle is great. George C. Scott is the brilliant doctor, but as a husband, father, class A failed. Diana Riggs, a sex symbol of the 1960s and 1970s (by The Avengers), saves him from himself. The environment is outstanding and the dialogue is very entertaining. I think the movie was more fun when I saw him on the 4th, 5th. or 6 .. time, because I have noticed so much more of the richness of dialogue and the interaction of the characters. Always worth seeing. In the near future you just do not want to check in to a hospital.
