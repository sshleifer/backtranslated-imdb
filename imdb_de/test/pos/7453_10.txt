Graphics: of course brilliant. The greatest things were definitely NOT given away in the trailers. Battle sequences move extremely fast, but after watching a few of them, your eyes should be used to it and it will not seem so confusing. Cloud has a wide variety of swords, and I wish things would move a little slower just so we can see them, because they were all incredibly detailed. Oh, and we can finally see exactly how to equip Materia ... <br /> <br /> Music: brilliant too. I was a bit nervous because Nobuo (after all I've seen) is not the best one to write music to do action (remember the Steal the Tiny Bronco sequence?), But it's brilliant and fits perfectly. I am glad that I have pre-ordered the OST. However, you have changed the text to One Winged Angel so you can not sing along if you know the Carmina Burana text. <br /> <br /> Content: In the first half of the movie, things are set and all presented in a rather complex tapestry, but the second half is almost completely combat sequences once all players are in place. I would not call it a weak plot, but it is not nearly as confused as the plot of the game. I think that's an attempt to avoid overshadowing the game, and I think that's a good thing ... the film is a separate entity and should not try to outdo the original in terms of sheer plot. <Br /> <br /> I admit, I somehow hoped that this movie would bring FF7 to a larger number of people, but this is NOT a mainstream movie. I just wanted to give it nine stars just because newcomers do not really try to explain anything ... Marlene (at least I think it was Marlene ... she sounded like her) gives a bit of background knowledge in the beginning, but it does is more a refresher than a crash course. But then I realized that this movie is a 10/10 for me. So why should I lose points just because other people probably do not like it so much ... if you've played the game or are at least passionate If you know it, you should watch this movie. But you do not need me to tell you that. If you're not familiar with the movie, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and hit it. Then watch the movie ... even though it has no background, it is still breathtakingly beautiful. You just do not get any of the inner references ... that make up 50% of the movie (ie, everything that is NOT a combat sequence).
