That was a great movie. Not just for the Black History month, but as a reminder of the kindness of the people and the statement that it really needs a village to raise a child. The performances of S Eptath were outstanding. Mos Def and his singing were off the hook. I had to take a double take when I saw that Rosie Perez was there. But the supportive cast of actors and actresses made that worth seeing. All the different stories they had were incredible. And how Nanny Jr and literally protected everyone else in her presence. I can truly understand that she is the matriarch of that time and even more so when she was tired of helping everyone. I can not wait for it to appear on DVD. It would be a welcome addition to any movie library.
