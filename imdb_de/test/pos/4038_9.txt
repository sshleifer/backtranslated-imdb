Of course, "Snow Queen" is based on the eponymous fairy tale collected in (at least) Andersen's fairy tale - and unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, it retains the spirit of the Faerie. an achievement that many, especially among Americans, do not easily understand. Spoken animals, arbitrary prohibitions, appearances of goblins, dragons and demons are not to question in the fairy tale; They are as natural a Faerie element as gravity in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is completely at the edge of history. The story is also not tied to the modern Hollywood composition rules: direct, often grotesquely linear in smaller works, and obviously (at least in retrospect). <br /> <br /> With this resistance to the common criticism of those who do not understand fairy tales, "Snow Queen" is a delightful film with wonderful visual effects, nifty acting and great feeling. The only flaw in the film, in my opinion, was not that it was too fantastic, but that certain parts of the dialogue in slang and expression were too disgustingly modern, affecting his otherwise timeless nature.
