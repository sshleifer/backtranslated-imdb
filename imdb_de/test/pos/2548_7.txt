I can not say that was not done well. At a film festival, the director admitted that some scenes took 30 takes. And there is not the slightest hint that he did not get exactly what he wanted. This, however, is strangely not Hispanic film, just like West Side Story many years ago. Both leads, a brother-sister team, are outstanding and memorable in their fields. The area, a kind of underground garage repair area in Queens, is completely foreign to most people and worth the price. However, the core theme of the film is unsatisfactory, namely, what the nurse considers necessary to get along. I can understand your brother's reaction, but it just seems too easy. The film seems to suggest that people like this do not need our help, that they will find a way to survive without the usual support systems. I would not encourage anyone to believe that. The decisions made here would withstand far more resistance than pictured. Apart from the fact that it works well as a conversation. As an accurate representation of a culture, I think, not so good.
