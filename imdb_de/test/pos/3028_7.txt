Style over substance. But what style is that? "The Cell" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, history hardly supports visualization. <br /> <br /> The psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) uses her artificial resources to enter into the dreams of her patients in order to discover and help her phobias and obsessions. A new patient who has fallen into a coma is being alerted by the FBI. He is a serial killer who drowns his female victims and then depicts their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his ill fantasies to find and save his last victim. <br /> <br /> Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and standards for this production. Each dream sequence is like a nightmare in motion, from the landscape to the costumes. <br /> <br /> But the plot suffers from the lack of history of their characters. Stargher is the only person with a thorough background and the last person you want to take care of. Without him, there is practically a movie that moves only in the present, which is a pity, since the film is visually stunning and really scary. Lopez is wasted, but she's not an amazing actress anyway, though she's as gorgeous as ever. And Vince Vaughn? I do not even know why he was selected. This is not his strength and he does it too well. He tried too hard to become his character, and it turned out. Stay with the comedy, Vince! Still, this movie is so visually scary that I can still see this movie with the lights on and never fall asleep immediately afterwards.
