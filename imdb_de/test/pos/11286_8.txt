Innate is certainly an experience and an extraordinary experience. The use of color is fascinating and sometimes frustrating. MUCH of what is happening on the screen is incredibly hard to spot. Your vision is obscured by either a sudden bizarre change in color and tone, signs in the path, and random cuts to the sky. The sound is very haunting and a welcome addition. It really helps the nihilistic and hopeless tone that stifles this movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding begging, the theory of "rape of the environment and rebirth" feels pretty accurate. But I would not spend a lot of time focusing on the meaning, it's practically unimportant. It is clear that the director did not want to explain anything. He simply presents it as it is, and if you want to search for meaning, it's up to you. <br/> <br /> Taking care of begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, but I was fascinated by the opening. It's like watching a person's worst nightmare. What we see is sometimes uncomfortable and very uncomfortable, but there is a surreal, dreamlike beauty. If you are an art house / experimental fan and have not yet seen begotten, you should make it a priority. I doubt you'll ever forget it. I know for sure that I will not do it.
