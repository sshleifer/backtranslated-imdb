From the opening sequence, filled with black-and-white images reminiscent of Gordan Park's photographs, this film draws the viewer into a sense of artistic renaissance. This is exactly what the background of a poetry caf√© with the fitting name "The Sanctuary" offers. Jazz, which permeates film and cinematography, will seduce you. <br /> <br /> This love story actually makes love grow, develop and eventually mature, a rarity in Hollywood. Everyone can identify with a stage on their way to each other. This story of two artists who just can not quite make it, triggered a debate among their audience. Should she have gone? Should he have stopped her? Who knows ...? <br /> <br /> Actors Larenz Tate (Darius Lovehall) and Nia Long (Nina Moseley) with a scene in which Isiah Washington (Savon) and Lisa Nicole Carson (Josie Nichols) steal the performance's ultimate best friend, this movie is a romantic gem. <br /> <br /> See this with someone you love (wink).
