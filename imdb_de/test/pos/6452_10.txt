City Streets is staggeringly modern for a 1931 film. Even those who are not fascinated by Gary Cooper's strong magnetism and who attract the attention of the audience. The plot is pretty detailed and clear. The decor scenarios are exceptional in every detail. All actors are above average. I always appreciate how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, light and photography, could have been so brilliant. I could not find a mistake because I knew the scenes on the road (bumpy ride) with the big movie screen in the background were the best they could get in 1931. All in all, I found this movie great and thankful for Gary Cooper's charisma.
