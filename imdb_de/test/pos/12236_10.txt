In the changing world of CG and whatever animated animation, etc., faeries was a warm welcome, at least to me. I think it's important to occasionally show these kinds of films to preserve them and remind us where the originality and fun of the cartoons came from. People talked about how boring it is because of the graphics and stuff, but hey! Think of the movies that are considered boring, when every movie looks like the new state of the art that everyone and their mother are doing today. Call me old-fashioned, but I liked it. It's a wonderful story about supernatural beings and humans and all she really needs from her audience is her imagination.
