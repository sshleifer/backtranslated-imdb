This movie is probably one of the best I have seen so far. I would put it second only to All About Lily Chou-chou, because it somehow gives me the same mood ... "9 souls" are about 9 prisoners who have just fled from prison to find fake money capsule at the Mount Fuji Elementary School. Later, they learn that there was not much there and set off. The first half of the film is just a time for introducing the characters and identifying the main points. It's a funny but serious part of the journey. The second half moved me to tears. In the further course of the film each character tries to realize his dreams, but unfortunately ends a bit badly. At the end, only 2 of the 9 outliers are left. The way every character left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes. a beautiful movie that is fantastically directed. This is a movie for people who have enjoyed other movies by Toshiaki Toyoda like "Blue Spring".
