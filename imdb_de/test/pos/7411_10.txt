"Pharaoh's army" defies the formula. Rather than choosing clich√©s and big stars, she relies on the stellar cast of a strong cast, the power of a well-written script, and a fascinating and bitter story. The result is a raw and realistic movie that moves fast and with a strong emotional flow. One of the best I've ever seen about the Civil War, and I think it's the pleasure of being an independent film. If you like this movie, try watching the similarly brilliant Indian Civil War movie "Wicked Spring". ). <br /> <br /> "Pharaoh" simply tells the true story of a small expedition / team of trade unionists going to a confederate farm to take provisions, but one of the men is trapped by an accident. Tensions and relationships are created and broken. Nothing happens the way Hollywood would write it; This film comes from the mind of a person who is really interested in quality film and narration of history. Outstanding dialogue and plot exposures move along a film that looks highly professional, but often does not feel like you're watching a movie, more like hearing a story. <br /> <br /> The film is unbelievable performance by Chris Cooper, who shows amazing versatility in exploring his role. He transforms himself, but is always on the level of credibility and can easily be emotionally related. Patricia Clarkson is equally outstanding and realistic in a role in which many actresses would collapse. She shares an interesting chemistry with Cooper's character and where she is the stricter of characters, she is still so easy to identify. The rest of the cast is quite capable of doing well. <br /> <br /> The art design and set are wonderful, and I personally love the camera. It feels like a photograph from the Civil War, with the camera presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin-like metallic tint, while retaining the naturalistic look of the rustic setting. They seem to have used natural light, but whatever they have used works wonderfully. Everything looks like it's where it is, it feels like period, which I rarely find in American films. The actors are from the 19th century, not like 20th century people in old clothes. <br /> <br /> This movie is very personal. I think it can afford itself as an indie. The film is almost flawless with an excellent script that effortlessly recreates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters, making them grow in such a bad situation. It does not fail to convey the point, and it becomes clear without the usual and overused techniques used in all war films today. It is brave. It's based on his characters, a fantastic script, human emotions, and the cold hard fact that the Civil War did not just consist of CGI, big stars, and hoop skirts.
