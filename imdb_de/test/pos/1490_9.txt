Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as an unsuspecting Mr. Bean who never gets far without his teddy bear. The attraction of Mr. Bean is essentially his childlike behavior and innocence. We do not know if he came from heaven or from another planet. He's a kind of weird character you can not easily make out. He is often alone and used to it. It's hard for him to communicate through language, which is why we sometimes hear his grunt. There are other characters who talk to him and he answers. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and still is. He lives alone and does the unthinkable, if he can do the rational. Mr. Bean is more of a strange man who does not mind. He prefers to live a simple life with his yellow car and his teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time.
