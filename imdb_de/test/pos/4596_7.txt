Many things in this futuristic satire are theoretically funny rather than funny (though they have some vociferous moments), but many of them are because they seem to have been cut from the studio to address just idiots, it's a ridicule. Many situations must not evolve, there is obviously an overdubbing of repository material, and most of all, a narrator will declare EVERYTHING (most of which need no explanation), probably because some previewers did not understand what was happening. In other words, a movie about mute was ... you guessed it. <br /> <br /> It is hoped that a longer, better version of this comedy will eventually appear on DVD, and it deserves to be a cult favorite, but even in this mutilated and slightly weird-spiritually diminished form, it's one The Most Memorable Movies of The Year - A Cry Of Disgust With Our Culture And All The Ways It Is Pampered, Confused And Maimed Name For The Yahoo. I saw it right after Land of the Dead, George Romero's recent milking of the only idea that consumers are = zombies, which is basically the same point that Richter makes. But where Romero's counterculture viewpoint (now zombies = sub-class rebelling against the rich) seems hopelessly outdated, Judge's attitude is fresh, unyielding, and much more disturbing. Just listen to the yoos in your film audience who, like the others on the screen, are excited about President Camacho's state, and you know we're all doomed to failure.
