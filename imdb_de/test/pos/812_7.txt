... and I'm so disappointed that I can not buy the DVD or the VHS from anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of mix of Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwood's fabulous as the spoiled teenager. This was done when Molly was still a brunette just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pink. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good, clean family comedy with an advantage! <br /> <br /> If someone has a copy of it or knows where to get one ... please leave a message for me - it will be appreciated.
