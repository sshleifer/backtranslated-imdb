Gone with the Wind is one of the most popular books ever printed. It is by far the film of all films. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett made people all over the world dream and made the main characters into cinematographic icons. One may ask, is it really necessary to make a sequel? And ... there are some big shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> Well, there was the book first. "Scarlett" by Alexandra Ripley is, we must admit, well written and respects the world created by Margaret Mitchell. It picks up where we left our heroine before, gently leading us from Mitchell's legacy to her own imagination. In the book that defeated Scarlett after the death of Melanie and the departure of Rhett, he travels to Charleston to live with her mother-in-law, hoping to regain Rhett's love. Her typical manipulative behavior again calls Rhett very critically and drives her further apart ... to a certain boat trip that will change everything. Scarlett is now wearing a secret. The series follows the book pretty much until the arrival of Scarlett in Ireland. From then on, the book and the series separate slowly. The real end is different, but of course, both Scarlett and Rhett are back together. Production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the next Scarlett O'Hara. Many countries produced their own television programs with young actresses auditioning for the role. Eventually, about twelve girls were selected to attend the latest screen tests and interviews in Atlanta, Georgia. Unfortunately, the producer has not found a Scarlett among these actresses. Sad for the girls, big promotion for the show (it was already sold to many TV stations worldwide before shooting began). Robert Halmi, the producer who acquired the rights to 'Scarlett', said he spotted the right actress on TV, called her and signed the deal two days later. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (who starred in "Willow" and "Scandal," the latest movie Robert Halmi watched on this loyal evening) is not Vivien Leigh, but she's undoubtedly Scarlett! Her performance is not a copy of Leighs, she makes the character her own. The main difference between GWTW and 'Scarlett' is the fact that the main character develops and grows as a person. This is the prerogative of the series. Why should you copy something that was done before? Given that there is a gap of almost seventy years between the first and the second plot, it seems likely that both authors emphasize different aspects of the characters. While Mitchell takes care of Scarlett and struggles with the aftermath of the Civil War and Tara, Ripley Scarlett faces her demons. This is the most interesting aspect of the series for me. We meet Scarlett in a different way because she learns that things can not always go the way she wants. I totally agree with the choice of Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler. He portrays him with charm and irony and is less a cardboard figure than Clark Gables performance. The rest of the cast was well chosen. Julie Harris is very popular as Rhett's mother, John Gielgud gives a very amusing performance, as grandfather Robillard and Sean Bean are always in great shape and play a dirty character. His Lord Fenton is no exception. Bad decisions, however, with Stephen Collins as Ashley and Ann-Margret's adaptation of Belle Watling were a waste of money. Costumes, sets and locations are elaborate and convincing. The newly built Tara set looked exactly the same and it's a moving sequence in the series when the house first appears. <br /> <br /> Is there a reason to make a sequel ... Well, six hours of romance are for me. One to watch!
