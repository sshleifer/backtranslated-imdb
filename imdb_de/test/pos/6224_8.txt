I think it depends on when you see the movie for the first time, that its impression is shaped as it is. I saw him on television in 1973 as a kid when he loved The Fremder and I loved it. At that time, the moon's space program was a reality, as shows such as "Search," "UFO," and "6M $ Man" showed a 12-year-old child what the world could hold in her future. Adventure and technology. <br /> <br /> You only saw shows once, and that was when the network sent them. The only way people could cut their shows was by doing their own parody. They could not take your show and add their own comments. <br /> <br /> I did not know what that concept of a "pilot" was. I saw the movie and hoped that Stryker would come home; I did not know that there was a possibility that it took more than two hours. <br /> <br /> Did I understand then, what so many people hate about the movie now? I doubt it because I do not remember it. I do not really understand now to understand the story, you should not see it from their perspective, but rather from the characters of the film. <br /> <br /> If you watch as an American, there can be a sense of humor about the lack of security in a police state ..... but if you are a subject in that state, compliance could be expected and security can be lower. If it is assumed that things are perfect and perfect to an extreme degree, so perfect that you do not doubt, then you probably will not question that quickly if things are not right. The movie is as interesting as the old one A man who remembers the time, but watches his words, suspecting that there are spies everywhere. Or that the police state appreciates knowledge to some degree because it pays attention to how they control or damage their brain performance. These days, you probably know exactly what the movie is about before you see it. So much of the tension is lost to the surprise. But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the film is a perfect exchange, considering that this film was well received in the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he crashed in the USSR. You get a long distance in the movie before it turns out that such a possibility is the least concern. <br /> <br /> This is the main difference between "The Stranger" and "Doppelganger". The latter can be considered as timeless, as his comments on the USSR are relatively small and were lost early in the film. In the former, these links are through the film, supposedly right at the beginning and then as a theme variation by stations. All in all, despite my good memories of the movie, it's pretty easy to see that it was not made as a series. Every week Stryker would make friends, Benedict would hunt, Stryker would get away. Eventually, Benedict's society would get rid of him. Someone else would take up the persecution. A rut would develop. It could be a jab to something new, like maybe another crew member from Stryker's mission, but it probably would not be enough to keep the show going. <br /> <br /> If you go with the knives that others have used to cut the film, chances are they will cut it too. However, remembering that this was done during the Cold War, and what the other side's fears and assessments of that time were, which contained the popular environment for the viewer, they could find entertaining and intellectual themes in it.
