Whether "National Velvet (1944)" is a bit choppy and sometimes unconvincing. Clarence Brown's equestrian fable is a lovely and very likable story with a good morale. After her modest success in "Lassie Come Home" (1943), the young Elizabeth Taylor, age 12, received her first starring role as Velvet Brown, a passionate schoolgirl obsessive with horses. Although filmed in California, the story - based on a novel by Enid Bagnold - is set in a small township in the English countryside, and Technicolor photography takes full advantage of the vivid and beautiful landscapes of the blue sky and the green To present shrubs. Mickey Rooney takes the top score as Mi Taylor, a misguided ex-jockey with fanciful intentions, whose relationship with the young Velvet revives his dignity and opens a new, optimistic chapter in his life. Although Rooney is clearly struggling in a succession, when he has to confess the traumatic experience that has led to his fear of horses, as a grumpy but passionate young man who has to prove his worth, he may well, that Elizabeth Taylor had these fascinating purple eyes because her acting skills were rather limited at this young age. Her emotional processes, in which she displays courage and integrity despite adversity, seem rather hollow, and the touching-naive idea that simply "believing" will accomplish anything is one that has been repeating itself almost utterly every day unforgettable inspirational sports movie that has ever been filmed. Nevertheless, Taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and she works well with Mickey Rooney, who was not a kid star. Anne Revere plays a very important role as Velvets mother, once a famous athlete, who not only swam the English Channel, but was also lovingly trained by none other than the father of Mi Taylor. I liked that Mi was told about it only in the last seconds of the movie. Ms. Brown rightly decided that the young man first had to develop his own sense of decency instead of using the memory of his deceased father for financial gain. Undoubtedly, he would have done so at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The film reaches its climax at the Grand National Sweepstakes, where Velvet has decided at the last moment to own her own horse, the Pi, in the world-renowned contest. Under the guise of a Latvian man she wins the race as expected, but is later disqualified - either because she is a girl or because she fell off the horse before she was allowed to dismount (what a stupid rule!). This lengthened racing sequence is extremely well done and effectively captures the nervous tension of these nerve-wracking seconds before the race and the confusion of the event that puts us in the same position as Rooney's character, stranded behind big onlookers, eagerly awaiting someone who provides an accurate update. It's not really important to know that this is a stunt double performing most of the difficult rides - in several scenes we can clearly see a scary-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same. I bet that "National Velvet" has fostered the imagination of millions of young girls over the past sixty years, and has little lessened its inspirational power over time.
