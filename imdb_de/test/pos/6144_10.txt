I saw this movie one night I could not sleep, I loved it and looked to find out when it would run again, probably the best movie I've ever seen, and even now the cast is full of people I had never seen this before, but it seems to be a real story from NYC. This is the kind of movie that enhances your viewing pleasure because you see, hear, and feel it from the moment Wirey saw a beer. When I watched the game, I imagined how it must be to grow up without a father. There are so many lines from this movie I use every day, like "The personal time alone" in the bathroom and a 7-11 drink
