I was torn over this show. While most parts of it were HILARIOUS, I found other parts stupid and shocked only for shock reasons. The parody on the wall of some of the cartoons is brilliant, as there are indeed many scenes with the kids. However, I do not think it is wise to get small children to say rude things. It's not like I think "Oh, poor kids, they're being exploited" - it's just not really smart !! It's something ANYONE could do and makes it as easy and pointless as a paper airplane. To improve this show, they would have to follow the natural reactions of children, which in my opinion may be funnier than the script currently. <br /> <br /> By far the funniest part of Wonder Showzen is Clarence, the blue puppet who marvels on the streets, talking to strangers and annoying strangers. It's really funny and mostly improvised. To see him in a long scene, how important patience is to test the patience of an EXTREME patient, was by far the funniest scene in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But you should watch this show, because all in all, it's very funny, even if it's sometimes stupid.
