I only saw this movie because I always liked Kevin Costner. I had the feeling that Ashton did a great job in the Butterfly effect. Although these two actors were / are capable of good, if not great, acting moments, unfortunately something was missing here. Some of the scenes simply were not believable and did not have enough support for the story. <br /> <br /> Although the movie has the impact of Hurricane Katrina, there was little (any) effect in the film. <br/> <br/> Overall, I liked the fact that the movie brought some of it has what is needed in saving lives from the water's point of view. <br /> <br /> The special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating I'm not sure if I'll ever go deep-sea fishing again. <br /> <br /> I expected a bit more emotion in the movie than what was presented. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie that 'I've seen on DVD.
