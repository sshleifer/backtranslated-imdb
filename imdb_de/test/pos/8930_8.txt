EIGHTEEN, as written and directed by Richard Bell, may have too many stories to tell for a 102-minute movie at the same time to be completely successful, but there is such a fine sense of commitment by all actors and crew that the Spectators ends The film should work - and it does. Yes, the aspects may have been a bit more sophisticated if the producers had spent more on the final cut, but as a small independent Canadian film, this is a tender, gently humorous, very touching story of vulnerability, communication and engagement. It works on many levels. <br /> <br /> In a very well choreographed opening we are voyeurs at a family dinner where obviously something went wrong and a father and two sons get into a car and have an accident killing one of their sons. With such an introduction, the mood for the surviving 18-year-old Pip son (Paul Anthony - far too old for his credibility as a teenager) is set to leave his family and live on the streets. He meets Clark (Clarence Sponagle), a male prostitute who gives Pip food and shelter, Jenny (the very fine Carly Pope) who saves him from bashing her partner Derek (Ryan McDonell) and romantically gets involved with Pip, and Father Chris (Alan Cumming) in a finely worked sympathetic role as a priest. It's Pip's 18th birthday, and his father (Serge Houde) is following Pip Down to give him a present from his late grandfather with instructions to open on PIP's 18th birthday. Pip, though he drank too much and furiously pledges the tape machine, retains the tape and listens to the words of his grandfather Jason (voice of Ian McKellen), who tells his 18th birthday in France during World War II where he (now the very sensitive actor Brendan Fletcher) has an experience with a wounded paramedic named Macauley (also Mark Hildreth, also excellent) and reflects only on his former marriage to a cabaret singer Hannah (Thea Gill of 'Queer as Folk') and a good singer and actress For something to live for during the war: Jason offers support to Macauley after his death, with a beautiful salvation scene for the two men at the end. The parallels between Pip and Grandfather Jason play together each time Pip hears the tape and makes Pip change his view of life and love. In the subplans, Clark is the isolated existence as Hustler, who was changed by Jeff (David Beazely - in a surprisingly fine film debut) who simply wants to be loved. by an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; by the trust that Father Chris instills in both Pip and Clark in a good shepherd's way: and by looking back on the car accident in which Pip could have saved his brother Daniel (Paul Dzenkiw) from an abusive act by his father just before the accident but not done, opened his deep guilt and resulting misplaced anger, which reflected on the experiences of his grandfather. Each of these subplots ties together at the end, creating a sense of closure for each of the participants. <br /> <br /> There are aspects of this film that make it seem like a big budget production: the music score by Bramwell Tovey is performed by the Vancouver Symphony members, Kevin Van Niekerk's cinematography is exquisitely atmospheric and overall quality the acting of this Canadian cast is very good. Although Paul Anthony handles his role well, a casting with a very young teenager in the deciding lead would have significantly improved the story, and Richard Bell promises to see a young talent in his resume with another film, "Two Brothers." Despite the shortcomings, EIGHTEEN is a worthwhile movie and deserves attention. Grady harp
