Alright, let me break it for you ... Haggard is probably one of the funniest movies you've ever seen. It's a mix of a unique story about a guy with girl problems and everything that goes backwards for him, with countless humorous scenes that will make you laugh throughout the movie. I would know what kind of humor to expect when you do Considering that most people are from these films. All in all ... I just had to give 10/10 because it's one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> ~ F0rs4k3n <br /> <br /> (P.S.) Haggard Rules!
