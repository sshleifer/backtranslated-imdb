I hate the idea of ​​TV movies. For me, TVMs usually involve Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying from a difficult-to-treat disease in such a sugary manner that the public does not need tissue that needs insulin. When DEADLY VOYAGE was a BBC and HBO-produced movie based on a true story that I vaguely remembered when I was in the TV schedule a few years ago, I sat down and waited, bored become. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> No blow to the last sentence, I was not surprised that I was shocked. Here's a TVM that grabs you harder than a big white shark. In fact, DEADLY VOYAGE does not deserve to be banished to the TV schedule. It should be made and distributed by a Hollywood movie company, as it is absolutely scary and what it's more it is - unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS - totally true. <br /> <br /> For those who do not know the story !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER TO REASON !!!!! In the early 1990s, a bunch of Africans were camping on a Ukrainian cargo ship to work in France. Of course, this was an attempt at illegal immigration, but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for leaving illegal immigrants from a previous voyage on their ship and not getting into trouble with the maritime and immigration authorities who were the ones responsible for the illegal immigration Crew the Africans murdered after their discovery they hide in the hold. Anything but one African, Kingsley Ofusu, who manages to escape the firing squad, has to survive aboard the ship, but the problem is that the crew is chasing him and France is still a few days away. <br /> <br /> Simply entering the above paragraph will remind you how good DEADLY VOYAGE is. What a remarkable story, and again, unlike many stories that claim to be, it is absolutely true. It's very well written, staged and played, especially by Sean Pertwee (why is not this guy a big star?) And most of all, it's a tense, claustrophobic, disturbing thriller that I remember well six years after his visit can do it for the one and only time. I look forward to seeing you again. <br /> <br /> But you have to wonder how a TVM can be better than most Hollywood action blockbusters that hit the market at about the same time. Oh, wait, I just had a worrying thought that Jerry Bruickhiemer has done a remake with Tony Scott as director and Denzil Washington as Kingsley, Brad Pitt as Pertwee's role, massive artistic license with events, etc. VOYAGE is a superlative TV not a bad blockbuster
