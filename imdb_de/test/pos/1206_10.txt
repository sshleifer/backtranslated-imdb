I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and every time I look at it, the movie is just as entertaining as the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of 1960s-1970s anti-war "hippies" living largely in New York City. This small group meets a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage), who was drafted into the US Army for use in Vietnam. Despite all efforts to dissuade him, Claude finally reports on the basic training in the army. The hippie group is still worried because they left them. She steals a car and travels through the US to visit Claude "... for a few hours." Claude's military base is temporarily stationed in Nevada. The result is really touching, so I will not spoil it for those who have not seen this fantastic movie yet. The music is just as fantastic! Don Dacus (of the rock group Chicago), who plays the role of "woof" - one of the hippies - is not a key figure, but the film would not have been the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays Sheila Franklin, an uptown girl friend of the hippie group) is sensational in her role! A must movie !!
