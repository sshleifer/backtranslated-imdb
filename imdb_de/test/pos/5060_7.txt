An Arabian American is abducted from an American airport and flown "somewhere in North Africa" ​​where he is tortured. The reason? His cell phone received a call from a well-known terrorist. The CIA decides to avoid legal means to determine if the phone call is fault or just a mistake. After watching this movie, we can only pray that a terrorist will not mistakenly enter the wrong number! <br /> <br /> In addition to the playback, there are several related side stories. First, the daughter of the Intel chief (secret police?) Who tortures the suspect, and her involvement in her lover, who is currently in the night school for suicide bombers. This story is much to be invented, yet fascinating, especially when we see the result. The director uses a concise timer switcheroo to attract the audience. <br /> <br /> The second side story is the suspicious woman's attempt to find out what happened to her missing husband. She gets an old lover to help. He (a muffled Saarsgard) is adjutant to a senator (Alda) and soon gets cold feet when he realizes that his job is not worth exposing the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role. All she can do is, with a brief tantrum, leave and look pregnant. Streep is good and cold and stereotyped as the government. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) Official who appears to be a Cheney clone. <br /> <br /> Gylenhall is also wasted when a small analyst is pushed into an area where he is over his head, though in the end he can do the "right thing". <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was a bit slender, but added that it did not add much to the topic. It certainly is not considered final, and it certainly has an ax to grind. Like The Kingdom, it's scratching the surface of a very complicated subject. <br /> <br /> The film makes a great effort to convey some idea of ​​the playback, but can only end up being a botched "warning story". The rendition is not about "torturing" but about getting "terror suspects" to convey information by avoiding legal (ie obstructive) barriers. Certainly, torture can be used, especially if the transfer is not in our hands - although obviously we are not guilty in this matter - but information that can save lives is crucial in this "shadow war".
