This film deals with the issues of loss, personal struggle, and transformation in such an intelligent, artistic, sensitive, and visually stunning way that I was fully transported. It is a rare jewel of a film in the way it distinguishes beauty and women. You have to see it for yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) masterfully portrays the intricacies of a remarkable, if not slightly broken, personality in a way that every woman refers to. I found the honesty of the emotional interactions between the characters very refreshing and profound. There was nothing in this film that told me "low budget" in terms of quality. Nothing. The fact that this is a low-budget movie is a tribute to the creators of the film. The final sequence during the credits will also put off your socks. It's a brilliant celebration of Jane's choice. Unexpected and inspiring.
