Never were the words "hidden gem" so accurate. Poor movie lovers may look everywhere for the next hidden darkness. Sometimes there are problems with weasels that tear my flesh, but at other times luck will prevail and you may end up with something like the death bed. Then hopefully it'll be clear that it's not a bad movie at all, it just has a bad title and not even a bad title, but a humorous one that might scare you off, but somehow the Death Bed still fits in the bad category. With a bleak and empty atmosphere, Death Bed is a true masterpiece of low-budget horror, reserved for those lucky enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision. <br /> <br /> The Death Bed contains an incoherent yet intriguing relationship between a demon in bed and the sympathetic mind trapped in the portrait, wishing he could save someone from the terrible fate of the yellow foam to be devoured. Although not so scary, Death Bed has the qualities that make a successful horror. A dark, desolate atmosphere, confusion, an eerie, subtle score, and the dream quality that almost brings this masterpiece to life. Such quality or mood usually appears unintentionally. It's not just intentional, but what I've read is based on a real dream: director George Barry has successfully translated the dream into the movie, only a genius could perform such a task. <br /> <br /> Old mansions provide good quality horrors, as well as portraits that are not sure what to do with the Killer Bed and the Killer Blue Liquid. This is indeed a bizarre dream. This is not quite the brand of B-horror that I expected, considering the title and everything. Before I looked at this gothic jewel, I expected something more like a class reunion massacre. Now this is a bad movie. If you have seen it, you know what I am saying. After considering all this, I feel that the Death Bed has earned only eight stars, but since it has been so dark for so long, we say the bed that eats earns nine.
