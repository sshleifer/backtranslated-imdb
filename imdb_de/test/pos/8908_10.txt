One of the best shows ever made and getting better with age. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons for me was the English adaptation of David Weir. <br /> <br /> A Japanese friend of mine once told me that the show was a bit more bizarre and less flattened in the original language than the version we all know. I think that his non-Japanese fans are mainly on Mr. Weir's inspired efforts and some profitable voice-over work are due. <br /> <br /> Well done, sir!
