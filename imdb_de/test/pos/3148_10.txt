I saw "The Reader" at a Manhattan film festival this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films did. In about ten minutes, it tells a poignant story with two characters that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done an excellent job, capturing very real, tender moments in the film. What I really admire about this movie is that the director chose a short story story. These are really interesting characters, and their story is told in perfect time. That is no small matter. Have not we seen all the shorts that are simply longer, format-adapted stories, or storytelling that did not fit the screen properly? I welcome "The Reader" that he did it right and I encourage anyone who is interested in film and storytelling to take a serious look. Worth every moment!
