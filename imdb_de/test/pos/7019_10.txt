When Dirty Dancing was on TV last year, I was out so I could not see it. My mother swore that I had seen it and that she had it somewhere on tape. In any case, she came to the point where she could not find her video, so I bought her the DVD for Christmas. Well, she had not looked. She sat there for a while and then one night I decided to take it upstairs and fell in love with it. This is a great movie with many beautiful scenes! I love the plot and enjoyed every moment! It's definitely not for everyone, but if you love a love story, you'll want to see Dirty Dancing again and again! Dirty Dancing - The way love should be meant!
