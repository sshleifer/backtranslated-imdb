My architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself through the legacy of his famous architect father Louis Kahn, who died in 1974. The film is developing slowly but perfectly, and what begins as a seemingly lost identity crisis is developing into a beautiful story of much deeper meaning in terms of the meaning of love, loss, family, and perhaps more importantly, in our life's work. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Louis Kahn before this movie, though I was vaguely familiar with some of his work. The words (both good and bad) of Louis Kahn's colleagues give a very good feeling of what Nathaniel must have felt when recalling memories and telling stories. Sometimes it seemed that these people were telling Nathaniel how to deal with his father. When I heard every memory, my own opinion of this man sometimes wavered for a moment, and it gave me a good feeling for the roller coaster where Nathaniel's emotions must have awakened. The final sequence in Bangladesh made the film for me. The reverence that people in Bangladesh said that Louis Kahn's work connected all loose ends for me and, hopefully, for Nathaniel. <br /> <br /> I think Nathaniel Kahn has finally found what he was looking for.
