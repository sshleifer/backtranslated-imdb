This is one of my favorite movies; a delightful comedy; I was thrilled to learn that it will be released on DVD in the UK in September 2007. Romuald, played by Daniel Auteuil, is a prolific company president of a dairy. Juliette, played by the eminent Firmine Richard, cleanses the Paris office of the company. Juliette, a black mother of several children, discovers a plot against Romuald, who initially ignores her attempts to warn him. Slowly he grabs what this charming lady from the Parisian subclass has tried to tell him. 'He seeks shelter in her crowded apartment as his marriage and career fall apart. An unusual love blossom. Cultures meet in a truly adorable carefree comedy.
