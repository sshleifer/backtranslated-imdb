No corned beef and cabbage anymore! <br /> <br /> This little romantic comedy is cut from scene to scene with some exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). It's all about the husband's wife, who's been played out of the doldrums of Gloria Swanson (she's been here for twenty years). Both leading men have a natural air that is convincing and, of course, Swanson is perfect for all kinds of moods, from reckless to anxious to hopeful. Behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is the old serious problem of staying in love and not in love. There is a bit of craziness, but director DeMille is anxious that he stay calm and credible. As with many films from that period, the subtitles not only tell what they say (or think), but often give a kind of philosophical insight, as if they justify the tragedy (or raciness). And there is this higher purpose here, probably better without the instruction text, but it is part of the narrative style and somehow curious. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for visual or formal amazement, you will not find it here. But as a story, well played and filmed with precision and economy, this is truly a great example. The events are not entirely surprising, but it's a modern love story set almost a hundred years ago, a gas. And did I see that Swanson was perfect?
