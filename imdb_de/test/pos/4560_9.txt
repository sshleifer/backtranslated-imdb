Her husband arrives at Sharpe's camp to challenge his wife's assailant to a doppelganger. The doppelganger is discovered and stopped by the authorities, and Sharpe becomes the prime suspect when his opponent is murdered in the middle of the night. <br /> <br /> Since no one in the British Army except Wellington and Major Nairn Sharpe considers anything but a rough citizen with little or no honor, he has ordered a Shambolic trial and is sentenced to death Harper and the Chosen Men have no choice but to watch their beloved Commander slowly go to the gallows. However, Wellington and Nairn, persuaded by his innocence, hang in Sharpe's place another convicted prisoner and dismiss him and his chosen men to find the true killer and La Marquesa himself, not only his innocence But also to find out their reasons, why they have even made in the first place. <br /> <br /> Daragh O'Malley, Micheal Byrne and Hugh Fraser perform with brilliant performances by Alice Krige as La Marquesa and FÃ©odor Atkine as the vicious Major Ducos, in another exciting, adventurous episode through Sharpe's moving journey through the Napoleonic Wars.
