One of the most interesting things is that this movie from 1988 is touted as "just for the name". There's nothing wrong with that: the return of Chevy Chase as Ty Webb. This connects the viewer with this character (from the original caddy's hack of 1980) and makes the fans think or want Caddyshack II to be similar to the first one. There are rumors that Rodney Dangerfield should return. He had a large part of the first movie with him, so that Caddyshack 2 would have been exceeded on his return. Jackie Mason is the "new" Rodney for this movie and does a decent job, even though her comic deliveries are a lot different. Dan Aykroyd was great, but not enough in the movie. He should have had a say in how much screen time Bill Murray had in the first one. Robert Stack (Airplane!) Was good in the "new" Ted Knight / Villian role. (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Noonan should have been back. So many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. Bushwood would not have had to go through the entire renovation. Instead, the characters involved and not the club itself should have been the main focus as in the first. When you watch this movie, remember that this is not a big sequel, and you may think it's another good or bad 80's comedy. Fans of the first should see it, but do not be shocked if the comparisons between Original and Part II are so far apart.
