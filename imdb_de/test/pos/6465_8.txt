Although this little film has been lost in the wake of On The Waterfront, Edge Of The City can keep up with this star-studded classic. It's another story about the docks and the code of silence that governs it. <br /> <br /> In addition to the corrupt union in which Lee J. Cobb ran on The Waterfront, Jack Warden is really just a little time corruption. But as a gang boss in one of the docks, he is really enough to intimidate the other workers by helping with his fists and the Abhakhakah and getting the rest to repay some of their hard earned money. And it's all hard earned money in this job. <br /> <br /> One guy Warden can not be intimidated, is Sidney Poitier, another gang leader, and when he tries to intimidate newcomer John Cassavetes, Poitier takes him under his wing. The two are developing a very friendly relationship, and Poitier and his wife Ruby Dee even manage Cassavetes with Kathleen Maguire. Warden is really a vile creature and it is sad how he almost makes cows by the sheer power of personality and physical abilities to subjugate all others. In this sense, he is tougher than Lee J. Cobb, who had to rely on On On the Waterfront on an impression collection of Goons. Edge Of The City was the great directing debut of Martin Ritt, who did a great job with New York-based players and discovered cinematography on-site. The low budget of the film shows, but you are so impressed by the cast of the ensemble that you are not really interested. Cassavetes as the loner with a past and the hip and tough Poitier are both good, but my personal favorite in this movie is Ruby Dee. She should have received a prize for her performance, her last scene with Cassavetes is outstanding. <br /> <br /> Capture this scene whenever possible. I wish it was on DVD or VHS.
