No, this is not an Ed Wood movie. "Angora Love" is the last silent movie by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. The end of an era! In the 1920s, Laurel & Hardy coined the silent film genre with films that are still popular and regularly played and broadcast regularly. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie is not among its best. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film sounds good and is good. The boys have teamed up with a goat this time, which of course puts them in trouble and offers us some fun situations. But at the same time, it's extremely stupid and unbelievable to watch the boys doing comedy with a goat. Most jokes in the movie still work fine, but the movie never gets really funny or memorable. The comedy and the story sometimes feels too short and is usually too simple and predictable. Of course still good and fun enough to watch the fans, but still a somewhat disappointing last dumb Laurel & Hardy entry br /> <br /> 7/10
