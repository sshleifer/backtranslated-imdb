I saw this movie in the early 70's when I was about 10 years old. old on TV. It was after school, and when I looked, I was so fascinated by the idea that the two astronauts were going on a mission to another undiscovered planet, that I asked my mother if I could get the tape recorder out. She left me. So I wrapped the cable of the microphone around the channel button so that the microphone hung in front of the speaker. This movie is the first one I've ever paid enough attention to - and has taken care to record. (Only the audio - there were no VCRs back then.) The plot lets you hang on to every word ... every minute of this movie .. The end will blow you away. After seeing the journey to the far side of the sun, you'll be familiar with Flashbacks for a long time. I've been playing the audio for many years ... and have "seen" them in my mind over and over again. Then - maybe 15 years later ... when video recorders were common and they sold tapes in stores .. I've always searched for it ... but never found it. When one day the Internet came, I searched for it and bought it in a second. After about 30 years, after seeing it for the first time, I was able to see it again. WOW! ~~ It was spectacular! Just for reference .. I must have seen it for 50 times.
