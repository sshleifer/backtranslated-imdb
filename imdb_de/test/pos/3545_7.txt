I saw this movie in the early 1990s when he was on the VHS for a short time. At the time I found it interesting and was especially impressed by the Ken Russell segment, with the visions of the accident victim in triage and surgery. Last Night on a Second Pass John Hurt's vision prompted "Aria" to an unexpected retrospective look at "Aria" that I had not thought of for years, and the sudden memory of the Russell play itself was just a little tears trigger bit. <br /> <br /> If I can make that observation, I note with interest the hate reaction that people in the Russell segment have expressed, and I have found this interesting difference in other films that plunge into deep trauma and his aftermath. Some receive it, others do not, interesting. <br /> <br /> I can see from the comments and the assessment that the overall work has taken people in different ways. That's how it influenced and influenced me.
