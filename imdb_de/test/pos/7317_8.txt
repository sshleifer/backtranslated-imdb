This is an early one of the boys, but some people may not be satisfied with it like everyone else. I found it somehow different than the average Stooge Slapstick. It was more funny for his jokes than for the punch in the eye or punch. Look for a funny part as Larry takes the stethoscope from Moe and sings into it. Moe gives him a good punch. This part took me for a good ten minutes. Another hit for the Stooges.
