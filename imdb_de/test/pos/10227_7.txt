It's a horror story okay. But maybe not as you know it. The real monsters in this streak are humans. While the monsters are human and prey. Strange as it sounds, I see it as "Monster Inc" for horror movie fans. <br /> <br /> Sure, the effects are from a standard horror movie gore is there too, there's even a Slasher in the form of Dr. Ing. Decker (played by David Cronenberg, I see Flash by Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Batman Starts here - or is it the other way round?). And it's Decker & C who are the bad guys. The monsters mainly want to take care of their own affairs, more or less misleading people and want to join their company. At the end of the movie you will actually become the rather small monsters (and the dog) - maybe not what you expected from the first scenes ....
