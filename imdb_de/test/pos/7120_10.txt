There are only a few films that deal with things that I call myself an expert. This is it. After a few years of fantasy role-playing, we split up, and I do not leave without a sense of shame from what I've got. <br /> <br /> You see, these things are really canonical, that happens to everyone. <br /> <br /> First you create a character and the character dies after the first attack. <br /> <br /> Then you help a little with the constitution and why do not you also help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and skill? This in turn frustrates the game master, who does not know how to deal with this invincible gang. And after a while, it also bores the players, so they always create more exotic racing-professional combinations, no matter how ridiculous it is. <br /> <br /> I created a Druedain warrior monk, not so far out of the movie. <br /> <br /> And that's not all to say about the destructive power of the inherent dynamics of this devilish game (think of chasing experience points), but just look at the movie, it shows everything - and of course the Stupidity of their most basic premises. <br /> <br /> There is no better profession than the Bard. I do not quite understand why the Bard ever became a character, after all, the blacksmith is none. But once it became one, it had to be integrated into the flow of the game, that is, it had to be at least indirectly fatal. The fun is never over, and rightly so. Of course it's not exactly a professional production, but I have not seen any better satire for ages.
