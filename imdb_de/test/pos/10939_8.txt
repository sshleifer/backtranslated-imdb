I watch a lot of vampire movies. I know, vampire movies. Hammer films have always been my favorites. Christopher Lee will always be the best Dracula. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is a funny movie from beginning to end. The synchronization is not great, but I also like Godzilla movies, so I'm used to badly synced movies. Anyway, I liked this movie very much. The SFX are great. Although Jackie Chan's role in the film has nothing to do with the plot and seems to be added to the film's sale, he enjoys it. The fishing work is excellent. The drama is not great, but that might have something to do with the bad dubbing. Maybe the language with the movie would sound better if I could understand it. I'm sure the movie Gone With The Wind sounds worse in another language. <br /> <br /> I own this on DVD and would not join. I have it in my bookshelf next to my Hammer Films DVDs.
