When I first heard that Checking Out was a suicide party, my first thought was how pathological, tasteless and then a comedy. I was skeptical. But I was wrong. I totally loved it. The cast, the funny deposits and above all the surprise ending. Suicide is a sensitive issue, but it was handled very well. Funny yes, but tender where it had to be. Checking out also covers other common issues that I think many families can address, with tact and humor. I highly recommend checking out. SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO SEEN. I am looking forward to the publication to the public.
