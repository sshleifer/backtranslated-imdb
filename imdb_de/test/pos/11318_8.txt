This movie was really interesting ... it's also pretty shocking as the movie's similar events happened just 10 months after the film premiered. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see what problems might arise and realistic enough to show that no matter how ready you are, they are - they are not. If this had been done for an American audience, it would be different, because they would have used it as a full propaganda film rather than a wake up call, as the BBC did! It is still, in a sense, propaganda - no film can not be on these issues today - but it has successfully dealt with the subject. <br /> <br /> A film that should be shown in all courses of terrorism / counterterrorism will not because it indicates errors that can not be acknowledged! A great film in which the BBC took some risks and London no longer needs a fictitious story due to the reality of 7 July 2005.
