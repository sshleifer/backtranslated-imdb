In 1961, this series was shown on local television here in Southern California. Me and many others have since tested the BBC on tape or DVD. Now all of a sudden here on Amazon. I pre-ordered in January and arrived here on March 30th. It was a long wait (48 years). Was it worth it? So far I've just seen Richard II (I've only had the DVD since 2am) and I can really say YEA !!! the wait is absolutely worth it. The acting, the direction and the production are excellent and even better than I remember. The production is in B & W, but somehow it fits. The video is clear and very good, the sound is impeccable. Another proof of how timeless Shakespeare really is. <br /> <br /> I forgave these 10 stars even though I only saw 1 of the 8 games. I'm sure that if I've seen them all, I'll change my rating to at least 12. I should better stop now so I can watch again. Next comes Henry IV. Part 1 of it is my favorite Shakespearean play.
