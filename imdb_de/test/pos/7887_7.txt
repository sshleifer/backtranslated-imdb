Unusual film about a man who befriends his social counterpart for fear of blackmail. Peter Boyle makes this film with his disgusting, boorish portrayal of a stiff "Joe" of the working class, who is in love with the past and afraid of the future, worried about the present. The first half-hour of the show features a film debut by a young Susan Sarrandon as Melissa Compton, a weak, voluptuous girl slumbering in slums with her loser friend, full of a naked scene. Her boyfriend is the film's flaw, a poorly portrayed drug addict and trader, who dies after Sarrandon's overdose. We meet Boyle's Joe in a bar when he spits out raging about minorities, crimes, hippies, and drugs, and it's easy to see that Archie Bunker's later Norman Lear television is based on a tidy version of Joe. The comparison even transfers to Joe's wife and his personal life and pastime. Joe subordinates himself to the life of Bill Compton, Melissa's father, and the two make an unusual couple as they search for Melissa, who has run away from drug treatment and returns to the drug addicts she calls friends. Her search leads her to a "rowdy," as Joe calls it, a free love fueled by drugs, a lot of nudity, and, surprisingly, Bill Compton and Ultra Conservative Joe and a murderous ending bother that blatantly six years later and anticipates the refreshing end of Taxi Driver. Joe is a funny movie that is at least on the surface against violence and against racism. But the main character of the film, Joe, becomes the instrument of turmoil he fears when he invades the illegal and unbridled sexual excesses he brings with him. In that sense, the film is not an effective message and lets you ask what the end result really was.
