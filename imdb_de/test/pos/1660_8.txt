The American foreigner Jules Dassin makes an award-winning French gangster movie. The plot includes Tony the Stephanois, a hoodlum from prison who is robbing his gang of thieves with a $ 240 million jewel robbery. Unfortunately, his ex-wife's relationship leads to a notorious gangster named Grutter, an Italian trick killer named Cesar with a weakness for women, and the missteps of his own friend Jo make the successful raid a bloody race against time, like Grutter holds Jos's son is paid as a hostage for the money in the typical "crime" "tragedy". <br /> <br /> The "rififi" in the title is referred to in a song as slang for mainly violence and sex and the full title. "You rififi chez les hommes" roughly means "something naughty in the men's house" where the deadly mistakes of the characters occur. Leave it to a gangster movie to focus on women's missteps, but this time around, Jos laughs women laugh (if you could call it a laugh) predicting, "All of you will kill everyone else." The characters are not the most likable and the women are mostly weak, but Dassin is still building up a very well-made suspense film when they make a robbery that requires utter calm, hiding the goods, and then trying to survive. What a cross-country Cat-and-mouse game becomes. In the mix, there are some very amazing photos and a meticulous editing of the details, resulting in a pacemaker and visual experience that clearly overstates the otherwise generic plot. Not only is it easy to see why this is considered a classic, but also why it is among the top 250 IMDb: it's exciting, visually awesome, full of sex and violence, and it retains this classic gangster attitude that we Fans film like so many things.
