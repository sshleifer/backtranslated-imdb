CAUTION: SPOILER <br /> <br /> Although this film has been a bit moving at times, the brilliant scenery, abundance of characters and powerful motives of Morte a Venezia make it a worthwhile experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I'm sure that Visconti's visual splendor, musical score, and the powerful summoning of conflict and desires must do justice. <br /> <br /> The study by Gustav von Aschenbach points to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, our behavior and our passion. This tendency is evident in the scene between Alfred and Gustav in Germany, when Alfred calls music mathematical - i. quantifiable - and emotional. This conflict arises again in the scene in which the young Tadzio alone plays "Fuer Elise" in the lobby of the hotel and Gustav remembers his visit to a brothel in which he is attracted by a prostitute who plays the same song , In his flashback Gustav is clearly seized by the consequences of his actions after paying the prostitutes. This reaction recalls the moral response to the temptations that Tadzio represents. After all, Gustav has to make his biggest decision: stay in Venice and face his desires and temptations? Or are you fleeing Venice to save your own life? His earlier attempt to flee the Venice railway station led to a futility, pointing to the extension of his stay. <br /> <br /> Adding to the intriguing interaction between the characters and Visconti's powerful scenery (especially at Venice at Dawn and the closing scene) by Tadzio, who goes into the water and points to the horizon, makes this film a true one masterpiece.
