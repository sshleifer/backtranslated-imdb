If you like Gary Cooper, this is one of his best roles. His gentle intensity of correcting an injustice made his career. "Blayde Hollister" comes to Dallas to avenge Will and Brian Malowe, who burned his farm in Georgia and killed his family. Inept Marshall gets in the way and tries to arrest him when he is interrupted by a street attack between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickock. The shootout is staged to remove Hollister's law and he takes Marshall under his wing to keep him alive in Texas as they change identity. <br /> <br /> That was a great start and the picture holds its own. Action is a bit slow by today's standards, but it's one of my top 10 favorite movies.
