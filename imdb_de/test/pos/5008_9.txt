This show was a pleasant surprise after watching Mad TV on a Saturday night. Spike is an excellent host who is still used to it, but he is adapting well to his new job. I imagine it's a difficult transition from the writer (Seinfeld) to the host. Unlike many new talk show presenters, however, he does not allow airtime and tries to figure out what to do next. He is quick and every segment and every section rolls smoothly together. It also does not hurt that he's somehow sexy in a nerdy way, so he does not look hard on the eyes like Leno or Letterman. I can not remember the exact episode date that was my favorite, but I loved the idiot paparazzi sketch with a fake J-Lo and Katie Holmes. Great new show !!
