This is a clever and entertaining film about the backroom fighting in which a successor to Johnny Carson was selected on the Tonight Show. The film's ultimate thesis that David Letterman's superior comedic talents were overlooked for his controversial character, and the show diminished by the enthronement of an inferior Jay Leno on the leading comedy show on television, is simply untrue to Leno and Letterman's ability to perform convince yourself. The hard and simple truth is exactly what an NBC exec said in the movie "Jay Leno is the funniest man in America". And David Letterman is not. Once you realize this, many of the intricacies of the movie become irrelevant. After all, the movie is not much more than sour grapes from Letterman fans who simply can not accept that the better comic was chosen by people whose business it is to know these kinds of things. The final proof is that despite Letterman's early leadership, perhaps because of the hype that has arisen from the Battle of the Tonight Show episode, Leno's show has always proven to be the more popular, disproving Letterman's claim to be unfair deprived of legitimate inheritance.
