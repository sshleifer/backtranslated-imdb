I'm not sure why some people complain that this movie is not a comedy and is too unrealistic at the same time. If it had been realistic, there certainly would not have been much comedy. I do not think a comedy has to make you laugh twenty times. There was a lot of subtle humor, sweet feelings and Kim Frank just portrayed a dreamy character. In real life, there are many people whose facial expressions do not change significantly. The end was pretty unrealistic, I would say, but happy. It's a carefree movie with a good ending. I liked it. Actually loved it. A serious part was that Krueger went to Schwedt, and I am glad that they did not show what happened to him there. To show how he felt when he came back clearly indicated that.
