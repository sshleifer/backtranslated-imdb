This movie started getting confusing and turned into one of the best movies I've ever seen ... The acting was absolutely great and when I did not dry my tears, I enjoyed Meryl Streep, whose performance was extraordinary. The film is about the hardships of a distant family coping with a mother who suffers from terminal cancer. The movie was very hard to see and heartbreaking. The soundtrack fits this movie at a discount. Brava Bette Midler !! Of 5 stars I give this 4 1/2.
