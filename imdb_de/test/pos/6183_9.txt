The Lubitsch's touch is more than ever in this movie. Humor at all times and very subtle. The plot is simple but deliciously shot by the director. The film cut is very clever and contributes to the comic effect. A real comedy that does not get that old for a 21st-century viewer. The character is portrayed by Gary Cooper and above all Claudette Colbert as clever and mean with this poor Micheal in the film. She avoids all traps of her husband and makes the situation to her advantage, very funny. No problem, with Lubitsch there is always a happy ending. A movie for men who are too self-confident with women. Do not let your girlfriend see this movie ...
