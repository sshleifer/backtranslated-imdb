One of my favorite non-MGM musicals, a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in great shape, her beauty jumping out of the screen. Gene Kelly demonstrates his dancing skills and introduces his unusual and innovative choreographies into musicals that ultimately change the way musicals become choreographers. Phil Silvers is the perfect second banana, and Eve Arden injects this movie with class. <br /> <br /> The structure is so theatrical that you have to wonder why the big Broadway shows come from here in this era. In movies Cover Girl was not adapted to theater.
