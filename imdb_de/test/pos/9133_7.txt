Having finally caught up with this "masterpiece," I realize it must have been awfully clever in its time. It's French, artistic, undermined to agony and finally downbeat. But from the perspective of 37 years in the future, it's just a bit empty, overbearing and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Others have summarized the story, but I do not think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw at the heart of this movie: the main characters Corey and Vogel really do not deserve what they get. They play in their code, never hurt anyone who has not asked, and show great courage and initiative. In addition, Corey in particular is being victimized by his former Gangland "friend," who stole his girl and repeatedly tries to have him killed, apparently only because he (Corey) dared to lend a few thousand francs ". These are guys who really need to take a break! Instead, things go far worse for them than they really need, within the logic of history. You could argue that this is the point: that the real bad guys are never caught; that they work with the police if necessary, sell out their friends and are always ahead of the game. But that is not shown. Corey's old gangster friend is not matched with the police. He is also not annoyed with his victory. Having materialized several times when needed, he is nowhere to be seen in the conclusion and leaves a dramatic suspense (his feud with Corey) that is completely unresolved! Nevertheless, I would say that this film is worth seeing for its beautiful photography, its slow, deliberate pace, its great dead performances, its sophisticated sequence of heats, and the encapsulation of the late 1960s art film style.
