Under the direction of F. Gary Gray, "Italian Job" never loses its grip on coolness and fun. Although the material is finished and average, the film itself is masterfully executed and satisfactorily good. The tone could have been a lot heavier considering the murder-revenge plot, but F. Gary Gray keeps the tone in a good mood, brisk dialogue and vibrant music. It's a pleasure to see these would-be men make a great connection and stay connected through deception and murder while never forgetting to have fun. This is 7/10.
