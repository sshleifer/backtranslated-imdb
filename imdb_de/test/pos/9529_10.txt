I've seen this movie countless times and have been charmed by its homely simplicity, sincerity and kindness. Great characterizations of all actors and the beautiful little steam trains that play such an important supporting role. I admit I fell in love with Roberta in 1970, and she still touches me. Shown on New Zealand television on Christmas day, the most beautiful gift I could have had.
