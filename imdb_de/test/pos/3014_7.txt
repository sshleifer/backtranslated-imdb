The cell fascinated me at first glance. I was a little surprised, because the story of the movie is absolutely boring. If it had no story, the movie would be better. I think of Bunuel's "Un chien andalou" - a film without history, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. But THE CELL is first a Hollywood movie and first a work of art. I am very interested in the next Tarsem project. Hamlet on Indian could be very interesting, especially if it looks exactly like THE CELL. <br /> <br /> For film music enthusiasts: Howard Shores score for THE CELL is absolutely wonderful, but because of the game's a hard listening experience it's very modernist.
