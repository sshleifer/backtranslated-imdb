My favorite police series of all time turns into a TV movie. It works? Yes. Gee runs for mayor and gets shot. The Homicide "Hall of Fame" appears. Pembleton and almost all cops who have ever played in this series. Many flashbacks help you who has not seen the TV series yet, but also the fans. The last five minutes solve another murder and in the end even two of the dead bulls appear. And a short performance of my favorite coroner Juliana Cox. That's a good movie.
