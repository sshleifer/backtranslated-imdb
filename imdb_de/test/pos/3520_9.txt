Just before Dawn came out in the golden days of the Slasher movie. The hillbilly started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning and Madman. Just before Dawn is one step ahead of the typical Backwoods Slasher movie. The cinematography is beautiful. The acting is first class. The heroine of the film is not the typical "last girl". <br /> <br /> Constance is a "forest girl", but when it comes to the original instinct of survival, she is one step behind. Only when it comes to saving the lives of her and her friend does the original idea of ​​survival begin. There is a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the hidden sexuality of the last girls - and that coincides with their will to survive. Shortly before Dawn is not for everyone, but for the Slasher fan, he is as perfect as you can get. The killers are very threatening - almost as if it were a game to mutilate and kill anyone crossing their territory. The final scene is a little outlandish. For the first viewer, it may be a bit shocking. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the backwoods. Even non-Slasher fans will find something here. The attitude is scary and you feel uncomfortable. The death sequences are not particularly bloody, but I'm not sure if the movie needed Gore. See it!
