This movie has some of the best dialogues ever written. The really good lines are given to George C. Scott, a man who knew what he should do with a juicy dialogue. I have seen this film for the first time in over 20 years and the dialogue is better than ever. The bizarre happenings in the hospital are so inventive that you are thrilled. They often include such wonderful poetic justice that they are close to genius. I love this movie!!
