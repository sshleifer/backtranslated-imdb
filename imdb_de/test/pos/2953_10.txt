In the middle of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but continues to make the documentary and discovers a story he did not expect. The result is a gripping drama that makes fiction in the best sense of the word, with a sympathetic but ignorant narrator unknowingly privileging the public. So the narrative has a double network, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Our admiration goes to the filmmaker, not only because he follows his story, although he risks his whole image of his parents' relationship, but also that they never give up sensationalism or melodrama. Although the stuff of Hollywood lurks in detail, Doug Block treats both history and everyday life. For those of us who have always speculated about the life of our parents before we came to the scene (or after we arrived, though we were too intrusive to realize that they had a life independent of us) 51 Birch Street is a proper warning: There are wondrous things in the Fatherland, but beware if you choose to enter there. <br /> <br /> But this caution is advised when the audience is slowly wandering around in the details of his parents' past. It is not a warning to those who get a glimpse into the life of the parents of Block. The film is a miracle of how the mother becomes alive and passionate, yet thoughtful, and makes her own conscious choices in the 1950s. The filmmaker's particular success is getting the audience to see the young woman behind the older parents and grandparents. We all know that our parents once were young and strong, but at 51 Birch Street is the mother. The father, who was distanced in the time when the filmmaker and his sister grew up, remains distanced in the film, but this is more due to his own elusive nature than to his portrayal. This biography, which becomes an autobiography, is dramatic, intense and unforgettable. It will certainly make viewers look at their family albums more closely, but is reluctant to look at the backs of these photographs.
