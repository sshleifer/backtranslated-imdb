Reckless mercenary Bruno Rivera (Paul Nashy in a flashy style) reveals his pregnant partner / girlfriend Meiko (well played by Eiko Nagashima) to have exclusive stolen diamonds. Meiko, however, manages to seriously injure Bruno before he can escape. Bruno ends up in the chic chalet of wealthy rich doctor Don Simon (an outstanding performance by Lautaro Murua). He also caught the attention of Simon's two hot daughters: the fiery Monica (juicy Silvia Aguiler) and the sweet Alicia (lovingly written by the lovable Azucena Hernandez). However, Bruno quickly realizes that something is wrong in the remote location and plans to flee as fast as he can. In the meantime, the bitter Meiko tries to find Bruno so she can take revenge on him. Naschy, who was starring as well as directors and directors, is making one of the strangest, most twisted and perverted horror vehicles of all time with this little weirdness seen. The unconventional plot and the mysterious atmosphere become more sinister and annoying as the story unfolds, eventually leading to a truly surprising end to the surprise. This movie also benefits from occasional moments of graphics bleeding (watch out for the memorable sequence in which a poor guy is devoured alive by vicious carnivorous pigs!), Alejandro Ulloa's glittering cinematography and a decent splash of nudity and soft sex. Good support Roxana Dupre as naughty maid Raquel, Pepe Ruiz as a playboy in love with Don Serafin and Julia Saly as confused Teresa. A pleasingly dark and rewarding shocker.
