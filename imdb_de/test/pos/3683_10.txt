Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It's an emotional roller coaster ride. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk Grace says he did not want to go to the pub because the villagers do not like him, expect the worst. As the old woman holds up her glass and says, "In memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub, I wanted to cry." The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style, Johnathan Pryce is awarded as Victor, Grace One of the best parts of Kathy Bates, Meredith Eaton steals almost every scene she's in. Rupert Everett does some of his best work in the act as Dirk, and the kiss between Rupert and Meredith made me another hysteric Today, when gay rights are being questioned, I think this film should be seen by everyone.As a gay man in his late 40s, I saw people lose everything when a loved one dies to all who are involved in this film.
