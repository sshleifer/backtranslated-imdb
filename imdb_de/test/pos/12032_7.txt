Hollywood has turned the mafia into a production line that ranges from the mundane to the exquisite. Despite good acting and a sensible script (many of which - for a change!), This hassle of "home entertainment" must be slap bang in the middle. <br /> <br /> The script is not only obvious (all checklists are ticked at the end), but spends a lot of time trying to make a pastiche of the best work of others. The Godfather is the most obvious, but there are other indications as well. I will not bother to name her. Nevertheless, it is a good taste! The producer seems to set a rate for shots and murder (at least every twenty minutes?) And the end is weak and "so what?" I've been told that there are different versions of this production, so maybe it's just the version I've seen. Gangsters do not make money, they take money. Usually out of fear. Some seem to be more involved in murder and chaos than in making money. They were the first to go first (in real life and here). "You can not make money with a gun in your hand," says Charlie "Lucky" Luciano at some point. One of the smarter gangsters, though all things are relative. He was a trained white slave trader and drug dealer before being bundled into Italy. The old school "Moustached Pete's" was picked up by the new blood collectors who wanted the power and money for themselves to free themselves from the straight jacket of Italian / Sicilian power (rarely does business outside of themselves). The young Turk knew that he needed to be allied with other groups (especially "Jews" who know how to launder money) and this is at least addressed and acknowledged. What is not so clear is that most immigrant groups have their own mafia - but most of them have earned their money and become lawful. And why not? Who wants to die in prison? <br /> <br /> Joseph Bonanno was a reckless man who was ready to kill, if need be, but not an unfair or stupid man. His story was tragic in the sense that he was able to earn money in the Supermundane world, and he showed a special ability not to be killed. With luck, of course. <br /> <br /> Despite the breadth of respectable names and three actors in the title role (Bruce Ramsay, Martin Landau and Tony Nardi), there is no charisma or talent to bring us in and make us feel. We are - only - passive observers in a life in which we are glad to have no guidance. The people shown here were born in a cruel world, but their only mark was to make them more cruel. <br /> <br /> If you can not get enough of this gangster genre, it's better to watch godfather 1 & 2 for the tenth time and it's even better - as a basic entertainment - than the terrible misfire that Godfather 3 was.
