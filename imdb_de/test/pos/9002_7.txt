Well, before people break down on this movie (those who play rugby anyway), this is a movie! The Hollywood treatment was given to entertain the people, and so those who play rugby (myself included) will of course pick holes in the game's choreography in the film. All in all, it's a decent movie that highlights the morale and ideas behind the rugby game. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real team, a real coach and his work, helping children to find the right people, to be better people in the future, and also based on real people, who played for the Highland team. It's just a typical sports movie with a character who gets misled and eventually finds himself on the right track through the rugby medium. Is generally a good movie that is fun but has shortcomings in the presentation of the game. As I said, it's a Hollywood-themed movie.
