I saw this movie for the first time in the theater. I was ten years old. I have just seen it a second time and I have to say it was amazing. The music, the dancing, the acting. It's a great story and very well told. I absolutely fell in love with Treat Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mother was always yelling at him to give him his pants and finally said, "How much do you need?" (Money). That was classic. ; ). <br /> <br /> Mothers are the best. If you have not seen this movie since it came out, I'll say it again. It is timeless. It will do what all the great movies do; Make you laugh, cry and think.
