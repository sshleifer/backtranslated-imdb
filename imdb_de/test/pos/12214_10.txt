I do not believe that sixty percent of voters chose this show as ten. How the hell is the rating a five-point eight? It is impossible that I do not understand it. It is totally pathetic. The show is great, the story is great and the characters are interesting, definitely a tenth of ten of mine. I think the creatures are cool Los went unanswered in the first season, and if Nimrod gets even bigger, since the rest of the creatures are huge, why is the rating so low when the voices were so high? <br /> <br /> 10/10
