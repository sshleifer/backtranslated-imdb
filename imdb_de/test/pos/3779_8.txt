Chaplin is a Doughboy in his last film of 1918, a doughboy who does not seem to be getting the march straight. He spends the time over there in the trenches of the First World War. Some gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a provisional grenade. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches, and when Chaplin and his companions are flushed out of their bunks by floods, are highlights. Chaplin finally captured several German soldiers and sentenced the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did that, Chaplin answers that he has surrounded her. Chaplin hides behind all enemy lines as a tree of all things, and these scenes are very funny. He escapes to a bombed house where he meets a French girl played by Edna Purviance. He is tracked down by German soldiers, escapes from them and Purviance is arrested for his support. Chaplin is able to pull a fast by slamming a soldier and using the soldier's uniform. In the end, of course, he saves Purviance and conquers the emperor. On the way Chaplin uses the German soldiers with viewpoints and slapstick. With this film Chaplin explored the location options while filming and maintained the audience's attention for a longer playing time, which he was not approved in his contract with the Mutual Film Corporation. The film also allowed him to make fun of the enemy, which he would do once again with greater effect in The Great Dictator. *** of 4 stars.
