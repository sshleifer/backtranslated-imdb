If you look at this series, you will receive interesting 10 chapters about the history of a sleeping cell and the individual characters. And more intense with infiltrating an FBI. <br /> <br /> Nice story, nice characters and performances, but something's wrong (for me, of course). The final is wrong. They wait ten chapters and hope for a great finale (it does not matter if they achieve their goals or not), but ... well ... I think that's not enough. It's a small finale for a big series. I also hoped for more definitions of character stories. <br /> <br /> But I repeat, it's an interesting miniseries. If you do not want to wait with large series (22-24 chapters), look at this. I give 7 out of 10.
