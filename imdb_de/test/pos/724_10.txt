I saw a lot of movies and that blew me away. The trauma, the tension is just incredible. I got so into psychological fear and philosophy and compared it to reality. Movies that play and challenge your mind are films you will not forget, that make you doubt your reality. One problem could be quality, but that does not stop the essence of the movie. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is brilliant and the end just leaves you completely shocked and with the question you are looking for the answer. I totally loved it! So many hints and twitches and puzzles. One of the best films of all time, no doubt.
