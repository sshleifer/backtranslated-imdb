When I saw this movie for the first time, I wanted to like it for so many reasons, but I just did not do it. It just seemed a bit boring. But there was a tiny question about something I had seen at the beginning of the movie, so I saw it again? and then it finally clicked for me. I first watched the movie with the "Surprise End", and while I definitely would not recommend pampering the end for you, I still enjoyed most of the movie to the fullest and discovered the many seemingly insignificant events, all of which show a very weird scheme. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone will love this movie or even like it. If you like one of the actors, you will like this movie because the acting is pretty strong and they all have a lot of time on the screen. If you like secrets (namely Hitchcock), you will like this movie. If you like independent or psychological films, you will like this movie. It really worked on all these levels. If you do not like actors, mysterious acts, or psychological elements, you may not like this movie. But that's your loss. The only thing that annoyed me was the accents. A good try, Alan Rickman, in the American dialect, but it was not a big improvement over the scene in Die Hard. (The wonderful voice, however, makes up for the comic accent.) The jumble of accents in the movie was a little strange, but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or particularly irritating. Also, the scene-to-scene camera change was obvious and could bother some people, but I think it was added to the scenes (or to the scene?) I can only remember a scene where the change was very different, but it worked). <br /> <br /> If you see this movie, you will see it at least twice. The second time you see it, I hope you realize how complicated the plot really is. Every time I see this movie (it's less than an hour and a half, so multiple visits are not difficult), I seem to see something else, wondering, "Why did that happen?" or "Was that intentional?" I like movies that make me think. This one does it. So just look it. Twice.
