I saw this movie right in my eyes as I passed a poster room in the nearby movie theater. The marker line was somehow confusing and immediately after reading I thought of the possibility that it resembles that of National Lampoon Dorm Daze. I liked the movie, except for a huge collection of such genres, and decided to bring it to the cinemas right after my exams for a suspense release and had as much laughter about parts and points of the movie. Amanda Bynes has certainly done better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. It's definitely not easy to be both an actor and an actor, especially if you have to face the similarities of life, coupled with the reactions the actress has to respond to. This film requires a lot of confusion to confuse yourself and us viewers at the same time. The only way to accomplish it is through this movie. <br /> <br /> The principle is obviously sorely funny in a serious way; the girls are as sexy and beautiful as the actors. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to relax on the weekend and do not worry, you will be laughing in the whole movie. It is a clear guarantee.
