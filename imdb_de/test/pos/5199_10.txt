This movie makes for infantry what the boat has made for submariners. If you appreciate the boat, then this is all you really need to know. <br /> <br /> This is a well made piece of cinema. On a par with the boat. It essentially follows a company of elitist German "Stormtrooper" fighters, which leaves the garrison service in an idyllic Italian coastal town behind and is immediately struck in the chaos of the collapsing Russian front. <br /> <br /> A good war movie sheds light on both the futility and the brutality of the war, while giving us an insight into the experiences and essential humanity of those who fight. This movie does. The movie is full of drama and action and is entertaining at this level as well.
