Assuming that you know what this movie is about, I'm also forced to assume that you've come to this meeting and know that you'll probably see it regardless of what I'm saying. If all of this is true - read on - you will probably agree with part of this review. If you are undecided or not sure what happened in urban and suburban youth music culture in the late 70's and early 80's, you probably should read one of the reviews that turns out to be objective. <br /> <br /> Although I did not grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene I really lived in. At the height of the hardcore I was immersed in from 1979 to 1981, everyone had a band and the only common denominators between the bands and their members were: <br /> <br /> * the denial of conformity <br /> <br /> * Tolerance and Difference <br /> <br /> * a Desire to Have Fun - Hard and Fast <br /> <br /> Hairstyles, politics, dislike of authority figures and violent slamdancing were not essential to that What I experienced, though there were certainly cliques or factions that were tended to be intolerant of those who did not dress, speak or act "punk" enough. And some of these cliques have often given away a certain amount of undeserved credit to those who were really trying to submit to the fascist paradigm of anarchic, self-mutilating, angry young policemen. <br /> <br /> Although the audience spunk interviews in Penelope Spheeris' excellent cal punk documentary "Decline of Western Civilization" provide a very close look at the subculture that some of us have enjoyed, the interviews with the bands and club owners, promoters and even the security people at least represent my own perspective and memories of the scene. Yet, it is possible for those who talk with prejudice about what punk is to experience this film without questioning its prejudices. Unfortunately, the blame lies with those who promote, believe, or feel comfortable with stereotypes - not the filmmakers. Do not blame the messenger. <br /> <br /> The music presented here is not for everyone - not even for most. It's not the coarsest stuff out there, but it's loud, disgusting, fast, and less concerned with technology than raw energy. <br /> <br /> For me, the early Black Flag with Ron Reyes, X, Fear and the Circle Jerks was worth much more than the cost of this hard-to-get movie. As much as I like The Germs, I saw Darby Crash for the mess - and the nice guy - that he left me a little cold. Still, the scenes in which Darby played with his pet tarantula while "Shut Down" sounded in the background were precious. The X-Interview is great, too. <br /> <br /> Spheeris' straightforward documentation style is complemented by wild pans and zooms throughout the musical segments. In the interviews, framing is used very well to provide the context for what is being said. Given her experience and her budget, Spheeris has done everything anyone could have done with this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended for those who know what this film really is about, and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun, honest, directionless uprising, before pacific punk to another flow within the musical co-opted, and the stereotypes became more important than the basic philosophy.
