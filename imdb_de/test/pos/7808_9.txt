Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy ever, first Namak Halal (though that was actually a drama). The story is not groundbreaking, but the added complications make it great. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just look at his utterances in the song Yeh Raat and your door. He's amazingly good at comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the weaker of the two characters. The sounds he makes are almost as funny as Aamir's faces. Raveena and Karisma serve their purpose but are nothing special. The real choice is Paresh Rawal as usual. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple: Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. They do not believe in hard work and simply want to get rich. Therefore, both come up with an idea to woo the daughter of a rich man (Paresh Rawal) (Raveena Tandon), who comes to India to seek a husband. So, Amar and Prem meet up on the trip, driving together the hundreds of men trying to marry this girl. If they succeed, they must now get rid of each other. Somehow, both arrive at Raveena's house, Amar as an injured man and Prem as his doctor. From here they try to repress themselves. But things are complicated when Raveena's girlfriend (Karisma Kapoor) falls in Prem and persecutes him. And the evil twin brother of the rich man (also Rawal) tries to get rid of the heiress and her father so that he can inherit the money, and sends his two most trustworthy but awkward fools into the dirty work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you do not want to miss. Look at it! It will be worth it. I even own the DVD, that's so good. And if you like this movie, I would recommend Gol Maal if you have not seen it yet. Other good comedies include Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).
