I'm an opera fan and the operas are full of sex, blood and death. It may be helpful to know the libretti of the operas that make up the arias to really appreciate this movie - my mileage is very different from Tug-3. I am a lover of classical music, and I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved Ken Russell's "Nessun Dorma" segment and I really want to see him produce Turandot because the opera is supposed to be overwhelming multimedia experience, but then I loved Lisztomania. I love * Turandot * and if I know the libretto so well, I may not consider this segment as a travesty that Tug-3 has made average viewers - they'll probably recognize the melodies, and it's a classic farce. I like sleeping falcons, so stupidity did not bother me. <br /> <br /> The "love death" segment is so great that I recommend that people look at this piece alone. "Depuis la Jour" was wonderfully spiritual to me. And the Caruso recording of "Vesti la Giubba" (aka I Pagliacci) with John Hurt as a clown was wonderful. But people who only want naked women may feel that there is too much music and not enough meat and sex.
