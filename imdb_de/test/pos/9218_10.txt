This was the very first movie I ever saw in the theater. I was 7 years old and until today it's one of my favorite movies. It is pure smarmy cheese. The cartoon was marketed for young girls who sold dolls with soft bodies and big plastic heads, one for each color of the rainbow, with their own special animals, "sprites" and even a rainbow-talking horse. Typical of the period, each show was about how hope, togetherness, and magic "make things better." <br /> <br /> The film is about the beginning of spring when all light and color returns to the world, but this time it just does not happen to our beautiful hero. A spoiled princess plans to overtake the light source of the soul (and the implicated life giver) of the Universe, which happens to be a giant diamond for its own insidious purposes, regardless of reality, and now Rainbow and her newly found friends Orin, Onyx and Chris has to save the universe. Like I said, it's cheesy, but it's cute and it's just like all the other cartoons from that time, like the CareBear movies, Strawberry Shortcake, Rose Petal, and the Smurfs. All movies created to sell dolls to children. And it works. :)
