I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> No one I know likes him, but I like him. <br /> <br /> I did not like him as much as the first, but he was still good. The script and storyline may not have changed, but the story was better than Caddyshack 1. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not like Caddyshack 2 is ... <br /> <br / > NO RODNEY DANGERFIELD! <br /> <br /> I think the movie would be better if Rodney Dangerfield had the role of Jackie Mason. Although I liked Jackie Mason in the movie, it would be much better if they kept Rodney Dangerfield. Another flaw in the movie that I did not hate so much was Dan Akroyd. The movie was shot 8 years after the first one. Bill Murray, "Carl," could have quit his job as a deputy greenskeeper and go to the military, you know? If Warner Bros. had thought of it, it could have improved the movie as well. <br /> <br /> This has been my comment for Caddyshack II. <br /> <br /> I give it 8.2 out of 10 <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but still good. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Caddyshack 1 and are debating whether you see Caddyshack 2 or not, I say it's an attempt.
