I do not usually like this kind of movie, but I worked at home and wanted to see something halfway while doing it. I was so fascinated that I stopped working and watched the last half hour without interruption. I'm sure there will not be any tears in this kind of show, but I cried in the end. Much emotional nuance. Great spectacle and good southern feeling. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommended.
