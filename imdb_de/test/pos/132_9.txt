This film vividly demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply rooted in ritual and tradition. All this against the background of an India that is itself fighting for the freedom of these values. This film is both political and personal and never preachable or idealistic on both sides. It's easy to see why "fire" has caused unrest in India, but still tragic. A real movie like this one deserves to be seen by all the people in the world, not just privileged Westerners.
