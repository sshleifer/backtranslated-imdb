The animation quality is clearly below that of IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters do not. <br /> <br /> That may sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is populated almost entirely by living machines, would you feel comfortable as a human being? Would a machine ever emulate human arrogance, myopia and greed so effectively? I doubt it. There are some clues in the film, but only if the team can make the effort to install them are the "bioroids" (or whatever they are) interchangeable with human characters. Seems sloppy to me. <br /> <br /> The main characters seem to have some kind of emotional involvement, although there is no light in this regard. About the background story is thrown little light, a pity. The short length of the film combined with the focus on Mecha and the crime means we do not see any depth of character. The preliminary work has been completed, but we do not have a finished product. A trimmed version of this OAV would have made a great TV episode after some subparts for characters had been established. <br /> <br /> The highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the action / espionage. <Br /> <br /> The vulnerabilities only become apparent if you were able to digest all the processes. Therefore, I can not recommend this for the property, but it is definitely worth one or two watches! Although this review is mostly negative, I think it's worth seeing, but it's not something you can afford. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: a truly wasted opportunity.
