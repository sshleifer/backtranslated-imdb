This first (and hopefully not the last) Wallace & Gromit feature will live up to expectations. There are lots of jokes (some a bit cheeky) and some great honors from previous science-fiction movies. It's great to see such a great movie like this, which is fun for almost everyone. If there is justice, it will be at the top of the box office and at least nominated for the best animation at the next Oscars. The animation is wonderful. The characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun. This is one of the movies that the whole family can enjoy. Charming, smart, funny and well done, what is not there to enjoy?
