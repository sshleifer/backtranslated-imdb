STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important movie for our cinema history. This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (after the quiet PLANE CRAZY this year) is probably his most famous movie - mainly because it was so groundbreaking. This is because it was the first sound cartoon. While you do not hear Mickey speak yet, there are plenty of sound effects and music throughout the movie - something we take for granted now, but in 1928, it was a huge crowd pleaser.

German: emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/art...2934 & lang = DE Was just an important historical film, it would be especially interesting for animation lovers , After watching the movie again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the movie really is. While Mickey and Minnie behave a bit strangely compared to the characters we love (mainly thanks to the kooky spirit and talents of animator Ub Iwerks), there is a contagious charm about the movie. It's adorable to play Mickey in a very ingenious (if occasionally cruel) way. Smart and a real crowd puller - after 80 wonderful years, this film is one of Mickey's best films.
