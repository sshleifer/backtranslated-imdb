"Mr. Bean" with the legendary Rowan Atkinson was a great success during his run in the 1990s, and I probably saw it for the first time when I was about ten, just after it ended, so I saw repetitions. I was certainly not a big fan at the time and did not see too many episodes. I only came on the show before my late teens, a few years ago, when I finally saw every episode. Unlike in the past, it made me laugh many times, and since then it has always been the case for episodes! <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is a mysterious, selfish, anti-social, extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is his teddy! He is quite isolated from society, and life is not easy for him because he is constantly struggling with very simple things! This is because he lacks some basic knowledge and is the mind of a child. He finds himself in various difficulties wherever he goes, and he has found very bizarre ways to solve the problems he is facing! Not only does he often cause problems for himself, but sometimes for other people he often does not recognize. In other words, Mr. Bean is a catastrophe going on! <br /> <br /> The humor in this show is very visual and there is very little dialogue. The gags are almost always visual gag, which is what the show is all about. Although there may occasionally be a lackluster gag, I would say that the vast majority of them are funny and often weird (there are so many highlights)! Mr. Bean is certainly not the most demanding comedy ever made, but for many who like visual humor, it's still great. Due to the very limited dialogue, you do not even have to speak fluent English to enjoy the show, so it has gained a worldwide reputation! The show went on for a few years, but the episodes were made very slowly, so that only fourteen were made. Nevertheless, it is a classic series that deserves its wide appeal!
