A good drama movie about a custody case with great performances by all the actors. A good example of what an excellent script can do to bring a simple story to a much higher quality. From the list of the best dramas of all time. Nevertheless, the great acting makes this movie a good movie to see if you are a fan of court dramas or a big fan of the main characters. The film should have been a bit longer for more excellence, but that would be a joke ......
