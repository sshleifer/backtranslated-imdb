The Aristocats is really charming and much too low on IMDb. The songs are not as memorable as the ones in the jungle book, but they were not bad at all. The animation is very nice, the best sequence is the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation, I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who does not love cats? Another great animation was that O'Malley looked the Duchess in the eye, as her romance was so believable and not obvious. (A good thing) The conspiracy (about a greedy butler and a fortune, reminds me of Bailey's Billions) was a little unoriginal, but it worked very well, and the script was really funny, especially the fighting between the kittens. They remind me of me and my brother and my three sisters who are always fighting. My favorite scene was the persecution of Edgar with the two dogs, who always argue about who the leader was. The vocal talents were a joy, especially Phil Harris, whom I knew from the Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor from the Rescue Team. The minor characters Scat Cat were well done. Finally, a really enjoyable movie that is definitely underestimated. 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
