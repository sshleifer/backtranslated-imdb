There are a few animated cartoons that depict animals or something "non-human", and I think this movie is one of them. Apart from a few points in the plot and the characters, this movie could be changed in all humans and not primarily in animals. Although - it's good that someone did not do it - I feel that the cats are funny in this movie that depicts humans! :-) <br /> <br /> This movie also focuses on a whole range of adult issues - which is rather strange for a Disney movie. It mentions alcohol *, shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack "inappropriate" humans, and it shows a male cat (Abraham Delacy Gieuseppe Casi Thomas), O'Malley, in a surprisingly human and adult manner interested in a female cat. <br /> As a cartoon - or just a movie - I find that this is a pretty good quality - the plot and the characters are especially good. The movie (in general) takes place in France and you meet a cat family - the mother duchess and her kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. They also meet the friendly (rich) old woman who worships the cats, the butler Edgar and an old man (who has lost his marbles CLEARLY), George. The kindly old woman discusses her will with George and Edgar overhears that what he gets from the will he will have after the cats have him. He is INCREDIBLE cross with this one - and has a bad plan in mind ... <br /> <br /> A very sweet movie for all ages - enjoy "Aristocats"! <br /> <br /> * Not included "Basil the Great Mouse Detective" and a few others I do not think about right now.
