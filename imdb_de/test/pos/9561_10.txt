This strip was even better than "waiting for Guffman". The great strength in these two films lies in the brilliant figure played by Guest and Levy's small second town group. If you find this movie boring or meaningless, God helps them, they simply did not understand it. It's a mockumentary, something that Guest and Levy have a genius for. At the end of the movie, when Guest's southern southern dog lover at home says he wanted to relax after the show, he went to Israel to work on a "coach," or when he tells us that ventriloquists are an old one Art is and we see a hieroglyph From an ancient Egyptian holding a tiny ancient Egyptian, I realized that it's moments like these that make life worth living. Thank you, Mr. Guest and Mr. Levy, and God bless you.
