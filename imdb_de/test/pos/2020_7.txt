That was an interesting movie. I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW! Apart from that, I loved the headbang music this movie was about. Chris / Izzy's parents are great! They support the interests of their sons and believe in him enough to support him - now it's WONDER !! What really surprised me was the knowledge of Chris in the end. It was not quite the "Hollywood" that ended on its path to self-discovery. The rise to fame and fall were a roller coaster ride.
