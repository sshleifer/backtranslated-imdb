DRIVING LESSONS is a little movie that sneaks up on you. What at first glance seems to be a bit fluffy British-style nonsense comedy is at its base a very beautiful story about growing up and the need for a meaningful friendship between young and old. The writer Jeremy Brock ('Mrs. Brown', 'Charlotte Gray', 'The Last King of Scotland') conducts his own script and the result is a coherent, progressive fairy tale with fascinating and varied characters, each played by actors < br /> <br /> Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint, himself a developing actor in the Harry Potter series) is a calm, simple, poetic seventeen-year-old who lives with his bird-watching vicar father (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive , compelling, rigid, evangelical mother (Laura Linney) in a home where "needy people" such as the murderous crossdresser Mr. Fincham (Jim Norton) take precedence over family matters: By the way, the mother has an affair with priest Peter (Oliver Milburn) , uses Ben as cover! Among other things, Sad Ben tries to learn how to drive a car. His mother is a poor teacher and decides that he needs professional education AND needs a job to pay for the poor Mr. Fincham's needs. Ben follows an ad and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters), an older actress as crazy as any character ever created. She hires Ben and the fireworks begin. Through a series of incidents, including a camping excursion that Evie demands, the two take the lessons of life that are lacking in the nature of the other. Ben learns self-esteem and self-confidence, and Evie finds a real girlfriend that allows her to drop her dizzying facade and to be the dear human she has hidden. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who has the finest acting skills in any of her characters, plays a role like no other: She's wild and loveable. Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for the required adulthood Ben. The chemistry between the two is as delicate as in the classic film "Harold and Maude". As always, Laura Linney is a great actress whose role is different from her usual repertoire. And the side occupation is a panorama of fine characterizations. This movie is a wonderful surprise that will warm the heart and entertain those who love good writing, governance and action - and messages! Grady harp
