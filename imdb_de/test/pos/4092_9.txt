I recently bought Lost Horizon on ebay because I have vivid memories of the number of things I will not miss (I'm an old 29). I recently completed the novel he's based on. I was so pleasantly surprised to find a real hidden treasure. A wonderful cast adds so much warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly narrated story, subtly updated from the original film (and now a separate entity to the much more intellectual and thought-provoking book by James Hilton). Above all, Sally Kellerman has a resplendent presence as the suicidal neurotic Sally Hughes, who is gradually warming to the charm of Shangri-La. Only Liv Ullmann flutters in her wooden depiction of the teacher (a role more suited to a Julie Andrews type.) The fact that Finch, Ullmann, and Hussey are all dubbed is not important, since it's almost impossible for them In terms of quality, the music is far superior to the lyrics, but it is still a living and captivating film that really deserves a decent DVD release and much more recognition.
