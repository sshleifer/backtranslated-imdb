I've copied my video to DVD so I can enjoy it whenever I want and it's also a very successful (and rare) wedding present! This is just an absolutely wonderful adaptation of a popular novel. Everything is just perfect and it has aged remarkably well. With such a thing, there is always a chance that it looks a bit snotty alongside more modern dramas, but "Precious Bane" can more than hold its own. <br /> <br /> The quality of acting is astounding with Janet McTeer A smart of superlatives and a young Clive Owen treading around as a silent Gideon Sarn. <br /> <br /> I challenge everyone to see the final sequence without at least a little snuffing at the sheer romance. It's the perfect movie to watch when it's cold outside and you cuddle up on the sofa. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend that enough.
