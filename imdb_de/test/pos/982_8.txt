This movie is really a fun, good, clean fun movie for the little ones. Kaley (played by Nickelodeon's talented Amanda) is the buddy for a wild guy who can not really tell the truth. He eventually processes this into a script that is stolen. I will not bore you with the details. If you have kids and want to watch a fun, if not exciting kids movie, I recommend this movie.
