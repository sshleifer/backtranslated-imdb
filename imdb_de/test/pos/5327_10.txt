I am not Ebert. What I am is a compassion, and I have never felt more sympathy for a fictional character than for Leland P. Fitzgerald. I'm sorry if I do not give a review, but I just see perfection in this movie. I'm sure many of you watching this movie will never see the same things as me, but if you look tough enough you might see something you did not expect. I read that Leland's character was flawed. It seems to me that the one who wrote this did not see the question that this movie is about. I'm sorry for anyone who does not see the answers from this movie. Open your heart more than your mind, and let Leland P. Fitzgerald show you a world that really has meaning. Extraordinary story with extraordinary spectacle. Ryan Gosling deserves to be talked about.
