Unfortunately, every person I ask about this series says she has never heard of it. I like to remember my early childhood (I was not quite ten when it came out). <br /> <br /> My favorite story was "A Story Short". Something about the way the "stone soup" story was woven into a bigger story awakens me every time. And then the storyteller explains why he has no story to tell, and this story itself becomes a story. I've always been a fan of Jim Henson, and that's just one reason why. <br /> <br /> I'm adding this DVD together with Labrynth, The Dark Crystal, The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride, The Last Unicorn, Willow and MirrorMask. These are all DVDs that I share with my siblings who are 6, 5 and 4 years old.
