I think I was one of the people who found another of Roth's pearls. His performance was impressive. The story, so eloquently told 25 years ago by Francis Ford Coppola, is gradually evolving, giving the characters leeway. Roeg proves once again that it does not necessarily have to be a theater of war to be interressting. In a wonderful place lies a story of contrasts. Ruthlessnes and beauty go hand in hand, while loneliness should become your best friend. It shows a more sinister past of a golden age kingdom that lies on a coast full of wealth for a first world country, if you send the right men. All in all a beautiful director of Nicola's direction with a sublime cast.
