This is not a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is the abbreviation for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Penal Batallion. Such battalions were formed due to the growing demand for soldiers, as the Soviet Union claimed heavy casualties during the war. These battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who had the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat. They were considered scum and easily spent in combat, without much regret or honor from the military. They were often sent to suicide missions and suffered extreme losses. Those who refused to fight were executed. Needless to say, her life was crappy. <br /> <br /> There have been some very good performances by the performers, most notably Yuri Stepanov, who played Antip, Aleksandr Bashirov, who played Stirah, and Roman Madyanov, who played Major Kharchenko. However, the series is not really addictive, partly because it's too long, it could be much shorter and just as effective. <br /> <br /> Although it's about war, Shtrafbat has very mild violence and pretty much no blood. It depends solely on the actors, and it's finally a television series, so the producers did not want to scare off the viewers and sponsors. Shtrafbat examines the cruelty of the film Soviet Regime and explains why so many men have decided to fight against the Nazis instead of joining them. Personally, I would rather be a fascist than a communist given the circumstances of the film. A character explains that the Soviets cleaned up his farm and his family died of hunger. Out of trouble, he burned it down, arresting him for destroying Kolhoz property, and he ended up as a criminal in the punitive battalion. Antip remembered how his mother had killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family. Both men declared that they had fought for their motherland and not for the Soviets. The punitive battalion had a Marine raping a girl, killing his comrade in the prosess, his other comrade threatened to keep his mouth shut on both exams, and then injuring himself when it came to combat. Besides, the girl committed suicide out of shame. I imagine if enough Marines had seen this movie, they would pick up banners and riots on the streets and demand a boycott or official apology from the producers. <br /> <br /> To say the least, I would recommend anyone with the least interest in the former Soviet Union or World War II. I do not think I wasted more than 500 minutes of my life.
