Story of a strange love and a desire to fall. Poem about beauty and its perfection, fear and touch. A piece of Visconti, Mahler and man. And a torturous Venice. I do not know if it's a masterpiece, a poem or the reflection of a movie director's world. It is absolutely a "Memento Mori". and an exploration of the illusion. An old mirror of the limits, signs and the delicacy of death. A journey into an old space, nostalgic, cruel and glorious. "Death" is a trip copy of an Orfeu in the immediate vicinity. And the essential is the music. A soft, sweet music like honey or winter fire. Like every regret and sorrow. Like a refuge in deep loneliness. Gustav happens to be gay. He is the researcher of the last form of the presence of God. The beauty, this beauty that gives meaning to life, which is at the same time sin and virtue, the gift of expectations and suffering. He dies because he has the right to hope to believe in the reality of the miracle and its way. A victim? Under no circumstance! Only Tadzio is allowed to bring freedom like an insignificant sacrifice. Who saw that the sun can live in the same situation?
