I missed the beginning of the movie. I came in when the partisans were in the farmhouse. I can honestly say it was horrible. The moral effects are stunning. <br /> <br /> My fear of pain and torture makes me unable to see me other than a coward. I see the Christ-like ability presented by the brave patriot, and I can only pray that I could or would have the moral weakness to follow his example. <br /> <br /> I see that as the main theme of the film is to show the weakness / strength of the tortured, but what a gloomy decision to face it. All this because the soul of man can be so distorted that the pain and suffering of a fellow human are somehow satisfying. Be it mentally or physically. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was very thoughtful.
