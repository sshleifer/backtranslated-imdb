I saw that at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. There are some wonderful descriptions of this movie from other commentators here, and they seemed to really enjoy it, so I will not go too far to give a movie summary, but it could be a bit of Woody Allen and maybe something by Federico Fellini in it see movie collection with about 50 short sketches or vignettes lined up and containing no actual action. However, some of the vignettes are related in their character and plotting lines, and a corner bar is often used as a central scene, in which it always gives the last call. The beginning and end sequences also have a common theme that spells out the movie. It took three years to film this and a lot of time was needed to find the easiest and most homely-looking people in Sweden to make the cast. This is Sweden's official application for Best Foreign Language Film for the 2007 Academy Awards. It is a beautiful film, but hardly worthy of an official template for the best foreign film. Sweden's official model last year was the very weak Farväl Falkenberg and the year before it was expensive, but ZoZo bored, so that Sweden again has no chance to win the Oscars. This movie has its moments and would have made a good 20-25 minute movie, but it's getting a bit old and cold for a full-length feature film. Roy Andersson directs. Gustav Danielsson is the cameraman. The editor-in-chief Anna Märta Waern deserves much credit for the work she has put into this work. Benny Andersson from ABBA Fame offers a fun music score. It's an interesting movie with a lot of dry humor and I liked it, but it's nothing really special and could only give it 7 out of 10 points.
