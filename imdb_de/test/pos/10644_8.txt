I've been wanting to see this for a long time: I never thought I'd see it in a dank Trafalgar Square in London with 15,000 other people and all the new Pet Shop Boys. <br /> <br /> Quick, this experience special. A new departure from the PSB, it seemed to suffer from the same problem that the miniaturist Hugo Wolf had when he wrote his opera The Corregidor: The long structure was a chain of short, d. H. songs. PSB produced a smoother, integrated score, though it was quite static under its own conditions. They also could not resist the song: setting the subtitle text, which in this respect was a free-standing meditation on the action of the Odessa massacre during the action of this sequence itself, was, I would say, counterproductive. Overall, it was very exciting, and this is certainly the goal of Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> It's a very exciting movie in which the choppier cut is the place of acceleration of tension or action. In fact, although the film was beautifully filmed and passionately played (it has a silent movie melodrama, but not the Hollywood comic style), by carefully editing certain recordings with a sense of the speed with which the audience turns it on in. And there is also a very big perspective; Either he had many cameras or the sequences at the harbor and the stairs took a lot of time. <br /> <br /> Super movie that can be judged regardless of the tone as the finished product would have been so conceived. 8.10
