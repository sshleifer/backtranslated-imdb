The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is based on a somewhat rickety formula of the Japanese school drama anime. The formula is something like this: <br /> <br /> 1. The main protagonist comes from the world outside of normal society and has superpowers. <br /> <br /> 2. There is a very beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> 3. There is a normal character that shares the lead role in the story. <br /> <br /> 4. Unusual things happen in an ordinary social environment. <br /> <br /> 5. Sometimes the story is the main protagonist and the normal character associated with the existence or destruction of the world. <br /> <br /> 6. Absolutely no effort is made to gain all the magical powers. You just have it. <br /> <br /> 7. Normally people outside of this tight niche group are not aware of their super powers and continue their daily lives. <br /> <br /> So you have it. The melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi is made in this way, which became the recipe for success for comics and anime in Japan. Although this is a Pat formula, the series is superbly designed and the episodes are always in an interesting background within the normal social settings, which always turns into unusual circumstances around Haruhi Suzumiya. Every player in the story brings unusual insights into everyday life that we normally do not know about. The philosophical twist of her insights makes this series particularly entertaining. The visuals are first class and beautiful. <br /> <br /> The crazy ideas that Haruhi always struggles with, along with intricate settings of history, can give you a headache from time to time. It gets even more complicated by the fact that the episodes are not played in sequence, which adds to the confusion. When I looked at the episodes in chronological order, some actions finally made sense. I recommend you to do the same. It's much fun to watch the show like this.
