Sometimes good things happen by mistake. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of "Silverwing" until the end of 2005 - I turned channels and just happened to see something on Toon Disney, where bats in a sawmill were attacked by owls. I had no idea what it was, but I was motivated to stay tuned - it was hard to wait for a commercial, so I figured out what it's called! <br /> <br /> Part of what intrigued me was the look of the bats - above all, they did not use the usual convention of giving the bats "extra fingers" where their thumb claws should be. They are more like palms like human hands, but the fingers are longer and have skin fibers between them. <br /> <br /> Even the faces - they look like humans (in fact, someday I asked myself if they were once human, but they were turned into bats.) Normally I do not like that in comic animals, but here it is works - the story is a human story, even when it comes to bats and other animals (not unlike The Lion King). <br /> <br /> What I saw on TV are the last two parts of the "trilogy" had missed the beginning of the first "Towers of Fire" (the second overall), but mostly I saw everyone, but I really wanted to understand what was going on, because the first part had not happened and I would not have caught it either /> <br /> But I saw that it was based on a book by Kenneth Oppel, how good that I paid attention and wrote it down - I was very disappointed to learn that the series was NOT AVAILABLE! not even that it sinnv lately oll was that it was not available yet. <br /> <br /> However, I not only found the book Silverwing, but also the two appendices Sunwing and Firewing. When I read the first book, I asked myself, "Is that it?" Not only because much of the series is not in this book, but even if I did not see the animated version. The book Silverwing (otherwise a good story) does not end so much as it stops. Only a loose end is bound - Shade and Marina meet at the Silverwing colony in Hibernaculum. <br /> <br /> In fact, Silverwing and Sunwing (in my opinion) should have been released in a single volume because they do it together for a complete story, but not separately. <br /> <br /> In fact, the animated version takes some elements from Sunwing (eg Orestes, lifting the sun ban) and some were completely original. It is not perfect, but it is definitely very pleasant. I like both versions of the Silverwing saga. <br /> <br /> So I'm glad it's finally available in June. It took a long time and it's worth the wait.
