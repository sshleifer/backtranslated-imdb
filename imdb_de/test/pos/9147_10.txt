No matter how many times Wile Ethelbert "Famishius Famishius" Coyote tries to win the Road "Burnius Roadibus" runner, we always know what will happen, even though our compassion always stays with the WEC. The highlight in "Hook, Line and Stinker" is a Rube-Goldberg scheme, from which the WEC hopes to finalize the RR. But of course you know what happens. So Wile E. continues to relish voluptuous fanaticism (defined by George Santayana, who doubles the effort after you've forgotten your goal), while Road Runner almost never becomes aware of the potential danger - or their absence - in which he could find himself. A true classic. <br /> <br /> And yes, the coyote's middle name is Ethelbert. I got that from "Jeopardy!" Learned.
