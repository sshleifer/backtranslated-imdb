Akin's award-winning 2004 film Head-On / Against the wall showed the appealingly chaotic world of a self-destructive but dynamic Turkish-German rocker called Cahit (Birol Ünel). This documentary is an offshoot of Head-On and explores the music spectrum that would be found in Istanbul today if you were as energetic and curious as the German avant-rock musician Alexander Hacke of the group Einstürzende Neubauten (who arranged the soundtrack and performed some) has the music for head-on) and was supported by director Akin by a film team and Turkish speakers. You get everything from rap to the most traditional Turkish classics, between rock, Kurdish music and Turkish pop. It is a chaotic and open world like Cahit, one in which East is East and West West, but the two meet somehow. <br /> <br /> Like Istanbul itself, on the outskirts of the city, Europe and Asia bring the two worlds together while remaining sui generis. This is a mix of Turkish pop, Turkish traditional songs, Kurdish suits, Roma jazz musicians and a group of street musicians (Siyasiyabend), lively and unconventional shots of Istanbul street life and some in front of the camera talking about the synthesis and some personal and musical history of Singers and musicians. He worked at the Grand Hotel de Londres in Istanbul's Beyoglu district, where Cahit spent the night at Head-On while searching for his lover. He roams the city with crew and equipment to interview people and record their music. <br /> <br /> He starts with a loud rock from the "neo-psychedelic" band Baba Zula ?? these are musicians he has teamed up with when composing Head-On's score, and he stands for the absent bassist - and Turkish (including brave female) rappers? Thus, some old people left the theater early and missed the predominantly melodious and easy to hear sounds that make up the majority of the film. (The narrative excesses of head-on were periodically tempered by musical interludes played by a traditional Turkish orchestra on the other side of the Bosphorus.) Hack gives us the opportunity to meet and perform at some of the most well-known live Turkish singers including Müzeyyen Senar, a lady in her late eighties whose aging, elegant musicians are reminiscent of the way the great Egyptian singer Umm Kulsoum performed. Hack picks up the songwriting film star Orhan Gencebay to make an impressive solo on the long-necked oud on which he wrote all his songs, and persuades the now elusive great Sezen Aksu, a special performance of one of their most famous songs "Memory" to make of Istanbul. "This is a coup, and so is the lamentation of a beautiful Kurdish singer Aynar, who was recorded in a bath whose acoustics are spectacular, if only she could have turned down the heat?" Singer and musician faces swarm with sweat a young Canadian, Brenna MacCrimmon, who speaks fluent Turkish and sings Turkish folk songs with expression and passion.The sound mix is ​​consistently high quality.It would like to see a sequel, many great examples of Turkish popular and classical music were necessarily omitted. <br /> <br /> film released in summer 2005 and screened at festivals in 2005 and 2006. Opened at the Angelika Film Center in New York City on June 9th, 2006.
