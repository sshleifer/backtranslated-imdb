This movie is excellent! Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable! His little peals when he's scared, and the funniest parts are when: Scamp gets stuck under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp 'Ive Never Had That Feeling Before' I can highly recommend the movie, it will be released on June 20th in a special edition. The cover has trash can and Angel under the lid. <br /> <br /> I just can not explain this movie as romantic, charming, funny, and adorable. The junkyard scenes are funny, all junkyard dogs have something special. Too funny I laughed, kids will love it. Buy it when it comes out, it has new features!
