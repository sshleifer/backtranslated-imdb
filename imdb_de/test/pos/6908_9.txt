I saw Glenn McQuaid's "I Sell The Dead" in his North American premiere at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Since this is the second gig worldwide, I did not really know what to expect from this film, especially because I did not see the short film that was inspired by this big screen adaptation. <br /> <br /> I start with a movie A bit more elaborate plot overview without revealing spoilers. <br /> <br /> This film is about Arthur Blake becoming a grave robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries he and his mentor discovered. <br /> <br /> The costume and stage design of this movie were excellent. I was amazed to hear that the entire movie was shot in and around New York. The costumes were very timely and bring you as a spectator really into the mindset of the time. This movie works just as well as a piece of temporary work like a horror comedy. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the two main roles was very fluid. They played each other off with ease. The dialogue between the two was very well written, with Glenn adding his comedic note even in tense situations. <br /> <br /> The story is very extensive and the ball rolls from the beginning. I would compare it to a visual page turner and always wonder what will happen next. The characters themselves are all very vivid and unique, adding different emotional layers to the film itself. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who is in the mood for dark humor and a little bit of horror mixed in. <br /> <br /> 9/10
