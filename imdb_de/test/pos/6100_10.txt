Spoiler Alert I worked on this Lifetime TV movie (shot in Seattle) as an extra. It's really interesting to participate in the production of a movie, because usually parts are still being written (like here), or editing cuts and major changes to the final parts. <BR /> <br /> My husband and I both worked as extras in this movie, and I remember them discussing on the set, how to decide if the little girl would die in the end or not. Honestly, I never thought that Margaret Colin's character was really punished properly for committing crimes and punishments, lied to the police, covering up, and so on, instead of getting out of her coma at the end, okay? Just something to think about. By the way, I'm playing a police detective you can see for a fraction of a second, and my husband is playing another detective you can often see (we counted four times). It was great to work with Margaret Colin and be very down to earth, even though Lisa Vidal (now a Lifetime director) was aloof. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was about 7/10, but as another poster commented, is still a real jerk and makes a great cable pull on Saturday afternoon.
