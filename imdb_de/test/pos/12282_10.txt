I liked the story of a man trying to get his girl back. I was there, done, so I can tell ... I like the camera work, how occasionally the camera stays on, and you just sit there and talk about the scene or other stuff ... or how the camera is leading him around Finding the cast and what not ... I was watching the IFC last year and I really liked it, so I told some of my friends about it, and some of them saw it and they did loved it ... try it if you can, a bit girlish, but it's still a good movie ... I gave it a 10/10 because of two reasons ... One: I can tell .. But anyone who has ever fallen in love and made a mistake can refer to two: Two: It's a really creative way to make a movie as if you're always there, right in the middle of the movies ... like said, great movie
