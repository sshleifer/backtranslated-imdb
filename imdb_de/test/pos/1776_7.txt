Directed by Jacques Tourneur (Cat People, The Past, Night of the Demon) and written by Phillip Dunne (How Green Was My Valley) Anne of the Indies is a pretty interesting adventure pirate movie. The main character of Captain Anne Providence is based on the true pirate Anne Boney, who actually lived and sailed through the Atlantic Ocean of the 18th century. The film begins with the naval battle in which Anne (Jean Peters) is a pirate ship attacks a merchant ship that was traveling from South America to Europe. As a result, a treasure of great value is conquered along with the handsome French officer Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan), who is captured. Anne falls in love with him and apparently her feelings are returned, but only when she releases him, when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife Molly (Debra Paget), with whom he is quite in love. Anne plans to seek revenge on both, but in an unexpected twist of fate, a great sacrifice is required to save her instead. The pirate movie cliché character "Black Beard" also appears here, this time by Thomas Gomez. <br /> <br /> Although Anne of the Indies probably does not seem to be more or less a repetition of the pirate movie cliché, it still has its classic moments in beautiful pictures and naval bout sequences filmed in Technicolor, as well as in some Aspects of history and above all in personal touches directed by Jacques Tourneur. 10.7
