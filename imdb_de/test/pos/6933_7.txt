I am a glutton for B-movies. I love the old drive-in fare like this movie. This movie, which seems to have been made for very little money, does something that some larger budgeted films fail to do. It's cheezy. It's bloody. It has no real conspiracy, but it kept me talking for an hour and a half. I either laughed or covered my eyes. There are a few great effects, such as a shot from the mouth of a man who is stabbed by a knife in the chin and pushes up through his tongue and penetrates into his palate eyeballs tore out. But there are also a lot of zombies and some psycho-killers after the Texas Chainsaw massacre, and a demon had a scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that the killers inject when they torture and kill people. It has great camera work and some cool cut tricks. This one is more original than the first Bloodbath, and the undead look better, but they are still patterned after the dubbed, shabby zombie movies of the '70s and' 80s, and they still have a cheeze factor that is mighty high. Do not expect Romero, only second-class Fulci. I would say that horror fans will like it, and it's funny and lively and a quick ride through B-Movie Land.
