This movie has something that most other films in its genre do not do: intelligence and good messages. Suppose is the story of a child named Bartleby (Justin Long), who is rejected by every college he applies for. His parents are incredibly severe, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students facing similar problems start a wrong college to bond with their parents as college kids. Not everything is going according to plan, and the movie is about being winged with it. But behind this conspiracy, which sounds ridiculous, are good messages, morality, and a new perspective on the American education system. The South Harmon Institute of Technology, which they founded, accepts those who have not been accepted elsewhere. The message is that you do not need "money, tradition or fancy books - you just need to improve yourself." They are a totally unorthodox school, but what the film teaches is that it's still alright - and different (whether it's a person or a school) is not necessarily bad and that anyone who cares is given the chance should be given to improve themselves if they are "weird". It is a message of nonconformity and also has traces of anti-authority. But news is not only great - it's funny! haha I laughed very hard. The humor can be subtle, but also crass and is a great mix. fraternities
