Later film critic Gene Siskel said that this film shows how easy it is to make a film. He complimented him, even if it had been taken as an insult today. Although I do not always agree with Gene Siskel, I agree with him here. Love Jones is a shining example of what a love story should be like: realistic with real characters in real life situations. <br /> <br /> The story tells the ups and downs of the relationship between Darius Lovehall (Larenz Tate) and Nina (Nia Long). Larenz Tate and Nia Long are more than just a beautiful couple on the screen. These two actually have chemistry together. You can feel the atmosphere between these two when the screen appears on the screen, and it's awesome. Bill Bellamy is pretty funny as the deceitful forest and Lisa Nicole Carson as Nina's friend Simone is great. Isaiah Washington is as good as Darius' close friend Savon and I sigh every time I see him in a movie. The guy is a great actor whose career is being ruined by industry lowlifes and the childlike games they play. It is believed that he called the little weasel from Gray's Anatomy out of his name, but anyone who knows how Follywood works is better off believing any "official story" from the place of faith. Definitely ... <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a wonderful love story full of interesting and likable characters in realistic situations that anyone who falls in love can relate to. You love these people because they are believable and not portrayed as gangsters and tramps. No obscene stereotype can be found here. Compare that to romance movies by toady. Exactly. Finally, if you love Black Cinema, you should have a copy of this movie.
