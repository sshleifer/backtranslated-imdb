This film is about a deadly poison contained in small glass balls used for killing. This is apparently being done to hide a spy ring stealing plans for a new American bomber. Now much of this action has been repeated in other Chan films, THE JADE MASK and THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS. It was also used for the first time in MR. WONG, DETECTIVE - everyone had the exploding glass balls - a plotelement that was obviously overused. It was interesting in MURDER OVER NEW YORK, but these later films made it rather pass√©. <br /> <br /> Luckily the rest of the movie was fresh and the plot worked very well - with a good ending Of course, the offender reveals himself. However, no plane could fly as it was before that plane - especially in 1940. Such extreme jumps and fast climbs were quite stupid for this already outdated aircraft to see a janitor Frank Coghlan Jr. - the same actor who Billy Batson starred in the CAPTAIN MARVEL series. According to IMDb Mr. Coughlan is 93 years old and retired from the film industry.
