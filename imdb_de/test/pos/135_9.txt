Cinematography is the highlight of the film. Park knows how to shoot unforgettable scenes behind the camera. Each shot is filled with bright colors that jump off the screen. Every frame of the movie seems to tell a story for itself. I hope there is a Blu-ray release of this movie because it will look awesome. It's pretty interesting to see what elements the Vampire Mythology Park has used for his vision. Sang-hyeon needs to drink blood to survive and look impeccable, has incredible power, and is prone to sunlight. However, he has no fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror. <br /> <br /> Although I've never seen the movie, I could not help but feel that this was the version of Chan-wook Park's Twilight. The entire middle part of the movie is dedicated to the love of Sang-hyeon and Tae-joo to each other. It really felt like the adult version of Twilight. There is a lot of blood, nudity, sex and even a few obscenities that are used for good reason. Maybe it's the Chan-Wook Park fan inside of me, but I honestly feel that I can guarantee that this is the better movie of the two. The psychological aspect that I love about Park's previous films is also in Thirst. This is an important factor for me because any movie that makes me think or is unusual in any way becomes a fan favorite. The soundtracks to Parks films always seem to fit into the respective film like a glove. Thirst is no exception. While the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time, it fits effortlessly into the overall atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> The middle part of the movie seemed to work longer than anything in the movie. It's funny, since the scenes during this time are crucial for the plot of the movie, and it's hard to imagine that Thirst is the same movie when one of those scenes was cut. Still, it's my only fool of the movie. Chan-wook Park bites Thirst into vampire mythology, giving her a dark, psychological twist. Park's movies always seem to have a certain formula or include most of the following elements: great writing, beautiful cinematography, a solid cast, a kind of psychological twist that puzzles your head, and an unforgettable ending. Thirst delivers on all fronts and hopefully will earn more attention he deserves during his drama on DVD (and hopefully Blu-ray).
