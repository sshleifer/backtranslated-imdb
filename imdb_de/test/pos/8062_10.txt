As good as Schindler's list was, I found this movie much more powerful as it is a documentary based on real life. It describes the history of the Frank family and especially of Anne. Although it is a bit slow at first (detail family life before the war); It becomes very powerful. <br /> <br /> Due to some shots and photos of the camps I would not recommend it for children, but for adults, it illustrates the horror of the Holocaust by a young girl. Highly recommended.
