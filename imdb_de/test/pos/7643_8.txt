TOUGH LUCK follows a homeless drifter who gets entangled in the underground crime world of deception and chaos. Archie (Norman Reedus) was released from prison and has nothing to lose. He is almost killed before the owner of a carnival called Ike (Armand Assante) hires him for work. Soon, Ike reveals a strong desire for Archie to assassinate his mischievous wife Divana (Dagmara Dominczyk), an erotic dancer for the carnival. Things get complicated when Archie falls in love with Divana and warns her about the plan. They engage in a very hot affair that leaves little to the viewer's imagination, and soon they make a plan. Together, they plan to assassinate Ike, but things are not going as planned. I would be lying if I said that this movie did not surprise me. I was really excited about how good this movie was. When I rented it a few years ago, I expected another cliche thriller with many of the typical elements and themes that are shown in many films of this kind these days. Within a few minutes I was fascinated by the world of this film. It's a kind of movie, similar to BUFFALO '66, that simply draws you in and puts you in the style and sense of paranoia. It's a movie that makes it really stunning. What I especially appreciated was how the movie showed its characters. The film is not as simple and clear as it can appear in the plot summary. These are characters that you are really interested in and that are intrigued, including the characters you want the bad guys to be. In truth, there are no good or bad in this movie. All characters are flawed in a realistic and incredibly realistic way. There are not many films that can handle this job as flawlessly as this film, but it is definitely a style of film I like and from which I want to see more from films today. There have been a few thrillers in the early '50s, but it has never been so enthralling and unique! <br /> <br /> In terms of mistakes, I usually have very small handles. The movie itself is not exactly original. I doubt, however, that most people would expect it to be original. The cut style of the film can also be irritating for some people, as it usually has a camcorder type like a blurred cam. Although it did not bother me and I actually felt it contributed to the atmosphere, I'm sure most viewers will not be so excited about it and generally find it a deterrent. Despite the small flaws, however, this is one of the most underrated films of the 2000s. It's so refreshing to be lucky and watch an unfamiliar movie that turns out to be good. It seems like this movie is a direct video release, though this movie is far better. Had it been shown in cinemas, it would not have won or seen awards, but it would have received much more recognition than it does today. Recognition that this movie deserves. TOUGH LUCK is a stunning, entertaining and twisted neo-noir thriller with a true sense of class and style side by side and with enough substance to more than satisfy the average moviegoer.
