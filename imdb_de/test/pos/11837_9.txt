toplines this ok comedy about an aging father (C. Aubrey Smith) who decides to collect his adult children from all over the world. Davies works as a choral girl in New York when she gets word that "Daddy" wants her. Hmmmm, I feel familiar. Davies' notable talents as a comedian save this otherwise comic comedy, breaking her British landscape with her Brazilian American personality. Not as sharp as some other Davies comedies, but still worth a look. Ray Milland plays her long-lost "brother". Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray and Halliwell Hobbes are also fun.
