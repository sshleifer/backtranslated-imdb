You know, people who make comedies so often forget that being outrageous is really alright. Well, not this time. Unconditional love has everything. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie starring Cathy Bates as the romantic lead ... and it works. It not only works, it works very well as well. I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard, I think I hurt myself, but the main characters were all so human, so honest and so real. But do not big comedies come here? Do characters not need real feelings, real feelings and the ability to feel real pain? Well, they do that in this movie. Unconditional love is a movie you should not miss, especially if you need a really good laugh or if you are curious to see the psychotic dwarf in the red raincoat.
