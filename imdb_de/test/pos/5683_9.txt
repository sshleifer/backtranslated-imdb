One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. Wow, it was a big surprise and amazing how good this movie was. Sometimes a jewel like this will pop up but is rare. I was expecting a popcorn monster movie and a slightly distracting way to spend a long night, instead making a very well done and directorial movie with great acting and passion and heart. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes you feel the characters and what happens to them, and it is filmed as if you were there and it really happens. I know some people in other reviews compare it to "open water," but I disagree because I thought Open Water was pretty boring and mediocre, though this movie was the opposite, even though it was superficially " The actors are at least unknown to me, but they are all very effective and convey the terrible situation with frightening intensity and realism. The story is well done and runs smoothly, the plot is logical and seems to be something that could happen. All the actions and thoughts of the characters are exactly what a person would do and think about. Very credible and this makes the movie more real. <br /> <br /> I finally had tears in my eyes. I have to say that a movie rarely has that effect on me, so powerful and emotional was this movie made and I am adequately impressed by the director and actors of this great movie.
