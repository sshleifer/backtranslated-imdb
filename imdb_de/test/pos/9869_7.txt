Although I happened to bring this movie (I thought it was the original Halloween (stupid!)), I was surprised how good it was. Many sequels simply continue the events of the previous films, but they try to explain the events. Why does Michael Myers kill people, and why does he seem to have supernormal abilities? I thought this was a top horror movie full of action, excitement and surprises. I am very happy that I brought him. I gave it 9 out of 10 points.
