This movie is a knockout referred to as fires in the named plane (burning at the end of the harvest season). A happy memory of Tamura. He experiences this in his mind many times and at the end of this gloomy movie like A Man Who Has Been Thirsty, He Believes He Is Home And This Last Illusion Is All He Has Yet. Billy Wilder's The Big Carnival is the only movie I can think of that is as bleak as this little masterpiece by Kon Ichikawa. I think the whole movie is brilliant. Two scenes that come to my mind are, as a train of Japanese soldiers trying to escape (crawling on their stomach) are attacked and massacred by Americans, True Horror, and like an American soldier and a pretty Filipino girl soldier has a cigarette on the street side, she smiles as she jerks her jerk, then her face turns into rage when she sees two Japanese soldiers trying to surrender, she takes a gun and kills her with pleasure, the American Soldier Attempts to stop them, but has no chance, this speaks to me volumes of the atrocities committed by the Japanese in the Philippines, all in all, a great movie, if you have the stomach for it.
