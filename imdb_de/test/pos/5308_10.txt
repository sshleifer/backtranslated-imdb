The United States of Leland was an amazing movie. I kept posting it in my TV Guide and did not know what it was, and never got a chance to sit there and get in there. One morning, when I woke up early, I saw that it was just beginning. So I decided to look at it. I had the time and the interest to see it. When I saw that Ryan Gosling was in the movie and he was the main character, I was immediately sucked in and could not move from my couch. The fight Leland is undergoing is an inspirational story. Everyone has to deal with the same thoughts at some point in their lives, be it a small, small detail or something as big as what he is going through. I have to sit down and watch the movie just to catch what I missed the first time. As a general comment ... I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Gosling fan or anyone who just likes a good movie with a really good story. The fact that there are so many other big stars who have all shown great performances is just an added bonus. So take the time to watch this movie. I can almost be sure that it is not a waste of time.
