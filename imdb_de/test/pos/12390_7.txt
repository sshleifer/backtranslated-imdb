Of course, how could he? He has apparently taken over several aspects of this excellent film, which was also based on the sensational French case of the self-described "doctor of the World Health Organization," who murdered his family and himself when he was finally exposed as a fraud. Emilio calls his son a "monster", he sings to the radio in his car, he's hanging out on park benches, and he specializes in investment plans to cheat on his family and friends - all this and even more directly from "Time Out". It's too bad, because this movie alone is good, with good acting and writing, while Vincent of "Time Out" is a much more subtle character who seems to have a sense of ethics though he is sometimes knotted into knots, the protagonist here seems to have no character except for his winning look and charm. Seriously, the part where he used x-rays showing his mother-in-law's cancer was making more money from To drive his father, uses a subtle twist of the same fraud to avoid the expulsion from his fancy home, because he does not pay the lease time - it is almost too much rl has no shame whatsoever. In fact, he is more the lead in "Stepfather" than a poor guy who gets fired and so humiliated that he can not face the disappointment of his family and friends and is forced to invent a shiny new life movie for himself even as Vincent did in "Time Out". So you could feel the tension in "Nobody's Life" and the violent conclusion. "Nobody's Life" definitely had a love interest in "Time Out", apart from the protagonist's trusting wife. It is not difficult to understand how the sexy babysitter could so intrigue and seduce Emile that he ignored the danger of her natural curiosity and allowed him to reveal his less well-crafted tricks. Given the reservations mentioned, this is a pretty good movie that we found entertaining. If you long to touch something similar that is deeper and intellectually and spiritually satisfying, I strongly recommend "Time Out".
