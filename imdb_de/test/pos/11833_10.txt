I saw this movie for the first time today and just loved it ... <br /> <br /> Yeah, it's just in its story, the cutest love story, and like any woman can not fall in love with it, Callum Blue beats me ... <br /> <br /> The scenery in Italy was as expected, beautiful, the bad guys lost in the end and for the two love birds to be reunited in the end, was wonderful, but this scene in which a certain Italian after Eric and Wanda's wedding swept away the confetti, perfection !. <br /> <br /> Have a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie. I know it was me and hope to get it on DVD soon. All the actors played their roles perfectly, this was a World War II movie you could believe in, because it was so realistic and did not excel like in other movies ...
