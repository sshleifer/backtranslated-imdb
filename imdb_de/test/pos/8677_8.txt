Imagine a world where everyone is treated nicely, no bad word is ever uttered, office fights do not exist and your boss invites the office audience regularly to self-cooked dinners, where you can talk about the latest decorating styles. Everything is neat, pleasant - well, just nice. In other words, you are in hell. After being dropped off in the middle of nowhere, Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) starts a new job as an accountant in a small, clean city in the mid-thirties. In this real, impersonal world of superficial friendliness, surrounded by pleasant but lifeless interior design, as well as colleagues, he feels alien from the start. The food tastes like nothing, drinks do not drink you, no kids anywhere; After first steps, Andreas is looking for ways to escape the bland new world. He does not remember where he came from, but still remembers the rich taste and the true feelings - everything that goes beyond the non-committal Flatline life that he now leads. THE BANGING MAN reflects the ideas of Huxley and Kafka, but here cruelty is the omnipresent non-binding purity. Unlike PLEASANTVILLE, this is not narrow-minded bigotry, but rather a fable of our urban civilization of the free world. It is mostly reminiscent of the ingenious FIGHT CLUB scene, in which Edward Norton goes through a mock IKEA catalog. Spiced up with macabre humor, this Scandinavian laconic story convinces on every level: history, characters and relevance. A true screen decoration. 8.10
