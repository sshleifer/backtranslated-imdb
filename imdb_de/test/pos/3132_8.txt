Travis and Sandy (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.) are horse traders who are forced to sell their animals to a Mormon group and lead them across the border to a settlement. What they do not expect is to meet the infamous Clegg killers with their injured leader Uncle Shiloh (Charles Kemper). Ward Bond portrays Elder Wiggs, the lead voice of the Mormon group, who moves the wagon train to the Lord's goal. Along the way, they also meet "Doctor" A Locksley Hall and his "Hoochey Koochey Wagon" and give them help. <br /> <br /> Lovingly led by Ford, who deals with realistic issues that any group could encounter, with great attention to detail, during a rugged car trail. The film has a wonderful cast of character actors, with nary being a real star in the movie, which is indeed a blessing when it's not just for a tempo change. Young Johnson and Carey, Jr. are doing really well, but this is Bond's film to shine as he has the best lines. Johnson is the one who seems to understand Ruffians and beasts like Shiloh, and will certainly come in handy when certain conflicts arise as the Clegg boys ride a bit beside them. <br /> <br /> I have to say this is one of his best and least appreciated westerns and seems to flow very well.
