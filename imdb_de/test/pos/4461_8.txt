Lucio Fulci's "Do not Torture a Duckling" paints an extraordinarily unflattering portrait of Sicily's town plagued by a series of brutal murders of young boys. This surprisingly well-directed film (especially in comparison to later Fulci's Gorefest) is characterized by its general atmosphere of perversity, malice and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence. The soon-to-be-dead children are portrayed as casually cruel and budding peeping toms, and Bruno's seduction by bare Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) really needs to be seen. Highly recommended - especially in pairs with my other cult favorite, "House with the Windows That Laugh "(1976).
