Although I've seen this movie dubbed in French, I'm sure he has lost some of the translation, accent, etc., but it was an excellent, funny movie for a lonely night in a hotel room - a real joke that has the complexity individual sexuality, gender role and finding a place within the communities to belong to - male, gay, urban, 30 years old, etc. - accurately and positively portrayed television to be such a candid and positive representation of the gay community demonstrate. While the fact that the main character ends up "straight" in the end is a little disappointing, this is life, and sometimes that happens. This is a great movie, alone or with a date! A really pleasant experience.
