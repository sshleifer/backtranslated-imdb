Two years after the success of "Airplane," Jim Abrahams and Jerry & David Zucker created this brilliant sitcom in which the great Leslie Nielsen acted as a simple-clad detective "Frank Drebin." The cast included Alan North as "Captain Ed Hocken", Ed Williams as "Ted Olsen" and William Duell as "Johnny The Shoe Shine Boy". "Police Squad!" blatantly insane jokes and clever visual gags in the background. Each episode would conclude with an apparent still image in which the characters in the image are complete. One of the best "stills sequences" saw one of the characters standing up pouring coffee into a cup, overflowing the cup! Guest stars were killed in the opening titles, including Georg Stanford Brown, who was crushed by a falling safe! Despite positive reviews and much criticism was "Squad!" lasted only six episodes before it was canceled. However, this did not mean the end. Five years later, the show was broadcast on the big screen for the first time in the trilogy of "Naked Gun" films.
