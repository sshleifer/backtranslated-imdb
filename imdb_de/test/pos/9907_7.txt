Sometimes a movie is so bad that it's kind of good. This movie was produced in Germany and is dubbed in English, so you have to pass it. The acting was also stilted and forced, unlike what was done by the real rats, the IMO performed the role excellently. Get the Rat Wrangler. Anyway, the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs, and the local garbage collectors are striking as a result, leaving large piles of garbage everywhere. This action has been used before, not to mention that it happened in real life (unfortunately too often) and the audience does not expect any surprises. But it's ok like that. We know what happens and when and sometimes an audience needs a movie that does not require a lot of brain cells. We have our heroes, right down to the chiseled face and body, the half-hero, and of course our heroine, who happens to be the doctor, but only in training, though she discovers what's really going on when so many people end up are sick and die and not just from a rat bite. Of course, the bad guy has to die (okay, all the bad guys, ie the rats), and the final scene is one of those scenes that reminds the audience that a sequel is in progress. This is one of those movies where you just sit back and enjoy what it is and what it is not.
