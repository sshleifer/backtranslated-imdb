The genius of Stephen Sondheim never became as prominent as in his 1979 "Musical Thriller" SWEENEY TODD, a gothic, bloody, grisly, but delicious musical brew about a demented barber returning to London to avenge the evil judge who not only permanently banished him from London, but also that he raises his daughter to his own and plans to marry her, to protect her from "all the evil in the world". The Barber finds love, compassion and help from a lonely pie dealer who has his own agenda with Todd. This musical rock Broadway and won nine Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actress in a Musical (Angela Lansbury). The production was filmed in its entirety in 1982, with Angela Lansbury rebuilding her Broadway role as Mrs. Lovett, the owner of a pie store that finds practical use for the heads that make Todd Hackfleisch. George Hearn, who replaced Len Cariou on Broadway, is so electrifying in the title role that one has to wonder why he was not originally accepted into the role. Lansbury and Hearn are thrilled from start to finish and are 100% committed to their ghoulish characters, backed by a world-class Sondaheim score, which is probably the next thing Sondheim has written for an opera. Lansbury shines on The Worst Pies in London and By the Sea. George Hearn stops the show with "Epiphany" and is also convincing on "Pretty Women", a duet with Judge Turpin, the man he swore revenge on. Cris Groendahl is in tune with Antony, the young sailor who saves Todd and falls in love with his daughter Johanna. Betsy Joselyn is a bit over the top of Johanna's and really vocal to the point that during "Green Funch and Linnet Bird" she actually shakes her voice off for a few moments. The rest of the cast is first-rate, notably Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin, the "Johanna" in this production cut from the original production, and Ken Jennings as Toby, whose sumptuous tenor is the auditorium on "Not While I'm Around." But it is breathtaking music by Stephen Sondheim and the mesmerizing performance of Lansbury and George Hearn in particular, making this night of gothic music theater an experience that will stay with you long after the curtain. Not for everyone, but if you have your heart and soul, SWEENEY TODD is a joy for all music theater lovers and a must for fans of Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury.
