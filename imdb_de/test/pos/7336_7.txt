...this. What immediately crossed my mind was Loving Annabelle, as it has this mature mood and distancing with the subject. We just watch the story unfold, without taking sides or having to face "moral" issues (or of course we are, but they are not fed with a spoon). Sure, there were some difficult facts and decisions to make, but it just flowed. Basically it was just like any other love story, in every other life, with different genders. <br /> <br /> Personally, I found the girls who had good chemistry and had fun with them on their night. The only thing that I could really turn out to be a problem would be that it somehow somehow ... feels like it. Restrained. It's not about the sex scenes (or those that are missing), but because I felt the movie most alive in the moments they had fun together, it was in stark contrast to the others. Lowkey is good, but it has never been as tickled as Loving Annabelle, or has touched me so much. <br /> <br /> I say it warmly, it is by no means a waste of precious time contrary ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
