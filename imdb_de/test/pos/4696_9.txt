This is one of my favorite series in all categories. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to have the whole series on VHS a few years ago. I loved it when I saw it in -91-92 when I was about 12. I love it the same way today or even more, which is remarkable considering my (hopefully) improved movie appraisal and critique abilities. Most of the movies that I liked back then do not appeal to me any more, apart from the nostalgia factor. This factor is also present here, but Robin of Sherwood offers so much more than nostalgia. <br /> <br /> There are only a few bad things about this series. First, the picture and sound quality is so-so, at least in the first episodes. Luckily it gets better. Second, you might have wished for a bit more blood and realism in the fight scenes, though I know that was not an option in this case. <br /> <br /> So the good things! And there are many. First of all, Michael Praed is Robin Hood. I do not think I've seen him in a single role since then, which only reinforces that fact for me. He delivers as credible a feat as Robin. Jason Connery had an impossible task to replace. The fact that Michael Praed has not become a big name as an actor is unbelievable. Or maybe that was his destiny to play that one role perfectly and then disappear. <br /> <br /> I love Nickolas Grace's Sheriff of Nottingham. He really is not a complex character, but totally rotten. The relationship between him and Gisburne is just funny. Just looking at de Rainault, bored and angry on his throne, makes me laugh even before he says anything. Another actor who deserves extra credit is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet. You can really feel the sadness in him as well as his hatred of the soldiers who killed his wife. Winstone is an actor who has finally achieved his well-deserved Hollywood breakthrough (in films like The Departed and Beowulf). There are also many other great actors here. <br /> <br /> I love the portrayal of the Robin gang. They have fun, play, laugh, you can really feel the camaraderie between them, the closeness that comes from a close group like this one. These bonding scenes are so important. <br /> <br /> I think the production of British actors with British actors really made it better, compared to the -92 movie version with Kevin Costner, which just feels fake, fake. (Christian Slater as Will Scarlet, come on ..) Being able to speak English with a British accent makes it more believable, and I have the feeling that the actors, the director and the writers behind the show can do much more following in the footsteps of the Robin Hood Gang, as an American crew. The music is wonderful, Clannad is perfect for the feel of the show. The music is another of those things they just nailed. <br /> <br /> An exciting addition is also the imagination and the magical spice that is used there. It's not over the top but believable and just makes it better and more interesting. I also love how blended the mix of comedy, adventure and drama is. <br /> <br /> These are some of the things that make this series so alive and true. It's by far the best Robin Hood version I've ever seen. I'm not finished with the quote "Nothing is forgotten". But one thing that will never be forgotten is for me the fantastic retelling of Robin Hood. Do you see it
