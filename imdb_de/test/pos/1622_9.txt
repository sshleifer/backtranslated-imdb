First, I have to say that this movie is less presumptuous than The Da Vinci Code. Sure, you have the problem of religion vs. Science, but it does not try to make a big statement about it. Basically, it's an action thriller that moves very well from one scene to another. a scene, especially with fire, I found very well done. <br /> <br /> Second, the book changes from movie to movie. As I watched the development of the movie, I complained about changing some characters and completely removing others, but I have to admit I was wrong. It was refreshing that the film did not follow the book exactly as it did in Da Vinci. If you are a purist of the book, however, you might upset some of them. The BIG TWIST is still there, so do not worry. Finally, I am glad that they have removed some stupid negotiations and have not even tried to bring Langdon and Vittoria together. <br /> <br /> The services are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. That's okay for a movie like this. <br /> <br /> I would give him a 9/10, mainly because it keeps its promise: entertainment, pure entertainment
