A heroic Scout offspring leads a large group of pioneers along THE BIG TRAIL to the west, with Indian attacks, natural disasters and romantic complications that are all part of the adventure. <br /> <br /> As captivating and awesome as his story, Raoul Walsh's THE BIG TRAIL is a wonderful movie, as entertaining as it was over seven decades ago. With very good acting and excellent production values, it lives up to its reputation as the first western epic of talkies. <br /> <br /> John Wayne, taken out of the dark for his first important movie role, looks incredibly young, but he immediately impresses with the natural charm and masculine authority he brings to the role of the hero; he quietly dominates the film with the attributes that would one day make him a big star. Marguerite Churchill is a charming southern beauty who is slowly attracting the Duke's attention. The dialect comic El Brendel is great fun as a Swedish immigrant plagued by mules and mother-in-law; His appearance in a scene signals laughter to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Tyrone Power Sr., who looks like a human grizzly bear and sounds big, makes a wonderful villain. Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a clever villain. (His famous physical similarity with John Gilbert is very obvious here.) The actor Tully Marshall, the actor of the silent film character, is impressive as a sly old miner who helps drive the car. The corpulent Russ Powell, as a friendly furry catcher, makes his singing talent make meaningless noises. Sharp-eyed filmmates will make Ward Bond one of the settlers in Missouri. <br /> <br /> What will surprise many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL was shot in an early widescreen process called Grandeur. More than just his name, the picture looks wonderful, with Walsh dominating the new technology. He fills the screen, every part of it, with action. During the crowd scenes, notice how everyone is doing the actual work, which greatly enhances the truthfulness of those sequences. Walsh deserves credit for being one of the first directors to use the widescreen. In addition, the film is blessed by the rear projection photography that stains so many older films. It should also be emphasized that it is only natural that the soundtrack sounds a bit primitive. Talkies were still in their cradle. That Walsh could use a microphone at all, with most of the scenes shot outdoors, is more praising to him. <br /> <br /> THE BIG TRAIL was not a box office success. In 1930, William Haines' comedies were the big money-makers, and the public was looking for something other than a smart Western. Most of the cast was forgotten, including Wayne. It was not until 1939, when John Ford rescued him in STAGECOACH, that John Wayne's legend would seriously begin. And despite its grandiose prospects, it would take 25 years for the widescreen in Hollywood to prevail, mainly in response to the economic threat posed by television.
