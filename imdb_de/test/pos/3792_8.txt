In this modern age (which is quite well known to the director of the short film about which this German Count will speak?), Politically correct films are the "leitmotiv" of the projects of modern young filmmakers. "Shoulder Arms" by Charlie Chaplin during the First World War (the film was released just weeks before the truce) is an obvious example of why the early cinema pioneers were a very brave people, surely! It was a complicated affair to direct a humorous film inspired by the terrible, bloody First World War, which few directors were allowed to do with these dangerous and courageous ideas. to embark on such a delicate business, and success was reserved only for geniuses. <br /> <br /> As this German count said, "Shoulder Arms" was made during the First World War, in which the whole world definitely lost its innocence (thankfully not the German aristocrat's fat heirs ??) and it is a hilarious, imaginative social satire about this and every war. The film is full of great gags and entertaining film continuity for a story in which this tramp will live on the front despite risky and courageous adventures - whether a hero for the Allies? or not. <br /> <br /> In order to mock the war trenches, the unhealthy, the frontal attacks and the Germans (as you dare !!), there are many inaccuracies in the film? The German soldiers had mustaches and longer beards at this time, not to mention that the Emperor lacks many medals in his uniform. In an elegant, funny and delicate way, it is even today a film wonder that can not be surpassed. In view of these terrible circumstances of war, the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent. Obviously, Mr. Charlie Chaplin had a lot of it. <br /> <br /> And if you allow me now, I have to say goodbye for a while, because this German count has to return to the moats.
