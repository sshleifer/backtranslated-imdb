I had never seen the original death wish in the book, either Death Wish I (movie). Death Wish 3, however, was the most interested movie. The well-known vigilante Paul Kersey tried to visit his friend Charlie, but he visited him only a few minutes before he died because Charlie did not protect the huge and infamous underground force led by Manny Franker. After some confrontations during his detention, Kersey learned that Franker, with whom he was fighting in jail, had his own intent to overthrow New York City (and his influence as well) by sending his followers to the crime each time to be hired, everywhere and every day. Because of Insp. Richard Shriker, who knows his profile well and likes him a lot. Kersey decided to wage war against Franker and his gang. <br /> <br /> I accepted that Death Wish III was one of the most straightforward and extreme violence films I've seen in the past. This film used the straightforward way to tell the story. No lumbering storytelling and less unnecessary scenes that were the sole merit of the film. Violence in the film was used throughout in the next issue. I thought many viewers might like the action scene of Death Wish III because it showed the raw, extreme, and hard-hitting action for every minute of the movie, especially the movie's climactic scene and the death of Manny Franker, whom I thought that this is the case It was the maximum action scene. <br /> <br /> For the cast, I think everyone was good and his role came through. Charles Bronson made everyone believe that he is still great as Paul Kersey. He did not look like the "big old cat", but the great Vigilante. Gavan O'Herlihy has also done a great job. His main role as a villain in the movie made him angry and looked like the big bad guy. The role of Kathryn Davis in this film, however, was pitiful. She did not look like the main character. I thought she only appeared two or three scenes before she was killed by Franker and his followers to focus on Paul Kersey. It could have more role to appear. <br /> <br /> For my comment, the straightline style and extreme violence made this movie great for extreme action movie fans. The fast back and the Forth style made this movie very interesting. Nevertheless, this film had a stupid scene and a storyline. First the scene when Insp.Shriker met Paul Kersey for the first time. It was very insane because you attacked your favorite before you want him to help, much like you hit a guy before you try to lend him some money. Haha! That's like a joke! Although I liked the story, Insp.Shriker later showed that he was helping Kersey because of his appearance on Kersey, which made him look very much like the rogue, but when the movie came to a climax, everything was clear, there was no hidden agenda with Kersey. <br /> <br /> In another case, the final scene of the movie set me back. It stumbles over every feeling because it ended too easily. Frank's gang members looked incredible when they discovered Franker was dead before his girlfriend and other followers decided to flee. Finally, Insp.Shriker had Paul Kersey fly out of town before the police caught him. I thought this style of the final scene can be found in many Cannon Film films, but I do not like it. <br /> <br /> For the summary, I'm fine with Death Wish 3, since I first entered my explanation. The cast and the action were very good and so extreme, even though there were scenes I do not like. Straightedge and Extreme of Violence might be the best short description of this movie.
