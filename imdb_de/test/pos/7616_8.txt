I can not say that I hug this as a romantic comedy, because I found something funny about it. I found it endearing, entertaining, heartwarming, and endlessly sweet, and though there were some funny moments, I found them more bittersweet than downright weird. <br /> <br /> I liked this one. Barrymore has grown as much as an actress, and it's always wonderful to catch her on the big screen. However, this can also be transferred to the small screen. On later visits, I like this picture more and more. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Romantic Comedy, you may be put off by the lack of comedy, but if you're into romance, it's definitely here. <br /> <br /> It rates a 7.8 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
