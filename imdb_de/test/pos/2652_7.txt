A movie should be first and foremost a good storytelling. It should be entertaining - and entertaining does not necessarily mean "laughter" and not necessarily "light". It basically means that you are not bored while watching. <br /> <br /> As brilliant as 2001, it's a difficult movie, especially for the current generation (video game / iPod fumbling). The slow pace and sometimes unbearable time an actor takes to perform a single action (such as trying to rescue the space-crew member) will extend your patience. On the other hand, the camera is brilliant, the film skillfully directed, the end thought-provoking, and the score ... the score is daunting, especially as the crew in the van approaches the artifact on the moon. Boy, I had goose bumps. This does not happen often when I watch movies, and bears witness to Kubrick's directing skills. <br /> <br /> It's considered a classic and is considered by many to be the best science fiction movie of all time. That alone is a good reason to see it if you have not done so yet. Just because everyone thinks it's a brilliant movie does not mean you have to force yourself to like it. Either you will (as it is) or not. Maybe the slow pace is not so bad after all. If you keep your attention at a fairly static and slow pace for 2 1/2 hours, you might learn a lesson. It will certainly be a different experience from all those fast-moving, fast-paced images that we're exposed to today (whether it's commercials, music videos or video games). <br /> <br /> I think it's a "memorable" movie. But I'm not looking forward to watching again in the near future (unless I'm especially into slow movies). <br /> <br /> So 7 out of 10 stars of mine.
