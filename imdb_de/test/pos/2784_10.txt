A young Frenchman uproots himself when he becomes an Erasmus exchange student in Barcelona and a better man returns. Sounds boring? Under no circumstance! The movie is full of colorful people, all of whom are stereotypes (the British cunt and her racist brother, the sexually liberated Dane, the ultra-organized German, ...). In this case, however, the stereotypes are performed brilliantly. You feel that you know such people (I know an arrogant doctor and his trophy wife, and they are just like the characters in the movie!), You feel like REAL PEOPLE! Watch this movie and enjoy the subtitles!
