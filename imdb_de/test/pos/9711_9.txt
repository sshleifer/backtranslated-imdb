Where should I start? I laughed and I was blown away! This movie is just perfect and indescribable. Jackass Number Two was, frankly, rude, obscene, funnier and more entertaining than the first one. That was exactly what I needed tonight. <br /> <br /> There are so many scenes in this movie where you say, "Oh, my way!" or "Ouch!". Perfectly mastered and furnished, each event and scene were coordinated in advance and thus even more perfect. I loved every minute of it! I just want to say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor certain material to prevent an evaluation of NC-17! It was so funny that they had to put it in anyway! Surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> 9/10. Incredibly funny, do not miss it!
