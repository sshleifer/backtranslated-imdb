It makes me tireless that I now and forever see this film (which I consider a masterpiece and do not name that word recklessly) with the qualification "Not the Michael Douglas Film!" The titles are not just the same, but they refer to the same thing - the fallout that fell on the survivors of the first atomic bomb attacks. In Imamura's film, this is not a cheap metaphor; The whole movie is about the physical and emotional consequences of Hiroshima and the war. As the decay of a couple and their grown-up niece becomes more cruel, the ironic imagery becomes stronger, from the old clock, which is reset every night, to the stone gods, who gradually pile up at the heroine's door. (These, in turn, are carved by a piebald veteran who, in a series of tragicomic episodes, is forced to attack everything with an engine approaching the city.) The bombing itself is shown in terrific piecemeal flashbacks. Nonetheless, "Black Rain" ("NtMDm!") May even be repeatedly watched because of Imamura's compassion for his characters. I repeat: a masterpiece.
