And I do not understand why the show beats so much. In my opinion, this show is really outstanding. Well, the first two episodes were not that great, but in the third episode, it picks up a lot of momentum. What's typical of a Steve Moffat sitcom. I would consider it one of the best sitcoms Britain has ever produced. <br /> <br /> The show itself is a farce at its best, it does not fit the Fawlty Towers, but you can definitely rate it as a Black Adder, a tie or the boys! I'm watching the first season and all I can say is that I'm happy I bought the DVD! <br /> <br /> The problem with this show is probably and why was it hit so hard, according to the internet. The original press release compared them to Fawlty Towers, and everyone was disappointed that it was not! Well, even Green Wing is closer to Fawlty Towers than this show. All I can say is that you clarify your prejudices, run the show at least (up to and including episode 3) and then decide for yourself! <br /> <br /> All I can say is Steve Moffat for writing and thanks for the entire staff!
