Unlike Bond and other detective movies, Alfred Hitchcock's hero was an ordinary man who got into trouble and then came out of him with his ingenuity and courage (and luck). Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and is in a sense Vijay Anand's tribute to the master of suspense. The tribute, however she may be, but she has her own reasons and establishes Vijay Anand herself as a great director. <br /> <br /> It's the story of an ordinary man Vinay, who one day realizes that he has a double named Amar who is actually a jewel thief. Suddenly, Vinay gets into the middle of a hatch. To save himself, he goes on a wild goose hunt to find this Amar who is one step ahead of him. The tension almost kills the whole movie, and when the plot runs out, you're struck by the brilliance of the scheme. Just like Hitchcock's films, Jewel Thief boasts a grandiose climax in the palace of Sikkim. <br /> <br /> Everyone and I mean everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyanti Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. are in their top shapes. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.
