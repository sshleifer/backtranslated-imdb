"Tourist Trap" is a really scary low budget horror movie that will surely satisfy horror fans. It contains an extremely strange atmosphere and there are some rather disturbing moments of total fear and fear. Chuck Connors sits down to dinner with a mannequin that comes to life and talks to him before his head drops. There is little gore, but the violence is pretty strong for horror movies rated by PG The climax is scary. David Schmoeller returned to film several other genre films, including Crawlspace, Puppet Master, and Netherworld. Still "Tourist Trap" is definitely his best horror movie gem. Look.9 out of 10.
