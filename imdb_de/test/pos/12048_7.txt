I have seen many of Shahrukh's films and this is a very good role for him. He has such versatility but remains mainly in positive roles. As Rahul, he is very grim and disturbing, but I felt a lot of the movie with him. If for nothing else, watch this movie for Shahrukh. He plays a very complex and real character, very convincing. The story is very typical and has been done before, but the character development is very strong and entertaining. The opening is a bit confusing, but in the end it does not matter. The songs that I found very sympathetic give insight into the characters who think. Very smart. I think this movie is very good and recommend it to all Shahrukh Khan fans. It is a must!
