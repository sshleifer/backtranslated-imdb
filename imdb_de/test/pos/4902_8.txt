One of Warner Brothers' best and most prolific films in the 1930s, this charming family drama was about a widower living with his first-born sister raising four daughters. But not every day four type daughters. All were trained by their musician father on instruments and one as a singer. They make some nice music together, even if it's the long-haired set. <br /> <br /> You can see and admire the infinite variety of roles that Claude Rains has played over the years as he shows you another aspect of his creative personality. The opportunistic Vichy captain in Casablanca is as diverse as the scientist who has gone mad in the Invisible Man, like the patient and smart job in Mr. Skeffington. After all, the same man and all so incredibly different. <br /> <br /> Here he raises the four girls with love, who are seasoned with a little gentleness, by their willingness to accept modern music. The Lane Sisters and Gale Page may know Beethoven, but they are also Hepcats and can beat Daddy 8 into the bar every time. And if Rains gets a bit too intrusive, Aunt May Robson can put him in his place. All sisters develop romantic interests in Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn and John Garfield. Of course, the mating process gets a bit complicated and one of the sisters suffers a tragedy, but promises that the movie ends. Four daughters is also referred to as John's debut film Garfield Apart from a tiny role in the Footlight Parade a few years ago, Garfield had no other film roles. However, he had been celebrated on the New York stage for his performance in Golden Boy, and Warner Brothers signed him and found the perfect movie debut as a cynical musician who just can not get a decent break in life. It earned him the nomination for Best Supporting Actor in 1938, but he lost to Walter Brennan for Kentucky. This movie was so popular that it virtually spawned a small cottage industry for Jack Warner. Series with actors like Daughters Courageous, Four Mothers and Four Wives were cleared at the box office before the Second World War. Warner Brothers played again with Frank Sinatra and Doris Day the games that John Garfield and Priscilla Lane originally played. Now the two made a beautiful music. <br /> <br /> In Four Daughters, a timeless white horse was still created, and the movie lasts 70 years after it was first seen.
