Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher who just wants to marry. Then one of his former students wins an Oscar for a movie in which he plays a gay soldier, and thanks Howard in his acceptance speech, which also turns him into gay! This film follows the aftermath as reporters immerse themselves in Howard's village and he tries to convince everyone that he is straight. <br /> <br /> I love this movie! Kevin Kline is wonderful, it has some really funny moments and I always feel great with a huge grin on my face. So it's a movie that I watch as often as possible. If you have not seen it, do not miss it!
