Charlie Wilson (double Oscar winner: Tom Hanks) is a carefree congressman ... Those who enjoy celebrating, enjoy the company of women and especially his alcohol. As Charlie's old friend and ex-girlfriend Joanne Herring (Oscar winner: Julia Roberts) wants Charlie to visit Afghanistan, which this country should certainly need. Charlie is shocked by what he has seen, especially from all ages, being killed or injured by this war with the Russians. He decides to help the people and the rebels fight against the Russians who started the war. Charlie, Joanne and a renegade CIA agent named Gust Avrakoto (Oscar winner: Philip Seymour Hoffman) will start a good fight to create the biggest undercover operation in history. <br /> <br /> Director: Oscar-Winner: Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, Relating to Henry, Wolf) has made a lively, entertaining sharp satire war comedy based on a true story. Hanks, Roberts, Hoffman in an Oscar-nominated performance and Amy Adams as Charlie's faithful assistant are very good in their roles. Despite the excellent premise of true life, "Charlie Wilson's War" never really catches fire and it's not as bad-spirited as you wished. Director Nichols and screenwriter: Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men) keeps things moving and the characters are consistently popular. <br /> <br /> DVD has a sharp pan & scan transmission (1.33: 1) and a good Dolby Digital effect 5.1 surround sound. The only special features of the DVD are the behind-the-scenes cast and crew and a true life with Charlie Wilson and others. "Charlie Wilson's War" is a good movie that could have been great, but it is not. But this movie is smart enough to appeal to those who like well-written or well-made adult comedies.
