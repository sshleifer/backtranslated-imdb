Although this film changes reality to become more heroic and entertaining, fantasy is sometimes more fun than real life, and nothing could be more real than Errol Flynn playing Custer. This is still the best movie about Custer. The music of Max Steiner is great and throughout the movie the Irish song "Gerry Owen" is played, which was a favorite of Custer. The film should have more villains because they try to focus all the baddies on Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flynn and De Havilland flows together like no other of her films, and director Raoul Walsh with his experience in outdoor scenes with many actors is best.
