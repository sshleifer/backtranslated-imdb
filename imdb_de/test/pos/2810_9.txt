Surprisingly good for TV thriller. I did not expect too much from this, but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of its kind. It's fast and offers solid drama and interesting events. <br /> <br /> The story captivates you from the beginning and with many hits you can find the movie very interesting. <br /> <br /> The backstory of Thiessen is hard It becomes a nightmare, however, when her husband is worse than the stepfather of her childhood friend. <br /> <br /> The "stranger" concept and its actions are worrying, considering that this is a common disease in society. A serial rapist does not respect society or even his own family, and this film perfectly shows illness and crime. <br /> <br /> My beef with the movie was the nonsensical situation when Thiessen's character is released home with her confused husband after being released on bail. At that moment, she knew what he was doing with his young relative (played by the cute Allyson Hannigan). But that's just the typical Hollywood scene that causes more trouble. <br /> <br /> The highlight scene shows Thiessen following her husband as he is committing another rape. Then she calls the policemen who are just coming to arrest him. The end tells us that the man was sentenced to 99 years in prison in real life. <br /> <br /> The acting is also pretty good and Tiffany is as always great and beautiful. The direction is also very good.
