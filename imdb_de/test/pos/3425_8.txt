I saw this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2005. I figured that if Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank play it, it would at least have to be decent. After a slow start I was not disappointed. In fact, I was very satisfied with the final product. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that some of the actors accentuated by Afrikaans and Xhosa (?) English were hard to understand, but I saw "Waking Ned Devine", "Trainspotting" or some other heavily accented film I stopped actors after about 15 minutes. And I tried to figure out why Hilary Swank was supposed to be South African, and she sounded like she was trying to put an accent, but she sounded very American, as if making a faint attempt to set the accent. But later in the film, more and more is becoming known about her character, and how she moved to the US as a teenager begins to understand how she has partially or largely lost her accent. So it made sense that only certain words have an African character. <br /> <br /> I know it's a bit weak when you use film as a lesson, but one of the great things about this movie is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a process of truth and reconciliation. I had heard about the South African T & R process after the fall of apartheid, but I did not really know how it works. <br /> <br /> The final conclusion is that some scenes felt a bit like this. This was a very strong movie overall. The final sequence, in which the "truth" comes out, was the strong conclusion that every movie hopes for. An absolute must for anyone who cares what is happening outside of their borders.
