I watch a lot of movies - DVD, features and classics. That night, watching JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had ordered it on the internet), she said she remembered when she was in high school that she had stayed with her all those years. Reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter and our son) and was riveted from the opening sequence to the final titles. We all were <br /> <br /> you, who remembered the original, and our kids (18 and 16), who had no idea what the movie was about, could not believe it. Our favorite scene? None when Peter Strauss tears his fist off so passionately and says, "I would do it again!". It did not advocate violence because it was a defense crime, but it caused such an intensity that we could not believe it ... When his fellow cellmates gave him their food to support his efforts, we did not have a dry eye home. <br /> <br /> Someone please make more movies like this. INCREDIBLE!!
