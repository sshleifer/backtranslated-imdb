Halloween 666 (1995) The review of the producer! <br /> <br /> Halloween 666 begins with a repeat of the terrible end of Part Five. If you thought the last chapter was dark, it really would come to mind. A mysterious "man in black" has raided the Haddonfield Police Department and released Micheal Myers. The poor Jamie Lloyd was kidnapped by foreign cultists. What do you want with her? Who knows, but let us just say that their long suffering will soon end. Doctor Loomis spends the rest of his twilight hours preventing Michael Myers from killing more innocents (good luck). Doctor Wynn, a friend of Loomis, comes back after a break of four episodes to help the good doctor. Another old face from guest stars from the first part. <br /> <br /> This dark and boring sequel was taken out during post-processing. For some reason, traders felt that the end product was not worth the time of an average horror movie observer. So they decide to make it too stupid. After the film lay on the shelf for several months, he put an egg at the box office. No matter what they did to the movie, they made it worse. They would have left alone enough. Hey, the movie company knows better now than the filmmakers ... or not?
