This is a very good movie. I'll give it a 10th. <br /> <br /> It's a different story because it's kind of a lengthy stalking scene. The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very credible way. <br /> <br /> She sees a murder (for a snuff film) and decides to walk, but is tracked (this takes some time). I will not reveal the rest of the movie as this would spoil the experience, but rest assured: it's very credible, well played, intense and has some nice surprises and a great ending. <br /> <br /> Don 'miss this movie.
