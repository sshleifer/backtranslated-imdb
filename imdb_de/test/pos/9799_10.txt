This story is an excellent story of two boys doing everything to escape their abusive drunkard. Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood is outstanding in this memorable role. This movie is one of the main reasons why I have not touched a single beer and will never do it while I live. That may sound like a nerd, but I have to say that. It's a wonder why this is not heard as a classic American story.
