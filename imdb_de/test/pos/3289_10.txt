I saw Chomps in about two days of his theatrical release. It's a delightfully sweet and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji', though it's much better and more focused on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life-difficulties in a humorous way, followed by bullying and villains who receive their just offspring, is sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought-provoking. With skillful sophistication, this film influences the awareness of cruelty, personal behavior and bullying. Films have different genres and different purposes. This movie, which is appealing to all ages, offers an interesting, humorous look at our own experiences. Everyone recognizes personality and behavior of themselves and others. Everyone will see the humor. The humor makes the move pleasant and brings the understanding of life situations to a new level. <br /> <br /> For carefree laughter and a movie to feel good Chomps is an excellent choice. Unforgettable.
