Ken Loach showed the world with "Poor Cow" the crazy side of Swinging London, about London's wife Joy (Carol White), who teamed up with a thief and had a son with him, just to see the man slamming his while Friend (Terence Stamp) manages to help her, he turns out to be a little better at what a loser he is. Joy realizes that she has to make a serious decision about where to go in her life. One thing I've noticed - I do not know if that's right or not - was a use of irony in the movie. Her name is Joy, but she has no joy in her life. Although it was not intended, it is still a movie that I can recommend to anyone. With songs by Donovan (one of them - "Colors") appeared in another Terence Stamp movie: "The Limey" (which incidentally came out in 1999) when I was the same age as my parents when "Poor Cow" came out)).
