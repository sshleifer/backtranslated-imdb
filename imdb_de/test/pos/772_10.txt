A nice film. One that made me think of God, but felt neither guilty nor overwhelmed. I had to think about death, but I'm not afraid to think about life, but not to hide from it. A film that condemns both love for everything I stand for and the deepest caverns in hell. A movie that made me think of love and everything I've lost, but no sadness made me feel relief for some strange reason. A child of two worlds, god and theater. And a little wine and irony! Best I recommend ***** <br /> <br /> "If the S *** meets the fan, bring a tent" Oh and we should all go camping. Every day.
