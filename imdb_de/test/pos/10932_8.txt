"Eagle's Wing" is a pleasant surprise of a movie and keeps the viewer interested. I did not know how it was done by the British until I read the comments of the other viewers. I can understand why it won an award for cinematography because it was brilliantly presented and must have looked great on a big screen. <br /> <br /> It seemed much more realistic than most Westerns The West was won more truly. As well as the complexity of the characters. Particularly interesting is the Indian-Sam Waterson character. He seems to be brutal in the wild environment in which he is conditioned, but shows a remarkable respect for the frailties he experiences among the white men and women he encounters. He is not friendly or sensitive to these invaders in his country, but he has a limitation of his sense of revenge, even a pity when he is in a position of power, watching the withering white man focused on revenge, as well as the girl he kidnaps after catching a stagecoach. His character seems complex but congruent with the harsh landscapes in which he lived, threatened by these invaders he does not tirelessly deal with. It is interesting to see how this Indian deals with it, compared to the Martin Sheen figure who has held him in his possession and power for a while. "Eagle's Wing" is an unusual western, a genre I'm not attracted to, but I appreciated this excellent offer that I would only rate "A Man Called Horse" second.
