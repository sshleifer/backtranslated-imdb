The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors, the sense of camaraderie in their dialogues and dances. This typical musical for aspiring stars has a reworked plot even for 1944, but it's still funny to watch because of the actors. Hayworth is not even a very good dancer, but she has a lot of 'inexperienced' charm that matches her character. Kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role, while Silvers offers much self-irony and laughter. Sometimes the movie can be very serious too. Not a must, but recommended if you like the actors.
