This movie had a pronounced Woody Allen feel. So, if you're not a fan of dry humor, dark humor or sneaky humor, you could probably find something else. However, if you are, this is a bit curious, with a few nice twists and a flowing, natural dialogue. <br /> <br /> The story itself is very captivating and not like a train crash from which you can not solve your eyes but close I mean that in the best possible way. The intrigues are plentiful, the twists are enough to fully unfold the senses, and the characters are downright adorable. <br /> <br /> I had a great time with this movie 8.3 / 10 from ... the underworld.
