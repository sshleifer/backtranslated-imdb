These comic authors are relentless with their crazy (and funny) puns. The first shot we see here is an island jail with the following inscriptions above the big gates: "Alka Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose". The first sign in prison is "Welcome: take a seat". They then show an electric chair. <br /> <br /> However Corny gives way to wisdom as our favorite wolf is behind bars. With the pen in his hand, he literally pulls a door next to him and flees through it! In no time he crossed the United States, moved through Canada and is in the north of the country. There we see the Canadian Royal Mounted Police and of course our hero Droopy, known here as "Sgt. McPoodle". His job is to catch the big criminal of Alka-Fizz. With his trusty little blue horse, he goes into the heavy snow to track down the wanted wolf. <br /> <br /> At this point we get the normal story: Droopy is always one step ahead of the wolf, no matter what the latter does ... and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny gags. Droopy even pops out of the egg of an eagle on a mountain. There is no place where the wolf can go (or plastic surgery!) To escape the intrepid "Sgt. McPoodle". By the way, no one in the history of cartoons may have more exaggerated reactions than this wolf, every time he sees his nemesis! His screams, his face, and his body, each time stretched in horror, are a big part of his eyesight. <br /> <br /> You'd think this joke cartoon would be drab, but it does not. It's more good stuff from Tex Avery and The Gang, just one of 24 cartoons on the Complete Theatrical Collection DVD, with beautiful-looking, restored visuals.
