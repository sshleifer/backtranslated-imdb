This show features some of the best comedies from Australia because it makes fun of just about everything that many of us want. Some of the best pieces on the show are the ad-road test, which tests how an ad would work in real life. What's really great about the show is how original it is and the fact that there are people (the persecutors) who do what they do and would not do. This show has a lot of pieces that collapse everyone like the ad road test I mentioned earlier, Mr. Ten Questions, in which he briefly poses 10 famous questions to famous celebrities like Hugh Jackman and the Beach Boys The Chasers Emmys and those who were there from the beginning, like What did we learn from current affairs this week? Overall, I am 98% thin.
