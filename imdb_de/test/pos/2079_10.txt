This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is by far the best I have ever seen. Although it does not have the production value of some recent adjustments, it does have the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. Jacobi's depiction of troubled Prince is complex and intriguing. His emotions are from hate to grief, vengeance, and everything else on the map, without being forced or exaggerated. In fact, some of the stronger sequences appear when he adds quietness, gentle language, and thoughtful expression. Whether he interprets Hamlet as crazy or sensible or not ... Well, you should decide for yourself; I changed my mind more than once. At one point, it seems he thought he was sensible and just madness, but he senses that he is indeed crazy ... a revelation to himself, beautifully captured. Hamlet's role on stage was more than any other actor in history, and Jacobi's affinity for the role is unsurprising. Film adaptation "of the stage play, with small special effects or unusual camera work, minimal sets and no musical accompaniment.This staging is based on the acting skills of the performers and the words of Shakespeare to evoke the emotions and the interest of the audience.And it works.The others Players are also top notch, especially Patrick Stewart's "Claudius" and Claire Bloom's "Gertrude." Together, the cast members form a seamless ensemble. <br /> <br /> The final (but by no means least) element that highlights this production is this It is presented here in its entirety, a rarity in the film, but strangely, I have never noticed the time, I was too busy learning history, and I suspect that you will.
