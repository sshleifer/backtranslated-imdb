... The reason why I like this movie so much is because of its spirit. It's a brilliant summer camp movie, so the jokes are not meant in a permanent way that makes a character the permanent butt of ridicule. There are pranks, but you get the feeling that the respective fall guys could look back and laugh because they were stupid enough to fall in love with the end! <br /> <br /> It's a special bonus if the ringmaster of all these funny japes is Bill Murray. For me he is still the comedic god without equal, if he has the chance to break free. No one is better at creating a sense of freed-up crazy anarchy without really hurting anyone. The sound of the entire film has the same style as its leading man, with a great opening scene showing Murray preparing for the day. Everything is stupid, yes, but more important than behaving like an adult, it's a lot of good-natured fun to have. "Meatballs" promises this and ultimately provides a nutritious watch.
