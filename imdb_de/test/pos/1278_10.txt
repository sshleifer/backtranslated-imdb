With the series of successful films by Christopher Nolan it's easy for me to see his filmography, see his debut film shot in black and white in England and take less than 70 minutes. It contains all the hallmarks that make him a filmmaker and storyteller have made. <br /> <br /> Although the film is short, he captivates himself with his intricate storyline, which you will guess because the premise does not even scratch the whole surface of this story, given the depth of the structure and characterization of the narrative pretty much is amazing. As I said, we follow a would-be writer named Bill (Jeremy Theobald), who begins a habitual obsession with random people he introduces on the street in a voyeuristic way, which could be thought of as research before he starts, to form his own rules, and break them. <br /> <br /> He meets the charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw), who turns out to be a robber with special sensations and modus operandi, and is soon thrilled to hang out with him, break in and enter and speculate about the Her victim's livelihood, as well as the persecution of a blonde femme fatale (Lucy Russell), a gangster bully who rejects any of his progress. <br /> <br /> Non-Linear With scenes that do not quite turn up at the beginning, the film is set up for several visits as you study how Nolan sustains that tension and fascination with you when the audience expects more and more want what is duly delivered. There are enough twists and turns that turn the movie into a dizzying crescendo, where loose ends begin to unite, and the brilliance of the star story begins to shine through. <br /> <br /> It's also amazing how, for the first time feature has seen cheap, that something as clever and sophisticated can be devised from his own experience of burglary, with Nolan involved in every phase of the production, from writing to filming, producing and governing, for a year he works on the project shoots can happen only on the weekend. I think this is an example of the modest roots of a successful filmmaker, inspiring and motivating new filmmakers. Now I wait patiently for Christopher Nolan's Inception, which will be released later this year, whose trailer is such an eye-catcher.
