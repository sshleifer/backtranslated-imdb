I will make it short. It was a pleasure to see. It might be more effective if the characters resembled their counterparts in real life, but apart from this little comment, I found the fantasy animal figures the most enjoyable. The visuals were the most impressive, except for the second-rate CG scenes that could have been omitted. I do not like computer-generated animations, they thwart the purpose of a biopic like this one. Look at it, you will appreciate it too!
