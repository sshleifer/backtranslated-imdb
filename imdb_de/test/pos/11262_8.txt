since I'm a high school student, I have to take a health class. This year is about drugs. We learn what harm they can cause a person. From what we talk about, I still believe and know that drugs can really mess up a person. Anyway, my teacher wanted us to see that. Of course, we moan and start to sleep, but like the rest of my class I really liked this movie. it was totally real and not covered in sugar at all. The characters were incredible and believable. Even the plot was extremely realistic and believable. What I really liked about this movie was the question of how the effects of drugs can affect a perpetrator and what consequences the person has. Everyone makes sure that nothing bad will happen to them. Well, let's get serious. Anything can happen in a small town, even with your best friend like Sam and Chris. This movie shows it. A person can really learn a lot from it. it was pretty effective.
