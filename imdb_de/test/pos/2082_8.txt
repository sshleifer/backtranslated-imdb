This is a great little movie full of interesting characters and situations. Although not in the same class as some of the more well-known films of its time, it is still extremely worth seeing and memorable. The scene in which Zachary Scott sits in a bus and happens to steal the fly-pin from the lapels of a cloak thrown over the seat next to him is terrific. It beautifully defines his character - a guy low enough to give a war veteran something of inestimable value to use as props in his various charades. He lies light as the situation demands, and fascinates the women in the Fenchurch household with his irresistible charm and that crazy smile. <br /> <br /> I can not wonder if this movie is useful for the success of Mildred Pierce. Scott and Bruce Bennett got together again, and Faye Emerson looks like Joan Crawford with her facial bone structure and big eyes. Also, the Mona Freeman character is not unlike the vile Veda in Mildred Pierce. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous commentary that the end of the film was pat, with the easy fall over a cliff for Ronnie Mason, "Zachary Scott's figure." In one of the last scenes, we also see that Mona Freeman is reunited with her boyfriend, whom she previously disdained for the older, sleeker Zachary Scott, and I think the script should have demanded that she be punished for her behavior and her cruelty towards her sister, rather than as one typical youthful episode, but these are minor flaws in an otherwise beautiful and well-made film.
