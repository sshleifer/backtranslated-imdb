I just saw Mar Ardentro and had the feeling that I had to comment on this film. Euthanasia is a difficult topic in every area and unfortunately can distort the true value of a movie. Many people have been impressed by the outstanding cast and the beautiful pictures and the camera work. Javier Bardem is certainly an actor who gives each film something special. To say he owns the real Sampredo is a bit stupid, as I do not think any of the reviewers knew Sampredo personally. To lay still and use a certain charm is an acting skill that, while well executed, does not represent "perfect" performance. Bardem just does what he does well ... and that's it. The camera work is beautiful and awakens feelings and perspectives that the film itself can not deliver. Sampredo is portrayed here as a man who gives himself up so much to dying that he leaves behind his loving family and marries a woman he seeks only when the other does not help him in his quest for a dignified death. Now I am not here to say something about the right or against euthanasia. The problem is that you can hardly escape the commentary on films. The theme of the film is so strong that you are almost forced to discuss the film in this strong topic. I find it a weakness for the movie - Sampredo is unintentionally portrayed as an unsympathetic character. Someone who is much smarter than his family, as portrayed in the simple cousin who does not "get" the double poem directed at him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because HE believes his life is unworthy. A scene juxtaposed with the lawyer who, according to the film, makes the "wrong" decision and ends up in a state of dementia, indicating that Sampredo's decision was the right one. The woman who is constantly looking for him is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer, but suddenly she is married to Sampredo when she is ready to help him dying. These choices make Sampredo a calculated figure, no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. Arguably, I would say that it can not fully convince, and I somehow think that Amenabar did not intend to include this unbalanced element in his film. For a young director, it is still an impressive movie, and it certainly has strong moments (for example, the discussion between the priest and Sampredo). The camera work is impressive and the movie is well played. But 10 out of 10 ... no, the movie does not reach that excellence.
