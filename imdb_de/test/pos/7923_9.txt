ALEXANDER NEVSKY is a great movie. The film opens a window to a world and culture that most Americans will never get to know. Much has been said and written concerning the film's sparsely veiled patriotism in the face of the upcoming war with the German Nazis. <br /> <br /> By American standards, acting is a bit stilted. The script contains only a few words and a lot of picture and action. And while the action gets tiring, the visual elements are often breathtaking. The direction is incredible. <br /> <br /> On another note, fans of Ralph Bakshi animation may find that he has stolen many of his images for WIZARDS directly from a copy of ALEXANDER NEVSKY.
