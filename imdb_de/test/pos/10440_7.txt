Reality in front of reality TV? Copy of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"? A forerunner of "Say Anything," who is a little sweeter? I can not decide, but the soundtrack * is * the 80s - Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie AND U2 - I can not believe it, they would never bring all these genres together in a teenage movie of today. <br /> <br /> I remembered it as a teenager - mainly at the sex parts and not a hint of altruism. Why? I was a horny teenager in the 80s. If I look at it again, I just can not describe how much I love that Rose, played by Kimberly Richardson, is the voice of "Pepper Ann" in the 90s. She was almost 30 years old when she was in Last American Virgin. In addition to playing 16-year-olds - fantastic! Complete cheese, reality, fantasy and comedy - with a sincere cherry.
