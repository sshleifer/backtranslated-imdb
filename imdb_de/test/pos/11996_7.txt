Caddyshack 2 has a terrible reputation just because it's a sequel to a high class classic. People have criticized the movie for many reasons, but in the end they are all referring to the fact that this is not Caddyshack. I'd start by saying that we should just take caddyshack out of the equation. Consider this movie as its own merit, but I think that would be unfair. The film has a lot in common with its predecessor. The class-centric themes of "Snobs vs. Slobs" and the desire to fit a class above your own are just as prevalent here as in the first film. The two things that are really missing here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, each replaced by Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason. Now I do not want to say that Ackroyd comes close to Murray's movie, but Jackie Mason is an admirable follower of Dangerfield. He comes as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, without biting too much. I would not say that he is almost as funny as Dangerfield in Caddyshack, but there is much more sense to his character and dilemma in the movie. <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase just bangs and a handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Maybe these special naysayers did not realize that he appeared in the first movie only a few times. For my money, his scenes are much funnier here, if a little over the top. <br /> <br /> When I'm into the subject, it's really the overriding of this movie that stops it. When trying to laugh, it seems a lot more self-confident. Many of the jokes are laborious and there is way too much of the gopher who seems to have adopted a much more anthropomorphic personality and voice just in case we did not understand the idea that it should be funny. <Br /> <br /> Characters are similarly hammered home, especially the smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason seldom misses a beat and is consistently sympathetic and very funny, but we did not need the tango sequence at all! The director is obviously not the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue with something to say about class and identity, which only a few films said at the time. Do not let the frighteningly low rating of IMDb put you off, see for yourself.
