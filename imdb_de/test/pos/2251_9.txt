Excellency seems rare in Hollwood today. Many hold only two of the best picture nominees of the year for the film industry. And in "Everything is Illuminated" the brand is hit directly. <br /> <br /> The film begins its brilliance with the beautiful scenery scenario. From the beginning, you get a sense of warmth and true family relationships and relationships between the two. And the cast is introduced perfectly. Elijah Wood's character Jonathon expresses his sensitivity by holding the dying grandmother by the hand. And for the character titled Alex, it's easy to see his life in perspective - the true Ukrainian rock star. After the cast was first lit, the story slowly springs to mind as Jonathon ventures into the Ukraine to meet the woman who is believed to be able to save his grandfather and thus the entire family. And from there, the story-films moved slowly, but they moved at a brisk pace in front of the contrast between dripping drama and loud humor, scene by scene in each scene. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself is rather award-winning, there are several complaints from other sources that tell about the inaccurate adaptation of the novel Jonathon Safron Foer by Liev Schrieber. Personally, I never read the novel. But every film, especially this film, should not be judged by whether the storyboard of the film fits the book's plot, but how the movie's main concepts are expressed and used by the film. Just because it's far-fetched by the novel does not mean that this movie is no longer a must-it still is. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, new information is slowly flooding the mind of the audience. Some of these thoughts are never answered; In fact, the second half of the film focuses its entire theme and the reason for its journey through Ukraine on something quite similar to the film's original intentions. However, the movie leaves you satisfied - but for the weak souls a crack can fall. And throughout the movie. For the meek, healthy-minded people, Alex and John may need to have fun and constant conversation. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to several different types of people: those who like movies, the common movies have the genre of drama comedy, those who are interested in family relationships, and those who are interested in Holocaustic topics. And for the crazy people who find slapstick as a weird comedy, this movie is not for you. And for you who believe that this is a really funny and absolutely awesome funny movie, you are wrong. This movie shares funny moments and dramatic sequences. And for those who judge a movie on the basis of its likelihood based on the novel, you may enjoy this movie or not. However, this film should be taken for much more than for the film. <br /> <All in all, "Everything is Illuminated" is an ingenious work that will enlighten the hearts of every human being.
