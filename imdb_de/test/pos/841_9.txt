"Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable," the third in the series, is a great piece of pulp. Closer in tone and exposed to a violent Nikkatsu red chick than other Scorpion submissions, it is breathtakingly photographed, directed with free enthusiasm, and populated with a rogue gallery of villains and degenerates. Shinya Ito, the director of the first installment, returns for this surreal fable that begins with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting off a policeman she is tied to and fleeing into the Tokyo subway, her arm still ringing swinging from her wrist. She seeks refuge in a red-light district where she befriends a prostitute first seen when she had incestuous traffic with her brother (which eventually impregnates her). Scorpion's desire to protect this unfortunate woman finally reveals her identity and hell breaks loose. She is beaten, sexually assaulted and locked in a bizarre birdcage in the rogue's chamber. I loved everything about this hypnotic, nihilistic and emotionally touching movie. It's the boss of the first three Scorpion movies and shows one great scene after another. I can not recommend it enough.
