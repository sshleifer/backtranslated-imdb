In the veins of Jeepers Creepers and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Monster Man is surprisingly well-done - if pointless - little horror. Take a little buddy comedy, beautiful blood and fierce fear. It's hard to say that Monster Man is really entertaining. The low budget seems pretty obvious, but it does not affect the overall presentation of the movie in general, and it does embarrass another big budget horror movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is a bit generic. Friends Adam (Eric Jungman) and Harley (Justin Urich) drive across the field to interrupt the wedding of a woman Adam has always loved. While Adam is a more nerdy type, Harley is a self-proclaimed female and very offensive bigmouth. After adding a bonus to the plot, they hired a sexy hitchhiker, Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things become a nightmare when a monster truck with a scary face pursues them. When the corpse starts counting, they must risk the race against the time before their own lives. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be reminiscent of many well-known horror films, but Michael Davis as a writer and director is successfully holding the suspense. The fear is well enough built up where characterization is never the best, but pretty okay. The script was also littered with comedies that are suitable for the fun moments and they are more pleasant than annoying and also wait for the turn in the finale. It's funny and shocking at the same time, which is pretty amusing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Monster Man is surprisingly entertaining. It deserves more attention on the big screen. This proves that the big budget does not produce an effective horror movie, but the ability does it! Something the director has shown and delivered.
