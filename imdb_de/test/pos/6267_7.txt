A very sweet movie about a young Chinese enthusiastic about Western technology and an Englishman trying to make his fortune with films in China. It's a very interesting story, probably based on true events, though I assume it's more fantasy than reality. It has fairy-tale quality rarely seen in real life, and it also credits 8 people for the script, so they've got to think it all the way to the left and to the left that conveys to people who have never seen it before how magical the movie was. It is not a particularly deep film that briefly goes into the loss of tradition and invasion of Western culture, but is mainly a pleasant little film. It's actually a movie that I really enjoyed and that disappears from my head 15 minutes after it has been recognized. Light as a souffl√©, but I enjoyed every minute.
