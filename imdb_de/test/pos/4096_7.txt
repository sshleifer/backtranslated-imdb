This version of "The Lost Horizon" is actually not a bad movie. I think the problem is that people like to play musicals, especially those from the 70s. I watched the movie in 1973 when it was originally released (I was ten) and I loved it, especially the music. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good and technically it is outstanding. Sure, there are one or two pretty stupid dance numbers, but hey, you can not win them all. I have this movie on video and see it from time to time ... and I enjoy it every time!
