Shadows breathe the smell of New York's streets like no movie before. This upbeat of Cassavetes' directorial work is as atmospheric as it is political, and the first spark for a renewal of American cinema. Perhaps this is the occasion to see Cassavete's first work in a double film with another debut, Godards B bout de souffl√©. Both films shaped the film production of their countries for decades and both exhale an unusual lightness and serenity, which was rarely reached by the filmmakers in their career. Shadow tells the story of three African-American siblings, Ben (Ben Carruthers), Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) and Hugh (Hugh Hurd). The story takes place in the New York jazz scene and the driving rhythms on the soundtrack play a major role in the feverish, sometimes almost dreamlike atmosphere that permeates the entire movie. Not much happens in the storyline. The everyday life of the three siblings is defined by problems in the love relationship or at work, but on both levels the normality deceives. Without moralizing gestures, Cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion in public and private life. In terms of the cinematic portrayal of racism, it was a breakthrough film in the US. <br /> <br /> This film also owes much to the imagination of the three leading actors, who were almost completely unknown. Above all, Ben Carruthers, with his energetic portrayal, established the image of a new self-image of young urban blacks in America, which characterizes the films of Spike Lee from the 80s and 90s. Surprisingly, none of these three undeniably talented actors could start a great career afterwards. Hollywood was and is not prepared to build its star system ethnically, which is why Goldoni, Hurd and Carruthers later found only small artistic niches on television and in independent films. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Shadows is one of the less "beautiful" movies ever made, and one of the finest at the same time; a film of shadows and spaces, with a camera just watching the flow of life in the crowded street corners, bars, hotel lobbies, and apartments, creating a fascinating ramble through the bustling streets of New York City.
