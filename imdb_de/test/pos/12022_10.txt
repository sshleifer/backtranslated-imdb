When commenting on this film, one has to recognize that it is based on a true story and must therefore be checked for the quality and accuracy of the presentation of the events as well as the entertainment value. It may not be plausible that Jack Shepherd should surrender to Jack Wild twice because Wild captured Edgeworth Bess. Nevertheless, it happened. It should also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced, which explains why he relied on proven techniques. There were times when Clavell did not have the self-confidence to follow the script as written. The movie would be better if he had done it. And yes, I had a copy of the script (Stanley Baker's copy - one in five) that I recently returned to my father, the writer Rafe Newhouse.
