I found this movie extremely adorable. I'm biased, I think. I like Kathy Bates. I found her singing an additional pleasure. She has a very nice voice. <br/> <br/> Ms. Bates plays Grace Beasley The film takes you from her Doledrums marriage in Chicago to England, home of her recently murdered singing idol Victor Fox. There she meets his three surviving sisters. She also discovers that Victor leaves a male lover, Dirk Simpson. <br /> The story leads you to some surprisingly funny and heartwarming situations in which Grace and Dirk develop a true fondness after an initial, rather rude rejection of each other. They return to Chicago, where they team up with Grace's poodle-sized, witty daughter-in-law Maudie to find the serial killer who murdered Victor. Everyone in the picture did a good job. Julie Andrews, Lynn Redgrave and Barry Manilow especially liked it. This movie was fun. It makes you cry. The music is absolutely charming. <br /> <br /> Other posters here that have found problems with any part of this movie just have no idea. <br /> <br />
