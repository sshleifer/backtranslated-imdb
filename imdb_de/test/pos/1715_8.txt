One of the most successful shows in TV history is back. Now I admit that I never came to the original show ... Okay, so I did not see her at all. But the new show is impressive. <br /> <br /> Sci-Fi premiered the first two episodes "Rose" and "The End of the World" this weekend. We meet Rose, a twenty-year-old employee hunted by remote-controlled mannequins. She is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself a doctor. Through the internet, she finds a conspirator warning her that the doctor's death is following where the doctor goes. When her geeky friend Mickey is replaced by a cheater, the doctor informs her of a plan to use the earth as a breeding ground for another of those plastic monsters the doctor has fought in space and time as he fights in a 50-year Tardis was traveling -Style police call box. <br /> <br /> She helps him save the world - otherwise there would be no show - and decides to join him. But if he puts their lives at risk, he is desperate and wonders if the risk to his company was worth it. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are a bit lame and some scenes are a bit choppy, "Doctor Who" is a clever, well written work (after two episodes aired in the US). Apparently the second season has already aired in the UK, so I can expect the same success here.
