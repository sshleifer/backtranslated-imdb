It is important, and rightly enough, to think that by the time this short was being produced there was a state of war between the United States and the Japanese Empire. Add to that the tremendous will that the beginning of the war has created, as well as the Bataan death march and other incidents, and the only thing surprising about this short film and others is that it no longer existed. Another thing: My only problem with this short form is that it seems like it's funny, but it's not. I'm not sure that anyone connected with it really tried to make the jokes run, or even cared. It would have been much better if they had done what Disney did with Education For Death and it was meant to be absolutely serious. But these shorts gets a bad name and should not be judged out of context. At that time, times were different and that is an important consideration. Anyone who uses energy to save the world from a sixty-year-old cartoon has to step back. Like me, spend energy to defend the same cartoon. This should be available to interested parties, even if they are not widespread. Not a nice cartoon, but sometimes life is not pretty. Recommended
