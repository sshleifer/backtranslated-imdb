This is the first of Ma and Pa Kettle. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in everything she does. It's funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the old lady on the train. God was ALWAYS old; She was in "Desk Set" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents". Her new house is also a co-star here - it's the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa does not care about. LOVE the paint mist. Keep an eye on TOM ... he played in "Nanny & the Professor". Unfortunately, he died really young ... strangely, his last role was in the series "Death Cruise". strange. Directed by Charles Lamont, who not only did some of the Kettle movies, he also made a series of Abbott and Costello films, so he must have known a thing or two about the comedy. Fun story, simple, simple humor. Even the release date was the April Fool's Day of 1949. The story begins with showing how backward and rural they are (the neighbors are even Indians), but as the story progresses, we have sympathy and respect for them.
