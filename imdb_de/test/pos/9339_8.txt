I'm not particularly interested in Michael Jackson. Apart from being a pedophile, I really do not like his music, except for a few songs from his milestone album THRILLER. This is one of them. I like this video because it's one of the first and most important music videos. <br /> <br /> This was led by John Landis, best known to the horror fan as director of AN American WEREWOLF IN London. This music video is less a music video than a short horror movie. M. J. and his date are in a werewolf movie. When they leave the film, they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies as Michael Jackson dances his famous "thriller". <br /> <br /> You know, this is a pretty good song with good synthetic beats. This and "Beat It" are probably the only two Michael Jackson songs I can ever tolerate. I love Vincent Cay's Came as a narrator. His distinctive voice is perfect for a horror music video. Even if you like the music of M.J. do not like, you have to watch this video at least once. By the way, he was good before he became a scary white woman with a fake nose.
