This is probably the best movie by Clint Eastwood. Here the action is minimal, but with a lot of good action. A Yankee soldier Eastwood is wounded and taken away by the female students and teachers at a school in the south where he is hid and cared for. Soon after his recovery, all the ladies wanted to have fun with him, and some of them were successful, including the director of the school (Geraldine Page). Erotic scenes come until the ladies find out that their "macho" has been shared by several. They got angry and poisoned him in a farewell dinner. Although Geraldine Page was a bit older, she was able to play a very suggestive role as director of the school, a woman with more failures than a happy life.
