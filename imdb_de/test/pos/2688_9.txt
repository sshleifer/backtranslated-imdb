I think the problem with this show, that she does not get the respect she really deserves, is that she comes to Seinfeld, to ELR and to friends. These three sitcoms were the stars of their time. <br /> <br /> KOQs came on TV at the end of this special time. <br /> <br /> But do not be dissuaded. <br /> <br /> King of Queens is just as good, if not better than two of the three mentioned. <br /> <br /> Seinfeld Started everything and was and is a timeless classic. I have never laughed so much as at Seinfeld. But KOQs are very close. <br /> <br /> When it comes to laughter, I just have to rank KOQs second only to Seinfeld. ELR, however, must come second because character creation and interaction is more endearing. <br /> <br /> KOQs is definitely the top ten of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The only other sitcom value Let us now mention Two and a Half Men, who really does not bring the other four a candle, but all we have left.
