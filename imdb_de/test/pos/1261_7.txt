For many of us, this streak was the introduction to the work of K Gordon Murray. That's because it was easy to find. It was on every public domain label of the VHS era, and before that was a late night t.v. Cult classic, double knee thigh racquet. HOW do you oppose the title? <br /> <br /> For late arriving visitors a brief explanation of their merit: Florida Wheeler dealer K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films, translated them into English and then made a mint They were at the driveway. The Mexican ORIGINALS were funny enough in the beginning; American borders and accepted horror film conventions have been cheerfully disregarded. Great, great set design and lighting were placed alongside weird or ridiculous special effects. NOTHING in Hollywood was as close as this, and weird. Now there are mixed Catholic conventions and Mexican folklore, and we are no longer in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Add the english scripts to THIS, into which they were transferred. Most were written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted the movements of the performers' movements to match the lips on the screen, not the literal translation. As a result, the American soundtracks tended to be overhauled to the right. There's even a fan site for Murray that delivers the best results for every movie. First-time viewers complain about the tempo, the violet prose, the production values ​​and say it is SUPPORTED to be like that. Meanwhile, people laugh with joy at things that are usually considered deadly film mistakes. It all has to be very confusing if you do not like it. <br /> <br /> This film was made in 1957 with the two previous films in the series; THE AZTEC MUMMY and the CURSE OF THE AZTEC MUMMY. All three are now available on the 3-Disc AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) and it's time. On one side is the K Gordon Murray version, on the other side the original Mexican production. The contrast between the two is fascinating. Mostly the original Spanish is not much healthier. <br /> <br /> ROBOT / MUMMY starts with a nice long flashback that invites you to the last episodes, the continuity windows in number two, so to speak, and from there it goes downhill, logically. You do not even get The Angel back or a mention of him in this last episode. Names, places, even family trees alternate between films. After a while you start to look for continuity changes. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the series villain Doc Krupp is completely crazy and nearly drooling on dementia and STILL wants to steal the Aztec Breastplate. Rosita Arenas is sent back into the past with another beautiful cut of the AZTEC MUMMY Floor Show and wanders into the dark in her nightgown to help find the damn breastplate again. The mummy is not happier when he was the last time. <br /> <br /> The robot actually has a production credit. It was from 'Viana & Co S.A.' I mention this because it looks like the handles are being formed between the slow afternoons when the actual costume was on foot. No. <br /> <br /> That was PLANNED. <br /> <br /> Wait until you see the controller from which it is running. X-Box, where were you when Krupp needed you ??? The robot LOOKS was squeezed to death in the end, but actually came back in two other Mexican films. He had a FAN BASE. Sit back and enjoy it.
