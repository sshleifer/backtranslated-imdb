Of all 48 films by Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" is widely considered one of her finest. What we see is something special: once the storyline has its own value, it offers far more than just a cheap vehicle for BB's sexually charged appearance. <br /> <br /> This film is your true and well-functioning film. a light comedy with a good and consistent story. It is located in French government circles in the late fifties and maintains from start to finish. Lots of amusing twists and slapstick play - all played by at least three main actors, including Bardot. <br /> <br /> "Une Parisienne" (= French for "female resident of Paris") focuses on telling a story that Brigitte Bardot does not show. Brigitte serves the plot very well, using her talent for light comedy. <br /> <br /> If you settle down on your couch tired and tired of a slave week on a Friday night, just turn on "Une Parisienne". In this movie you feel better.
