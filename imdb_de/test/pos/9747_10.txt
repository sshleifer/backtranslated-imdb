The standard carrier of all film series, the definitely good guy - Flash Gordon - against Bad Guy - Ming the Merciless. Although the special effects seem terrible by today's standards, they were first class for 1936. But the essence of the story is the fight between the Earthman Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) and Mongo's Emporer Ming (Charles Middleton). Crabbe and Middleton are great in their parts. And the minor characters, the Dale Arden, dr. Zarkov, Princess Aura, Prince Barin, Vulcan and the rest are all very good. This series is far superior to the 1980 movie, essentially because Crabbe is far superior to Sam J. Jones as Flash Gordon. This series is the standard for all film series. No question.
