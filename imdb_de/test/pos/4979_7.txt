John Parrish is a former union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to Wilkison's in Anchor. The problem is that the price offered is too low. When Parrish and his workers are abused, the heart changes, especially when things change brutally. <br /> Originally, after seeing this one, I had a feeling of frustration, mainly because of the actors involved. If you saw Edward G. Robinson, Glenn Ford, and Barbara Stanwyck in the same movie, you hope they get a story and a script that sets them apart. Unfortunately, they do not have a chance to produce a Western classic that has earned multiple re-runs, or is my over-high expectations a poor service? Well, I slept on it and decided to keep thinking about the picture. I think it's right to say that the actors in question deserve a better story to work from. It is, when all is said and done, a conspiracy that has been milked for everything it's worth, and then more. But The Violent Men is still a very worthwhile movie, despite the missed opportunities that arise in production. Glenn Ford as Parrish is as cool as the nose of an Eskimo and it's always nice to see Babs Stanwyck playing a slut because she can do it well. While Eddie G, when one gets used to being in a western, it is good in an underlined part. Robinson, who was injured in the first election as Lee Wilkison, Broderick Crawford, the first choice, is the one who is the least changed by the creators, even supportive characters like the devilish Wade Matlock (a grinning joy of the Trusted) Richard Jaeckel} and Judith Wilkison {radiant Dianne Foster} have something to leave an impression. But what it is, Robinson's crutch flinging "bad" guy is at least memorable for the right reasons. <br /> <br /> Not shy of action and weaponry, it's with the twists and turns that are almost Shakespearean tragedies, the Rudolph The film of Maté rises above the mundane, and the film is magnificently framed by Burnett Guffey's breathtaking cinematography. Lone Pine in Alabama has been used for many Western images (see Seven Men From Now for another glorious use), but this is where Guffey really convinces and manages to blind his eyes every time he turns. The Violent Men is not a great western image, and perhaps a better director than Maté Donald Hamilton's novel The Big Country would have given an adaptation that he can be proud of. But for every Niggle and Irr I personally had with them, I found two more reasons to really like it, so it's really commendable. 10.7
