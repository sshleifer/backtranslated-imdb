After a decade of turbulent unrest, American films began to shift gears, turning their cameras from war-torn battlefields, political corruption, and general social unrest into the more intimate world of familial dysfunction. The tribute paid by the selfish baby boomers against the American family when they grew up and had children of their own made itself felt. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs. Kramer" is one of the first of these malfunctioning family dramas that continued to be so popular in the eighties, and it's one of the best. It's going to be a pretty crappy rap because he's known as the movie that beat "Apocalypse Now" for the Best Picture Academy Award in 1979, but comparing those two films is like comparing a banana to a marinated chicken breast: same, but can not we both enjoy? Director and author Robert Benton does not try to do anything special about his film. His strength lies in his performances, notably by Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, who play a divorced couple who are childishly and selfishly battling for their son. The scene in the courtroom, in which they custody, and in which everyone has to hurt the other in a terrible way, is devastating and feels authentic. The film does not present Hoffman's solid father as a hero or Streep's stray mother as a villain. They are neither good nor bad as humans - they are just bad to be married. <br /> <br /> The film is racy in the finale, but not in a manipulative way. It deserves its right to evoke sobs. <br /> <br /> Note: A
