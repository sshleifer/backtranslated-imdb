The Thing is a milestone in filmmaking and remains one of my favorite films of all time. Despite the film's science fiction roots, it is ultimately a horror film that brilliantly blends splatter with psychological trauma. Today, more than twenty-five years after its release, the special effects are an example of pure brilliance and effects. Rob Bottin suffered a complete physical collapse for his art. It would be impossible to shoot the same movie today because the studio would most certainly insist on occupying a female character or a Paul Walker type. <br /> <br /> An all-male American science team in Antarctica will be in turmoil when an alien life form that can perfectly absorb and imitate other life forms invades its camp. Their trust in each other is steadily decaying as they become increasingly insecure about who is real and who is an imitation, and in this scenario of the "body catcher" their numbers will vanish as one by one, they will fall victim to the thing. When cornered, it manifests as another nightmarish creature, the metamorphosis is always terrible and captivating. The helplessness, isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men who have no way out of their situation and no way out to help them is expertly sustainable. The long hours of darkness and the increasing snowfall form a gloomy backdrop for the terror that unfolds. Director John Carpenter has chosen a team of brilliant character actors with great care, and each member of the team fits perfectly into the role it plays, be it the young and street cook, the elderly and wise doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter pilot. The point is that nobody here is almost a pure American badass superhero with blond curls and a six-pack, and the real strength of the film is not least due to the extreme realism. The people who suffer on the screen are recognizable in our daily lives. <br /> <br /> The Thing remains consistently pleasing and influential even after repeated considerations. I have seen the film on more than twenty different occasions now, and my astonishment at the quality of the direction, acting and special effects is unshakeable. My friend prefers the high school spin-off of the film - The Faculty - which offers good and solid entertainment but is far more carefree and whistful. She still loves and acknowledges the brilliance of The Thing, and thank God for that ... Because I could not stay in the company of someone who did not love this movie. <br /> <br /> A classic and then something.
