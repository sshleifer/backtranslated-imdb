This is a beautiful story with beautiful music, a lot of dancing, a lot of interaction between big and small sisters (almost everything positive) and many wishes. There are fun moments that older children and adults will enjoy, such as when King Randolph exclaims: "They are just SHOES, are not they?" And tender moments when Princess Genevieve comforts her youngest sister Lacey after a mistake. <br /> <br /> The animation may not be as good as Disney, but it's still very good. The facial expressions are differentiated, especially for Genevieve, King Randolph, Duchess Rowena and her servant, Derek the Cobbler and the little Princess Lacey. My only criticisms of the animation are the dance sequences in which the dancing princesses become absolute carbon copies, without the slightest deviation - even the three youngest copy the dance steps perfectly. I would have liked to see some more individuality in dancing, considering that these girls are not professional ballerinas or chorus dancers hurting them. Guards are treated violently in the story, and the villainous villain is common to other animals in the story. <br /> <br /> My 4 year old daughter loves this movie and has seen it repeatedly and again and again. I found it quite acceptable for her to see it.
