I only bought this movie to see Bam because I really loved it, but after seeing that, I do not like it very much. I mean, his acting was good and I guess, but whenever it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes, I just said, "Okay, we know you're a professional skateboarder, can we go back to Ryan Dunn now?" Dunn, Rake and Brandon really shot the movie from my perspective. <br /> <br /> I noticed that Jenn Rivell (obviously) and Missy Rothstein were both in Haggard, but who met Bam at the time? Anyway, I really enjoyed Haggard and I think it's really like no other movie I've ever seen. It's somehow in its own category.
