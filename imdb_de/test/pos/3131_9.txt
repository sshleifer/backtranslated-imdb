It was recorded that John Ford made the "big blockbuster" movies so he could afford to do the "little" movies he loved so well. Wagon Master with a young Ben Johnson is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his little films. The filming locations, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the involvement of the Indian Plains are all trademarks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the influence of the great Russian director can be seen in this film. The side cast of Ward Bond, Russell Simpson and Jane Darwell is outstanding, as are the many small character actors Ford uses, including his brother (the drummer). While Ben Johnson won a well deserved side Oscar for The Last Picture Show, his co-star Harry Carey, Jr. was not reaching those heights. Although his father Carey Senior became a leading Western man in Ford's early films, Carey Jr. spent most of his career in supporting roles. For fans of John Ford and for fans of Western films, this is a must.
