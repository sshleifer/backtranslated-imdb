In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean, this romantic love story moves across the screen in epic proportions that correspond to the desert regions in which it is located. It is a film that provides that one does not choose love, but that love makes the decision, no matter who, where or when; and besides, it is a matter of the heart that often depends on prevailing conditions and circumstances. And so is the situation in "The English Patient" by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most unfavorable places and times and prove that love, if predestined, will find a way. <br /> <br /> It's World War II. The Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) flies over the African desert, his biplane is considered an enemy aircraft. And though he survives the crash, he is badly burned. Fortunately, he is rescued by a nomadic tribe and ends up in the hospital. However, the existing conditions are determined by the war conditions and Almasy will soon be one of many patients who will be transported by convoy to another facility. After arriving in Italy, he is too weak and sick to keep going, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers to stay with him in a deserted monastery. Hana discovers this soon is something of a man of mystery as Almasy remembers nothing of his past and not even his own name. It is believed that these are Englishmen, the only clues as to who he is are contained in a book that was in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as Hana's patient. Slowly, however, after being asked by Hana, Almasy begins to remember parts of his life, and his story begins to unfold. His memory is further enhanced by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he was looking for - a man with whom he wants to settle a bill. But burned beyond recognition, Almasy might or may not be that man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue to emerge; Memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) - as well as memories of Katherine's husband Geoffrey (Colin Firth). And crippled in thought and body as he is, these memories become the only thing he can cling to with all hope, even if his life seems to slip on with every passing moment. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the script for this film, which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaatje. The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's "Doctor Zhivago" and "Lawrence of Arabia". A great movie that fills the screen and senses with unprecedented size and beauty. Put simply, Minghella's film is ingeniously realized; Made and delivered with a poetic perfection, it looks like bringing a Monet to life. From the opening pictures, Minghella mesmerizes the audience, who is binding and transporting, with a story that has an emotional beauty that resembles the fascinating and vivid images that bring John Seale's remarkable cinematography to life; Images that fill the screen virtually, as well as the soul of the beholder. In every way, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a remarkable emotional ability that allows a truly transcendental experience. Nominated in twelve categories, he was awarded nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography. <br /> <br /> If one had to choose a single word describing the "essence" of this film, it would be "excellence". Even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine Oscars without extraordinary achievements. and the performances of Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas transcend the term "Oscar worthy". Nominated as Best Actor for Almasy's presentation (Geoffrey Rush was awarded the gold for "Shine"), Fiennes has never been better off than before. He achieved with his character an emotional depth that is almost tangible. Private and introspective, Almasy is not inherently an individual to whom the public can connect intimately. Fiennes, however, finds a way to open this emotional door in such a way that you are let in so that you taste the honest passion that rises in it. And it works. Almasy does not seek your friendship; He will, however, gain your compassion. <br /> <br /> Also, Kristen Scott Thomas received an Academy AwardÂ® nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the award for "Fargo") for her portrayal of Katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance hides the furious emotional in her Conflict, born of the forbidden passion that she enslaves and to which she voluntarily surrenders, by rejecting her fetters of oppression, to embrace a love so strong that she threatens to engulf her. The reserve that Katherine must maintain evokes the audience's empathy, as Scott Thomas successfully breaks down the emotional depth of her character with the greatest possible impact. It's the kind of performance that attracts you and keeps you going fast. It takes you beyond the curtain of hypocrisy, which prescribes what needs to be, if only for the sake of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion. Unobtrusive and subtly shaded, it's a great work by Kristin Scott Thomas. Binoche offers an impressive, influencing performance as well as the kindhearted nurse Hana; In fact, it is their humanity that defines love in the purest sense and offers a balanced perspective in the context of the film. Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) gives us an insight into another kind of passion that effectively stands out against the intensity of Almasy and Katherine. "The English Patient" is a movie that moves you and emotionally fills you. one that you do not want to end. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
