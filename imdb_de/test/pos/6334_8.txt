This is a good episode, but it is not my favorite. Many people love it and on a creative level it is brilliant. Most of the episode has no dialogue, which is a cool idea and "Hush" can handle the silence well. In addition, this episode presents tare, which I like very much. But I do not like Riely or the initiative or Maggie Walsh and they seem to have a lot of time on "Hush". Besides, I do not think the gentlemen are so scary, and I tire of watching the floating around Sunnydale. I know that I'm in the minority, but I tend to rush parts of "Hush" fast. Of course, there are other parts of the episode that I think are great. So if you are watching DVD, I recommend you watch this episode. It is really a classic. <br /> <br /> "Hush" is about the whole city losing its voices. Skeletal-looking demons called gentlemen arrive to collect seven human victims, but when they hear a human scream, they die. So they steal the voices of everyone in the city. Buffy and the scoobies are trying to figure out what's going on, while the initiatives are also starting to investigate. In the meantime, Xander realizes what Anya means to him, and Willow meets another witch named Tara. Buffy and Riely finally face each other in the fight against the gentlemen. They are both amazed at what they learn ... He is a Commander and she is the Huntress. In the end, Buffy saves the day, but now she has to deal with her new knowledge of Riley's secret life. <br /> <br /> The creativity of "Hush" really can not be seen in a basic outline of her life plot. It's the overwhelming silence of the episode that makes her so great. The characters try to communicate in different ways (white-out boards, pantomime, obscene finger gestures, etc.) and everything works really well. After a while, you forget that there is no dialogue, because they are all so good at expressing themselves. During the "talking" parts of the episode there is much evidence of how important it really is to "hear". Anya claims that Xander does not really talk to her. Giles ignores the protests of Spike and Xander and insists that Spike move into Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly replaces the word "petroleum" for "patrolling" when she talks to Riely so she does not have to explain her vocation. And in the end, when Buffy and Riely really get the truth from each other, they sit there and have nothing to say. It's all pretty cool. <br /> <br /> This episode has many good parts. I love that people keep forgetting that they can not speak. Buffy and Xander both try to use the phone. Riley can not use the speech recognition feature in the elevator of the Initatives. People are trying to scream. It's basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no language. And I think it's funny that Spike has to move in with Xander. (They also share a flat for the seventh season.) Xander and Spike have a funny teething troubles that is just funny. I also like the beginning of Tara and Willow's relationship. Tara plays an important role in the rest of the show and she and Willow are pretty cute together. It is nice to see how they have just started. <br /> <br /> To the detriment, I do not understand how the gentlemen select their victims. They just seem to float in dormitories and pick random people. I do not like Riely either. I never liked him, but from "Hush" I'm just waiting for Angel to come back to town and beat him up. After all, what happens to Olivia afterwards? It seems we've just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything is going well ... and then she suddenly fell. I do not get it. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the episode: Giles "Who are the gentlemen?" Lecture in front of the scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful and his heads are just funny. In Season 7's "First Date", he does some similar looking flashcards. Almost always when Giles draws monsters, it's just fun.
