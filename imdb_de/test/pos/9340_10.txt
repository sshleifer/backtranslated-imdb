Before this clip, music videos should show only one artist. Michael Jackson's "Thriller" has created a whole new section of music videos that can be described as mini-movies. "Thriller" follows a couple as they travel from a movie to the girl's house. Along the way, they encounter zombies announced by the immortal Vincent Price. My favorite part is where the zombies rush onto the couple and the girl turns around to see that Michael has become one of them. Then they dance a bit. The scariest thing about "Thriller" is perhaps the fact that it's more fun and fun than many movies that are made. After twenty years it remains the first music video. <br /> <br /> P.S. My Music Video Top 5: 5 - Madonna "Like a Prayer" 4 - Guns N 'Roses "Sweet Kid of Me" 3 - Nine Inch Nails "Closer" 2 - Peter Gabriel "Sledgehammer" 1 - Michael Jackson - "Thriller"
