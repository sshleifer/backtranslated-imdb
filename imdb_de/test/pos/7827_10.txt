When I saw this show on Australian television for the first time in the late 1990s, I ignored it because it was using the Kevin Costner movie "Bodyguard" just for itself. But then I caught an episode and wished I had seen it from the beginning. The partnership between Sean Pertwee and Louise Lombard had worked so well and the structure of each episode was extremely entertaining. It was not an over-the-top TV program that could be said to have spent the most energy making things explode, so they could put that clip on the spot to entice the audience and then deliver it on no other level , The show dealt with the lives of the two main characters and that made it interesting. The stories for each episode were also well written with interesting guest stars who were good actors. And of course there was a lot of action and intrigue, which is always good. But the great thing was that there was humor, and of course it flowed from the characters, it did not seem invented. It was British, but in a good way, and if this show was made in America, it would no doubt appear on DVD now. I do not know why British TV production companies are not interested in releasing this show on DVD. It was a great show and deserves a DVD release.
