The Pickle was the most underrated film of the decade. Despite my efforts at home, it is still seen as a bad movie. I say to hell with everyone here. Everyone does not understand that it's partly a comedy that has a dramatic twist in the end. Danny Aiello plays a burnt-out director with perfection and imparts a sad, depressed man. The scene in which he tries to record a final message is pretty good. The interludes of Stone's movie are absolutely funny. "That's Harry Stone and today I'm going to be a man!" All in all a nice and unfortunately misunderstood movie. Plus a great cameo from Little Richard. Hilarious! I hope more people will see this movie because 202 people are not enough for a consensus. <br /> <br /> -Silence Dogood
