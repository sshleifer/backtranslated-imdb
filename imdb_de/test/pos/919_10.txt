I use IMDB very often. I mainly read other people's comments about movies that I have seen or not seen. I thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and how I look like a movie. I think I've seen it at least a dozen times since fall 94 when I saw it for the first time in the theater. <br /> <br /> I think Kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time. And I think that's his best. It was his last. I was very sad the day I knew he died, because we certainly did not have a chance to get anything more from him. If you have not seen it yet, then look for it !!! If so, just come back! <br /> <br /> Red: just a masterpiece. please forgive my poor english! reader
