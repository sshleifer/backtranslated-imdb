Adam (Eric Jungmann) and the hideous best friend Harley (Justin Urich) drive cross country to the wedding. On the way they take sexy hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks) with them. Then, for no reason, a monster truck tries to run them off the street ... and maybe kill them. Who does that and why? <br /> <br /> Pretty good horror movie. It's energetic and full of eye-catching directions that get you right into the action. It's also a horror comedy. Most of the humor is infantile and REALLY crude, but actually a bit funny. This film sometimes stacks correctly - but that's a good thing! Acting is alright - Jungmann exaggerates his nerd role a bit. Urich clings to the hopeless role of the evil-minded, sex-obsessed best friend - but pulls it off; Brooks is good too in a limited role. <br /> <br /> BUT I could see that the "end" ends long before it happened, and in the end the logic completely disappears (especially the rescue). Nevertheless, this is a bloody, sometimes funny and sometimes scary horror movie. I give a 7.
