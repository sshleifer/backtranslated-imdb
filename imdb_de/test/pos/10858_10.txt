I think Andrew Davies has done a wonderful job recording a great book that mimics the tempo and design of a Victorian novel, making it a moving and entertaining film. I'm glad I read the book first (twice), which is usually the case with me. I know that you have to consider a novel and a movie as different media and judge accordingly. Nevertheless, it is often difficult to read the original material after a movie has given away the best parts. <br /> <br /> I realize that Davies is a very good adapter, but I wish the producers had selected a woman to write the script. Davies, he admits in the commentary accompanying the film on DVD, specifically wanted to highlight the skatological aspects of the book. I certainly enjoyed these, both in the movie and in the book. But Davies missed half a dozen moments that were so painfully tender and painful that he could have put them in if his sensibility had been more feminine. <br /> <br /> I would also grapple with his use of the book's main symbol, the rose. <br /> <br /> As the script was planned by Davies, the resolution was inevitable and appropriate. But I really think that the last nod of the author Waters on the rose symbol was much more interesting. And I preferred how the novel Nan "got old" when Davies chose it. <br /> <br /> A short commentary on the four actors who perform the lead roles. They are all wonderfully talented - except maybe for singing and dancing - and besides, their physical notions are what the spiritual eye sees when they read the novel before they see the movie. I loved them all. <br /> <br /> I recommend every lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction to put both the book and the DVD of TIPPING THE VELVET on the bookshelf.
