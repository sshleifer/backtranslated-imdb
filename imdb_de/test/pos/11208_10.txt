Hysterically painful; maybe the kind of movie Chekhov would have made if he made films. What's really funny is that the two cousins ​​have so much in common (many descriptions of their relationship on this page are absolutely wrong). Make yourself talk to each other - or to anyone else! It is terrible. If you've ever been too shy, worried, self-involved, or just afraid to talk to someone (and who has not?), You'll definitely see yourself in this movie. And it will not be pretty. <br /> <br /> It holds a mirror to the audience and says, "If you do not like what you see, change it".
