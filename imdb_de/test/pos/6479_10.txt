You do not have to be a Notre Dame football fan to enjoy this because I'm not, but as a football fan in general, it was fun to see it. It almost makes me a struggling Irish devotee. If you can not deal with emotions in this movie, with or without lattice, you should better check your heart rate, as this is an emotional movie with some very touching scenes. <br /> <br /> As a sports fan I loved to watch the classic recordings of previous college games. At that time, they had some pretty wild pieces with many sides. They scored the footage while Pat O'Brien was shown as head coach Knute Rockne on the sideline and some of the players like George Gipp (Ronald Reagan). <br /> <br /> Reagan gets a pretty good score in this movie, but his part is really not that big. O'Brien is the only actor who plays a big role here. The rest - all play nice characters - include Gale Page as Rockne's wife "Bonnie". Donald Crisp as the "Father John Callahan" of Notre Dame; Albert Bassermann as Chemistry Professor "Father Nieuwland" and Reagan as Gipp, perhaps the most talented and famous player of Notre Dame of all time. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie good is the balance between personal history and football. None of the angles is exaggerated. The characters here are all people you can apply for, as there are no villains. On my last look, it was interesting to discover Johnny Sheffield - Tarzan's son - who played Rockne at the age of seven, and George Reeves, Superman of TV, as one of the players. <br /> <br /> For some reason there are very few football films in Hollywood and only a few good ones. This is one of them.
