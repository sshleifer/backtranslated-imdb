I have been a fan of Rachael since the beginning of 30MM in the Food Network and have seen her grow over the years. The moment I saw her interacting with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen because I saw Oprah being taken with her, and with good reason: she seems very natural and ready to go beyond herself laugh, which is very captivating. The set is appealing and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan the audience is sitting on). There is just enough of a celebrity segment, and she keeps away from controversy and debate (there's plenty of that in daily TV). The show is a carefree escape, and she has not turned away from her power (cooking), which is a very good plan. I know there are people who hate them and hate their show. that's alright, you can not please everyone. And somehow I think Rachael knows that and accepts it. So just turn the channel; I do not think she would mind.
