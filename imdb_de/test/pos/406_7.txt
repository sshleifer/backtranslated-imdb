It takes a lot of patience to get through a movie with such flat and out-of-the-box singers that one wonders what the hustle and bustle was when WHISTLING IN THE DARK made such an enthusiastic greeting to the audience in the 1940s In addition to a few weak inliners and ordinary sight worms, the storyline is as far-fetched as the stories told by The Fox (Red Skelton) to its radio audience. You have to wonder why someone might think he could find a real solution on how to make the perfect crime and get away with it. But so unrealistic is the comedy. <br /> <br /> But if you're a true Red Skelton fan and catch a glimpse of how comedies developed in the '40s, then you can at least enjoy the lovable cast supporting him. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Gray do it as a love interest and Conrad Veidt makes as always an interesting villain. One of his more amusing moments is his reaction to Skelton, who explains the secrets of wearing turbans. "I never knew that," he muses, impressed by a small dot that is cleverly introduced. <br /> <br /> All in all a typical nonsense where you accept the lack of credibility and the gags are just so accepting. Not always easy for the discerning observer, as many of them just go flat, as many comedies of that era do, because the novelty of sight gaggers and monliners has simply waned.
