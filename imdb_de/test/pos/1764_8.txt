Like all first films, this "movie" is very, very short and takes about a minute! Therefore, due to its brevity, it is not really possible to compare it to more modern films. But for his time it is indeed a very remarkable movie. Much of this is because the prints were hand-painted, so Annabelle appears red and in other colors in her amazing dance. I actually saw two different versions - one that turns red and one that changes color. I think the red movie shown on the DVD "The Great Train Robbery and Other Primary Works" is the best of them. The dance itself is very hypnotic and resembles an amazing piece of performance art. And unlike other one-minute (or less) movies of the day, I've been able to see this movie over and over again - it's just as visually pleasing and weird is a 36-second version on Google Video (enter "Serpentine Dance").
