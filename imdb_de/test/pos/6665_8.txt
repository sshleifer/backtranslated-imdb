I really enjoyed it both times when I saw it. And both times I went away thinking a lot about the "moral of the story". I agree with another reviewer that the film does not focus on the sci-fi aspects that you might expect from an alien-on-earth movie, but that it's the human condition. The characters in psychiatry give a great insight into how they and hopelessness become hope. This film has a touch of sadness to humor, sympathy for the finale "Is he or is he not". This last question has been well-handled, and though some feel that you do not know what will happen in the end and the question goes unanswered, I feel that it is being done in much greater detail than anything else, such as the feature film Ronin ( with Robert De Niro), where you never know what's in the box, and feel very frustrated. I highly recommend K-PAX. 8.10
