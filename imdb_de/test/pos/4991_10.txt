I am very impressed by the acting in Comanche Moon. Before I started to look at it, I did not expect it to be as good as Lonesome Dove. I could not believe how well the actors were chosen to portray all the characters. I was very impressed by how well they played each role! I think that was almost as good as Lonesome Dove. It's hard to compare every movie with Lonesome Dove. If you do not make that comparison, I'll hold my thumb up. It was very entertaining! I do not write many comments on this page, but I just felt like I got my opinion. Amazing! I do not want to call every actor who is brilliant because I would probably have to list each one individually. My favorite was Steve Zahn. He hit the nail on the head and played Captain Gus. His mannerisms were perfect.
