I think this movie is underestimated. For me it was like a sip of fresh air. Some people complain about the implausibility of the plot, overly lengthy sequences and the lack of sex (the latter is, I think, the main reason for "implausibility" and why are there no drunken teenagers talking dirty ?!) But it just is not their cause and good for them if they can not relate to the story. The performances are great. I would really like to see more actors in other films. The emotions are real. The whole unrequited love thing is presented with uncanny subtlety. And it gives you the tingling sensation that you expect from a good movie.
