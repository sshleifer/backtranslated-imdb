Not many people seem to know about this movie. What a pity, because I think it's pretty good. Sure, sometimes it's a bit cheesy and can have a predictable storyline. But the presentation of the film is pretty well done. I think the casting is good with sympathetic actors / characters. Tom Selleck plays a good baseball player (suppose I do not think so) and Ken Takakura (from Black Rain) plays the boss (the coach of the Japanese baseball team). There is not too much to complain about. It's just a light, easy-going, happy comedy, and I recommend it.
