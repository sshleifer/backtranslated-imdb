Amazing, one of my favorite movies at the bottom. I guess I can be proud that I do not like what the "general population" wants more. Jackie Mason is weird in this movie, as is Randy Quaid. I can never get enough of his "strong arm" tactics, just like in Moving. He was also notable in National Lampoon's Christmas vacation. I love this guy.
