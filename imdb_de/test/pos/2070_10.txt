1. I have seen Branagh's Hamlet: Branagh is too old, often speaks in a high voice (involuntarily funny!) - no convincing Hamlet and the qualities of his directors - poor! (See also much ado about Branagh - the funny parts of the dialogues were mostly cut out, without mentioning the mistakes of the directors in the dialogues!) 2. I saw Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is an interesting idea - but such lousy actors - all 3rd Orson Welles Hamlet is fine - but this BBC Hamlet is the best! Derec Jacobi is convincing - looks a bit crazy - very suitable! and Patric Stewart - wonderful and Claire Bloom is a very attractive queen. They believe these actors what they say - I think that's the best compliment.
