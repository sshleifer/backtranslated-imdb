I saw this movie a few months ago on a big screen. I did not know what to expect, and in the first ten minutes I was afraid that I would not like this movie. It started very slowly, in silence and almost banal, which was all the less exciting when the sound was pretty bad and the subtitles were sometimes unreadable. <br /> <br /> But I do not regret watching it. It's one of the most beautiful Bergman films I've ever seen, simultaneously human, ruthless and psychologically so convincing. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen actors so wonderful with such intensity on their faces: the interpretation of Liv Ullman is unforgettable and Sydow is also excellent. <br /> <br /> In Bergman films, there is always psychological violence, and this is possibly the most physically violent of all. The tense relationships between the man and the woman develop in parallel with the physical violence that surrounds them ... <br /> <br /> Finally, this sober, violent and powerful film has a surprisingly striking depth. An excellent Bergman. <br /> <br />
