I saw this movie at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything Is Illuminated is the directorial debut of actor Liev Schreiber. Schreiber also wrote the screenplay. In the film, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) obsessively collects items from his family, from toothbrushes, to mounts, to scraps of paper, which he seals in Ziploc bags and pins on a wall in his home to record his family history. But the space for his grandfather is remarkably empty. All Jonathan really has from him is a piece of jewelry and an old photograph of him with a woman who hid him from the Nazis during the Second World War. Jonathan decides to do a quest in Ukraine to find the woman, thank her, and learn more about his grandfather. <br /> <br /> His search is supported by some characters who run a tourist business for Jewish people. These include a young man obsessed with Western culture (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Leskin), who thinks he is blind and who may have memories and demons from the war, and his grandfather's spirited eyesight. <br /> <br /> The script effectively combines humor and drama as the three characters travel around the country in search of Jonathan's grandfather's city, pushing ever deeper into the memories of the past. The best performance probably comes from Eugene Hutz, who plays Alex Jr., who starts the movie as a tracksuit, break-dance slackers to have fun, but develops into something more, because not only Jonathan, but all the characters get their own lighting Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood and Eugene Hutz participated in the screening and did a very humorous Q & A after the film: <br /> <br /> - Scribe was very close to his grandfather An immigrant from Ukraine who died in 1993 , This caused him to write to put his memories on paper. Meanwhile, he was asked to read a reading of Foer's short story The Very Rigid Search, which was an excerpt from the unpublished novel. Schreiber was overwhelmed with the quality of the writing and said Foer had done 15 pages, which Schreiber tried in 107. Schreiber turned to Foer and they talked about their grandfathers, culture, movies, and the nature of short-term memory America; In the end Foer agreed to have Schreiber adapt the book. <br /> <br /> - Schreiber's own project should be a road movie, but the book has a parallel narrative that is an envisaged chronological history of the city of Trochenbrod that spans over 500 years; Given his budget and his limitations as a filmmaker, he said he would leave the Milos Forman and make the road trip instead. This imaginary chronology inspired him to make the movie in the first place, the idea that "a lovingly imagined past was as precious as a past that was well remembered." <br /> <br /> - Schreiber said the movie was a series of lucky accidents. After unsuccessfully searching for an actor in Ukraine, he walked through the Lower East Side in New York when he saw a poster of a centaur standing high in the waist and sitting on it with an insane guy. Under the poster was the name Gogol Bordello Ukranian Punk Gypsy Band. Eugene Hutz then took over the story. He had never looked up to playing music was his first passion. One day a friend gave him the book, and he thought it was written as he writes music; Bolt sets / syntax, language is my own. Later, they received a call from a production company looking for Eastern European music that was medieval but modern. Hutz met with Schreiber, and he soon found out that the film was based on the book he happened to read. Not long after, Scribe Hutz asked what he thought about Alex and if he could make the character by accident. <br /> <br /> - Shortly thereafter, Foer and Schreiber spoke in the fall of 2001 about the film The events of September 11th. Both were in Europe at that time and they talked about the derogatory comments they heard about Americans. As a result, Schreiber wanted to find an American American who would defy the stereotype of Europeans over Americans. Someone who was awkward, vulnerable, flawed and innocent looking for history beyond the borders of his own country. Scribe began to think about who that was, and Elijah came to it. <br /> <br /> One of the inspirations of Schreiber as a filmmaker is Emir Kusturica (I think he said that he also directed another movie in another festival film, All, the Invisible Children), who said "You They are not looking for the actors, they are looking for the people. " Schreiber said that there is something Elijah is convinced he has a generosity of mind and a sincere goodness as a human being who came up in the film. Schreiber said that the eyes are important in trying to articulate a figure who is an observer, and that when "eyes are the doors to the soul, they are Elijah's garage doors." <br /> <br /> - Elijah Wood enjoyed the similarities between his character Kevin in Sin City and Jonathan in this film, as they are both a kind of blank board on which emotions are projected. Wood replied that Jonathan may seem quiet and seemingly emotionless, but it's all about his observations, his experiences with other characters, and the environment in which he found himself. <br /> <br /> - Regarding the difference between directing and writing: Schreiber said that he writes a lot more and jokingly called the direction "hell". After his grandfather died, Schreiber began to think about how to maintain some historical awareness and self-preservation. is he content or not good at interpreting other people's work? He said he loved the exercise of finding out what is emotional and important to you.
