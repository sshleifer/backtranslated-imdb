Manna from heaven is heavenly. This is a movie for families - teens and grandparents can enjoy it together. It is not syrupy sweet or stupid. The characters are really "characters". The plot is a bit complex and you have to be careful, but it's like putting together a puzzle, because everything fits together bit by bit. The beginning of the period is like watching an old photo album or remembering when. It is very well done with very accurate hairstyles and costumes. The story moves fast with twists, turns and a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> A special treat is to watch the great cast of familiar faces that we have not seen in a long time. Part of the fun is to mentally recognize and name them when they appear, though this can be distracting. Cloris Leachman looks at the end of the film as if she had revised "Oprah". I've never seen Faye Grant in a movie - just as Grace's mom in the TV series "Saving Grace." She was great, even without the southern accent. And I did not even recognize Shelly Duvall. The five sisters who created this beautiful movie are a very talented quintet and Sister Theresa is a heavenly treasure.
