pretty good, do not expect anything high culture ... the acting is bad, the plot fails, but it is still a pretty nice movie. Why? because it's dark, a bit stupid, unpredictable and just entertaining and funny to watch. Do not expect anything, as I said before, just see it for yourself and you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> It's a movie with no plot or memorable acting, but there are enough scenes that make you laugh, cry, or at least feel compelled to see it through to the end ... <br /> <br /> That's all I wanted to say ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
