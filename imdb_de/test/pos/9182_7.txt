Will Smith is a great "Relationship Doctor" to heal all your relationship issues. <br /> <br /> I had expected this to be a standard RomCom that is not much fun. I am happy to report that I was wrong. Will Smith is adorable and unexpectedly "fresh" in this Andy Tennant vehicle. Surrounded by a great cast, an interesting story and a witty dialogue, I was thoroughly engaged. <br /> <br /> We found this cute, quirky and inspirational, without preaching. <br /> <br /> It rates a 7.4 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
