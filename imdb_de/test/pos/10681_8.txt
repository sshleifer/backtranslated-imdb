The journey to the other side of the sun is about discovering a planet on the other side of the Sun that has the same orbit as the Earth and has therefore been undetected until a spacecraft on the other side of the Sun photographs it. Of course, two astronauts (Roy Thinnes & Ian Hendry) are sent for reconnaissance, but due to a malfunction they crash and are on Earth only three weeks after their six-week journey. Of course, they are abused (at least Thinnes, Hendry is badly injured) and grilled and asked why they have withdrawn from their mission, but it is claimed that they have not done so. Until Thinnes seems to notice a few strange things when you're home again. This is excellent, if sometimes a bit chatty, and the sets and feel are not far from the "Thunderbirds" area, but will be actors for once. It's not a big "Star Wars" production, but calmer science fiction that you have to think about. It is worth seeing and it is criminal that the DVD is out of print. 8 out of 10.
