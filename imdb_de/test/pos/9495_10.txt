I loved this movie. She manages to sympathize with the characters (most of them) for the problems they have with their relationship. Gloria Swanson, as Leila, is in a dusty marriage to a husband barely noticing her presence (though he notices her absence). The film shows very well why she is tired of married life and why she is vulnerable to a good-natured cheater, without making herself selfish or demanding. Leila's reaction shots on her dining table anniversary while her workaholic husband eats salted spring onions before dinner and pushes bridal couples out of his plate are perfect. > <br /> The show is stolen by Elliott Dexter as Jim, Leila's careless husband, and easily stolen. After losing Leila to another man, Jim literally clears his deed, shaves off his mustache, tries to lose the middle-aged spread, and gets dressed neatly. At home, there are several settings of Jim who are lonely and think of Leila, including a powerful scene in which he finds one of her old clothes in the closet. The film offers the audience the advantage of seeing along with Leila Jim's transformation. Not only the exterior is more attractive. We learn a lot more about the kind of person Jim really is, and we see how different he is from Leila's second husband, Schuyler (Lew Cody). Dexter shines as before and after Jim, who, having discovered Schuyler's true character, is determined to regain Leila if he can. The film's most touching moment comes when Jim and Leila discover that they are under the mistletoe and Jim talks about what he has lost. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look.
