Like a very expensive Buffy episode with a lot of humor. Lots of wire and stunt kung fu. The Twins effect is on the list of classic HK movies. The vampires have a cool mix of hopping ghost-type and the handsome European-style boy. If you have the opportunity to see it in the theater, it is worth a 30 minute drive. Otherwise, buy the import DVD before someone messes it up by a bad dubbing.
