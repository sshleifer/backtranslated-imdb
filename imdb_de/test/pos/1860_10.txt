I think the reason why this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is in the many misconceptions of Darwin, Pro and Contra. I would say the real man is portrayed here without sterility. He is what he is. Although the film is only a snapshot of the man, the storytelling technique extended his life well beyond the years touched in the film. This is a profound movie, a reflection on modern life and the way we think, and can provoke a study of the man whose thoughts (and others who used him) have certainly influenced our lives. There are a few films whose historical context is so great that the main task of the actors is to get out of the way. The story bore the day and the actors did their work. Good job for her, I say.
