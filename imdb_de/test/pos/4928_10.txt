Tiny Toons is the first cartoon I saw as a kid, and I loved every minute of it. When I was four or five, my parents bought the video How I spent my vacation. I've watched it over and over again until I've rewritten every word. Well, a few days ago, my three year old cousin came by and I had to entertain him. I decided to show him this old relic of my childhood. I was new, he would laugh, but I was surprised how much I laughed. Like any movie or episode of Tiny Toons, the humor is more based on wackiness and slapstick humor and is hugely successful. Bugs, Babs, Plucky Duck, Maton Pig and Fifi endure all the amazing adventures of Bugs and Babs White Water Rafting. With some help from Superman, Plucky Duck and Maton, you go to the largest amusement park to just ride the monorail and Elmyra undertakes a weird search for cute kittens in a safari country. <br /> <br /> Some of the classic jokes of this Tiny Toon adventure are some of the best crazy comedies I've ever seen. My favorite gag had to be the monorail thing when Hamton and Plucky arrived, riding the monorail and leaving much to Plucky's dismay. No matter how old you are, you will cry to tears without having to deal with language and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiny Toons Adventures: How I spent my holidays. Cast members of: Charles Adler, Tress MacNeille, Joe Alaskey and Don Messick. <br /> <br /> 5 of 5 stars.
