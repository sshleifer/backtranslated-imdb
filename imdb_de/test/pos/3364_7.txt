The 70s are often regarded as the golden age of British television comedy. At this time there were numerous classic sitcoms as well as sketch shows like "Monty Python's Flying Circus". The epoch was, however, emphatically not a golden age of British film comedy, and what worked well on television was rarely successfully broadcast on the big screen. The most triumphal exceptions to this rule were provided by the Pythons, but their best films ("Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and "Life of Brian") differed substantially in conception from their television program. <br /> <br /> The main problem with adapting cinema sitcoms is that concepts developed for the BBC's 30-minute periods (25 minutes for ITVs that need space for commercials) are not always work so well when extended to a feature film three or four times as long. Few people will care about the movie versions of "Up Pompeii!" Recall. or "Steptoe and Son" with the same affection as the TV versions. Many classic TV comedy shows ("Some Mothers Make the Avenue," "Yes, Minister," "Fawlty Towers," "The Goodies") have made no attempt to even film them, for which we can be grateful. Characters like Michael Crawford's Frank Spencer or John Cleeses Basil Fawlty can be hilarious in half-hour doses, but I doubt they would be so funny for over two hours. A comedy program (though a dramatization of a comic novel instead of a sitcom in the normal sense) that could have worked in the movies was "The Fall and the Rise of Reginald Perrin," but the hopes for a movie became tragic Early feeling destroys the death of his star Leonard Rossiter. <br /> <br /> "Daddy's Army" was one of the few TV sitcoms of that time, which was turned into a decent movie. (About the only other one I can think of was "Porridge"). This may be because it had an unusually large number of well-developed characters and derived most of its humor from the interactions between them. The original sitcom ran between 1968 and 1977 and told of the failures of a prisoner train in the small coastal town of Walmington-on-Sea. (The Home Guard, originally known as Local Defense Volunteers, was an auxiliary militia during the Second World War, consisting mostly of men too old to serve in the regular forces). The movie version is a drama with three acts. Act I deals with the formation of the procession and the recruitment of its members. In the second act, they cause chaos during an army education. In the third act, they manage to capture a group of Nazi airmen whose plane was shot down. The three main actors in this drama are the commander of the train, Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe), and his two subordinates Sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier) and Corporal Jack Jones (Clive Dunn). Mainwaring, who is on-site in the civilian life of the bank manager, is a fussy little man who looks through the thick glasses in the world. He is the one who takes the initiative to form the unity of the Home Guard and appoints himself commander. He is pompous, insolent, with an exaggerated sense of his own importance and his own leadership, the kind of man who does not like fools. (And in George Mainwaring's world view, the term "fool" covers most of the rest of humanity). He does, however, have his good qualities. He is motivated by a genuine patriotic idealism and able to demonstrate great physical courage, as shown in the encounter with the Germans. Wilson is Mainwaring's deputy at the bank. The two men are very different in character, something highlighted by a different look, Wilson being tall and skinny while Mainwaring is short and strong. He looks smarter and more educated than his boss. (His accent indicates that he may be a former public student). Nevertheless, he played the second fiddle in both civilian and military life, probably because he has a passive personality that leads to pessimism and defeatism and the inability to take everything seriously. Jones is an old soldier who now runs the local butcher shop. (His promotion to the corporal is mainly based on his ability to bribe Mainwaring with black market sausages). His enthusiasm for his new role is matched only by his incompetence and his ability to cause chaos. Although his buzzword is "Do not panic!" He tends to panic at any given opportunity. <br /> <br /> Several other members of the train are being introduced. Private Fraser, the scathing Scottish Undertaker, is even more pessimistic than Wilson. (Keyword: "We are doomed, man, DOOMED!"). Private Godfrey is a gentle old man whose main concern is the whereabouts of the next toilet. Private Walker is a keen cockney spiv and Private Pike (another bank clerk) is the boy of the spoiled mummy. (Pike's mother is Wilson's lover, though Wilson tries to keep this connection secret from the disapproving Mainwaring). Two important outsiders are the mild Vicar and the ARP overseer, Mainwaring's despised enemy, and he is equally equal in pomp and stubbornness. Mainwaring allegedly refers to soldiers holding this rank, more than in the TV show, which was surprisingly free of allusions. (His creators, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, later created comedy shows like "Are You Served?" And "Hi-de-hi," infamous for suggestive humor). However, the film retains much of the mix of gentle wit, nostalgia and sharp characterization that have made the TV series so successful. 10.7
