I was five years old when the show debuted in 1958 and was a regular viewer at a later date. I remember that I really enjoyed the show, along with Leave It To Beaver, My Three Sons, Ozzie And Harriet, Dick Van Dyke, I Love Lucy, The Real McCoy ", etc. I am now enjoying the first season of" Donna Reed "on DVD and have watched the first two episodes. Donna Stone is a smart, good-natured, problem-solving, serene mother who stays home, much like June Cleaver and unlike Lucy Ricardo. In Episode 2, I particularly like how Mrs. Reed becomes a substitute father, who swaps her dress for sweats and boxing gloves while teaching her son how to physically resist a much larger tyrant. While none of the mothers in the neighborhood in which I grew up, including my own, fulfilled the idealistic standards of Mrs. Reed, it is refreshing that at the end of the day, good manners and intelligent decision-making predominate today's standards of vulgarity, egoism and the indifference among the neighbors. I can not imagine that Jeff and Mary Stone have learned from their parents that entering their neighbors' yards is okay, barking a dog outside all day is acceptable, or that their mother is being asked in one Supermarket in front of everyone to "shut up".
