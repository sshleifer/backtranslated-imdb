Latter days is the best Gay movie of the gay genre. Most movies have lush stories, one-night stalls, and may we forget not notorious baseball teams? In the last few days there is indeed male affection beyond the kiss in the dark, and quite graphic material that made me wonder if the movie belonged to blockbuster or to badpuppy.com. The movie's emotional journey is what sets the genre above the rest. It was only in this film that I saw a story of such intense passion and love and the torture he can bring. I think if people cry during movies, they should be beaten, but I cried in several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world we live in. I suggest to all gay men to watch this movie, and if you have a boyfriend, thank him ...
