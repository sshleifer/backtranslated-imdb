This unusual Troma movie is actually a very good movie. It is known for its epic and best and highest rated production. Her version of Shakespeare's game is extremely funny with the usual dose of Troma Nudity and Gore. Troma has done some very good gore movies, one of my favorites is "Street Trash" and of course the Toxic Avenger movies. I have a Troma movie, "Terror Firmer," which has the reputation of being the hottest and worst movie. I enjoyed "Tromeo and Juliet" so much that I finally have to see "Terror Firmer". This is a 2-disc collector version with four comments and many features. "Tromeo and Julia" is an absolute Huss and highly recommended.
