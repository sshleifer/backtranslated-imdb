Do not watch this movie during or shortly after dinner. <br /> <br /> Having said that, begging will stay with you for the rest of your life, whether you like it or not. Based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing more than a superhuman human (to formulate the title sequence / introduction), this will most likely include the most intense and cruel images you can ever see in a movie. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue, just picture by picture, describing the life cycle. The combination of strong black and white photography and really scary background noise makes the manufacturer's message home. <br /> <br /> The film begins with God (portrayed as a bandaged and obviously insane man), who opens his cuts torso with a razor and then dies in his own filth. After his death, Mother Nature emerges from his corpse to impregnate himself with blood and semen, giving birth to the human being represented by a maggot of a human cramp on earth. The landscape is a barren waste, populated by hulking hijacked humanoids, who eventually meet Mother Nature and humans. After a series of violent scenes depicting the rape of nature and the destruction of humans, these humanoids continue to knock the remnants of the bodies back into the ground, and the life cycle begins again. <br /> <br /> I actually rent them out of blockbuster one night, based on cover art and hype content, but this is definitely not a blockbuster movie. Do not expect a narration, dialogue or drawn strokes. This is an intense visual language based on a dark subject. <br /> <br /> I give this film some good grades for the filming and the sound, but I do not think I will watch it too often, if it is yet again. I like my movies dark and unique, but this is exponentially more than I expected.
