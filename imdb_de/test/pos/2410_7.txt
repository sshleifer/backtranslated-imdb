After a very disappointing third part, I wondered if I should even deal with The Next Karate Kid. Although I could understand why this saga was not continued, I enjoyed The Next Karate Kid most from the second and third Karate Kid movies. There are very unrealistic moments and situations, but it was very enjoyable and the story is catchy and warm. Hilary Swank, has this girl come far or what? She plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents in a car accident, and when Miaugi has "babysitting," he notes that she has karate skills. He offers her more lessons as she becomes more serious in life. Now, of course, there's the boy who likes her and the mean bullys that are quite similar to the first karate kid, but I would recommend this one. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> 7/10
