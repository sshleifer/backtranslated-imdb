I was ten years old when I saw Subspecies. I immediately had the sharpness for Michael Watson and Laura Tate. You really have great chemistry on the screen in the earlier parts of the movie. I ordered a copy from Full Moon in 1993 and I learned that: Ion and Rosa, the servants, play a much bigger role in the script than the king. What most people do not realize is that there should be an alternate sequence in the final scene: Michelle and Stefan are driven into a room, and Michelle has the idea that Stefan turns her into a vampire fighting Radu and Radu want their demonically controlled ex-friends. For some reason, however, this scenario never came before the camera. Another scene in the script, which can be confirmed by the original trailer, shows Stefan drinking blood from a wolf, or you can actually see him in the trailer with blood on his chin. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 9 because it's one from my childhood, and I have fond memories of the characters; Although my favorite characters were Stefan and Michelle, I think that Anders Hove's Radu is pure emotional acting, so much feeling in his work there.
