My favorite movie this year. Great characters and action, and the direction and the editing went smoothly, beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> In Barcelona, ​​the film plays one year in the life of six foreign students and several others. Cultures and languages ​​collide, but heart and life intertwine. The lead role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he performed the role perfectly. The characters were well developed and their interaction was honest and accurate. There were two particularly notable scenes, the climax was really inspired. The film is sentimental and the last ten minutes could have been cut, but it was wonderfully entertaining. <br /> <br /> I almost did not see it, but just to see Audrey Tautou. Although her role was second or third, she was of lesser importance and was surpassed by several other characters. I wish more films like this were done. It reminded of The Big Chill or The Breakfast Club. Do not start this movie too late if you want to go halfway to bed.
