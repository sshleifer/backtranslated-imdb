I've been waiting for this movie for so many years! The best part is that it suits my vision! This is a MUST for any Tenacious D or real Jack Black fan. It's just great to see JB, KG and Lee on the big screen! It's not a true story, but who cares? The D is the biggest band in the world! I had the soundtrack to the movie last week and listened to it without interruption. Watching the movie was a bliss for me and my husband. We met Jack and Kyle after two different Tenacious D concerts and also saw them touring with Weezer. We left the concert after the D was done playing. Nobody can beat their show! Long live the D !!! : D
