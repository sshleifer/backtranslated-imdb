The famed and mysterious hermit Raymar, a deadly telekinetic psychic vampire, dies abruptly under bizarre circumstances. Pretty pupil Julie Wells (a heartfelt and likeable performance by the enchanting Meg Tilly) absolutely wants to be accepted by the snobby clique The Sisters (played by Leslie Speights, Robin Evans and the ever-cuddly Elizabeth Daily). So she agrees to spend a night in a spooky mausoleum where Raymar's body was buried as part of an initiation rite. Of course, Raymar still has his extraordinary powers, so it will be a very long and harrowing night of pure nervous play for poor Julie. <br /> <br /> Director / co-writer Tom McLoughlin (who later gave us) the funny joker "Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason is alive") refrains from graphic attacks in favor of a brooding and eerie atmosphere, but fails this special achievement because the first lesson is far too slow, talkative, and too short to be uneventful, scary, or exciting. Nevertheless, I found this flawed horror movie still exciting and entertaining. The big poofy hairstyles, a silly music montage sequence, badly timed fake fear (including the ubiquitous hand on the shoulder gag!), A scene in a glittering video arcade, kids chuckling happily, and the funny stupid teenage slang ("Nerdle Brain"). !?) give this picture a certain charming rustic 80s charm. Hal Trussell's fine-looking, sophisticated cinematography (I've dug out the smooth moving steadicam tracking shots, in particular), Bob Summers' creepy but unconventional Hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, and Tom Burman's gorgeous, gruesome f / x make-up everything. "Batman," the ever-firm Adam West of TV, only takes up space in a not insignificant part. The mausoleum is an impressively large and disturbing main location. The grand finale, with a bunch of gruesome, rotting corpses gushing and floating from their coffins, is considered a wonderfully macabre shock. Sure, this baby is definitely not an unjustified gemstone, but it still delivers a lot of pleasant stupid and distracting cheese fun.
