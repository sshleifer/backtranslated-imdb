<br /> <br /> my favorite sci-fi, incredible drive through mistrust and distortion of reality. Probably the best performance I have ever seen. Incredibly original with interesting character developments and a story that turns and rotates so fast that it takes a few minutes for the movie to fully capture its genius. It's even more fun to see it all again.
