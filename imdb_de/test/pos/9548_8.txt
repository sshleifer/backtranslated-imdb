I saw the film in Izmir as the final film of the Izmir Film Festival. I did not know anything about it, but right now I'm glad I did not decline the chance to see Ding-a-Ling-less! It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and believe me I've seen millions of movies !! (I'm a film critic!) Clever scripts and dialogues ... Intelligent details ... What else can I say? An indie masterpiece with a unique sense of humor ... you can not wonder what he's capable of at the moment. Ding-a-Ling less was shot five years ago, and I'm sure that director Onur Tukel is now more mature. I've heard that his next movie will be a political satire, and I really can not wait to see that in his earlier works, like "House of Pancakes" ...
