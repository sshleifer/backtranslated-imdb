I try to watch this movie every time it is shown on TV, which luckily happens frequently. But I keep forgetting to film it. I know the script practically by heart, but that does not stop me from having a good cry. In fact, it probably helps if I know what's next. It's such a nice movie - well done, well staffed, good photography. I love it. One of my top ten films.
