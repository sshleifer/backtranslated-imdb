Love is hard to find in this fast-food society we live in. The man named Hitch makes it a duty to help men find love with women they fall in love with forever. His rules say that he only helps to find love, and not just occasional sex that seems to be very much. Soon, the word starts to turn around, and people get a wrong idea of ​​what he does, which makes the relationship with the woman difficult. I have just met that he is in love with him immortal. <br /> <br /> - I have to say, it's really nice to see Will Smith in a movie where he's not trying to save the world from aliens or robots. There are no chin-stopper effects and he does not show his souped-up body either. He's just a normal person in this movie, which was really nice. He does not necessarily stretch his theatrical muscles in this movie, but the story does not require it, but it was still nice when he looked relaxed and did not flaunt his torn body to make those of us jealous without six packs. Like all his characters, his character is likable, witty and very charming, which almost all the characters in this strange love story seem to share. The Kevin James character is just a normal guy who needs help in connecting with the girl of his dreams, which really makes you feel like a man and root for him every step of the way. The only character that hurt me a lot was the Mendez character, because she is so cold and so calculated that it's hard to believe that Smith could fall in love with her. He has to love a challenge, I think. <br /> <br /> - now this is the part of the review where I make a joke about how I would never need Hitch because I'm such a player, but I'm just so by writing about 16 reviews for another website and I'm still working on a small project, so I'm a little jaded now. Filled with enough charm and sympathetic characters, the film slowly and confidently falls into the sea of ​​romantic movies, where after the big scene where the terrible secret comes out, everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before. But hey, there are over 4000 films about the underdog overcoming adversity, so I think another movie with a predictable ending that's almost done to death does not do much damage. I also really like the message of the film, because in the end you do not need a formula to get the right girl. Just be yourself and everything will come into play, which is the theme of the movie and why it works so well. I'm sure if the James character turned out to make the girl pursue everything the Smith character said, it would have been a pretty empty movie, but it looks like it works really well , <br /> <br /> Although predictable, this is a PERFECT date movie. It's cute, it's funny and it's romantic, so anyone watching this movie on a date should get some of it after it's over. and with some I mean sex
