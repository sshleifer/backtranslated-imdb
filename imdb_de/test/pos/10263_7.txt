Dr. Sayer (Philippe Leroy), a wealthy doctor with psychological problems regarding the opposite sex, abducts an employee, Maria (Dagmar Lassander), a liberal-minded, free-thinking woman who believes that men are the "fixed" rather than women. Sayer retreats to his palatial estate, leading Maria through a humiliating series of mind games, threatening to harass and kill her. Sayer's desire seems to be to control her body, mind and soul, to make her a sexual slave, to obey his commands and to adhere to every wish and every mood. After resistance, Maria gradually gives way to his goal, but has her own plans. She says that she wants to help Sayer abandon his sadistic behavior towards women so that he can love such desires and not suffer. It seems that Sayer has them under control and agrees to some rather embarrassing scenarios (such as lotioning his toes, "loving" himself with an inflatable doll, which is a renewal of himself, often spending time upstairs) without, and even getting hosed, as she hits him hard in the face and brings blood out of her nose, which is almost broke, but something happens when the agitated doctor falls in love with Maria and through a desperate attempt, the Madness to finish, Maria gains the upper hand and plays with Sayer's desire for her body. <br /> <br /> Rather a fight of the will, a kind of sexual war, in which it seems as if one were responsible, if the Others actually have the upper one's hand. "Through a large part of the film, Sayer abuses Maria and forces her (it seems) to submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature His home is such a well-designed fortress. It is a typical European Art Deco palace designed and orchestrated by a man who has considered this weekend retreat a certain spell. Walls and doors open to his command, leaving an area for his "victims" under Quarantine). But when Maria seems to have taken a bottle of tablets because she longs for his hands, the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him. He thinks he actually desires her and Maria uses this to her advantage. She's playing hard when Sayer wants to hug and devastate her (and I could understand his frustration because she has that fascination that can drive a man crazy). <I had the feeling the film work was ultimately a rallying cry for women, their empowerment and rebellion against men who have the idea that they should always be in control, both sexually and mentally. The "turn" makes this ideal final. I could not swallow Sayer's fate for his rigorous cardiovascular activity and training regime. We see him developing his well-trained athletic figure, and how this regime is part of the normal routine every weekend before the real brain games begin with his victim. If he is so fit and spends so much time developing for the extracurricular activities that follow his regime, how could he end up suffering the fate that ends when the deal with Mary ends, when she stops to resist his progress? <br /> <br /> Maria, he would later admit, is the first one he has actually kidnapped; Others from the past, callgirls, were paid for their services so that Sayer could feel the power to control a woman, even if it was a fictional charade, that of a deeply troubled person with the inability to relate to the opposite sex to connect was evoked. The spontaneous decision to jump from the norm costs him more than he could ever know. <br /> <br /> All these psycho-sexual subtexts are pretty intriguing, but Dagmar Lassander, such a delicious sex kitten, was my reason to enjoy it that way. Without her, I would not have liked her so much because she is vital as a victim. Perhaps the highlight of the film, the delicious dance as Lassander, dressed in gauze (!), Unravels the wardrobe that exposes her breasts to a jazzy score. This is the sexually seductive moment that waters the mouth and sweats the forehead. Dagmar Lassander must have been a pleasure for fashion designers because she wears these clothes so well would define her career ... even if the film is not known (.. I found it by word of mouth). The provocative nature of the script and the daring themes may not appeal to particular crowds, as it deals with sex (and pain) in many different forms, the dialogue is very illustrative and detailed. Sometimes I could not help but giggle over Sayer's comments on a jailed Maria, how he enjoys letting women suffer, and the thrill he gets to force her into a sort of slavery (... in the attempt It all feels pretty hokey, but Dagmar is the real reason to see it, and the film works best for me as a fetish film, a possible male fantasy with this seemingly primitive and right-wing idealist captured and held against her will, forced into a precarious situation, her fate may be at the mercy of a complex and potentially dangerous masochist, her submission and how she reacts to her aggressive behavior with her (..there are times when she has a wavering desire decides to embrace him, to reveal a possible attraction to him that in itself might scare some) the most intriguing Highlights of this utilization function. My other favorite scene is next to the dance, the piano concert with Sayer, who caresses Maria while she plays a soothing melody.
