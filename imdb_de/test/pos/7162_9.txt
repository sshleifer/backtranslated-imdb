When I switched from film to film at the SXSW Film Festival, this film from the opening night stayed with me. Curious, because it is a dark comedy with an absurdistic premise. A family of extremely stressed fundamentalists in a small community of similar minds is being changed by a car accident. Three of the four have the same near-death experience in which they are fully open, each receiving a reversal of the concept of original sin (I will not spoil the scene with the details). The fourth, a middle school cheerleader, is not only the only physically injured but unchanged, and now bears witness to her crazy, apparently mentally bankrupt family. Every new moment brings with it a new outrage, as they have become innocently naked and open in every way. I have ever seen a song to Sarah Brightman's song "Deliver Me" that now brings tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> The cast is terrific. Robertson Dean as father, Vince Pavia as son and Aviva as cheerleading daughter are excellent, Mari Blackwell plays Peggy, the questioning neighbor and best friend of the mother. Everyone in Central America knows a Peggy). And Theresa Willis lights up positively as Betty, the mother. There are many risks that are taken by the actors of the three changed characters, and these risks are paying off. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie gets a big release - if so, I plan to see it again /> <br /> Very close check at: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/ forgiving.htm
