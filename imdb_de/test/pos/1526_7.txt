The good news: The director is reportedly committed to the cause of Amnesty International and wants to send a clear message about freedom of expression and the evil of oppression. The plot is uniquely original and the actors are two of my absolute favorites. The not so good news: "Original" is not for everyone when it comes to movies or video rentals to visit. Known critics such as Mr. Maltin and Roger Ebert have rejected the film as a truly failed attempt to turn a play into a cinematic form. If I recall correctly, the title is taken from the fairy tale that Stowe wrote and that made her a potential subversive and suspicious person in the fictitious place where the story takes place. Their dreams are dangerous to the government, represented here by Rickman as an intense, manipulative interrogator. Since these two people are virtually the only ones to appear in the film as a whole, the director has a real challenge to get the viewer's attention. In the end, I found the whole thing fascinating. Not immaculate and definitely not for everyone, but worthwhile. It's far from being a masterpiece like Kieslowski's "A Short Film About Killing" or as "dead man walking." But if you are interested in these films or one of the political thrillers of Costa Gavras, you may also appreciate it. Just do not expect exaggerated sermons or action-packed sequences.
