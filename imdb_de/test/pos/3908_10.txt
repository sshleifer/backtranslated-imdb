This excellent film starring Elizabeth Montgomery is long overdue for DVD release. The same applies to her earlier, equally excellent film A Case of Rape. I can only hope that my comments lead to BOTH Elizabeth Montgomery movies being placed on a DVD to be shared with many fans. Unfortunately, I think that the role of this great actress was stereotyped by her role in Bewitched, so she did not have any serious acting roles. I'm confident that if these two films, perhaps even a trilogy with The Legend of Lizzie Borden, were released in DVD form, their fans would set the record for how much they value their serious acting skills.
