For fans of Chris Farley this is probably his best movie. David Spade plays the perfect cynical, sarcastic Yin to Farley's "Baby Huey" Yang. In his monologues, Farley achieves comic genius beats, such as the bit "Let's say you drive down the street with your family ...", the "yo-yo, the idiot circus boy with a pretty recent pet" (his potential sale)) "Speech" or the brake pad "Glue-Sniffing Guarantee Fairy". The juicy moments in the film are in sharp contrast to the phenomena of Farley and Spade. Even after many visits, it's still fun to see Farley pouring everything he had into the role. "Richard, what happens to me?!?!"
