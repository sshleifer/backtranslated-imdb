Asterix and the Vikings is the first animated Asterix movie for over 12 years since 1994 "Asterix conquers America". It also has the honor of being the first digitally colored Asterix animation that makes the largely entertaining story far more stunning. <br /> <br /> Each scene in this movie is vividly rendered in bright, cheerful tones closely related to the color schemes of the comic books on which it is based. The character designs also stay relatively close to the comic, to the good or to the bad, while preserving the characters' simple yet unique look. The drawing design is simple and allows more time and effort for the actual animation, which by the way trumps many other big movies. Character movements are very fluent and have a quality that goes far beyond what a modest budget would normally bring. There is always something going on in every scene, and there is no indication of the usual cost reductions for animations. 3D computer images fit seamlessly into traditionally animated 2D art. The shading makes the 3D elements look more like traditional cartoon images than CGI models. <br /> <br /> The plot takes most of its elements from the comic "Asterix and the Normans" where the main flaw lies. As an adaptation to this comic "Asterix and the Vikings" takes far too much freedom with his source material. For a long time, fans of the comic would undoubtedly find much dislike for the story of the film and its lack of adherence to the source. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this story can be considered a really funny story in itself, without comparing it to the source material. Highly comedic, well-written jokes maintain the opening script. The funniest parts were the numerous pop culture references and jibes in 21st century modern life. Mobile communications, the shopping channel, commercial airlines and even sports cars are very effectively faked. Outstanding chemistry and acting in the cast (I've seen that in English, by the way), though a few voices like Cacofonix were really irritating (but I think that's all part of his character). <br /> <br /> If there's something to criticize about the story, it's the lack of "asterisks". This story seems to be more about Justforkix 'story of youth romanticism and "growing up," with Asterix and Obelix playing minor roles. This gives a rather big sense of vagueness, as many elements of the story are the usual staple foods of such teenage films. Derived and sometimes clich√©d stereotypes manage only the witty comedy and the traditional "Astrix" elements (the Romans, the pirates, etc.) to save this film from falling into plain mediocre Asterix animated movie library, it is certainly one of the funniest, best scripted and most beautifully animated. DVD seems to be a bit heavy, though ????????
