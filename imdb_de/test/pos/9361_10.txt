*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** In the immediate post-war years something must have been in the air that has turned night cities into attractive backdrops for movies. At this time, not only in America, but also nightly city films were filmed. One of the most notable was Carol Reed's Odd Man Out, an English image of a wounded gunman stumbling through the streets of Belfast. In America it was high noon, or rather, the high midnight movie Noir. Crossfire is not a real movie noir, but has the impression of Noir, although he uses it for his own purposes, which have to do with bigotry. Directed by Edward Dmytryk, written by John Paxton, it was adapted from a novel by Richard Brooks. The book concerned the murder of a homosexual; In the film, the victim is turned into a Jew. Although filmed like a mystery, there is little tension in the movie as it is pretty obvious who the killer is. What makes the movie so worth seeing and beautiful is the evocation of a city, Washington, DC, shortly after World War II, by some of the most gifted craftsmen who worked in films at the time. Unlike many night movies, Crossfire plays mostly indoors: at police stations, in homes, and in night cinemas. Soldiers are everywhere in the movie, and most are itching to get back into their civilian lives. Most of the men we meet, however, feel that their personalities have been shaped by their military experience, making it difficult for them to return to their old neighborhoods. maybe even impossible for some. They seem to be more connected than anything or anyone else. <br /> <br /> Still, some men have never really grabbed anyone in the army. The killer Monty is one such person. One senses that he was never connected even in his civilian life. He is a lonely wolf who also needs people. Desperately alone, he has a mile-long sadistic line and always needs someone close by who represents his father's joke. The man he kills has not harmed him and was indeed a stranger to him. But when Monty found out the man's religion, that was enough. He did not really want to kill the guy because it was his intention to "just" humiliate him and just beat him up. Since he was pretty drunk then, Monty's fists have defeated him. It is this act that sets the story in motion. <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie gains steam, the other characters quickly move into focus. Monty's antagonist is Keely, another soldier who, though he is introspective and aloof, like Monty, does not harbor any resentment towards anyone and seems to be a reasonable, even amiable type. Finley, the commissioner who is a pipe smoker, is gloomy and a little efficient compared to the men in uniform, but turns out to be more than an alternative to the various and mostly recalcitrant soldiers he deals with. The actors who play these roles, Roberts Ryan, Mitchum and Young, perform superbly, each in a different key. Ryan, like Monty, is tense and paranoid, always looking for someone to focus on. and you feel his fear of becoming a victim yourself. As Keely, Mitchum is reserved, almost casual; he never raises his voice; and he seems to say more, to offer more than the script allows. Young's performance has often been criticized for being too soft, but I find it deceptively strong and beautifully unconventional. He defies the stereotype of the hardened policeman and makes the character of Finley a prince of crime detection. <br /> <br /> There are few surprises in Crossfire, though the script is sometimes surprisingly well written, even brilliant. Character actor Paul Kelly gives one of the best short performances in the movies as the "friend" of a woman picking up a soldier in a bar. Kelly may or may not be her husband; and he can live with her or not, although he seems relaxed enough in her apartment. The beauty of these scenes is that nothing is clarified and this man himself seems to be more than a little confused about what his role is, was or should be. In a sense, these few scenes form the thematic core of the film, which is anomie. With the exception of the detective, all the men in the movie are impulsive, aimless and basically lost, some more serious than others. In this regard, despite all the sermons, Crossfire is ultimately a film about the vagueness of identity and how easily it can be lost or distorted. Men drift from one bar to another in this film as they engage in a kind of crazy camaraderie, and their personalities merge into a sort of generic American male submission. Then something happens, something is nailed down. One word is mentioned, whether "Jew" or "Hillbilly," and things suddenly become tense, and even the idea of ​​individuality, of an identity outside the group, of anyone who is not, becomes profoundly offensive, even repugnant. Then, after the mood is cursed and whatever stirred it up, dissolved or forgotten, the men return to their loose, non-personal group normalcy and order is restored.
