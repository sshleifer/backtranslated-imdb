The big bell in a bar rings intermittently after the last orders and the inevitable onslaught on the queue forms at the bar. Do we want what we need only when it's too late? Or is the irony of plaintive Cassandra of the opening scene a more resonant reflection of our perceptions of individual existence? There is an endless fascination with where scriptwriter Roy Andersson wants to bring us into his fourth movie "You, The Living". With about fifty semi-referenced vignettes held together by a penchant for tragicomic hyperreality, their wistful interpretations and symbolic lifestyles bind us all together in this great cosmic Sisyphean battle. The sheer simplicity of these vignettes has a dramatic effect on longevity and immense preciousness as we stand apart from the symbiotic relationships we have among ourselves. Andersson could reduce the complexity of the human condition by a hard and fast cynicism rather than he should, but he also reminds us of the inherent, reassuring glory of waking up to a new morning every morning, when we are all conscious of our own personality the arrested development.
