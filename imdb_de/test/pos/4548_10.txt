This movie literally put me on the floor (at least on the couch) and laughed. I did not think I would like that, but it came on cable television one afternoon, and I watched it all and enjoyed myself a lot. Since then, I have also seen Black Sheep, which was pretty good, but not as consistently funny as Tommy Boy.
