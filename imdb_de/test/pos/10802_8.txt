Many American pea brains, who adore and support the political half-truths of scammers like Michael Moore, do well to sit through this film more than once and see how hypnotic manipulators can scare, intimidate, and lie down a scared, underserved public mutilated. In this fine epic, Robespierre kills the opposition by remote control, all in a fit of self-righteous devotion to his principles. We feel that Robes considered it justified to tear down his opponent's heads, even as he sent his subordinates to make false and misleading charges against the state. Today, the captains of our rotten media institutions are much more sensitive than robes ... They only murder your character with allusions and false accusations that are laid down without foundations or sources. Witness Dan Rather's attempts to assassinate W's character on the eve of the 2004 election, or the constant bustle of stealing the 2000 elections, despite the fact that constitutional scholars continue to mock such irresponsible laughter.
