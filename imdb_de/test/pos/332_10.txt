I think that's one of the best Tamil movies I've seen in a long time. I love the fact that it's not about a guy and a girl who fall in love, and they've made the movie brilliant. The cast has done a great job and I congratulate the little girl in particular. She was brilliant and really made her feel like an adopted child looking for her real mother. Best of all are the songs, beautiful music and moving lyrics. There are some great songs this turn, ya'll! in particular 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' and 'Velai Pookal'. Great songs, both. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good scream and great plays (and great songs!). Cheers Simran.
