Thirty years after the 1939 classic film, Robert Donat won an Oscar and made Greer Garson a star. "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" overcame a variety of problems before stumbling onto the screen in this musical version. The original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remick, who in turn received the throne in favor of Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. Andre Previn's score was rejected, and the one ultimately used was composed by Leslie Bricusse. The first-time director Herbert Ross was commissioned with the monumental task of turning a simple love story - that of a man for his wife and his students - into an extravaganza on a large budget. That it works so well despite the many obstacles on its way, is a proof of its two stars. Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher in Brookfield, a boys' school in a suburb of England, where he is himself was trained. Introverted and socially unsuitable, he devotes himself to his students, but can not inspire them. Before the summer holidays, a former student takes him to a London music hall to see a conversation with Katharine Bridges, the young woman he wants to marry. The post-performance gathering is unpleasant for everyone, and chips - as is well known - set out to explore some of Italy's ancient ruins. Unexpectedly, he meets Katharine, who has booked a cruise in the Mediterranean, to take the time to mourn a failed love affair and to think about the direction of her career. In the time they spend together, she discovers a friendly and gentle man under the confused exterior and follows him seriously after his return to London. When the fall semester starts, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride, and the two live in a quiet family life. Complications arise when aspects of Katharina's past emerge and World War II invades her life, but chips are strengthened by his wife's support, and his newfound self-esteem makes him a favorite among the students. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few musical interludes - the delightful production hall number "London is London" and Katharine's declaration of love "You and I" - most Bricusse songs, some of which are played in one voice while the characters Doing Explorations Emotions are easy to forget and do not improve the movie in any way. Eliminate the score completely and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" works pretty well as a drama. Terrence Rattigan's script retains elements of the original, but extends and updates it by a few decades. He has created several scenes between Chips and Katharine, who delineate their devotion and some with comical relief by Katharine's friend and cohort, the over-the-top actress Ursula Mossbank (attractively played by Sian Phillips, O'Toole's), infuse real Wife at the time). He also captures life at a British public school - the equivalent of a private academy here in the States - with incorruptible perfection. Ross is a good director who generously sprinkles the film with stunningly photographed images - the opening sequence in which the school anthem sounds in the school's vast stone corridors sets the tone perfect for the film. Costumes and sets correspond to the period. Portraits portrayed by non-specialists enrolled at the Brookfield School handle their various minor supporting roles well. <br /> <br /> Highest credit goes to Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark in the lead roles. O'Toole has long been established as a top-class dramatist, so his Oscar nomination is not surprising. Clark, a veteran of about two dozen B films in the UK and "Finian's Rainbow" from the previous year, is absolutely brilliant as the music hall, which gives up a theatrical career in favor of life as a schoolmaster. Her golden voice enriches her songs and almost leaves us overlooked about how bland most of them are, and in her dramatic scenes she fits in more than O'Toole. The chemistry between the two is palpable and leaves no doubt that this is a love couple. <br /> <br /> This version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is not a classic like its predecessor, but hardly The disaster was described by many critics when it was released. Ignore the results, focus on the performances and enjoy the atmosphere that Ross brought to the screen. It's a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.
