I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theater and came straight to IMDb to check it out. I was greeted by a comment from another user who said it was nothing special, one in 6 out of 10, and not very impressive. I would feel morally detrimental if I did not disagree. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm an avid fan of Masterpiece Theater, but often the stories on TV are a bit stupid, for example, "He Knew He Was Right" was absolutely terrible. However, "Carrie's War" is probably the best I've seen so far. The entire cast is doing an excellent job and has sparked my interest more than any other piece I've seen recently. The character Mr. Evans is of particular interest, and subtle images of, for example, a pristine birthday cake or a garnet ring made my opinion of him bad to really good. Really. His ultimate downfall and the story of how everyone around him left a cold, hard man to me was the bittersweet in this story. <br /> <br /> The ending is gratifying in every way, except one; that everyone did not get what he deserved, but overall, everything went well. I can only recommend it to anyone.
