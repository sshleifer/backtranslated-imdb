The trio is a pleasant, nostalgic journey to that first burst of desire - when it came to simple exploration of the unknown - before we "grew up" and the complexity of HIV status, emotional baggage, and motto run-my added -pager-just-go-off in the emotional mix. <br /> <br /> The depicted fear is pure youthful fear, but it sounds right in all three stories. Your sweetness and positivity make you feel good that you are gay. And there are only a few such films. <br /> <br /> Good news! Both Boys Life and Boys Life 2 are available on DVD from September 1999.
