This is one of L & H's shorts, most commonly referred to as the first "true" L & H teaming, and possibly one of its best silent functions. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who came to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he has never seen. First, Ollie laughs with everyone when this strange little man gets out and attracts a lot of attention when he is doing his medical exam, but he is very humbled if it turns out that this is the guy he ought to be , He has been told that Philip is a good boy, but he has a weakness - women. Mumblethunder and Philip set out to go home, but their journey there is constantly interrupted when Philip breaks into a little dance each time he sees a woman and then chases after the woman. Every time this happens, a huge crowd gathers, not so much because he's hunting for skirts, but because Philip also wears a skirt (a kilt). Finally, Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor shop to be measured for a pair of real trousers, but Philip escapes there to hunt more skirts. There is a lot of laugh everywhere. It's also nice to see such a short film because the guys are not exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is pretty much his usual character, but it's a pleasure to see that Stan behaves so much of his usual man-child character. It shows that he was not a one-trick pony and outdid himself in other types of roles when he got the chance. With a running time of 19 minutes he is short and sweet and offers classic singles who still sting me.
