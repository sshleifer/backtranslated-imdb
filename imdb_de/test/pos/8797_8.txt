This movie has a brilliant soundtrack and excellent acting from rather unknown faces. I especially like the Welsh Docklands characters who stumble around like American rappers. The banter between Jip and Koop is so brilliant that they look like best buddies, as if it were true in real life. I've seen some of the things in this movie, and I want to tell you that these people are not acting (especially the talk and coughing of coke seen with Jip and Koop). Danny Dyer is invaluable as Moff, the "Party Prescription" dealer, and has the funniest lines in the movie ... "I'm happiest when I'm no longer in the cucumber and feel the music, you get me. ... yeaahhh! I knew you would not let me down, I knew it !!! "
