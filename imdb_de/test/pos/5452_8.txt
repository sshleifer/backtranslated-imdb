TV movies generally do not get as much recognition or recognition as great films - and with good reason, but the 1996 HBO The Late Shift is without a doubt one of the best TV movies ever. Based on Bill Carter's revealing book, The Late Shift is about NBC's dealings with the late-night talk show David Letterman and Jay Leno when it came to occupying the free seat of the Tonight Show, which was once occupied by Johnny Carson , We see what happens in front of the camera - author Bill Carter, director Betty Thomas and HBO show us what happened when the cameras were off. Unfortunately, we never really know what really happened when it was time to replace Johnny Carson with either Letterman or Leno - but The Late Shift gives us an interesting potential reality. Although The Late Shift is a very well done movie, it does a really good job of portraying all the pages pretty much the same - though you're wondering if the movie makes Letterman and Leno too nice. especially Leno, who seems a bit too holy. <br /> <br /> The services are also very good. In a very deserving Golden Globe-rated performance, Kathy Bates plays Leno's most intrusive manager Helen Kushnick, who, according to Carter and the book / movie, is the studio and Leno (the real Kushnick was actually very problematic for Bill Carter because of his slander over this performance )!). John Michael Higgins breaks off his usual gigs to get weird little comedy parts, and he delivers an outstanding performance as David Letterman - he gives an excellent impression of Letterman, but also creates a full-scale and understandable character. Daniel Roebuck performs well as Leno but can not compete with some of the other talents in the film - Roebuck has probably done the best that anyone could have done. It's just sardonic when someone tries to make an impression or a presentation of Leno. Bob Balaban (a mad Warren Littlefield), Treat Williams (a magical Michael Ovitz) and Ed Begley Jr. (a pompous Rod Perth) also give memorable supporting performances. <br /> <br /> The Late Shift is certainly one of the best TV movies I have ever seen. I think if you have not seen David Letterman or Jay Leno, The Late Shift may not be for them, but it's an interesting movie for those who get into the late night politics - something that happened recently with the 2009 has awakened his ugly head again -10 Conan / Leno / NBC debacle.
