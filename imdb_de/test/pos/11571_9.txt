It is now 2005 and 15 years ago that this cartoon was first aired. I have not seriously or closely watched it in about 10 years. Now that I'm an adult in my 30s, I can look back with serious eyes as I watch the episodes again. <br /> <br /> In the concept, the cartoon is partly a tribute to the classic Looney Tunes, but also to their own original show. There are some episodes structured like the old cartoons. For example, there is a singer who attacks Buster, and he takes his revenge on the singer's concert - just like the old cartoon by Bugs Bunny. The following cartoon is similar to Looney Tunes, just in another era. If you look at the old Looney Tunes, they've done a lot, just like Tiny Toons. The old Looney Tunes made many social comments and parodies. There were celebrity imitations. There were many jokes, slang and dialogue. The comedy was unreal and crazy. This can also be said for Tiny Toons. The comedy styling is "spiritual" the same. In any case, a return to the classics, which in the decades before this show in cartoons (if any) were not made good. We recognize the cultural references in Tiny Toons and we can roll our eyes if something turns up that we do not like. But we do not think Looney Tunes is crazy because we were not alive in the 1940s. At that time Looney Tunes was original, but today caricatures are being washed over and over again. Therefore, it is easy to perceive Tiny Toons in an unfair light, as we are exposed to current events and are generally over-exposed with cartoons. <br /> <br /> There are certainly differences in many ways - the timing, the delivery and obviously the duration of the shows. There are two different styles from two different eras that are performed in two very different circumstances: Looney Tunes for adults in the theater and Tiny Toons for children watching TV. Still, they've done a great job making an original show with original gags while still paying homage to the comedy styles of the old Looney Tunes. <br /> <br /> Since Tiny Toons had more time to play with, they had some real moments of great animated inspiration. You only have to watch episodes like 1 minute to 3, the Baby Plucky Toilet Episode. There are so many more. One of the best comedy dialogues ever to be animated is ThirteenSomething, for example, when Babs and Buster talk on a split screen. They hope that both miss the other. The miscommunication is spectacular. Notably, character development in this episode and in some others (usually written by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is pretty good. The female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, the opposite is unusual for cartoons from this period. <br /> <br /> This was the first modern cartoon that was both pop culture and self-centered. referential humor. This was far ahead of his time. Tiny Toons really opened a door where writers can take comic freedoms that are so common in cartoons today rather than the boring old crap that we, as children of the 80s, had to endure. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons jumped away from it all. It was a breath of fresh air. Bakshi's new adventures of the Mighty Mouse might have been a precursor, but Tiny Toons made this surreal comedy comic style a real success. <br /> <br /> As a kid I totally missed some jokes. For example, an episode pays homage to the Marx brothers, whom I completely ignored as a teenager. Now I have a new respect for it. There are so many inspired gags that I have never noticed that they are really awesome. It's that kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. NEVER noticed this kind of comedy as a child. I've been thinking about most of the episodes I've seen recently. <br /> <br /> You would notice such things if you actually saw the show. Unlike some other reviewers that I know are unfair, I have seen and considered all the episodes, both as a child and as an adult. <br /> <br /> You can say it was there. Also the voice is very careful. I'm not just talking about the main characters, but the supporting characters were really good and creative. Back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille, in my opinion, had her best performances in this cartoon. She has not been like that since. Rob Paulsen has also done some incredible stuff. <br /> <br /> That's not to say that the show had no bad consequences. It was plenty. There were also many mediocre. But by far, there were certainly many really funny episodes. Especially when it first aired, it was funny to see. <br /> <br /> From 10 years on, I give the show 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and opening the doors, leading to a new era of cartoons.
