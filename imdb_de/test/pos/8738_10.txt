Cactus Flower is what I call a "pizza movie" - a personal favorite that is always satisfying. Perfect for a night at home with a pizza. Knowing all lines (and lines!) By heart only increases enjoyment. <br /> <br /> With so many others telling the story again, I just add the correction that Bergman's character, Miss Dickinson, had a nurse receptionist, meaning she was a trained nurse - and therefore an educated person - not "just" a receptionist. Bergman's performance in this film - and the film itself - was largely rejected at the time, but today's audience will be amazed at their reach; Not only the impeccable comic timing, but also the ability to make us believe that her character does not know her own feelings and she so clearly reveals to Toni and us. While the general conspiracy is credible, Bergman's accomplishment is convincing: honest and absolutely credible. <br /> <br /> Also outstanding is Jack Weston's performance as an old friend and co-conspirator of Matthau, Harvey. No one could identify a zinger like Weston and I.A.L. The script from Diamond gives him a lot. For example, "This is such a big, dirty, lazy lie that has class." Weston was characterized by slightly shady characters because he radiated a warmth that allowed you to forgive the mistakes of his characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a fairly straight adaptation of the Abe Burrows game (itself taken from a French play by Barillet and Gredy). On Broadway Matthau played the role of Barry Nelson. Bergmans by Lauren Bacall and Hawns by Brenda Vaccaro. It ran 1,234 performances (three years) and was nominated for two Tony Awards (Vaccaro and Burt Brinckerhoff, who played Igor). <br /> <br /> For me the film music, written and adapted by the legendary Quincy Jones is another highlight. The main theme (A Time For Love Is Anytime) is performed by Sarah Vaughn on the opening and closing credits. It is also hinted at in various arrangements throughout the film, especially as the romantic piano music underscores Berman's speech to Hawn at the record store. Jones also created covers of popular songs from that time (To Sir With Love, I'm A Believer) for the nightclub scenes. As with all elements of the film, talent, taste and professionalism are immense. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, few modern romantic comedies can give this classic a candle. It's great to finally have it on DVD. Time to call for a pizza ...
