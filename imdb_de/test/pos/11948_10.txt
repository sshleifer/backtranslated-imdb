I first saw this movie in 1988 when he was on HBO and I loved him !! It was so weird that I've seen it too many times to count it. I love the Stork brothers and the pitiful, ugly dog ​​Bosco! My favorite quote from the movie is, "It's so ugly, it should be euthanized." I also loved it when the little sister slaps the girls on their backs and their faces stay that way. I also love John Cusack and Demi Moore in this movie. They were great. This movie is reminiscent of my college days when I saw him for the first time. I've rented the movie countless times and watched it over and over again. My roommate and I just could not get enough of it. Who could not love this crazy movie ?! I want to buy a copy on DVD. Does anyone know where I can get them?
