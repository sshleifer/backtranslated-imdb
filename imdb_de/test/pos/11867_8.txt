Liv Tayler in her hottest movie! <br /> <br /> She integrates the femme fatale role in an amazing way, while at the same time managing to be a super sexy woman, while the "cute girl" stops and does not exaggerate like others Movies (eg "Femme Fatale" with Rebecca Romijn) <br /> <br /> Until this movie, Lord of the Rings was the only movie I've ever seen (Im addicted to LotR) <br /> <br /> Point: Through LoTR, I had formulated the opinion that Liv Tayler was the only sweet-woman's role, but when I saw "One night at Mc Cool," I completely changed my mind. She is the sexiest woman ever! <br /> <br /> That's why the movie is a mediocre, common comedy with a "confusing" storyline
