Still funny after all these years. Midnight Madness is good entertainment for all ages. It introduces Michael J Fox as a typical 15-year trouble-maker. Melio and Blaylak are by far the funniest characters and Leon is perfect as a Wierdo game master. The emerging romance between Adam and the girl could not have been more cheesy. Fagabeefe !!!!
