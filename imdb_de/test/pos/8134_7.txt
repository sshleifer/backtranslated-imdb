This was the last silent movie by Laurel and Hardy for Roach Studios. However, since the audience was really thirsty for "talkies", the same short was recreated by the team just a few years later, with just a few small changes in the plot. It was essentially the same conspiracy except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grumpy landlord - not a goat like ANGORA LOVE. This whole goat angle is the worst part of the movie. While you could understand the boys who want to hold a cute little dog (it's snowy outside), the reason they bring a goat home is simply futile and pointless. According to the plot, the goat followed them home and so they became tired of throwing them away and kept them. Huh ?! That just does not make sense - if it had been a giraffe or a cow, would they have done the same thing ?! Apart from an unconvincing storyline, the film itself is pure Laurel and Hardy, with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians. There are some laughs in this film, but unfortunately, none of their better films is to end their mute careers. This aspect of her career seems to have come to an end only with a whimper.
