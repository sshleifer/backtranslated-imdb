From the very first title of this movie I love the artwork and the canvas layout of one of the Japanese national islands. We see some green hills and some oriental houses of a coastal town. Immediately we look at the Pacific beauty on the widescreen of the theater. And to prove how great this movie is, I have to say that Charles Darwin would be proud of it. Teachers of evolutionary classes and school science such as biology would fondly favor Hayao Miyazaki's brand-new movie entitled "Ponyo". As you'll see, the title character may be the perfect media animation icon that can be equally present in all classrooms and lecture halls. <br /> <br /> Apart from the scientific aspects of all these aspects, we dive into the blue waters of this exciting story. We have a lean, old and powerful wizard named Fujimoto who lives in a submersible and is cynical of the urban expansion of humanity and its industrial waste pollution. He wants to have complete control over the seas and the cute-looking peaceful aquatic life, including fish and organisms. Fujimoto, whose blood is half human and half amphibious, resembles both an ocean-loving anti-hero and an antagonist; Similar to the James Bond rogue Stromberg in The Spy Who Loved Me, which operates an underwater city called Atlantis. <br /> <br /> His daughter, whom he treated like a cocky pet, is called Ponyo. She is a big goldfish who already looks like a pretty red-haired girl. The father forbids them from the real human world and claims that it is dangerous and too much for them to handle. But frankly, Ponyo's curiosity is as strong as her love of nature. With the power of building, similar to the wonderful scenes of Nick Park's "Chicken Run", she frees herself from her father's rocky and petrified water city and floats to the water surface of Japan, and her luck and joy fall into the caring hands of a young ship's captain named Sosuke. <br /> <br /> Sosuke lives in a seaside home on a well-kept beach (or a boulder-filled beach) and has two overworked parents, a senior housemaid Lisa and the first buddy of a tanker, Barge Koichi. Lisa seems angry at her partner because he was on a ship and left her with all the housework. Even more, the black magic that Ponyo wields creates an apocalyptic chain of events: the moon is approaching the earth too close and waves are beating out of the imbalance of tidal interaction forces, and huge tsunami waves strike the peaceful but evacuated city. However, what seems to underestimate this curse and seem literally more powerful than a supernatural power is the love and close friendship between the childlike Captain Sosuke and the adorable redheaded Ponyo, who wants to be a sensitive person rather than just a conserved fish. Ponyo reminds me of it just like the curly and freethinking hobbits in "The Lord of the Rings". <br /> <br /> I could write about this amazing animated film, the best since "Coraline" was in cinemas in February. And now, Hayao Miyazaki, tie your gaze to another 10-star level from your animation fan Graham Abraham. The year 2009 can be filled with dozens of animated films; However, Ponyo is the most eye-catching film of many environmental beauties and should be consecrated as a new wonder of the world.
