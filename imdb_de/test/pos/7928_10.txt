(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> Russia in the 13th century. The opening shot shows the remnants of the last invasion: disastrous uniforms, human skulls and a horse skeleton. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) expelled the Swedish army and impressed the Mongol ruler so much that he suggested that he be promoted to the rank of captain. But Nevsky answers, "Die in your home, but do not let it go." He intends to fish, build ships and trade. He warns, however, of a more dangerous enemy: Closer, meaner and no way to buy up: Germany. Your destination is Novgorod. They have already reached Pskov: mothers and daughters suffer for their fathers and sons. The marauding occupation forces distribute the loot. Rich merchants want to buy their freedom (always a place for some anti-capitalists), but the "ordinary people" are ready to fight. They want Alexander as their leader. Pskov burned down. The Germanic knights feel invincible and have a smile for the Russian women who are helplessly witnessing how their fathers and sons are slaughtered. Babies are thrown into the fire while high dignitaries watch the church and remain inactive. In Novgorod: Olga Danilovna has two admirers: rich and confident Gavrilo and the big and cheerful Vasili. She promises to marry the bravest. Vasili calls Alexander Nevsky in Perejaslav. The prince decides not to wait for the attack, but to strike immediately. Even women wearing a chainmail ... The attackers want to lure the "Russian bear", but Nevsky's stratagem has proven itself: The Peipussee is his war zone: his men know the territory, but the heavier Germans will break through the ice ... < br /> <br /> Open your eyes and watch the most impressive fighting scenes ever made. It's not just the many extras (which I believe were pushed in this patriotic exercise), but Eisenstein's masterful management of such a large number of individuals: he supplants sections like pieces on a chessboard, and almost every shot resembles a composition of a composition Rembrandt or Rubens (including horses in fantastic outfits). Russia is intimidating in winter, but Eisenstein's visual imagination is hors concours. Piles of corpses are bathed in cosmic light under an endless horizon. As night falls, Olga and other women search for survivors with torches. A devoted hawk sits on the corpse of his master while a crow waits for the right moment to recognize the deceased's eyes. Eisenstein's direction and Prokofiev's score make ALEXANDER NEVSKY the "Rolls Royce" of the propaganda films. Nevsky, of course, is Stalin's alter ego, and the Russians are tall, handsome, heroic, and they have a perfect haircut. The Germans are bearded savages and look like members of the Ku Klux Klan. The actor who plays Vasili gives a one-man four-figure show: first swaying, then heroic, youthful lover and comic relief. Cherkasov's main job is to look heroic. In the end Nevsky-Stalin shows his generosity: He forgives the "little soldiers" and swaps the knights for soap. Only a bearded murderer and a treacherous cleric are handed over to the mob. He does not forget a final warning: He who comes with the sword will die by the sword ... He kept his promise. 10/10
