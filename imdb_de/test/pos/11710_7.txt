Sharky's Machine is a crime drama set in Atlanta in the early 1980s. It distinguishes Burt Reynolds as a renegade policeman who hellily refrains from stopping crime and corruption in his city. The story is about a dirty politician who is at the head of a criminal ring that has brought the city to its knees. Sharky's connection to this syndicate is a high-priced hooker he falls in love with over the course of the movie. The action sequences are well done for the early 80's and the soundtrack / score is pretty good. The drama is B-level, but this is a pretty decent movie in your DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Total 7/10 <br /> <br /> Peace <br /> <br /> Buggieblade
