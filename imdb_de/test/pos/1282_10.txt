With only $ 6,000 and a number of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion the next great one and our first taste of Nolan does not contradict that. <br /> <br /> None of the problems that constantly call into question the low budget that is independent of Nolan and his crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young, but they deliver and engage us in this story. Honestly, I think, is Nolan's best script, because that's what he had the most control over. It's a beautifully presented movie. It leads us into a world where we do not feel constrained by budget constraints. The dialogue and the atmosphere are courageous and intelligent. <br /> <br /> Nolan's distinctive method of telling the story of continuity is used here for the first time, and here in a way that plays out the story to the full. With Memento and The Prestige you have to think a bit to really understand the genius, but Nolan does not try to confuse people with his prototype movie. We can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is both creative and captivating. I am glad that Nolan has had so much success because his films become more than they could be with this method. The payouts in the Prestige and Memento would not have been exciting if the film were told in a conventional format. This idea was already made with moderate success, but Nolan really made it his own. <br /> <br /> The script here is the best of Nolan. I've had some doubts about his writing skills, I've all thought that his brother Jonathon was the writing talent, but he proves that I'm wrong to follow. It is a thought-provoking story that makes interesting observations of people and how they work. Cobb's assessments of burglary and how he can get you to find out what makes people tick really sound plausible. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that the camera work sometimes gets shaky, but it does not take away any of that history or acting. <br /> <br /> The following is the first film by the man who will portray 21st-century filmmaking in its most beautiful form.
