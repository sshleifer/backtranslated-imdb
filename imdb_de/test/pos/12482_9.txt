First, the obvious as a police drama with a funny melodrama, QUAY ?? is disturbing, just independent and a threat to banality. Jouvets Aplomb is used for a tough police service, which is immediately noticeable by her strength and exuberant power. His Antoine is not so much a man of the mind, but a man with great life experience and earthly instinct. QUAY ?? is not subversive in the sense that today's (and yesterday's) Philistines like to use the word. It's Clouzot's most playful hour. He tended to adapt Steeman's books in a satirical note. (It is said that Clouzot was a great reader of detective novels.) As a director, Clouzot's firm hand is successful. <br /> <br /> It's not a mystery or a thriller, it's a satirical look at a Parisian couple and police procedures. Those accustomed to Clouzot's masterpiece LES DIABOLIQUES will find the variety of things, styles, and elements in QUAY somewhat confusing. Here Clouzot talks about many things, about a couple and a hidden love story (Simone Renants for Blier) about the entertainment world and about old spinners, about police techniques and an old bitter policeman with a boy to raise, etc. There is a hint on exuberance - not only in Jouvets performance, but also in the film conception. <br /> <br /> Quay is a realistic mystery as satire. It offers an outstanding performance from Jouvet as a tough police inspector. Antoine is an old policeman with an adventurous past (he fought in Africa but did not climb the stairs because of his independent behavior). he lives with his son, a student; At work Antoine is tough and merciless, a capable inspector, bitter, intelligent and hard. It's a great role, very picturesque. Jouvet was composed of several characteristic features: his clothes, his expression, his comic accent, his brutality and this mocking mood. Antoine does not seem smarter than plausible; When he questions Blier, Antoine makes mistakes, and his talent is portrayed as the talent we encounter in real life - blended with mistakes and gaps and deficiencies. Antoine's talent is one that comes from experience, from daily observation - it's not the almost supernatural _divinatorial genius of almost all famous detectives. <br /> <br /> QUAY ?? It's versatile, it's a realistic crime thriller, and it's also a satire and a melodrama. One can see it among the first cinematic forays into the legendary resilience of French police. Long ago, the tough bulls were Eastwood and Wayne, Antoine. <br /> <br /> The title is interesting, indicating that this is a movie about the police, not a case or a riddle. <br /> <br /> As a craft, Clouzot was perhaps the best and hottest in France (as Welles was). QUAY ?? is very appropriate for Clouzot's nature - a sardonic comic, keen observations, a lot of psychology, sharp, merciless irony. The man was the first class when he filmed something. He knew what he should be shooting, what he should choose, and he saw the introductory scenes of this film, with Jenny Lamour's big stage performance. Every scene is memorable, exemplary turned. Clouzot's technical and stylistic skills were amazing. His style is imaginative, satirical, sharp, extremely transparent and ingenious. <br /> <br /> Jouvet's style was lush, powerful and vehement. (Some did not like it for these very characteristics, being a great stage actor, his cinematic style was considered too theatrical, etc.) His Antoine is a good example of what was meant by composing a roll, a composition. <br /> <br /> Jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomy, much like a threatening bird of prey, something like Van Cleef, but much more subtle, noble and intelligent and eye-catching. Jouvet had this predatory, cruel air, and it's useful here because he's doing an old, hard cop. A page from QUAY ?? is that it is a jouvet concert. It is instantly recognizable, recognizable by the quality of its performance (I see that many who watch this film do not know it's a Jouvet movie, which is an amazing quality in itself). <br /> <br /> Fresnay and Jouvet are the two French actors I admire the most. The first was revealed to me through a Renoir drama (the famous one) and Jouvet through a Carn√© comedy. I was intrigued to see that Clouzot gave both lead roles. <br /> <br /> Finally, a word about Steeman; He wrote the novel by Clouzot (who had previously adapted another Steeman novel as a Fresnay comedy). Steeman was an old school puzzles writer in Wallace. With the new, hardened fashion he was quickly overtaken. When I was 11 years old, I read one of his thrillers and loved it.
