Thankfully, there are films that do not follow the same old Hollywood Crap formula. I think the digital revolution and the DVD revolution are actually making it possible to do even more interesting work, even if you have to find it harder to find it. I love when a movie takes its time to move you deeper and deeper into its inner emotional realms. It really was like a journey through the soul of America, and this soul is disturbed and confused. What really impressed me was the way in which they used Martin Luther King's talk about Vietnam and evidence of his assassination in a way that hit me hard. I was suffocated every time I heard his voice. Of course I've heard him speak before, but the way they used the speeches here made me feel that I had understood his message in ways I'd never thought about. What can you say about it? A film that has critical statistics on war, oppression, and a plea for pity at the end where a credit scam would normally be? In fact, there are no credits in the movie at all. You need to access them by selecting them in the functions. Somehow that made me think. All in all, I can not say enough about this DVD. Brilliant.
