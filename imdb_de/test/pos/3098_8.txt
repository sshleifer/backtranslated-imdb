One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short "Chess Fever," a crazy story of how a rigorous intellectual board game could even upset the carefully planned central economy. An uncompromising comedy object such as Chess found an earlier paragraph in this delightful short film. Two young men play the game seriously against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts like 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', where human activity was deliberately shaped by a natural environment. The difference in activities (natural = feeding baby, pouring garden, artificial = chess) may be significant. <br /> <br /> The main difference in this film, between this motionless background and the quiet, quiet chess game, is the fierce passions that the latter triggers, as frauds lead to a most unworthy close combat. The intellectual game becomes a gross physical scrap, just as the claims of artistic filmmakers are forever invalidated by the grosser demands of the public. <br /> <br /> Most amusing of the movie is the descent into slapstick, but the way it is filmed takes a long time after the initial joke is made; The camera refuses to pay any attention to the fight, focusing instead on the set as we catch a glimpse of flinging feet and flung-out clothing. The movie's refusal to cut is audacious, so that the humor seems to come from something other than struggle, reflecting our need for physical contact through intellectual stimulation, our willlessness to let go. What is special? Brilliant is the dissolution, as these upper-class toppers are caught by the valet, who picks them up like two stray students, as if chewing their ears off. If Masters can not be expected to keep their place with followers, then somebody has to do it for them.
