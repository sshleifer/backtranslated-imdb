This movie is very similar to the Death Warrant with Jean-Claude Van Damme and also bears some resemblance to Island of Fire with Jackie Chan. I've also heard that there are some other very similar action movies, but this movie has a lot better action than Death Warrant or even Island of Fire (that's right, the movie by Jackie Chan). Seldom do American action films have such great action sequences, even though there have been many negative reviews of this film, they easily beat most of the action films of that time, which were more successful. There were many martial arts scenes, David Bradley was fast in this movie as Bruce Lee and what was good was that fight scenes were much longer than in most American martial arts films. The shoot-out scenes were similar in John Woo's films, maybe not so good, but still very exciting. There were also many impressive explosions and a great chase scene. I've seen some of David Bradley's films, but this one is the best action effect. OK, this movie has some cheesy moments, but which movie does not have that? The acting was decent, Charles Napier was incredible and his character was really tough. Adam Clark, who played Squid, and Yuji Okumoto, who played the main villain, were also very good. Other actors were also pretty good, although acting in these types of films is not important. If you're a fan of action movies (I mean the real action movie fan who really appreciates the action) then you need to watch this movie.
