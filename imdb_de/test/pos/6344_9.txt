This is a wonderful sequel to the award-winning miniseries Lonesome Dove in the 80s. This sequel may be better than the original. It's definitely family friendly. The language is muted. There is a lot of violence and a particular scene with Cherokee Jack is especially cruel. Overall, a great movie. The spectacle is great. William Peterson is fantastic. Such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of humor and comic timing. Jon Voight aptly fits Tommy Lee Jones as Captain Call. Ricky Shroder does a great job as a young boy who grew up without a family. Highly recommended.
