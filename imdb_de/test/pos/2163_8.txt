I have just seen this movie and it is not bad; There are a few exciting moments and not many long dialogue chains. Comes out pretty smart. fastpaced almost like "documentary style". This movie will evoke nostalgia and a bit of Cold War paranoia with cars, street scenes and life in the 50s. The drama is pretty solid and with 85 minutes running at a good pace. A film fan from the atomic time should not miss this.
