Background Info - The Octopussy & Never Say Never Again movies were both shot in the same year, 1983, and people naturally compare them. Moore Vs. Connery. Bond vs. Bond. <br /> <br /> I have heard many people claim that the "official movie" is far superior to Octopussy. Well, I just saw Octopussy. Bond drives at a speed of 100 miles per hour (impossible - the wind would blow him off) with his feet to force the plane to the ground, and then jumps off at about 60 miles per hour (again impossible - try it.) jump out of the car --- you would end up with a shattered body. How is this octopussy scene supposed to be "good" in the truest sense of the word? Suddenly, Bond has superhuman strength and a titanic body. And he does all these stunts at the age of 56? Complete crap. Incredible. Heifer. <br /> <br /> ---> Now let's face the above scene with Connery's "unofficial" Never Say Never Again: she does not have the same polish because of her independent film status (less money), but at least you can believe that Connery is a real spy in real danger. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Bond showing his age (he's at least 50 years old) and sent for recovery. Absolutely believable Of course, there is no "day off" for a world-famous spy, and Bond quickly finds a destination within the hospital. From then on, the story turns into another adventure, with Bond trying to pinpoint his attempted killers and ultimately thwarting an attempt to steal nuclear weapons - the-top / incredible stunts. This film feels like a natural sequel to Connery's last film, Diamonds Are Forever from 1971 ... the old style of Bond ... before the franchise became stupid. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
