This show is really great. It is smart. It's funny. It's great to act and write. This show is really the fastest I have ever seen. The dialogues are really funny and played well. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have great chemistry. They really believe that they are mother and daughter. This show has really shown that mother-daughter relationships need not only be mother and daughter, they can be best friends, but at the same time it shows that it is really hard to be more than just mother and daughter, especially Lorelai and Daughter Emily. Just look at this show, which I highly recommend. She is great and definitely the best show on TV. Season 7 stars Tuesday, September 26, 2006, 8 / 7c on the new The CW
