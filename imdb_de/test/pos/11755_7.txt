This movie is likely to be too sentimental to many viewers, especially contemporary audiences. Still, I enjoyed this movie mainly because of the down-home charm of one of my favorite stars, William Holden, and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are some really heartwarming scenes between the couple and the talent of these two actors saving, which could have been banal lines in lesser hands. The cinematography of Hong Kong from the shooting is another highlight of this film. All in all, an above-average romantic drama, 7/10.
