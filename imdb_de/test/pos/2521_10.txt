I saw this masterpiece on VHS for the first time 10 years ago, and the powerful interpretation of the angry, painful versus established society that it has carried since then remained in my heart. Director Hector Babenco is such a good humanity that finds a sensitive angle to tell the story of how urbanity kills childhood children from the poverty class. Even the expelled children have innocent beautiful dreams. But the corrupt reality never gives you a chance ... <br /> <br /> Thanks to the publishers for the last DVD release, I can now count this great movie as my favorite collection.
