The Italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is needed. This is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the cinema. The plot is good, but the actual playing of the plot is very simple and does not require thinking. These are chases, explosions and everything to defeat the "evil" of Edward Norton. For Norton, he seems content to portray the same characters as in his previous films, such as The Score. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts. Attention: If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie. If you are looking for entertainment at reasonable prices, you need The Italian Job.
