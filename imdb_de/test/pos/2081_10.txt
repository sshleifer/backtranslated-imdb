Caught this movie on TCM in the early A.M. It was amazing. <br /> <br /> Slow but threatening ... Scott is a shady character who falls victim to women. In this case, there are two women who are accidentally inherited in Southern California. <br /> <br /> The beach and neighborhoods of the 1940s are original and fascinating. The title may have been more creative, but the theme and the shameful shadows of human nature are intriguing, almost in a Hitchcockian version. Scott reminded me of the character Uncle Charley in Shadow of a Doubt. , one of Hitch's best-known favorite movies. The audience learns that we really do not know what lurks in the dark side of the human mind. This movie is a repressed gem and worth buying. 10/10.
