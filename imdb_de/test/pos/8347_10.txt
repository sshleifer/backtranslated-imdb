Lady and the Tramp II: The Adventure of Scamp is a cool movie that many children can really identify with today. It's a well-presented story about a child who wants the freedom to do things in his own way, and how he achieves that freedom is only part of what makes this movie interesting. Just forget the tiny disappointments, such as the fact that there were only adults in this movie who refer to a puppy's point of view, because that's only 0.5% or less of the film's wonderful effect on the audience. Great music, lively drama, talented animations and directing as well as a powerful storyline tell the difference between freedom on the streets of New England and a cozy home with your family. And no matter how bad things may seem, your family and friends are "always there" to help you, even when things are tight. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to get the soundtrack!
