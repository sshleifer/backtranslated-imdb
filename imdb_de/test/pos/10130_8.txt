"Radio" is a beautiful film based on a real story of the mentally retarded James Robert Kennedy (nicknamed "Radio") and the football coach of T.L. based. Hanna High School, Harold Jones. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding, Jr. is great as a radio! I would never imagine seeing him in a serious performance, especially because most of the movies I watch with him are comedies. Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones, but this actor is great, so this is nothing new. <br /> <br /> The mentally challenged young man named James Robert Kennedy always goes to T.L. Hanna High School, without disturbing anyone and almost noticing. One day, when the football ball is thrown close to him, he decides to keep on the ball for the impatience of Johnny Cash, one of the best players in the football team and one of the most unpleasant men you've ever met. One day, Cash decides to punish James, ridicule him with other footballers, and even tie him up. <br /> <br /> When Jones discovers this terrible act, he remains angry and punishes the entire team, opting for that day to help James, who is nicknamed "Radio" because of his passion for radios. <br /> <br /> The film shows how radio becomes an experienced assistant, helping the team, despite the rigors of training, by the players and even respect of essentially all the people who live in the small town. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a real and beautiful story. It has a life lesson that shows us how a person can make a difference, even if it is not what we call "normal." Radio has a big heart and can not hate anyone, and we should all transfer that to our daily lives.
