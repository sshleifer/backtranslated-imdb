I found this movie in one of my old videos, "Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster" (which should give you IMMEDIATELY an idea of ​​its sound) and I had not seen it for a while, so I decided to look at it , I did not remember much about Rainbow Brite except that I liked the cartoon and that he was cute. Most people feel that way with her. You probably do it. <br /> <br /> Well, when the movie started, I was wondering if it was the right one! It did not look like Rainbow Brite when I remembered her. But it turns out she's kicking her butt! This is the strangest animated movie ever! I can not believe these characters were so popular (the series is not much different) while they are so bizarre. As soon as I saw this movie again, it became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to reveal too much. When you see the movie in the video library, lend it and look at it. No questions asked. You will get a kick of it. Especially the outrageous princess character. And the robot horse. And the hypnotized sprites. <br /> <br /> If you can not tell, this is an 80s cartoon that's really an undiscovered "head" movie hiding! Have fun!
