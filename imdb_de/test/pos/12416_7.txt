I recently recorded this movie on the sci-fi channel. It has proven pretty decent when it comes to B-list horror / suspense movies. Two guys (one with naivety and one with a loud mouth) make a road trip to finish a wedding, but have the worst luck when a madman in a crazy car / truck hybrid decides to cat and mouse play it. It gets even more complicated when they pick up a ridiculously lively hitchhiker. What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually works in this movie, unlike many others. The two guys are sympathetic enough and there are some good chases. Thanks to the good pace and comic timing, this movie is more than passable for the horror / slasher buff. Definitely worth a visit.
