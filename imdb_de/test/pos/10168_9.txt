Many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of the man who knew too much. I did not have a chance to look at her. The 56er version is a very successful movie. The series of Hitchcock movies in the mid to late fifties (including "Rear Window," "Dial M For Murder," "Vertigo," and "To Catch A Thief," and this film) is one of my favorite periods in his career. As always, in the man who knew too much, Jimmy Stewart threw himself into his role with all his might. Doris Day is very believable in the role of an atypical Hitchcock blond. I thought there was nothing wrong with her performance. Her character may not have been written as heavily as the original, but she's definitely not reduced to the role of a passive "yes, darling," pretty thing on Jimmy Stewart's arm. <br /> <br /> There really were some neat lines for Hank (the couple's son who is kidnapped later) in the opening scene of the bus - it's too bad that Christopher Olsen read them so wooden. However, it is rare for a child actor to perform well in the '50s. Most of the supporting actors in this film were very competent, but especially the assassin (played by Reggie Nalder). <br /> <br /> Some little things that undeniably make this film Hitchcockian - the use of non-English dialogues, especially French (something that Hitch did on a much larger scale in "To Catch A Thief"); Unsuspecting Arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears; Stewart and Day talk in church and sing their words to the hymn; the Albert Hall scene, in which the musician and the accomplice of the assassin are shown following the score, tension, as well as the percussionist who prepares the pelvis; and finally the gun of the assassin, as it appears behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it has to happen mechanically (an effect Hitch also uses at the end of "Spellbound"). <br /> <br /> All in all, the man who knew too much is a fun movie to watch. It's not as deep or heavily laden with icons as some of his films ("Vertigo", "Strangers on the Train"), but it's still one of my top five Hitchcock masterpieces.
