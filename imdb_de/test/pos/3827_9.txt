First of all, this is my favorite of the ST operating system. In addition to the critical comments from StuOz, I'll add something else: Technically, when the Enterprise fires their lightning with Photon Torps, they would have to be close to direct hits (I think) to use the Romulan ship with the vacuum of space which I could struggle to damage less. <br /> <br /> I had something This is a problem where the Romulan commander questions his belief in the Romulan "Protocol" or his leadership, unless it is about vulnerable goals ( Outposts in the neutral zone) that are not at war. I also do not think the commander would let himself in for the basic or simple tactics Kirk played, such as "playing dead" or dropping for the trick the subordinate suggests, whether he's the Enterprise should attack or not, if that is the case play dead. <br /> <br /> About the Enterprise: I'm surprised Sulu, after seeing the Romulan ship's attack method, said, "Are they surrendering?" When it attacks the Enterprise for the first time. <br /> <br /> Funny how Spock can do the gun control repair only when the emergency is over. <br /> <br /> Also in the last attack I thought the Romulan ship was not disguised for too long (so long that Spock could walk down a few passages into the gun room and activate and fire the photon torpedoes.) I would have gotten that point Phaser used, but I'm sure had to do with the technicians and the budget). <br /> <br /> Positive: It is a good drama that is played on the Romulan ship to introduce us to the Romulans. Great scenes in which Stiles tells a lot about the human knowledge of the Romulans. His conflict with Spock is also at the top. I wish Stiles's character had stayed on the show for a while, when added to nothing more than the energy he added. <br /> <br /> It's just for fun that I point out the negatives and blunders sure there are more). But for me it's as good as it gets! "Balance of Terror" is always the one I place in my ST ranking at the top.
