Julie Brown's brainwashes Madonna's attempt at a rock documentary with exciting humor and truly original and catchy songs that compete with Madonna's own rivalries. Cinematography and sets are top notch. <br /> <br /> Kathy Griffin and Chris Elliott offer their own comedy shots to underline and complement this film. The appearance of Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale in itself is an added bonus. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say if Brown's performance is to insult or playfully annoy Madonna, although the Material Girl would not find humor in my opinion. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "Why are you coming? not here (to the Philippines), they only eat dogs and I am a vegetarian. "
