This Blaxploitation classic about a kung-fu mum traveling to Hong Kong to avenge her brother's death offers everything you would expect from this genre. The playmate Jeannie Bell (with a huge afro) really kicked her ass and usually loses her clothes very fast. If you do not take it too seriously, the movie is a lot of fun. Stan Shaw shows a solid performance, Jeannie Bell is a little less convincing. Pam Grier is not her. <br /> <br /> Here Quentin Tarantino has his idea for the light switch scene in "Jackie Brown" of. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of Don Julian is a gem and is often used in rap songs.
