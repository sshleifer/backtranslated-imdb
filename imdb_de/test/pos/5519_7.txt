I saw this movie on my local cable system titled Beyond Redemption. I was looking for new material to watch as most of the repetitions of a Saturday morning did not interest me. I have always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Ironside, so I chose this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I personally enjoyed the movie very much. Rich Roesing, who has commented on the movie he was spoiled for watching scenes from the movie on the back of a video rental box, is quite justified. I did not have the disappointment to know anything about the movie first. That made me rate the movie higher than the average rating on the page. <br /> <br /> I like suspense movies, and this was no exception. The movie let me guess until the end. The end surprised me! <br /> <br /> The moments of reflection and remembrance of the character's past experiences during the movie added just the excitement. His reactions to these memories gave the film a sense of the humanitarian and yet conflictive side of the police task. The fight with his faith is also a welcome addition. <br /> <br /> If you like exciting movies as well as films that relate to the character's feel and personal twist, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie in the manual of your local cable or satellite system, look at it! <br /> <br /> But if you're looking for a rental video, follow Rich Roesing's instructions and get someone's video for you before you see it.
