This movie is so wonderful that it captures player life. I laughed so much when I saw that. The film is about a group of games that have a hard time with a campaign designed by their dungeon master. The movie changes from the real world and the game world as he plays the campaign he shows in the game world as his character, and then switches to the real world when they are not playing. The campaign is the basis for a module written by the Dungeon Master Lodge. The problem is that Lodge can not finish his module because the characters can not finish the campaign. They are more likely to kill and plunder than to role play. Lodge wants them to roll through the campaign, something they have never done before. They decide to bring some extra help, so they hire, wait, girls to play. Lodge also makes a npc, a non-player character, a paladin who can not or can not testify. The movie is how they do it all and more I do not want to spoil the movie, so I do not say anything anymore. While this movie is not a big budget movie, acting is not Oscar-worthy, but if you're into games, or dungeons and dragons, then check it out. It was a lot of fun to shoot this movie, and it shows that I did not like it because of any movie issues like continuity or anything, it was a low budget movie that was just fun. There's a slapstick comedy that I like, and in my opinion, some damn good writing. So if you want a funny movie, give it a try.
