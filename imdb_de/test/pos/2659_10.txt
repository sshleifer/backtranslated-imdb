Like a circle around the human beginning in 2001, skip the middle and go to the very end where we started. Kubrick has noted the weakness of words in comparison to pictures and wisely refuses dialogues, prefers the power and essence of the scenery, and makes the intelligence of the audience decode. Or not, depending on the audience. <br /> <br /> A Monolith in Film History, 2001 is a sign of direction, execution and performance. Considering the film's ambition (a movie about everything) and the film's success for that purpose, a very good argument can be said to be the biggest of all films. </ B>>
