The movie brought me memories of 9/11. The first thing that I remember this morning was seeing TV pictures of an airplane flying into a big building, and my immediate thoughts, "Must be a preview of a new movie by Tom Clancy." <br /> <br /> This was not a Tom Clancy movie. This was certainly not a British version of "The Sum Of All Fears". The typical film or novel by Tom Clancy has a relatively small cast, a linear representation and usually a certain resolution. This movie had neither. Sure, what I saw right on the screen was a small cast, an action, and a vague resolution, but as with 9/11, the point was that reality was so much bigger and more complex. <br /> <br /> I The work in system planning, and the reality of preparing for the disaster and the disaster itself is painfully obvious. It is impossible to prepare for such a catastrophe, nor will it be possible to deal with it when it happens. <br /> <br /> The quarrel between the police (not enough is being done to prepare) and the police politician (If everyone at the tube gets a gas mask, it can cause panic), the loudspeaker announcements (They are not harmful to your health but do not go home before we decontaminate you) and (do not eat, drink or smoke before we decontaminate you), I was nervous all through the movie. Not the slightest urge to surf. <br /> <br /> This movie was 90 minutes long. It could have been twice as much and yet not shown all possible details. Instead, enough was left unsaid for each of us to imagine the details, each in their own way. That made it so much more real to me than any other Tom Clancy movie. <br /> <br /> I once lived in London and right on Edgeware Road. And I often took the train from Waterloo station. When I saw Dirty War, I kept saying that this is just a fiction. At the moment. <br /> <br /> If Allah and Jehovah want it, this movie will remain fiction, and at some point in 20 or 30 years, my nephews will be able to watch this movie and remember the early 21st century, and the panic we have felt too much. Hopefully, as I feel at the moment, when I see Cold War memorabilia with the evil mid-twentieth-century communist regime, and recall drop and cover exercises in school.
