China White (1989) was Ronny Yu's first international film. This production in the UK, Holland and Hong Kong was shot in English and easily edited for the Western audience. The American Wong brothers (Michael and Russell) were to play the lead role in the film, but due to past commitments were not available, so that another Western actor Steven Leigh took his place. Several Hong Kong stars such as Tommy Wong (a dumbass) and the always scary William Ho, as well as the director, appear on an interesting cameo spot. The Chow brothers are in Holland to run the family business. They want the family business legitimized, but the other Asian gangs do not want to call it a face-saving move to please the "foreigners" and continue to want to make money the old way. Others want to take their business to a new level through drug smuggling and what not. After the Chow elder has been shot down in cold blood, the brothers turn against any family that is not with them. Can the Chow family prevent families from killing each other, or while the streets of Holland flow with the blood of innocence and gangsters? <br /> <br /> A highly underrated film. I was surprised how good it was. I have not seen the Hong Kong version. That would be a great treat for me. It is longer and has more stars of Hong Kong cinema to do with production. Too bad that this movie is not on D.V.D. is available. The video print I saw was washed out and the sound was not great. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for action fans. <br /> <br /> factoid: This film is about decriminalizing drugs <br /> <br /> in Holland.
