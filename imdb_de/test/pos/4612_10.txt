A powerful debut film by Murali K. Thalluri, who examines the events in the life of a group of students in one way or another in a crisis. The film begins with the discovery of the body of a student, then follows the life of the group in the past hours, leaving the audience curious about the identity of the deceased until the last minute. Each of the main characters is faced with major stress factors that could trigger suicide. The cast of unknowns offers performances full of strength and emotions. Fantastically well done, especially given the youth of the writer / director who was 19 years old when he wrote the screenplay.
