As you know, The Greatest Game Ever Played is about golf. I kept chuckling over the dramatic title, but with the great visuals that come from director Bill Paxton (better known for his acting in Twister and funny supporting roles in Aliens and True Lies), we find that this is much more means as a game. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is about golf, the sport only seems to frame what's really going on. What is really going on is a story of individuals who are told that they can not fulfill their dreams, be it age or social status. A conflict between the wishes of a son and the demands of a father. An English golf legend who wants to bring the title home with the land. Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) plays Francis Ouimet, a caddy with a God-given talent who was never allowed to play golf in the first place. Despite the grudges of the "upper class" class, it was undeniable that Francis had a gift. A major threat was his father's discouragement played by Elias Koteas (Sugartime, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), who felt that playing a mere game would never improve his poor living conditions. With the continued support of his mother, Francis is finally confronted face to face with his idol, golf legend Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane). <br /> <br /> More impressive than the game itself was the cinematic performance of the film. This has proven that storytelling through pure cinema is successful. The entire film could have been told without dialogue. There are scenes in the film that generate strong tension and strong emotions with only pictures. In one scene, Francis Ouimet swings and the crowd turns his head to see the ball flying into the distance, except for Harry Vardon's face, which looks at Ouimet closely without a twitch. The way golfers visualize space provides more aesthetic enjoyment. <br /> <br /> A pleasant supporting cast completes the whole thing. Peyton List plays the love interest and is worth playing, and Josh Flitter plays a loveable caddy who keeps Ouimet in focus while the pressure presses him down. Golffan or not, you will appreciate the movie for its beauty and the memory that cinema is a great medium to tell any story.
