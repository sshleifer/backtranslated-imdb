A wonderful movie that is ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> I think so. In the eighties it was all about winning, greed is good? Do you remember this? I have watched this movie more than 20 times. For me, this is a real desert island movie. I keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that I just love, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin Beverly D'angelo and Beau Bridges come in shortly afterwards. Do not get me wrong. There are many more great performances in this film, and it's also the way it was written that made it for me, and I hope you have a movie that you want to see over and over again, I believe in TV shows like "Northen Exposure" and "Earl" owe this movie a lot. But remember, it's not a movie by Tom Cruise.
