A movie I've seen and enjoyed, possibly more than any other movie. I saw it as a child for the first time and loved the drama and the big fight. I liked it as much as I did when I was older, but now because of the components that make up a true classic. The acting is great (especially Keith as T. Roosevelt), the cinematography is spectacular, the script is full of gems and the director pulls everything together beautifully. It is loosely based on an actual event, showing an onslaught of Europe and a new emerging America to slash the "Sick Old Man" (the Ottoman Empire) as it breaks in a way that I can not think of any other "historical" Have seen a movie. Humor, drama, action, love ... it has everything and deserves far more recognition (similar to 'The Great Waldo Pepper').
