My family and I usually do not watch local movies just because they're bad, they lack depth and just are not worth it. <br /> <br /> The trailer of "Nasaan Ka Man" caught me Attention, my daughter-in-law and daughter, so this afternoon we took the time to look at it. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story was beautiful and the spectacle fantastic. Jericho Rosales was really good, said Claudine Barretto. The fact that I detested Diether Ocampo proves that he was effective in his role. I've never been so touched, moved and influenced by a local movie before. Imagine a cynic as I dabbed my eyes at the end of the movie? Congratulations to Star Cinema !! Keep it up, Jericho and Claudine !!
