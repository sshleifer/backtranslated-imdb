I liked this movie. That's pretty much all I can say about it. Lou Gossett did a good job, although I'm still very disappointed with him after all the Iron Eagle movies. And even if I smiled from the inside when the first teenager died (I will not give it away), it was a nice, fitting way. Pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job, so check it out! It's another movie that I found really cheap, so I bought it and I recommend the same.
