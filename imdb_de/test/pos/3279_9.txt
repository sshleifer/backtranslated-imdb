Thank you, Mario Van Peebles, for not only telling us about the existence of black cowboys, but also a fascinating story that was easy to follow. <br /> <br /> The plot, background, music and talent were first rate. It was great that you used so many African American artists to tell the story of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Is he ever playing a good game? <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to broaden their mindset. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it. I hope you feel the same way.
