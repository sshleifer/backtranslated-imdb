Another piece for Chen Kiage ... (can not remember that he made a modern movie!) ... <br /> <br /> Good characterization with a simple story of confidence and broken promises. None of the HK fight scenes or the Hollywood guy of heroes, but it's good for that. The characters are strong, I really felt for them. <br /> <br /> If you understand the Mandarin, the English subtitles definitely have the advantage. The movie lasts 3 hours, but it did not feel like it.
