I am not sure how the "weighted average" of the IMDb found in such a low rating in this film. It is in my opinion and in all other reports an overlooked gem of a movie. Rip Torn is fantastic as a stubborn Noel Lord and Tantoo Cardinal superlative as a roommate. Torn and Cardinal are both undervalued actors who finally get a stage to do their craft. <br /> <br /> Your relationship is not always pleasant, but it is very real. This is NOT the "humorous and touching love story" that is calculated on the DVD case. In the end, it's a tragedy. Lord just aims too high and ignores all the advice to get the money offered by the energy company moving. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, as is the period.
