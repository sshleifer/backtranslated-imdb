A widely unknown, weird little western with overwhelming colors (probably the same material as "Johnny Guitar", I think, "Trucolor" or something that makes drops of blood look like shiny rubies), almost surrealistic scenes with twisted action and characters. Something else, far from being a masterpiece, but more attention should be paid to this little jewel in the Western Encyclopaedias.
