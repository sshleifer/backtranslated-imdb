I am a Christian and thought that this movie was pretty good! :) Acting was not the Oscar caliber, but I thought it was good to see that the cast had limited acting experience at the time this film was made. <br /> <br /> Jesus Christ was wonderfully explained. The message the director tried to convey (most importantly, not how the characters are dressed!), Definitely came through. The theme of the main characters of the illegal drag racing was also a good idea (cool muscle cars, by the way). I think this movie will definitely reach a lot of young people. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie, it is a great testimonial! :)
