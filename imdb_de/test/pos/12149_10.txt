Strangely enough, one should only be able to stumble on "Classe Tous Risques" by chance. it should appear on any "Best of Film Noir" list, including that of IMDb. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as good as never before; The knowledge of his bad, delicate family situation gives his almost expressionless face and his short dialogues an extra weight. Belmondo's restrained performance under Sautet's tight lead only shows what a wonderful actor he could be - and should - be. "Classe Tous Risques" is absolutely minimalist, dry and cold, without Melville's artistic scenery and pretty faces and fancy cars. It's almost a film noir neo-realism. Davos few, hard words to his children, in which they describe their life of secrecy, hold on to the end of the film at the throat. <br /> <br /> The last sentence of the film - a voice that Davos communicates in no more than ten dry, gloomy words - leaves a hard punch in the stomach. <br /> <br /> A true jewel in the great crown of French film noir.
