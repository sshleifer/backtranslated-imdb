The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode in the depths is like a journey into space! We saw that with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us did not make it. We read a negative comment and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we have never learned at school. It's also the best view we've seen from any television or movie, into the delicate balance of our Earth's ecosystem. The amount of time and effort involved in taking these shots is very obvious when you sit down and watch this series. <br /> <br /> A must for everyone.
