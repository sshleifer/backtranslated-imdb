Andaz Apna Apna is a movie that I appreciate, and it's a movie that I liked to watch anytime ... almost always! This movie is just wonderful and in my opinion the funniest movie I have ever seen! And yes, I put it over Hera Pheri ... reason? Hera Pheri has scenes that you will see besides Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene to watch out for! Aamir and Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes, but I'll put the characters in the favor: <br /> <br /> Rank 1: Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor's best performance yet and yes, this happens before the casting couch): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to the well-known family of Mogambo (Mr. India Fame). Crime Master Gogo is actually Mogambo's nephew, but to Mogambo he is more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic, charming son. Gogo makes the biggest mistake of life by giving 36,000 rupees to Teja (who, as Balla once said, "A betrayal and a fraud!"). Well, Gogo's only goal is to get back what he has and how to recover his lost money. Gogo realizes that there are more than 36,000 he has to reach, and begins ... Gogo's fight against the sinner world /> 2nd place: Teja (Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!): Teja is one evil figure who is Ram Gopal Bajaj's twin. Originally called Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja decided to change his name according to his personality. Teja, when a child had always envied his brother, one day it got worse when his father Ram Bajaj gave all his fortune. Teja decided to kill his father, but killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena's father) in the darkness of the night, although Teja does not regret his actions. Teja's only task now is to somehow get back his property and found his own poultry and bakery farm. Teja has to repay the loan to Gogo (but has no intention). To achieve his evil goals, Teja employs two collaborators: Robert (Vijay Khote, who can aim very well) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajit's clone and son ... who is a very smart boy!). # 3: Amar (Aamir Khan): Wants to marry the wealthy heiress Raveena, so he sells his father's cheap salon and sets off for Mumbai. Amar has no problem taking care of the big business that Raveena's father will hand him over after their marriage and is willing to sacrifice his fortune and, if necessary, move to London. <br /> <br /> Rank 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most guilty character in the movie and the way Amar tries to exploit him in the guise of a friend is tragic. <br /> <br /> I have won 'Because Jesus Christ reveals more characters! I just would not stop typing! The movie is just amazing! Get the DVD now and beware of these cheap VCDs, as they've omitted many good scenes from the movie. <br /> <br /> The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (beware), it appears at its peak. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teaches us a lot about life, values ​​and ethics. It teaches us about valor (why would Amar Prem ask you to stay behind if you want to meet the kidnapper, even though Prem complained that he needed to go to the bathroom ???). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes in which Salman is targeted by Aamir and overdosed with stomach obstruction pills. The part in which Teja reveals his sad feelings about why he could not go to London and in what part Gogo is finally arrested without retrieving his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is a complete package ... sit back and enjoy the ride! I bet there will be a second ride after that ... and then a third! <br /> <br /> The movie was a flop back then and I bet nobody liked it, but strap on people! This movie is a great success! Even though there were not enough people to go to the cinemas, the film is one of the best-selling DVDs and one of the best-selling movies on most channels. Therefore, the producers have long laughed to the banks!
