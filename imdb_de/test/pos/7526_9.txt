This is the first cartoon by Pepe Le Pew and in some ways it is very similar to the later ones, but in some other weird ways it is not. While the object of Pepe's affection is a cat, strangely it seems to be a BOY cat! This whole situation comes about because a cat is tired of being abused by others, disguises itself as a skunk and tries to smell like a skunk, so it can be left alone. Unfortunately, this attracts our hero Pepe. Most of the action is pretty typical until the very funny and unexpected end - and that makes them one of the best of all the cartoons in the series. Excellent animation (even if the style is different from later examples), excellent writing and a good sense of humor make him a keeper.
