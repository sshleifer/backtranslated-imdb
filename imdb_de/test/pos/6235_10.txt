Let me start by saying that Tourist Trap is a better movie than 99.9% of the horror movies that have come from Hollywood lately. If you do not believe me, see Darkness Falls or They. And it's definitely better than all those crappy direct releases like Stab, Bleed, The Pool and so on. One of the biggest problems with the film tourist trap is that you never really find an audience. When the film opened in 1979, he received a PG rating from the MPAA. Anyone who knows horror movies knows that a PG on a horror movie is usually the kiss of death for the movie. (Director David Schmoeller speaks about this problem in the commentary track of the DVD.) However, there are exceptions like Poltergeist, who also received a PG rating. However, there are big differences between tourist trap and poltergeist. Tourist Trap was not a big Hollywood movie like Poltergeist and was not produced by Steven Spielberg. That alone was enough to guarantee the success of Poltergeist. (For those of you who have seen Tourist Trap, you may even wonder why the MPAA rated this movie PG.) The "Heart Burst" scene alone should be enough to give the movie an R rating, like I would have to admit that in my youth I had a copy of Poltergeist in the video library, I picked it up and found out that it was PG and. Instead, put it back on the shelf for R movies. Years later, I finally saw Poltergeist and realized what a great movie I had missed because I had not rented a PG horror movie. From then on, I would never judge a movie again based on its rating. This is most likely what happened to the tourist trap. People like me with poltergeist will probably miss it in favor of the R movie. Most likely, it would also be a teenager targeted by most of these movie types. Friday, the 13th, was not a masterpiece either, but he was extremely good at the box office because he was rated R and then was heavily promoted by Paramount. It found its audience and earned enough money to produce several sequels. If you look at people, Tourist Trap is as good as Friday the 13th. The same thing could have happened to the tourist trap. We would have seen Tourist Trap 2, 3, 4 and so on. As far as the movie is concerned, Tourist Trap is an entertaining horror movie made on a very small budget but well-played, well-directed and well-made on many levels. Chuck Connors is a riot like Mr. Slausen and shows the best performance in the movie. A special thank you must go to the composer Pino Donaggio, whose score for this film is truly what differentiates him from others and gives him his eeriness. The music in the scenes with the mannequins is particularly scary. Donaggio worked on the horror film Carrie and many other film scores since the tourist trap. He did an exceptionally good job in the film and counts to this day films. The weakness of the tourist trap is that there is never an explanation for Davey's powers. Maybe it should be like that. He only has them, and we should accept that for the movie to work. We accept it to a point, but then the script has incidents of how Davey makes the phone ring in the store while he's in the basement of the house. In this case, Davey can only use his powers to a limited extent? Can he ring a phone in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is his reach? These are things that people who are not interested in this movie would call mistakes. Others would accept it as a mistake. I accept. There are not enough questions this movie creates to hate me. This is a horror movie. We should not read in too much. Many people have called this film a "killer mannequin". I assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this movie. The mannequins are controlled by Davey's power, which she uses as a weapon. This is a common misconception about this movie. Some people have a problem with the mannequins and some have even said that they are just stupid. I think they add to the horror of the movie. Overall, Tourist Trap is a good fun rental. *** (of 5)
