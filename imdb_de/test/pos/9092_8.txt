I intended to write a review of this movie some time ago, but only now have I been able to put down my thoughts for the perusal of others. <br /> <br /> I've never had the pleasure of seeing this film on the big screen, which is a pity as it's often visually stunning, but I've reworked it over video several times over the years and over I enjoyed it immensely each time. It's definitely on my personal list of favorite movies and for more than just the lead role with Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, two of my "actors". <br /> <br /> Perhaps I appreciate this movie so much because it appeals to my somewhat outlandish taste in terms of entertainment. I like my movies a bit off center - unpredictable and fresh. And whether you "believe" the plot of the film or not, you have to admit, it's different! <br /> <br /> Everyone has different tastes and opinions, but my impression of some negative reviews about this movie is that viewers have never really seen the surface of this movie. They were involved in technical details: "Why should a subway be illuminated in green?" or "Why should medical students do such a stupid stunt?" and have not seen the artistry and psychological depth of the piece. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some medical and technical aspects that do not make logical sense, but if you're willing to put up with unbelief, this is a bit of a very appealing movie. <br /> <br /> First, a comment on the artistic quality of the film. Some have complained about the dim lighting and illogical nature of the sets - but for me, the use of innovative lighting techniques, the sets covered with plastic and sheet, the unusual settings in old buildings and damp, dripping tunnels, the use of statues, rain and wafting curtains - all adds a poetic touch to this film, a haunting beauty that blends in with the dark questions of life, death and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I will focus on two examples; In a lane scene, certain elements of the set can dramatically come into focus by changing the lighting and then disappear when the lighting returns to normal. It is an innovative means to convey a shift in the "reality" of the moment and works wonderfully. We can also see the characters' interiors - the warm wood, the bright colors, the golden light and the overcrowded comfort of the Labraccio rooms contrast with the white, white space of Nelson. Both reflect the characters themselves. Nelson's lack of "objects" reflects our lack of knowledge about his past. and his carefully constructed mask, which keeps his companions at a distance. We will learn that his past is a mess and a conflict. He has decided to leave this behind in favor of a tidy emptiness. Unfortunately, the void also reflects his relationships with other people, a finding he finds in this film on his personal journey of discovery. Flatliners are not a typical horror movie. It's also not a typical drama or suspense movie. It is rather a fusion of all, where the best elements of all genres are intertwined in a complex, exciting plot. <br /> <br /> This is an ensemble piece and the cast does a great job of bringing life to individual characters. Their immediate impression is that the characters each stand for an established "stereotype": the female ice queen, the slightly neurotic "doctor", the playboy and the socially conscious "nice guy", etc. As the film progresses, however, the characters become more and more characters are further refined, they take on several dimensions and depths. <br /> <br /> Most interesting of all is Sutherland's character of Nelson. Nelson is not a character that's easy to like - in fact, he's a bit crazy, a master manipulator who definitely puts self-interest above everything else. Sutherland, however, plays him with a touch of uncertainty, which gives him a certain charm. As events unfold, you'll find that much of Nelson's disagreeable personality is a smoke screen, a protective mask hiding behind a very insecure and vulnerable young man burdened with a terrible secret Nelson's complex personality guides the writers, directors, and performers gradually toward a better understanding and understanding of him. The character who started out as a "jerk" becomes important and valuable to himself - as you learn to "forgive" his former behavior for new information. Her journey of discovery with Nelson reflects the characters' own travels toward self-understanding, as they too come to the realization that everyone has value, and "everything we do". <br /> <br /> What leads to my concluding comment. Although many of the posters here have taken up the theme of the trick against death, few seem to have touched on what I consider the most important premise of the film - the importance of forgiveness and the recognition of everything you do. because it is "important". <br /> <br />
