Peter Watkins' rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutalized, uncompromising political weapon set in an infinite desert landscape. An unintentionally anti-authoritarian abuse festival. The antics seem so militaristic and ill at first glance that it might seem like a distant, fantastic dystopian alternative story that Harry Turtledove might even enjoy. But as soon as we dive deeper and pay attention to the vile diatribe squirting out of the chair's tent, and the shotgun that guides the guards to monitor the bloody matter, our eyes are really open. Suddenly we realize how important Watkins' filmmaking is. So many neo-con talk points talk about youth culture and the legitimacy of divergent thinking thrown by politicians today. Granted, much of it was leaked, but it really does show us how little has changed, and informs us, in a way, of approaching such a world where Punishment Parks would be a real and frightening operation. <br /> <br /> The main actors in almost every scene are experienced non-actors who are selected for their rash political views and their desire to be in front of the camera. This gives the entire experience an unprecedented amount of authenticity, as we never, even for a second, question the reality of all chaos. A documentary filmed with 16mm film, it looks like a roughly documented documentary of a vile government test project that was not classified until years later. At least it seems to have this story now, maybe not so much when it was (barely) released. However, this adds weight to all procedures and helps you to enter this incredible universe of torture for convicted dissidents.
