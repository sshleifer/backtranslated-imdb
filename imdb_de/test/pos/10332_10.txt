This film is a study piece for my English lessons, but its depth and significance amazed me. As we look closely at all the facts and characters in this film, it's an interesting story about love, hate, war and prejudice. Good to recommend! <br /> <br /> Story: A girl named Patty Bergen, the wealthy Jewish Jewish woman, meets an escaped prisoner of war. Then she hides him in her playhouse in her huge gardens and as they get to know each other, they start to see each other's qualities and they earn each other's love. Patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt. Anton (the Prisoner of War) nearly hits to protect her, but Patty manages to stop him before anyone sees him.
