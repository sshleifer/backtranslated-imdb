Well, unlike most people ... I went into this movie and figured it would not be so good. Pretty cool plot I love the idea, but what really made this movie were the actors. They all did a great job and it was pretty cool to see Fishburn and Dillon working together. It's a movie in which you immediately think that you can predict what's going to happen, but it's not very clear how you predicted it. I do not want to reveal anything about the story, so I will not do it ... but I suggest giving this story a chance. If you have seen the movie Money Train and you liked it, you would love this movie. Maybe everything that touches Lawrence Fishburn is gold?
