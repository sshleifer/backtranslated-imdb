A talented high school graduate with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state-run All-Star High School football game. If he meets and falls in love with an attractive local girl, if he plays well, plays well, it helps him to a full-ride scholarship. <br /> <br /> Too often these dramas fall into formal traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teenager. Matt Sabo from FULL RIDE certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique person than we normally see in this genre. Matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager, both too confident and vulnerable, alternately optimistic and cynical. Influenced by Amy, Matt grows into a man of character and heart. He makes friends with his teammates, which influences his growth as an athlete and team player. <br /> <br /> FULL RIDE contains all the elements we like to see in a movie - great acting, admirable characters, exciting sports scenes, moving dramas and a love story. While you may have seen these elements in other films, FULL RIDE is supported by performances that are sincere and sometimes even moving. The best thing about FULL RIDE is perhaps the sense of reality. Although the author of the previous commentary does not seem to agree (apparently an angry student who for obvious reasons received a bad grade in his film class), director Mark Hoeger founds the film in a credible situation and in a place that does a great job come to the point of what life is like in a small town. These characters are real people who are rooted in realistic situations that often create the most compelling entertainment. One level is a love story, another is a character study and a simple football movie. All these ideas unite into a coherent vehicle.
