A surprisingly beautiful movie. Beautifully designed, beautifully directed, beautifully played, beautifully played and nicely photographed ..... the cinematography is just beautiful. It's a war movie, but it's epic in its scope, combining romance, tragedy, and comedy into a story that's as shattering as it is provocative.
