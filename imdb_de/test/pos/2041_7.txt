<br /> <br /> SPOILERS IN THIS EVALUATION <br /> <br /> <br /> The long kiss Goodnight is another prime example of the suffering of many modern films. It starts with a very interesting concept - a trained assassin whose memory has been erased, regains consciousness of himself - and the initial setup is captivating, but it seems the writers do not know exactly where to go next, and the whole thing wears off increasingly confusing and / or inane ways, leaving behind the disappointing taste of something that was OK but promised much better. The bad guys are remarkably unremarkable, and even Jackson's weird budfuck seems to be more of his time before Pulp Fiction. It looks like Harlin, as on Cutthroat Island, made every effort so that no one put his then wife's stage. Her character is by far the best in the movie, and that fact just makes you even more frustrated that she was not able to do anything better with it. <br /> <br /> However, there is still something about this film that sets me apart from the normal Hollywood actioner and places it above average, if only fair. It's something very subtle that I can not quite put my finger on. It's a disturbing, cold, dark, even sick edge, a nightmarish and unreal feeling, a decadent air, a mean trail that keeps coming up in various ways. It's a dark reddish photograph and an almost permanent night in which the characters dwell, it's in Samantha's dreams in front of the mirror, it's in their evil eyes and smiling whenever they want to kill a man or when they proclaim like them she enjoys watching her nemesis as her daughter listens, it's in Mitch's comeback at the wheel of a car as he squirts so much blood out of his mouth that he can barely speak ... I do not know, it's an atmosphere , something that I can not define which sneaks me a bit (which is a bit) and that still makes this movie strangely intriguing to me.
