'Hitch' is a nice surprise: a romantic comedy with romance and comedy. Most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to terrible because they are not funny or romantic. "Hitch" takes actors like Will Smith, Kevin James and Eva Mendes on a fun, feather-light journey where I actually laughed and, yes, a little "aww, how sweet!". <br /> <br /> Meet Alex Hitchens (aka Smith), aka Hitch. He is a self-proclaimed "Date Doctor"; He helps hopeless guys like Albert (Kevin James) to win guys like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, Hitch has to deal with Sarah (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist who wants to break the Date Doctor. <br/> <br/> 'Hitch' is actually quite funny and even makes the usual slapstick scenes to work simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly fun. I have to wonder why Will Smith did not make such films anymore. His sharp, fast-paced look is perfect for this genre, and his chemistry with Mendes and James is wonderful. James is a real find. I've never seen his show 'The King of Queens', but it's funny and heartfelt, and it proves once again that fat white men can not dance hip-hop (Smith's reactions to his attempts are funny). Mendes is hot and lively (not so, goodness), as Smith's perfect match, and Amber Valletta is sweet as Allegra. <br /> <br /> 'Hitch' is not perfect; It's a bit too long, and things eventually turn into "dramatic" (though it's redeemed by the happy ending with fun dancing). But it's a great refresher on the romantic cookie cutter comedies that still waste theater.
