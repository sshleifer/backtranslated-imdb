This kind of fear can only be in a young person who takes his religion and his place in this world very seriously. As the text says at the beginning of the film, these images are dead: they are already past and have understood correctly from the moment of product completion. But this is only for the manufacturer of these "products": maybe for someone who is in the same condition (I think that a lot of people, at least those who are seriously interested in religion, suffer the same terrible anxiety doubts about their personal development ). And that, of course, is the reason that art is made in the first place: identification and comfort among fellow human beings. <br /> <br /> This film uses the "classic" techniques of experimental cinema very well. And here, in my opinion, these techniques are best used: as an instrument to tell stories and create atmosphere, not just as a pure abstraction or as an end in itself. These "tricks" have been done often enough. Some other films that I believe have influenced / inspired this director are "Eraserhead" and "Nosferatu". It's interesting how these techniques make this film totally timeless: there is nothing contemporary in this film. Or nothing from another specific time. It could have been done a thousand years ago. <br /> <br /> In this story, it's interesting how these people deal with the newborn holy child: they use it selfishly for their own purposes and do not even try to listen to it. They beat him, ripped off his guts and castrated him. They forcibly drag his (living) body from place to place. And they do the same kind of violence with their mother. The story also reminds me of Borges's short story "El informe de Brodie". The criticism of the practices of the Christian institutions reminds me of the great "El Topo". <br /> <br /> Sometimes unpleasant watch, but nice. Very simple, thoughtful and focused. Very strong movie, almost too strong. All human energy is focused on it. Also, this movie shows that if you have the passion and the ideas, you can create a movie with a zero-lap budget. Spectators like me, because of the experimentalism. It was so slow and demanding. But worth the suffering after all. I have to score ten points just because someone makes such a movie.
