A very funny movie. Michael Douglas' "do" is worth watching this movie, though for no other reason. I want him to play more of those roles with little life. He was great, as were all the performers. <br /> <br /> The movie sounded like an American Roshomon, just funnier and easier to see because it was American and did not need stinking subtitles! <br /> In a funny movie with a laugh every minute, two of the best were with John Goodman (not with someone I'm crazy about) - 1. He tells the priest that Jewel did something, what he liked and what he wanted says "I had to wipe the smile off my face." The picture shows that he does not smile and is clearly a man who never smiles, but probably does not know. 2. The scene at the end between Goodman, all fitting for Jewel in his police uniform, and the confrontation with the hacked Reiser, who is perched over a table ... and the two protest that they are not gay to another character who happens in the scene - that alone deserves a special Comedy Academy Award.
