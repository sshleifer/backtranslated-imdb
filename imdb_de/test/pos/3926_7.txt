** 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. <br /> <br /> Another classic horror movie was redone with dauntless youthfulness despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on 1953 by Vincent Price designed movie House of Wax, in which a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and makes them valuable wax figures. With the awesome set design that makes the whole house wax, the movie is a classic, classic horror remake, such as Tobe Hooper's 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre classic, which was restored despite creativity and acting. Director Serra showed a slight enthusiasm with his director, which nevertheless makes it worth seeing. My final rating 7/10.
