I've just discovered this fantastic series and I just can not get enough of Garner's relaxed PI. The shows are always showing an excellent level of lyrics and exciting episodes. <br /> <br /> This episode, Sleight of Hand, is a bit different. Abandoned humor in favor of a more serious turn for Rockford as he searches for his missing girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The secret is great and convincing enough to solve it. It's based on a book (can not remember the name) and it could easily be stretched to a feature-length episode. Garner excels here as Rockford gets tough and really means business. This has a "noir" feeling, the dark light and the general mood reflect the big dark thrillers of the 40s and 50s. <br /> <br /> Really good episode in a class A series. Easily earned a 10.
