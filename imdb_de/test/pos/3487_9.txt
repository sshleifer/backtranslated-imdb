A very exciting giallo of the director of "L'Anticristo" (1974), who begins with a brilliant sequence with a priest, a little girl and a broken doll. The main story, however, is about Maniac (David Warbeck). To marry a traumatized cripple to kill them for their money. The plot is not original, but it's really exciting, the acting is good and there are several clever and bloody murders in Lucio Fulci's "The New York Ripper" (1982). Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!
