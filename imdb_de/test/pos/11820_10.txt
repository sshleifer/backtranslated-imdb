Very nice movie! I searched the channels on my TV and usually ignore the channels showing drama films, but then I saw this channel broadcasting old school movies. There I saw this movie. When I first saw the title "The Cure", I thought it would get boring, but then I got addicted to seeing Brad Renfro in that movie (one of my favorite movies of all time is "The Client", where Brad is also a star ). Then the scenes got better and better. The story is so beautiful and very touching! I cried in this movie, which I do not usually do. Great casting! and there are so many beautiful lines / quotes in this movie that are very eye-catching and make me cry a lot! Now I have bought my own copy on DVD and can recommend it to anyone!
