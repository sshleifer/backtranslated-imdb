Somehow, this film has dug into the vulnerability of my heart. Do not ask me how it happened, but I think the movie Ed "I'll sponsor everything" McMahon as a tail-pursuing crack hustler had a little bit to do with it. Honestly, I was disappointed with Slaughter's first outing in 1972. Nothing short of a litter to follow Shaft-Mania. How does the sequel go? Big Jim Brown seems to be stronger here than Slaughter than in the first one. Maybe this is because he had something to work on a year later instead of his simple "be like shaft" motivation before. <br /> <br /> The most outstanding part of the film is the soundtrack of Pimp-Daddy number one, James Brown. Almost every scene is adorned with a touch of sparkle by the godfather. An excellent epoch film for music, wardrobe, vehicles, jargon and hair. I should also point out that this movie is also an excellent time frame to represent a time in movie history where Jim Brown and Ed McMahon could actually grow hair. Body number and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You'll be interested in an action movie from the 70s that is no less than its predecessor. For my money, Slaughter's Big Rip-Off can play ball with every Blaxploitation movie ever made. Even wave. Chances are you disagree, but Slaughter's Big Rip-Off has its own feel. Something was missing the original.
