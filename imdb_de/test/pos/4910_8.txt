Story about a widowed father (Claude Rains), who educates his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is loved by Big Hunky Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is romanized by an old but wealthy man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic. The handsome Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), a business partner of the father, comes to them. All sisters fall in love with him. Then the cynical Micky (John Garfield) enters the picture ... <br /> <br /> A very entertaining film was a great success and was nominated for five Academy Awards. It's beautifully directed by Michael Curitz, has a pretty good (albeit predictable) script and a very attractive cast (especially Lynn). Again, this was John Garfield's first film, making him a star. This was so popular that there were three or four sequels (which I have never seen). This is a captivating, entertaining soap opera on a big budget - well worth seeing.
