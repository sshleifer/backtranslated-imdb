This is the best TV series for kids (and adults) ever. John Hurt is a great actor who has done great work for many years, but he was born to play the storyteller. The scripts for almost every episode are superb craftsmanship, and the productions determine the spectrum of emotions. They are alternately funny, sad, happy, exciting and always incredibly beautiful. It's hard to choose a best episode from so many excellent competitors, but "The Soldier and Death" is unbeatable with its timeless pathos. It's a series that you can watch with your kids over and over again.
