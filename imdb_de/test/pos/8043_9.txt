Smooth, tidy and well-made old school version of how a big international thriller should be made. Determined to pin down a dreaded global terrorist known as "Carlos the Jackal", Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, "Without Borders", "Space Cowboys"), a CIA employee and his Israeli counterpart Amos (Ben Kingsley, " Gandhi ")," Sexy Beast ") Get a noble naval officer, Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn," Music of the Heart ") to become Carlos, and use him in a daredevil conspiracy to bring in the KGB to kill the real Carlos because he made an offer from the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are both good here, but the movie really belongs to Quinn here who embodies himself here (in a double role). Director Christian Duguay and cinematographer David Franco are another great benefit of the film, which offers Hitchcock excitement and great sights in the world.
