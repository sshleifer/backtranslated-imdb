The four signs on the street say, "If you're looking for fun ... you do not need a reason ... all you need is a gun ... It's rabbit time!" <br /> <br /> In the woods we see hundreds of "Rabbit Season" signs on each tree. We see more and more signs pointing to the hole of Bugs Bunny. Who uses all these signs? Daffy Duck! <br /> <br /> Daffy puts the last token on her tiptoe and says to us, to the audience, "Terribly unsportsmanlike of me, I know, but what the hell, I have to have some fun! It's really a Duck Season. "<br /> <br /> From this point on, we see Elmer Fudd, the shotgun in hand ... and a semantic war between Bugs and Daffy, with bugs winning every time. Only in cartoons, fortunately, we can see someone who was shot five times in the head and continue!
