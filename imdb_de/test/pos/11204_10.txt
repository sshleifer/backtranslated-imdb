When I saw the poster for the first time, I was overwhelmed by its calm and beauty. Since then, the city of Istanbul has been in my mind ever since. Not much dialogue, little music, the whole movie was shot as elaborately and aesthetically as a sculpture. It is a landscape itself. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many things in the film, but the director has deliberately left out the most dramatic parts and left them to our imagination, creating a truly flat life. ** (mild spoiler) You can see Mahmut's Ladylove cry in the bathroom and then go without a word, but not her fight. You can see how Mahmut accompanies his mother in the hospital, but not her fight against illness. The most dramatic scene in the movie for me is that Yusuf laughs aloud for the toy soldier he bought for his niece **, and it almost broke my heart to see this boring, lonely life erupting in this way <br /> With all the little things in life, history presents us with the pure inner world of all the characters, their sadness, fear, loneliness, remorse ... And as the story unfolded, I somehow understood it Despairing situation in which their emotions really No way out, if no external things intervened, what exactly each individual tried to hold at any cost, especially for an irresponsible artist like Mahmut second watch Last night, I perched in my blanket, some vodka next to my bed and got the gone through the whole movie in a trance. I sensed two real lives, one off the screen, one on the screen. I felt free from all this loneliness and fear, because the people inside experienced it. I just got away from all these things. <br /> <br /> We can not deny the universal problem of communication, and the loneliness even brings us into the distance, and it becomes a vicious spiral. I bet Mahmut still has not found a solution in the end. Therefore, he left his room to find the answers from the outside world, the cold and the landscape.
