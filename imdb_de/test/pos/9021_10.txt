In this movie "Virtual Sexuality", 17-year-old Justine does not fall in love. One day, when she gets up, she goes to a virual reality conference with her friend. There it is presented with a machine that can change your look, your character and everything you like in Virtual Reality. She decides to give it a try, but she makes her own friend, her dream date. Then suddenly there is an explosion in a gas pipe and its creation comes alive. I'm not saying anymore, you have to watch the movie, which is pretty funny.
