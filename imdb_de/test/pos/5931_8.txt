Probably the best Royal Rumble in years. <br /> <br /> In Match 1, Edge faces Shawn Michaels in a good but very long match. Next, one of the worst wrestlers on the squad - Heidenreich takes the Undertaker in a boring casket. Match Number 3 envisages Bradshaw defending his WWE title against Big Show and Kurt Angle in a surprisingly good contest. In the next match, Triple H will defend his 10th heavyweight title defense against Randy Orton in a great match. <br /> <br /> Next up is the Royal Rumble, where 15 Raw Superstars and 15 Smackdown! Superstars hit the ring to try to win the rumble, and face the champion whoever can be at Wrestlemania 21. Highlights include Tough Enough 3 winner Daniel Puder, who gets kicked by Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Hardcore Holly! All superstars beating the crap out of Muhammad Hassan and Raw superstars against Smackdown! Superstars! <br /> <br /> No bad PPV. <br /> <br /> Edge vs HBK - 8/10 Taker vs Heidenreich - 4/10 JBL vs Angle vs Big Show - 7.5 / 10 Triple H vs Orton - 8.5 / 10 The Royal Rumble Match - 9/10
