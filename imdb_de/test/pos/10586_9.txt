"Haggard" in Bam Margera's hometown of Westchester, PA, is a half-true story about the lives of Ryan Dunn and his pals Falcone and Vallo. Dunn was released by his 2-year-old girlfriend. Glauren, who now sees a beery, long-haired metalhead named 'Hellboy' driving Dunn crazy with jealousy. In a desperate attempt to learn the truth about what's going on between them, Glauren and Hellboy, Dunn pays his friends Vallo and Falcone to break into their house and present evidence of the matter, with some catastrophic consequences for everyone involved! I found this movie very funny, perhaps because I'm a total fan of Jackass and CKY, and it must be said that much of the humor is likely to be lost to those who do not have any knowledge of Margera Madness comedy. ' , <br /> <br /> The film contains much that will be of interest to skaters, not least the skateboarding legend Tony Hawk's cameo appearance as a police officer. There are also comics by Bucky Lasek, Brandon Novak, Jason Ellis, and Bam's suffering parents, April and Phil. The DVD Extra's contain music videos by CKY (with Bams brother Jess on drums) and Bams favorite band HIM (Bams character in the movie takes its name by HIM frontman Ville Vallo.) There is also a documentary and a "too hot for donkey" Sketch. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, as I said before, this movie will be especially interesting for skaters and Jackass / CKY fans, but I think Margera and Co have done a great job with 'Haggard' and me.
