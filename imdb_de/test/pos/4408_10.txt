I must have seen this on television when it first aired a few decades ago. I thought it was great, and since I remember so much, maybe I was right. While living in and around London, I can not call myself Londoner and I do not even know it well - who except taxi drivers? Once the viewer understands the premise; If a group of men tries to learn the seemingly unlearnable and become the status of demigods, then the rest is pure joy. The characters are well contrasted, their family relationships are just as different and so different influenced by the events of the film. Do not think that this is a documentary - it's a drama and The Knowledge is one of the characters. I've never seen anything like this movie before. Look at it!
