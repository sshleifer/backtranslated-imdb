Friendly up-and-coming cartoonist Hoops McCann (a wonderfully captivating performance by John Cusack) and his best buddy George (the deliciously dead buddy Joel Murray) are heading to summer in Nantucket after graduation. Hoops, George, and some new friends come to Cassandra's (Demi Moore's most charming side) to help, a singer whose family home is threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted clan. The author / director Savage Steve Holland offers an often witty, crazy and piquant nonstop tide of admittedly broad and stupid, but still very funny jokes. The constant madness has a really dizzying, good-natured and contagious inhuman vitality that neither aversion nor can resist. In addition, the vivacious and enthusiastic acting from a good gambling add immensely to the crazy merriment: Bobcat Goldthwait as a spastic Egg Stork, Tom Villard as his dumb brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf as a bad jerk Aquilla Beckersted, Matt Mulhern as the evil Teddy, Kimberly Foster as the hollywood cookie, Joe Flaherty as the gung-ho General Raymond, William Hickey as the eccentric Old Man Beckersted, Jeremy Piven as the complacent preppy Tyran Ty, and John Matuszak as the squatting biker Stan. Isidore Mankofsky's glittering cinematography, the hip, thrashy soundtrack, the cool rockin score of Cory Lerios and the funny animation are all equally outstanding. The only funny scene: Egg in a Godzilla suit terrorizing a noble dinner party. An absolute scream.
