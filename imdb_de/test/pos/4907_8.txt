"Four Daughters," John Garfield introduced to the audience, and that's what's most reminiscent of this movie today. In contrast to some actors who appeared in several films before their screen image gels, Garfield immediately noticed that a cigarette sticking out of his mouth and he said that fate befell him girl, her widowed musician father (Claude Rains ) and her various admirers, of whom Felix, the handsome Jeffrey Lynn, is played. He's the one they all fall for but he loves Buff (Priscilla Lane). Then she meets Mickey Borden, who also falls in love with her. When Buff realizes that one of her sisters loves Felix, she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly formulaic story that teaches life (and the sequels) through acting. Garfield was mentioned earlier, but Priscilla Lane was by far the strongest of the daughters, the most interesting and best actress. Jeffrey Lynn was a fresh and handsome lead actor, and this film put him on the right foot with Warners. However, a real fame should not be. Like many others of the era, he went to work, and when he came out he had a bronze star, but no great career. Later he went on TV and in real estate. Claude Rains is warm and wonderful as a patriarch. <br /> <br /> So popular were "Four Daughters" that they inspired "Four Wives" and "Four Mothers" and returned a large part of the cast back into "Daughters" Brave, "where the actors played different characters. <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable, a nice reminder of easier and probably happier times and the chance to see John Garfield in his first movie.
