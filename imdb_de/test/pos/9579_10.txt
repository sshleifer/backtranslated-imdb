How often do you see a movie of any kind that has a talent show with refreshments? Waldo's Last Stand is a refreshment. Here Waldo sells lemonade, but does not earn any money. Alfalfa, Spanky, Darla, Mickey, and Buckwheat visit him, which is ironic because both in 3 Men In A Tub and in Came The Brawn there was a conflict between Alfalfa and Waldo to Darla's affection. Back to the story: The gang tries the lemonade to see if Waldo did it right. A funny moment is when Alfalfa gets a glass cup for lemonade and Waldo is filled and gives Darla and Alfalfa has a furious expression. Spanky suggests a floor show for the lemonade and even Mickey agrees so sweetly. When the floor show starts, nobody is in the barn, but then comes a customer (Froggy). Spanky asks him if he wants lemonade, but he only nods. Spanky asks him for numbers in the short time and every time Froggy nods, Spanky shows many facial expressions, which is funny. Spanky tries to make him thirsty in many ways. One way is, as Mickey said, "These crackers are salty and made me thirsty." There are also many musical entertainments that are so short. The opening number is from Darla, who dances and sings. The second involves Alfalfa (as usual) off-key with Mickey, Leonard, Spanky, and Buckwheat over "How Dry I Am!" (I think they sing this to make Froggy thirsty, which made me laugh too.) The final number includes boys and girls, all dressed in old fashion. This was Waldo's last Our Gang short. A great musical short, which is a mere 10 out of 10 points.
