I can not believe that this is not a great cult hit. Maybe the people who thought of Monkees as a stupid, factory-made pop band rip-off of the Beatles in 1968 refused to see it. This cynicism has probably not seen it since. Do not make that mistake. _Head_ is an amazing movie that most open-minded people appreciate. It is very funny and very intelligent (and very trippy).
