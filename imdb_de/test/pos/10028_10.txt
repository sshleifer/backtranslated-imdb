After working on 7 films with director Mickael Curtiz (The Adventures of Robin Hood are their best performance), Errol Flynn was tired of his dictatorial impulse and decided to work with the great Raoul Walsh. This reunion is a happy thing for cinematography. THE DIED WITH YOUR BOOTS is her first and best movie together. Raoul Walsh portrays General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) from his debuts at West Point to the Civil War and finally at the Battle of Little Big Horn. It's true, the film shows too heroic a portrait of Custer, but that's not important. What is important is the fact that we are transported with the passion and fame of the characters. Who can forget California Joe, the great Queen's Own Buttler, with his song "Garryowen," the touching Mrs. Custer (Olivia de Havilland), the devilish Sharp Arthur Kennedy plays well? stays on this epic and tragic fresco.
