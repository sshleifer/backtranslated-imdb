Although the premise of the film is a great "coincidence," all the actors do a good job and look great to bring the story to life. Rooted in the characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti, I was able to empathize with both and wanted them to be reconciled. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson are also good at their roles and do a good job with the stereotypical cuddling relationship. While history tends to jump through time, occasionally leaving the audience a little hungry for missing details, it still flows and avoids any real confusion. This interesting plot contains all the elements for a good "chick movie".
