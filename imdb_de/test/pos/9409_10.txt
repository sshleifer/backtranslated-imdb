I had heard about the case, but during the entire time Fuhrman wrote the book, Skakel was arrested. Mark Fuhrmans involvement and the results of his investigation. I especially liked the flashback scenes in which Martha talked about her last summer. The actress she played literally radiant with life, making it even worse that the real Martha was probably like that. It made Martha like a real person and not a victim. I would definitely recommend watching this.
