When I read the summary of "Messiah" in the TV magazine, I was not prepared for what was in store. The story is about DCI Metcalfe, who is trying to solve a case of gruesome murders across London. He soon realizes a pattern, there is a serial killer who kills people with names and jobs similar to those of the 12 apostles, and their killings are identical to their apostles. The two-part series brought me to the edge of my seat. Metcalfe closely followed the killer, but he always missed him within a few seconds and discovered the gruesome chaos he'd left of his unfortunate victim. "Messiah" will certainly cause much controversy, but it is nevertheless the biggest drama that the BBC has shown for a long time.
