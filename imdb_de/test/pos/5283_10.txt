My first encounter with Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli production company was when about 7 years ago an English version of Spirited Away was released. What a wonderfully creative and unique movie experience! With that in mind, my friend, who worked in the cinema, saw this new movie by Miyazaki with me, especially because he loves everything that Disney (the US publisher of this movie) loves. All I can say is "Wow!" What wonderful pictures of the way water is portrayed as ocean ... and what about transforming the title character of a goldfish into ... and seeing how the behavior of some characters changes ... and if you want, watch this movie to know what I'm talking about. Oh, and the voices used for this American-dubbed version: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. Good selection all. Is everything useful? No, but that's part of the childlike charm that permeates. There are many funny scenes about Ponyo and the boy and many other people they meet. Oh, I think I wrote too much so I highly recommend Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo.
