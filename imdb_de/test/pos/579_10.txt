This wonderful movie captures so many elements that make a family comedy funny, entertaining, sweet and memorable, it's hard to decide where to start. The score sung with enthusiasm by Kermit D. Frog gives us a foreword to the entire adventure. Throughout the story, this is a funny movie. <br /> <br /> Essentially this is a road trip movie Kermit travels across the country dreaming of having a "rich and famous contract". Along the way, our green hero meets a number of other up-and-coming actors, comedians, singers and musicians who happen to be Muppets like Kermit himself. Did the Muppets really start this way? "About the way it happened," says Kermit. <br /> <br /> Not since "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" has the Cameo formula been used so often and successfully. The rising stars encounter many recognizable faces during their odyssey; Some just squint across the screen, but others have very memorable cameos. Steve Martins amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably the best. The puppeteer Jim Henson nods to his inspiration, Edgar Bergen, is particularly touching. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen the Muppets TV show will be able to see all their favorite characters, they are all here. The puppetry is great. Especially looking for Kermit's cycling (how do you do that ???) In-jokes and references to old movies are everywhere, but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit itself. For example, if the crooks terrorize Kermit and Piggy, she affectionately says to her short, green and pretty Beau: "I would not give up this evening together, would I?" "Uh, give me an offer ..." I also love the shootout in the OK Corral scene: Brilliantly absurd stupidity. <br /> <br /> Now has to do "Movin 'right," but in summary: a good-natured movie that anyone can enjoy, regardless of the age or taste of the film genre. Highly recommended.
