I found this a bit more chaotic than the average stooges short (strange as that sounds). There were some funny pieces, especially the running gags ("Call Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!"), The glass door broke, the Stooges ran into the pantry and came along with ... well, you know ), but also some of it was taken up with things that simply did not make sense to me. I have to assume that these were generally scenes from the movie "Men In White", but since I do not know much about this movie, I can not say for sure. If anyone could explain it, maybe I would be more pleased about it.
