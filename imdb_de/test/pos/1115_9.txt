I saw this on the Accent Underground release of the short films. At first I found the film boring and old-fashioned and switched it off after the first hour. I was a bit drunk and tired within half an hour and an hour after falling asleep. I could not stop thinking about why I got up, turned on the TV, put in the DVD, and watched the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well done, Alex Frayne, sir Implants your movie into this ancient, cynical movie head, and that's what it takes. So 10 out of 10 for you. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I "love" this movie, but despite its shortcomings and low budget, it has had a lasting effect.
