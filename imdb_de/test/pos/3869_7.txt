Bart The Genius While not the first Simpsons episode, Bart the Genius is more or less the first typical episode. There are no gadgets or themes, it's just your typical Simpsons episode in the setup. It always seems to me that it's an episode that's growing on you. There are certain elements that do not interest me, especially the spotty animation that can be forgiven. But over time I like this story of its uniqueness. <br /> <br /> For example, it would be very difficult for a live-action sit-com with a standard budget, this episode due to the various sets shown in this episode, the computer bay in Ms. Melon's class, the opera and so on. My point is that the Simpsons recognize one of the biggest strengths in animation. The sheer lack of visual limitations compared to live action. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of writing, it is also very intelligent and fresh. The concept is quite unique and in particular the problems it has to deal with. Instead of the old security, this work was too heavy, it was just Barts social isolation from his classmates who failed him (though the exploding science experiment could prove otherwise ... which in my opinion is one of the best visual gags the series.) The end seems a bit unoriginal, mainly because the beard, which runs naked into his room to avoid Homer, was already done in the shorts, but still funny for Marges and Lisa's short back and forth, if not otherwise <br /> Finally, it's a very good episode, with many interesting new points in the series that are not quite perfect. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the now iconic name Kwijybo was of course brought to the world stage.
