They worked together four or five episodes of Johnnie Socko and his flying robot. An entertaining giant robot fighting a huge monster story is aimed directly at children. Parents naturally go crazy because the action is violent. The robot / monster battles are similar to professional wrestling and human violence, as found in Al Capone St. Valentine's Day School and the Gangster Training Academy. I liked it, but I grew up in the series. If there are any problems, the difference to the "men in suits" effects is that the movie plays like a series of episodes that peak every 20 minutes. Recommended for those who do not have Ultraman or Godzilla
