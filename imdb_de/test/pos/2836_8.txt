This movie, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of Westerns released in the 1950s. The cavalry had to defend the territory from a murderous gang of Indians, an officer decided to complete this task, and the men with various character weaknesses, which he had to merge into a coherent unit. This small group has to cling to a fortress near the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know only too well that the small band is understaffed and can be extinguished before the help comes. A major difference to this film, "Only the Valiant," is that it tries to play the usual plot, but at the same time convey the message that duty is a matter of concern that needs to be shared by everyone, even if they are decide. Do not accept this charge. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck personifies the stern captain of the force, which is to prevent the Indians from breaking out into the territory. The soldiers he takes to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop in the fort. Again they have grips or weaknesses that make them ask if the captain did not take them out, because they generally do not take part in anything. After all, the captain and the little band face the hostile and at the same time everyone makes his own mistake. The cast includes western stalwarts like Ward Bond, Gig Young, Neville Brand, Lon Chaney, Jr. and Warner Anderson. <br /> <br /> A movie sleeper and a good western for fans of this genre.
