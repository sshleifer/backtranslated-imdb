As I write these comments, I watch a DVD of this movie I just received from a mail order company, and I think it's extremely good, with strong characterizations, believable situations, and well-orchestrated action scenes <br /> <br /> It's been over forty-five years, maybe fifty, since I saw HELL BELOW, but the one scene that really impressed me was the death scene of Sterling Holloway, which several other commentators have mentioned here. I have not come to this scene yet, but I can vouch for the other comments: If you see Sterling Holloway's death scene in this movie, you'll never forget her. Considering how strong the film has been, I fully expect this scene to live up to its memory - as undoubtedly one of the greatest death scenes in film history. The movie is worth watching for just this moment, but even without it it would be a first class submarine drama.
