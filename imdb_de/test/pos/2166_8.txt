Black Scorpion is the Batman of Roger Cormen. What's cool and there are many cool things in this movie. Just as the Breathtaker is a mix of Doctor Doom and Darth Vader, it's kind of cool. The mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the Mad Hatter. The Cormen B film style can be seen everywhere on this puppy, which is not always a good thing. There are many stunts and hot girls that make every action fan happy. In this film the good weighs the bad. However, if you are not comic book movies, I would advise you not to look at Black Scorpion. However, if you like comic movies, it does not matter if there was ever a comic. Then look at BLACK SCORPION, because I give it 8 STARS.
