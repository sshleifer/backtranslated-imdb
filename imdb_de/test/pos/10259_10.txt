Read this: <br /> <br /> BOYZ 'N THE HOOD IS A SCENE IN SCENE, COMPLETE RIP-OFF THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> Two friends in the hood, one is focused on intellectuals pursuit and the other is an athlete. The friend who is an athlete is involved with the wrong people and killed. (The athlete happens to be Washington from "Welcome Back, Kotter.") <br/> <br /> It makes me angry that people do not know that. I'm thrilled when I go into a video store and Boyz 'n the Hood is in the drama section, while Cooley is high in the comedy series. It's an embarrassing shame. This movie is both funnier and more dramatic than John Singleton's rip-off. At least Singleton would have had the honor of saying that his film was a hommage to Cooley High, but no, he never said a word. Boys 2 Men named their success after this movie.
