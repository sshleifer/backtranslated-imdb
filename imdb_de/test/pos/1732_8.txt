I just saw Doctor Who's Season 2 finale, and apart from some boring episodes, this show is awesome. <br /> <br /> It is a sad loss that we say goodbye to a protagonist again this season. But finally the show continues. <br /> <br /> The BBC needs to raise the budget for the show, there are only so many things that can happen in London and the surrounding areas. Also, some of the special effects, although usually very good, occasionally a bit more polished. <br /> <br /> It was great luck for the BBC to bring a lost show It's been a long time and they need to be complimented. <br /> <br /> Come to the 2006 Christmas Special, the 2005 Christmas Special was by far the best on TV.
