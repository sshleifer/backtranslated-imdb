When I was younger and today, Mr. Bean is a brilliant job. The three-time BAFTA star nominated Rowan Atkinson stars when the nearly miming-looking alien fell to the ground, causing chaos and disaster wherever he went. He tried to take an exam, pulled his pants on to a blind man (he did not know he was blind), went to church, tried to dive in a swimming pool, had lunch on a park bench, saw one Creepy movie, changing car, picnic with flying bow tie, spent Christmas with his girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), been looking for a baby in Portsmouth, been in room 426 of the Queens Hotel in Portsmouth, won a pet competition with his teddy on a new one Chair driven on his mini, and even hit the queen and knocked out. Guests included Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Nick Hancock of "They think it's all over," Caroline Quentin, David Schneider today, Richard Wilson, Eryl Maynard of The Fast Show, and Roger Lloyd-Pack of The Fastar. It was nominated as BAFTA's Best Comedy Program (Program or Series) and Best Entertainment Program for Light. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 of the 50 greatest British actors, he was the # 24 comedians' comedian and he was the # 8 British favorite comedian. Outstanding!
