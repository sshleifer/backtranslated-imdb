A very interesting documentary - certainly much more than Sideways, a pseudo-wino drama - revealing the conspiracy of capitalism in all its greed. According to the documentary - and recently confirmed by the publication of a Parker biography - only two men determine the nature of the wines in the world: Robert Parker of Massachussets and Michel Rolland, a French wine expert based in Bordeaux "flying winemaker". The director is smart enough to include interviews with local wine producers from many different regions of France, from Sicily to Argentina, and interviews with the industry's biggest players, such as the Mondavi family, to pinpoint the limits of globalization in winemaking and marketing. A must for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry. Drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after seeing this well-made documentray.
