Meville's Caper Movie is not as good as his most famous film, the deliciously stylish "Le Samourai (1968)". I do not even think that this is the best example of the popular subspecies. The main thing against the movie is its long runtime. Meville has this tendency to focus on too many trivial details. He could have told the same story in a relatively short time, but for reasons I do not understand, the movie seems to go on and on. Nevertheless, the movie is never boring. Melville's direction impressed me and the cast is very good, especially Alain Delon as a very cool master thief. The indispensable color photography of the film is a great asset, and Melville uses the sound (or lack of sound) in a very effective way. Technically, the film is virtually flawless. Sometimes you feel that Meville is just pretending, but if someone is as talented as you, you have little reason to complain. I like other predators a bit more (Jules Dassin's "Topkapi (1964)", to name only one), but there's no doubt that this movie is a good piece of pulp entertainment and a good example of what people are after refer to as a "cool" cinema.
