Tweety is sent in a cage by his old lady on a train. In the same luggage cart, even in a cage, is New Year's Eve. <br /> <br /> Sylvester grabbed Tweety in no time, but a trainman comes back and beats the "fool-cats" as he calls him back in his cage. He puts Tweety "in a safer place", "high in the air" and tells the cat: "Now remember: no tricks!" Sylvester puts on his halo and looks innocent. Yeah right. <br /> <br /> I found the funniest stuff, but it was not about New Year's Eve. Tweety, but the "blind dog", who is in another cage next to Sylvester. The cat gets along with it and pays a high price in an extremely funny way. Sylvester just does not learn it, but that's one of the reasons we love him! (I know a lot of IMDb reviewers do not like Tweety, but I like both main characters - they both get me done!) <br /> <br /> The train and the passing scenery are also very beautiful here - really nice visuals.
