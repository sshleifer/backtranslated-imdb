"Checking Out" is a very funny and honest account of a bizarre family that happens to be Jewish. Judaism plays virtually no role in the film, but American Jewish culture and behavior are thoroughly broadcast. I hope that the film deals with the religious perspective on the topics covered, because I think that would have been interesting. <br /> <br /> I've never been a Columbo fan before, so I was not familiar with Peter Falk - it's a lot of fun watching him. It's great to see Judge Reinhold, Laura San Giacomo and David Paymer again - why do not they work anymore? They are all funny. The script is great with many memorable ones that I will use with my own family. Watch out for Gavin McLeod (Captain Stubing!) As a bouncer.
