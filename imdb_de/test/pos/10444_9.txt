As I said in the other comment, this is one of the best teenage films ever and one of my personal favorites. For me, this movie is the second best teenage movie ever. Second, only at the breakfast club. The last American virgin is perhaps the most honest teenage movie ever. It is undervalued and for many people a pretty unknown movie. it may come on TBS once a year, but sometimes longer. The first half of this movie is a sex comedy with some honest scenes. then the second half is purely honest and mostly serious. with only a few funny scenes. In my opinion, this is the best soundtrack of all time. I've never heard so many great songs in a movie before. There are 4 love songs in this movie that I think are some of the best love songs in history. The movie is about a pizza boy named Gary, who is a virgin. He's in high school and has some best friends. His two friends are sex-addicted teenagers. The first half of the film consists of sexual failures. that is very funny. Gary loves the new girl in school. Later he learns that his best friend goes out with her. He also cheats on the page. You can really feel the love Gary has for this girl. You can feel it even more in the second half. gary's boyfriend turns out to be crawling. but his other friend is pretty cool. The film shows how mean people can be. You can refer to many of these films. The action sounds like your typical teen comedy. but it's so much more than that. It's a very honest movie. it is also very 80ish what i love. If you love the Eighties or grew up in the eighties, rent this movie. but there may be some people who do not like the 80s, but still like this movie. I first saw this movie in 1987, I think. It is very entertaining and very funny. it combines very touching moments with very funny moments. it is an underrated gem! I have the movie. I love it! I give the last American virgin *** 1/2 out ****
