Many comments seem to treat this movie as a baseball movie, but I think that's secondary. It's really about living in Japan and it really works. <br /> <br /> I've lived in Japan for a few years, and I think the reason this movie did not work out so well is that you have to somehow have Japan experience it to get it. I looked at this with a well-traveled friend who had never been to Japan, and he found that many of the events in the film were so ridiculous that they destroyed the suspension of unbelief. My answer was that these events were the absolutely unvarnished truth about life in Japan! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is definitely worth a look, especially if you've lived or are interested in Japan.
