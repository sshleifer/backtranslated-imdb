This movie is considered controversial today, but it is still very funny. Racial stereotyping is done from the perspective of humor, not hate. This film shows how corrupt politicians were in the early 1930s. This film proves that it began before the 1970s and was also accelerated in the US. Lloyd is still in his typical genre, though his character grew up in China. <br /> <br /> The meaning of a cat's paw in this case is a person who stands for political office but is used by the established political machine to push its agenda. In other words, they think that this guy (Lloyd) is harmless when he is running for office. When he is chosen, he surprises her. <br /> <br /> This topic will be used later in James Stewart's film, in which Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Stewarts is more famous and has a stronger message. This movie is smarter and more subtle, the hallmarks of Harold Lloyds. <br /> <br /> Behind the facade of the movie is still the heart of a romantic comedy, but today's mainstream crowd would still appreciate the political humor and the end is absolutely priceless. I wish someone could beat today's political system in this way. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the movie and I wish Harold had become more similar in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> At least we have this one here. I think the person most cited in the movie is the fictional Ling Po. I've always thought Confusicus was the way, but I believe that the wisdom of China was not limited to him.
