It is a pity nobody knows about this movie. I think if it was just upgraded a bit and if it were not so cheap, I think one of the big movie companies might want it. I saw this movie for the first time at the age of 11, and I thought it was so powerful with the many, but illegal, lengths Mitchell does to keep his family together. It inspired me then and I'm surprised now. If you are lucky enough to find a copy of this movie, do not miss it!
