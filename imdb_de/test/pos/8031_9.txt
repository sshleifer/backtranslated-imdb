All over the world, the unmistakable impression of the American company C.I.A. You find them in a lot of confusion that they left behind. In the beginning, their goals were simple: spying, removing enemy agents, stealing secret information and destabilizing unfavorable governments. Years have passed, and though their mission is still similar, their secret black operations now include espionage in the US, discrediting US citizens, and the invasion of American organizations that criticize the US government. However, this movie is about the worldwide search of the C.I.A. after the infamous "Carlos, the box". The film is called "The Assignment" and tells the story of Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn), a US Navy officer, strikingly reminiscent of the mastermind of so many terrorist bombing raids. Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) of C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley), a special agent from Israeli Mosad, secretly trains Ramirez to locate, pose and infiltrate the elusive organization and then discredit the real jack-of-all-trades who works for the Russians. This movie is explosively exciting and full of wild chases, murders and interstate chaos. Quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic on both sides of the war. Easily one of his best efforts. ****
