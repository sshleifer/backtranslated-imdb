Impressive. We saw this movie in the hope that there would be at least some decent climbing scenes. We were disappointed there, but it was still a great movie! It was so cheesy, it was great! I have not laughed so much about a movie in a while. If you like rock climbing and enjoy cheesy movies then this is the place for you!
