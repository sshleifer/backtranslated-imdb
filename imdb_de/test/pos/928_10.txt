In this section, there is a comment stating that there is a continuity error in which Auguste Auto is parked at a different location than in a previous shot in the same scene. That's wrong. One of the views is from Auguste's apartment, the other is from Valentinés apartment across the street. The whole purpose of this segment is to show how Valentiné and Auguste - who can be made for each other - almost cross paths (as it does a few other times), but never quite do so until circumstances end of the year to throw on the ferry The movie. (And here's the hint that Joseph manipulated things so Auguste was on the ferry after checking Valentines ticket on which sail she was booked.)
