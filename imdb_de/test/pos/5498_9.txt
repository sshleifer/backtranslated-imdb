Quite simply a well-made, well-written and beautifully portrayed film. Eastwood is a classic, as intelligence officer Frank Horrigan and Ren√© Russo have their own partner, Lilly Raines. But the size of <br /> <br /> the film is on John Malkovich's shoulders as "Booth". He captures <br /> <br /> the anger and hatred of this character as well as his humanity in a strange way. Personally, I think that this was his best performance and should have received a <br /> Oscar (but I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive again this year). All in all, a great movie to see how you look into the mind of an assassin and find yourself all the way to the edge of your seat. Enjoy!!
