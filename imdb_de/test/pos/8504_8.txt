The famous French detective Henri Cassin makes his first holiday in St. Margot for 11 years, where he meets Nanette, the daughter of the resort owners. Although Nanette was promised to childhood friend Leon, Henri and Nanette fall in love and decide to marry, although Nanette's father protests against Henri's age. Leon returns on the day of her wedding and Nanette runs after him. Of the two, nothing is heard until both are found dead, and Henri vows that he will not rest until he can find the killer. The only clue Henri has to work with is Leon's footprint, but he also receives written warnings that others will die soon. Soon Nanette's mother was found dead and Henri has no idea of ​​the identity of the murderer. If he considers himself a failure, he returns to Paris and realizes (and fears) that the killer can only be one person, even though none of his colleagues can believe his explanation. The ordinary murder mystery does not really follow the formula in other genres from Columbia or other B studios. This is certainly also thanks to the director Lewis, who despite the backdrop of the film could make a noiric film, which is also supported by good camera work and good lighting. Geray delivers a very good performance, probably in his only lane, and the rest of the cast can perform well. Rating, 8.
