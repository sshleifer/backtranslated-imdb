Like the first movie in this series (SLAUGHTER, 1972), I think it would be a mistake to call this movie a "blaxsploitation movie". Sure, Slaughter is a tough, violent, black man, but it's more of an action image, regardless of the color of the leading man or the bad guys - and a very good action image. <br /> <br /> For the second and last time Jim Brown plays the title character. The movie starts with one of the stupidest scenes that I can remember in a movie. While Slaughter and his friends enjoy an outdoor party, a biplane comes and squirts the group with machine gun fire! No, Slaughter is not so tough that he shoots the plane with his .357! But Slaughter is ticked and nobody is sure why this hit happened - but Slaughter will get to the bottom of it! Well, it turns out that the hit for the last movie was tried in retaliation. In it Slaughter takes on the mafia and occurs in Mexico many butt. Well, in a terrible and awkward attempt, the guys on the plane kill and injure many people, but miss Slaughter. And because the job was done so badly, the mob boss (Ed MacMahon !!) orders the pilot and shooter to be killed by his brutal assassin (Don Stroud - in a typical role for him). Stroud is great - weird and evil at heart, but Ed MacMahon as boss ?! Wow, that's an interesting twist! <br /> <br /> Slaughter is silenced now. He figured out who the two guys were on the plane, but when he came to them, they were dead. To help him in his own private vendetta, Brock Peters (who plays a cop) tells him who the gangsters are ordered the hit and called on Slaughter to help with illegal covert work. So Slaughter and his pimp friend break into the gangster's mansion and steal a list of payouts to key government and police officials. And of course there are a lot of shootings and bloodshed in the process. Stroud does not want to let Slaughter get away and kidnap Slaughter's girlfriend. Now it's a stalemate - Slaughter has the list, but if he does not return it, the lady is dead. As a tough but brave man, you may guess a lot about what's going to happen next. <br /> <br /> The action is very good in the movie and Jim Brown is threatening and hard. The only negative I noticed was that while MacMahon played this nasty boss, in the end he just worked - and way too fast. When Slaughter catches up with him, MacMahon becomes eyelashes, and all the previous wickedness disappears - and that's too much stereotype and inconsistent. Despite these little mistakes, it is an exciting movie that is NOT suitable for children because of the violence and breasts.
