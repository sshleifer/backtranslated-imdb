To this day, I only held three people for me, including myself, who viewed Heaven's Gate (1980) as a masterpiece and perhaps the last great Western (since 1970), Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972)) , The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). <br /> <br /> I was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at IMDB rate this film as 10, just like me. A recent book, The Worst Movie of All Time, contains Heaven's Gate. It was thwarted by its production and release, since it was no longer a movie since Cleopatra almost twenty years ago. At one time it was considered the most expensive over budget film of all time and even surpassed Cleopatra. It was blamed for the demise of his studio, United Artists, until eventually all the studios fell. Fresh off his fame with the Deer Hunter, Michael Cimino was hated and despised for his success and the movie, which despised an excessive amount of money, but obviously this was a jealousy in the worst jealousy. <br /> <br /> Cimino eventually developed one of the great expositions of American experience. This movie is not to be missed, but any serious student of American filmmaking.
