Driving Lessons From author of critically acclaimed films, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a touching heart to Oscar nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and the Harry Potter series Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint), a seventeen-year-old boy imprisoned in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). After completing his school year, he decides to accept a position with Evie Walton (Julie Walters), a sly, free-spirited and "heavily bottle-retired" actress. The couple undertakes wonderful adventures from camping, walks around the block to simple conversations about life. The two challenge the domineering mother and each other along the way and develop a beautiful bond that revolutionizes their lives. <br /> <br /> The comedic elements are impeccable and precise, especially by British veteran Julie Walters. Brock uses his unique style to create an inglorious and loving nature that the directors could only dream of for the first time. Governance is natural to Brock as he builds breathtaking imagery that shatters the surface and sinks the viewer into an abundance of worship and creation. Even the subtle score of the unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourn emphasize the tone and manner in which Brock had no problems with the generation. Laura Linney always makes a name for herself in films, as she does as "Laura". The domineering and overbearing mother is sometimes unbearable and with Linney at the head of it we are involved in this persona. The complexity of their character could not have been presented more accurately by anyone else. Rupert Grint breaks away from "Ron Weasley" and tries someone new. His performance is more responsive than gossipy, but Grint gives us a brand new performance for kids and the viewer can enjoy them. But the special is Oscar-nominated actress Julie Walters, who gives "Evie" a life of its own. Although the role clearly plays a leading role, Walters is better in the supportive category, where I believe she can easily take the prize home. "Evie" is a mix of "Clementine Kruczynski" and "Mrs. Laura Henderson" with their free spirit and loveable personality. Hopefully her role in this awards season will not go unnoticed. <br /> <br /> Driving Lessons is not an experience "of this world", but a nice, enjoyable experience that allows every viewer to just sit back and learn about life, love and friendship in the most beautiful colors and sizes. <br /> <br /> grade: *** / ****
