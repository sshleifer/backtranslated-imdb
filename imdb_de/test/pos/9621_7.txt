The martial arts films became hugely popular in parts of Asia in the 1960s, but with the growing popularity of the notorious Shaw Brothers films, America had to prevail. This movie was the first to be released in America under the Warner Bros. label. This was actually the beginning of an enthusiasm that flooded the 70s with martial arts films. Many of the following films were pale by comparison, but some were great, and many like Enter The Dragon (which came out shortly after) became big hits and made these fighters superstars. <br /> <br /> Fast forward almost 40 years later and this movie continues. Most Shaw Brothers films are as good as they were then, and it has been said that there were no films made in this genre that could compete with those of The Shaw Bros at the time. <br /> <br /> I like it I think martial arts is like porn and no one looks at porn for the storyline, just like the action. Most of them are just a bunch of great fights with a little story, this is an exception. There is no amazing story, but there is one. <br /> <br /> The lead actor, played by Lo Lieh, is one of the karate movie heroes. He never brags and he never fights just because he can, he is often seen as weak and less as a fighter than most, but when he has to fight he is damned the best who lives. I really loved that character. Many of the bad guys were memorable and the fight scenes were presented so amazingly. Even a small role with Bolo Yeung can be seen as the great Mongolian, and Bolo is in my top 5 as the greatest martial arts movie star of all time, he was also in the aforementioned Enter The Dragon production, as I've said over and over again , is wonderful, you can not beat the shaws, the direction was different than I've seen a lot in films of the 70s. The use of color was well placed, making this film alone and rising above the other. When the light shines on Chi Hao's hands while he does the Iron Fist, it's pure beauty. <br /> <br /> The music was excellent too. Martial arts films were for Asia what westerns were for Italy, two separate art forms with so much in common. The countries that made these films all had genres, but the Japanese films caused quite a stir because Western spaghetti was in Italy. With their many differences, the styles of these two genres were neck and neck. As seen in movies like 5 Fingers Of Death, the fights were easily comparable to Sergia Leoni cowboy prints, and the music combined the genres so well. The music here borrowed a bit from Ironside, but was still very original. <br /> <br /> Many films were inspired by this and when I look at them, I can see that everything has been influenced by The Master Killer to Bloodsport. The most obvious movie that was influenced was Kill Bill, which for me is the greatest of all time. Many of the sets used by Quentin are full replicas of the one shown here and he used the music from this film, although the music he used was borrowed from Ironside. And the fight scene at the end of Kill Bill vol. 1 with The Bride and O-Ren is sometimes accurate compared to the fight with Chi Hao and the Japanese thug at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen many martial arts films, some even better, but that is a must for fans of the genre. You can not go wrong here. The movie starts slowly, but after 15-20 minutes it picks up and does not slow down.
