So many of us who are dedicated to the "art" of film will ignore or forget that films are also entrepreneurial activities. Mostly they are way too expensive to produce anything else. In the face of this, it often seems to me a miracle that really great things are always done. Once in a while, filmmakers will go beyond budget to produce a film, so that the business people responsible for financing the company will be seriously injured and, of course, very angry. I would like to know how it happens that this has often meant that both the big studios and some big critics "shoot" the picture when it's finally released. Terrible expectations are aroused, and often what people expect is perceived in the perception of their point of view. <br /> <br /> You can see this phenomenon while working in the imperfect, but magnificent '62 '' Mutiny on 'The Bounty', and you can definitely see it in the response to "Heaven's Gate." Cimino needed it For a long time, United Artists was spending far too much money to paint this picture, the company was mortally wounded by its excesses, and no doubt powerful people were on the lookout for its reputation to be ruined forever as this weird mammoth epic was finally released There are always many viewers who do not like long, weighty images, and storytelling in this film is not done with great economy or brisk pace. "Like Stanley Kubrick, Cimino often decides the particular statement he makes with a particular scene, Rather, he prefers that the viewer feels alive, as he has now, and has time for his own imagination to delve deeply into the pres intervened to intervene. Many people are not very positive about this approach. They want the story to move quickly and clearly, and they become slightly impatient and confused by this kind of movie. These factors have undoubtedly contributed to the failure of "Heaven's Gate" at the box office. <br /> <br /> By nature, a film editor, I am deeply frustrated with two issues with this film. Here and there, a scene is clearly too long and could easily have been trimmed without compromising its effectiveness. Then we come to the massive, elongated fight scenes at the end of the picture. In these cases, the clarity of narration is actually impaired. If you like the movie to the point where it occurs, your understanding of what is going to happen is likely to be unclear and this is indeed a frustration. I have not seen all the rough material and I can not say whether new footage would actually be needed or if some critical plot elements were made clearer by careful reworking of a few moments. Given the time and money put into this picture, this problem should have been more carefully considered. <br /> <br /> There are other issues, some occasionally weak actions, some dialogues that do not sound true, but these are really minor concerns. The reason why I am so worried about the above issues is that, like so many people today, I feel that "Heaven's Gate" is so great to look at and so magnificently deals with the major historical, political and sociological issues It's just a masterpiece. Despite its inadequacies, it is so dramatic and visually powerful that it faces most of the other Hollywood movies I've ever seen. I would like to remix much of the sound. I want to redirect and revise the scene where Ella is killed, but the size of this image is such that these considerations become truly trivial when compared to the value of total output. I should add that it can always be seen on a large screen to achieve the glorious effect it can deliver.
