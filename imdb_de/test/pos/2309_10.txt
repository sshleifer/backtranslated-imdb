especially considering the amount of crap it made on DVD. I found this movie very funny. Rip Torn is classic with its barbs. Rob Schneider, when he is annoying as an overcompensating ensign; Bruce Dern is a great "villain". The entire cast seems to have an explosion and is not at the expense of the audience. If you just like fun comedy and do not look too deeply into meaning, you might fall in love with them.
