After seeing Meredith in Beyond the Prairie, I had to buy another movie with her eyes. I can not believe how she got involved in this teenage movie. It's best if the sound is turned off, but just focus on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network publishes a DVD on "Beyond the Prairie". It's worth it at any cost, it has to pay you to see. <br /> <br /> This pretty lady needs someone to put her in a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman. Maybe something fits in with her latest, but I have not seen it. She has the smile of a Cathrine Bell and eyes of Dana Delany with a much younger body. <br /> <br />
