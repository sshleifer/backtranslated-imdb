THE DI. (4 out of 5 stars) Wow, I certainly did not expect to enjoy this movie like me. I'd never heard of it until one day I saw it sitting in the bin bin. I thought Jack Webb, who plays an Army Drill Instructor, might be good for a giggle, but I thought that the drama would be compared to the new movie DIs in "Full Metal Jacket" or "An Officer and a Gentleman" is shown, become pale. Boy, I was wrong. This is probably the best work Webb has ever done ... far better than his monotonous "dragnet" performances. The delivery of his tough guy dialogue is awesome ... in his patented deadpan monotone, and yet you know the guy means every word of it. The story may seem a little hokey compared to the filthier military films that followed, but I still found the film intriguing and captivating. Even a completely unnecessary musical interlude in an army nightclub had made me addicted. Does anyone know where I can get a copy of this great Ray Coniff song "If'n You Do not, Somebody Else Will"? Webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever ... and he's under pressure to kick the deadbeat private owen, but he sees a man buried somewhere in this sissyboy and will kick him out and scream! Great stuff!
