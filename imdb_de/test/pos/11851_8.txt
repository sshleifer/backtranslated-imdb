Well, the movie was doing a lot better than I expected. It is not boring and not unoriginal. It really is not a stupid romantic comedy. The situations in which the characters go are very unusual, of course we still talk about a movie, but the main characters are actually plausible. Of course Donald is an exaggeration, but in the movie he's just a chess piece, a means to prove something. The end is not one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, morally-containing shit that you normally see in films of this genre. I really liked it and it's hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies. It is worth a watch. It's also better than other movies, the story always stands up, the characters themselves stand up. And they do not experience this wondrous change and love is not revealed to them like a holy god who gave the artifact Yada, Yada. In the end, you really see everything for yourself, the movie makes you feel something, you can even learn a thing or two. It's not the usual hope-producing, fabric moistening idiocy. It's a good movie, not a consolation prize for women around the world.
