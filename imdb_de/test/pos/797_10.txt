Ok, I'm a big Traci fan, so it makes it easy to be in the movie at 8.5. But even if she was not there, I thought it was a good movie, especially for an HBO movie. But I'm afraid if you take Traci out of the movie, that would be fine. But a person can not do that she is in it and she is a wonderful actress. She is getting better and better.
