It's amazing what you can do with very little money. DEAD SILENT as a low-budget movie does what it promises. <br /> <br /> Too bad we do not see Rob Lowe on the screen more often. In this captivating thriller, Lowe is at his best. No wonder he went directly from DEAD SILENT to the TV hit The West Wing. <br /> <br /> TOT STILL 8 of 10 <br /> <br /> Sputtosi Toronto.
