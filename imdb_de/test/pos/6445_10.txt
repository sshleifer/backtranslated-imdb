I saw this movie as a child and fell in love with it. It has a sweet sensitive story. Children can appreciate something. I loved so much as a child that I had to find it for my daughter. It's definitely a movie I would see with kids. It reminds me a lot of stories of a Disney nature like Pete's Dragon and Mary Poppins. Both because of the live action and the cartoon features, but on his premise. It is also a good story to show the children that they can be trusted when they speak the truth. I think all kids should see it and enjoy it. It's such a break from the violent bad taste films that many children nowadays watch. It has all the charming qualities that many of today's films do not have.
