I was aware of Netflix Instant Play because it only took an hour and a half (it's just before 4am), and because it's Norwegian, and I wanted to continue with Dead Snow to see what else the country is doing in international cinema offers now. This movie is a shabby and deliciously dry move. He shows a man, Andreas, being taken to a purgatory in a city of the beautiful New World, where everyone is happy and bland and the food has no taste, no smell and even sex loses its appeal. Sidelined by the absence of normal senses, he almost feels ready to kill himself. <br /> <br /> After a jolly failed attempt at the latter, Andreas discovers a man with similar discomfort and they discover a tiny vagina-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music starts. The two try to break through to see what's on the other side, and pursue a tiny light they can barely see. But in the fantasy allegory country, longing and disagreement are of course not allowed, and the elements of the city end Andreas's attempt at freedom and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Jens Lien and his crew create a simple, straight line. Moving forward to the story, which flows well with their subjects and moves at a pace sufficient to not lag behind. The similarities in other similar sci-fi scenes are not worth it, but the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with pretty horrible scenes. I like the limited but effective use of Gore in this movie, some demystrations and flagellations that will stutter your heart harder than the Passion of Christ just because it's so out of place on the gray-toned mise-en scene. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a reliable squirrel actor who is physically out of his environment, which works very well. Despite the fact that the concept itself is not something to write about, all participants do it, and the film realizes its own world. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
