I can hardly call it a great movie, but it's entertaining. In my case, at the time of this movie's release, I was the same age as some of the younger campers in the movie. When I see this movie, it brings back the memories of my bearing years. While some of the pranks that take place in this film, for example, take the camp leader out of bed and leave him lying on the roadside, lined up in the trees or on a lake, some of them are a little over the top. The other pranks are not. When I went to camp, the campers and counselors put on similar stunts, such as underwear on the flagpole, canoe fights, and boys raiding the girls' cabin. As I got older, I realized that these night raids on the girls' hut I attended had been carefully arranged by the counselors so we would not find the girls in embarrassing situations, but at the time I thought it was real was and it was fun. This is MEATBALLS (MB). <br /> <br /> MB captures not only the scenic beauty of the camp's surroundings, but also the beauty of being young and carefree. MB is a great example of adolescents, teens and young adults spending their summers without worries when girls and girls meet with boys and pals who have as much fun as possible before heading back to junior high school. High school and college. The title of the first title is "Are you ready for the summer? ... no more homework, no more books, no dirty looks from the teachers anymore ..." describes exactly how the summer is viewed by schoolchildren. <br /> <br /> Personally, I really enjoyed the two campers Spaz and Fink. Which boy, nerd or jock, has not spent the whole camp enjoying himself with a pretty camper? Which guy did not want to be accepted by the other campers and advisers? Although these two characters are a bit over the top, I can imagine that anyone watching the movie can not help but like those two. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from PEANUTS and Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas from THREE'S COMPANY. I'd bet most viewers even cheer for Spaz in the egg contest and Fink trying to "beat his stomach" in the hot dog contest. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie had normal-looking kids and counselors. No supermodels for consultants or campers who wore trendy clothes. It's fun to just sit back, watch this movie, and remember when life was as fun as this movie.
