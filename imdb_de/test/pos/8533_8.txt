On Monday, early this week, sometime in July, I happened to be under the influence of the sweet leaf, and as a horror fan, I wanted to see something sinister. I thought of The Ammityville Horror 2, but I got something better. I was in my friend's house and he had the VHS Evil Ed. No cover or anything, he did not even see it for himself, but he told me it was about "a guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people." Well, this movie was very shocking, I have never seen the actual brutal nature of sadistic violence. He buries Ted Bundy and Ed Gein! It's also pretty funny with references to The Evil Dead trilogy (and plus the Evil Dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie!). The film is about Edward, an obsessive-compulsive, nice guy who happens to be a movie editor. He is then lent to another section of the building and sent to the noble but violent world of Sam Campbell, the Splatter and Gore Division. Eddy's new head Sam Campbell tells Eddy about the big break in his films, the gruesome Loose Limbs series, and he needs Eddy to make the movie a little less violent so they can be screened across Europe. Eddy regrets it soon, because the pictures and scenes shown to him from the lonely suburban home where he was sent are displayed. What happens from there is really a nightmare. Imagine that you are in his place! The drama is great, the overdubbing is not funny (Sam Campbell's voice is often found funny, just like the other actors). However, the overdubbing job was pretty well done, I give this movie 10/10 and he's a good introduction to the horror gore sub-genre. Very good, nightmare, bloody ....... you just have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Quote from the movie: "Where is my Beaver rape scene?!"
