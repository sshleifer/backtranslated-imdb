Billy Wilder has created a somewhat conventional biopic about the Charles Lindberg flight. He structures the film with the help of flashbacks to tell the Lindberg story that led to the famous flight across the Atlantic, which is happening in the movie at the present time. Flying by plane by the hour is not the stuff of excitement, and Wilder will not deviate from his Lindberg theme as a simple man hero, so things are predictable. However, James Stewart is well-staffed and credible as Lindberg, and the many obstacles he has to overcome to get his plane in the air are catching one eye. <br /> <br /> The film is most successful when Wilder weaves together the parts of the story in a way that creates tension, then relief and then tension again. The cinematography is pretty good, the score of Franz Waxman improves the scenes and Stewart seems to make Lindberg really alive. You might think he could be Lindberg. In the end, there is some religious disgust from the 50s, but overall, the direction, the action and the high production values ​​outweigh the predictability of the story (would anyone really see this picture and NOT know that Lindberg made it across the Atlantic?) Entertaining movie that has aged better than most other films of that time. Billy Wilder has made films of all kinds, and this one is best for his artisanal impression.
