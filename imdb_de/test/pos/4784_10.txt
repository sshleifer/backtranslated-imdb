A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE cartoon. <br/> <br /> STEAMBOAT WILLIE, a mischievous little rodent, neglected his pilothouse and joked about movie history. <br /> <br /> On November 18, 1928, an arduous boy genius debuted with the world's first successful cartoon with synchronous sound. After Walt Disney or his alter ego Mickey Mouse there would be no review. Financial struggles would persist, but essentially the world was her oyster bed, and Mickey would eventually take Chaplin as the most famous cultural icon of the century. <br /> <br /> For entertainment, STEAMBOAT WILLIE is still fun and looks great work by animator Ub Iwerks, showing a Mickey with all the passions and indifference of a young child. He has to deal with a tyrannical skipper (Pete, no bumpkin, who has appeared in Disney cartoons since February 1925), a parrot (in a few years a duck), and a cute little mouse named Minnie. The two rodents play along with the living bodies of a goat, a cat, a goose, a piglet, and a cow (a precursor to Clarabelle) - all of whom happened to be aboard the steamer. The audience howled for more and the pattern was set for the following mouse cartoons of the next years. <br /> <br /> ************************ ******** <br /> <br /> Walt Disney ( 1901-1966) was always fascinated by pictures and drawings. As a boy in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched livestock on scraps of paper; Later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew cartoon characters on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, Walt teamed up with artist Ub Iwerks to develop a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and small cartoons to local movie theaters. With his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series, which is always the inventor of the world, he built a live figure in a cartoon universe. The business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother Roy became his life-long managing director and adviser. When a slightly successful series starring Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was torn away from the distributor, the character of Mickey Mouse fell into Walt's imagination and secured Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928) a huge hit with popular music. The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon surfaced, and Walt's growing crew of amazingly talented entertainers rapidly broke new ground with full color, deep illusions, and radical advances in personal development, an arena where Walde's genius was unbeatable. Mickey's feisty, saucy demeanor had captured millions of fans, but soon more animated companions were added: the spirited Donald Duck, the intellectually challenged Goofy, and the energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt's greatest dream - feature films. Against a blizzard from Doomsayers, Walt persisted over the next few decades, inspiring children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi, and Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his fortune started with a mouse, or that the childlike simplicity of the message and a lot of hard work always pays off.
