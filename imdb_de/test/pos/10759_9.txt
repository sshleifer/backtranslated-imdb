This is an adaptation of a Dirk Wittenborn book that I did not read. Young Finn Earl lives with his mother Liz (Diane Lane) in a narrow East Side apartment in New York. He dreams of going to his anthropologist father, who studies a wild tribe in South America. Liz has friends and makes coke. When he is caught costing Cola for her, one of her clients (Liz is a legitimate masseuse), a wealthy Mr. Osborne, gets her money because he is his entire personal masseuse in his huge estate in New Jersey. They are driven there in a limousine, where she is strung in the backseat, her dress is pulled up and shows panties. (This and some low-cut clothing scenes are the only exploitation of Mrs. Lane. Some may be disappointed, but I'm sorry she had to do all the stuff in "truculess" to make the A-list, this lady has more talent in her little finger than Streep, Roberts and Sally Field in her entire BODY and the time she has given her.) When they arrive, Finn gets on with Osborn's grandson Bryce and has come of age with his new girlfriend. Granddaughter Maya. Liz joins AA and goes in with an AA doctor. It miraculously cleanses immediately. However, Finn does a lot of drugs and sex with his new friends. Bryce seems to be a good guy, but gets jealous when Osborne hosts a hot air balloon race instead of Finn. This leads to a tragedy. The genius of the story (and the movie) is that they are cut from the violent acts of the fierce, filthy Blysdale tribe to the Yanomano warriors. It is a bit implausible that Liz, if she finds out what's going on with her son, merely demands Osborne's actions and does not appeal to the authorities, or regulate them in Thelma and Louise style. There are elements of a Gothic romance with a revelation of the village trotter. They also do almost no plot or character development before moving to Blysdale. Liz, like Lane's Pearl Kantrowitz, had an unwanted pregnancy with Finn at the age of 18 in "Walk on the Moon" and felt trapped. This is in the book, but not in the movie. However, these are minor defects. The movie will be released in full length on December 31, 2005 over a year after the original release date, and I just could not wait. <br /> <br /> There were many red carpet moments in the theater where I've seen that movie on almost all the cast ... except Diane Lane !! Director Dunne said she would make a movie. I know that she did not promise to be there, but I came from the city and it would have been a thrill to see her in person. The film is a definite Best Picture contender for acting? Sutherland was pretty good, as was the boy who played Finn. Lane was great as always, but I only remember one or two emotional scenes when she caught Finn with drugs, "let's fuck with mother and son" and with Osborne "your twisted grandson ...". She'd better nod with a supporting actress, but it will not work that way. unless they give it to her for a "work".
