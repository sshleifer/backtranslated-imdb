Nightbreed is definitely my favorite movie, I've worn more than one band as it is. The make-up is fantastic, the story is lovely. It takes a few different turns and is not as deep as the story it's based on (Cabal by Clive Barker), but for a movie adaptation it stays very faithful to the source material. The only problem with this film was the producer's futile attempts to turn it into a teen slasher movie, hence the altered ending to allow sequels * eye rolls *. Apparently, someday we will get a Director's Cut, which (I hope) will clear up this bit of nonsense. Until then, I would recommend it to anyone who likes dark fantasy horror unlike Freddy / Jason / Micheal slashers. I really do not know what would be comparable ...
