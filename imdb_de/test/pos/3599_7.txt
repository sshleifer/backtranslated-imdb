As soon as Nic Cage can play an Italian soldier who loves opera and believes in love, not war, you can enjoy this beautiful looking movie. This could be used as an advertisement for tourism in the Mediterranean. John Hurt is great and Penelope Cruz is not bad as you might expect. The character of Christian Bale is a bit one-dimensional, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> The main drawback of this film is the adaptation from the book - after I was later told the differences between the book and the movie plot, I believe cheated on a much better and more convincing plot.
