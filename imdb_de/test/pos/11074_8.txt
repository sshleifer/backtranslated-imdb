This is a very realistic movie. It is the most realistic thing I have seen in urban youth. The actors were great. I'll be watching for more Gomez films. I had never heard of the movie until recently mentioned. I bought it on DVD. I was impressed. I have not seen anything as close to life as I know it in Philadelphia. This comes very close to me - in fact, a scene in which there was an accident (I will not spoil and give details) reminded me of an almost identical situation in Philadelphia. At first I thought Gomez had taken the scene from this real event, but then I realized that he was shooting the film a few years before this situation. I also agree with the point that this movie has not tried to increase its appeal with Hollywood crap. Gomez also ran "Laws of Gravity" - I'm very excited to see it.
