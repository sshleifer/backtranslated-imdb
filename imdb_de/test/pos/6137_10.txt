I agree with so many other reviewers here. This was a great movie and an even better novel by Robert Fish. Unfortunately, I believe that the author died before he could see this movie. The performances are all first class. The three principles (John Glover, Ben Cross and Veronica Hamel) seem to be made for their roles. The outsides, both in Europe and in Israel, look very authentic, and the 4-hour mini-series length was just right for the narrative of this story. Fortunately, I recorded that when it was on TV and have always enjoyed watching it. I can say without hesitation that it holds until today. I rated it at 10. If you have not read the book, you should really find a copy. This would be an excellent movie that could be released on DVD with extras that could easily include interviewing the cast.
