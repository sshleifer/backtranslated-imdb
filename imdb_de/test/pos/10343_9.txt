Great movie. Good drama, a wonderful screenplay. It's exciting to find out what people think and how they react to the situation in which they find themselves. Pity about the end; A 'page' of text on how Nynke's life went on instead of moving images was a bad decision. I hope this movie attracts a lot of people; That's worth it!
