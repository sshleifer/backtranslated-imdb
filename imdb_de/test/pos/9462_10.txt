This movie is about Viola (Amanda Bynes) and her ambition to beat her school Cornwell boys team after kicking out the girls team. So she goes to competing school Illaria and joins the boys team. She falls in love with Duke (Channing Tatum), who thinks she's a guy, and Olivia (Laura Ramsey) likes Viola as her brother. <br /> <br /> I was in a version of the 12th night game and the beginning was very modern. So I knew the piece well. I was very excited to see this movie and when I saw it, it exceeded my expectations. It kept many of my favorite lines and I could see big connections with the piece. Although it was like the piece, it was not that complicated. It was also more of a chick movie than I expected, but it was good. It was very funny. It draws you into a lot of crazy love stories and lies. You saw how viola (Amanda Bynes) thought wrong, what the guys thought and how complicated it was to live in a guy's world. You also see her roommate Duke (Channing Tatum), an impression of it. I really enjoyed watching the characters in a modern way. It also tells the modern theme "Follow your dreams", but this time it has a twist. I think this movie was a great movie about a girl who loved football and was committed to her and her family and her dreams. I think this movie will be the big break for many young stars.
