Highly politically charged drama that is biased but extremely well made and one of the most intelligent films ever made. It contains almost no sermons, but follows a naive television reporter who is beginning to recognize the threat posed by nuclear power plants, not because of inherent danger, but because suppliers are more interested in the end result than in the safety of those affected. <br /> <br /> Many hated the movie because they saw it as a political course made by ultra-liberals like Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, but if you just take it as a drama, it's thrilling, exciting, full of well-developed, distinctive characters, and ultimately a truly thrilling contemporary thriller that arrives close to home. Historical Note: For some, especially those from the energy industry and residents of Harrisburg, PA Metro In the area, it may have been a bit too close to home, less than a week after the release of this movie, the devastating explosion at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility took place. <br /> <br /> Update from 08/04/2007: In almost a decade since I wrote this review for the first time, I've heard a lot of comments on the movie. I think it really needs to be noted that this movie is not the "ultra-liberal" anti-nuclear tirade that is often tagged as tagged. <br /> <br /> While the creators and stars are (or were) "Hollywood establishment" liberals: what this film attacks is not the idea of ​​atomic energy, but the idea of ​​human greed, corruption and fallibility, which questions the possible dangers of something that has already made nature dangerous. <br /> <br /> No one who accepts reality can dispute the fact that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least likely to be fatal. Close friends of mine, who worked for several years in a nuclear power plant, even told me about their employer's official policy regarding the maximum "safe" exposure their employees could handle. <br /> <br /> You do not have to believe that corporations are inherently evil to accept that individuals are greedy and often corrupt looking for wealth and power. And even if you refute this claim, you can not deny that all human beings make mistakes. When it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation, we can not afford mistakes, and that's more than anything the argument that this film tries to do. <br /> <br /> Condemn it if you have to, but try to have a little perspective. We are currently in a war whose ongoing outcomes are quite different from those originally predicted, an incredibly costly, endless war. Whether you think the war is necessary or not, to fight global terrorism, you can not deny the fact that the length, the financial cost, and most of all, the loss of human lives are the values ​​backed up by the "experts." So far, we were in 2003. Even if none of those involved are greedy or corrupt, "mistakes were made" and errors of a fairly serious extent. The same serious failures that may occur in the nuclear industry could make much of the earth's surface uninhabitable.
