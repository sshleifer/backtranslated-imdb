The very first talking picture has returned from oblivion, and now you can hear and see it! In the fall of 1894 William Dickson, associate of Thomas Edison, at the Edison Laboratory complex in West Orange, New Jersey, attempted to combine two existing technologies (the phonograph and the kinetoscope) to combine image and sound. In this case, Dickson was unable to synchronize sound and image playback, so this experimental film was never released to paying viewers ... and so (unlike many silent films Dickson made for Edison at the time) he has none official title. The silent picture (recorded at 40 fps) has been in the Library of Congress for years and has become known to movie historians as a dumb curiosity. It was also known that the "soundtrack" was recorded on one of the raw wax rollers languishing at the Edison National Historic Site ... though no one knew which. <br /> <br /> But now that has changed. Recently, curators located the paraffin cylinder broken into several pieces. These were reassembled: a reproduction was obtained and the sound was digitized. Hollywood soundtrack editor Walter Murch has cleaned up the background noise and tweaked the digitization to sync it with the film image that Murch digitally compressed to 30 fps. Sound and picture are finally synchronized! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the voice of an offscreen man: "The rest of you ready?" Go straight ahead!' (The invisible speaker remains unknown, but was probably Dickson's assistant.) On the screen, Dickson plays a violin in a huge funnel mounted on a tripod (one of Edison's sound recorders) while he's beside him In front of the camera, two male lab assistants hug each other to dance a short ballroom at the pace of Dickson's music. <br /> <br /> The movie lasts just 17 seconds: just long enough for us to wonder about this rude technology before being provoked to laughter at the sight of two men rolling in each other's arms. By the way, here's a WARNING: A well-known but very inaccurate reference book ("The Celluloid Closet" by Vito Russo) contains a picture enlargement from this movie and calls it "The Gay Brothers". This is wrong. 'The Gay Brothers' is a completely different film shot by Dickson in the Edison lab over the same period. "The Gay Brothers" never had a soundtrack: it's a short feature film about two brothers who are NOT "gay" in the sense of Russo. The late Mr. Russo, for his own reasons, wanted us to perceive Dickson's experimental sound film (probably the first film musical!) As an artifact of nineteenth-century homoeroticism. (Hmm, what about gay men and musicals?) Sorry, but there is simply no such content here. <br /> <br /> This vital movie deserves a rating of 10 out of 10. As I have often said, no "lost" film should ever be deemed irretrievable unless deliberately destroyed. I am pleased to announce that this movie is finally available to viewers as its producer intended, more than a century after it was shot!
