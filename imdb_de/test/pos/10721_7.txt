Beyond the words is about this heartbreaking story of a divorce that leads to a tragic custody battle over a seven-year-old boy. One of the great strengths of "Kramer v. Kramer" is the screenwriter and director Robert Benton. who adapted the novel of Avery Corman wonderfully to the big screen. He keeps things pretty simple and very realistic while delivering the drama straight from the heart. His talent for telling such emotional stories was to prove himself again with Places in the Heart, where, as in Kramer v. Kramer, he showed that he has a natural ability to work with children. The other strength of the picture is the great acting that rightly received four of the film's nine Oscar nominations, two of which were winners. One of these was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor), who is outstanding as a frustrated businessman Ted Kramer, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. As Ms. Joanne said, Meryl Streep claimed Supporting Actor Oscar for a strong, sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. Also nominated Jane Alexander for her fantastic turnaround as a good friend of Kramer Margaret. The final word in the drama must go to the young Justin Henry, whose unbelievably moving performance will bring you back to tears, and a well deserved Oscar nomination came for him. Brilliant is also Nestor Almendros' Cinematography and Jerry Greenberg's contemporary editing, while Henry Purcell's classical piece musically comes into play. Truly, this is a touching story of how a father and a son as a wife and mother depend on each other's leaves. They grow together, get to know each other and form a completely new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new attitude to life and slowly realizes why Joanne had to leave. <br /> <br /> Certainly, if nothing else, "Kramer v. Kramer" shows that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child, especially not the child itself. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 10, 1995 - TV <br /> <br /> Strong drama from Avery Corman's novel about the pain of a man Custody dispute between estranged parents, both of whom care about the child's wellbeing. In addition to an outstanding screenplay and an amazingly controlled director, both by Robert Benton, it is the superlatives that make this image a winner. Hoffman is as brilliant as Ted Kramer, the man who was torn between his career and his dive, the son he desperately wants to keep. Excellent is also Streep, since the woman lost in eight years of marriage and had to get out before she became a person nothing. To support these two is a very strong Jane Alexander as a mutual friend Margaret, an outstanding Justin Henry, when the boy is trapped in the middle, and a top cast of extras. <br /> <br /> This extremely emotional drama that breaks the heart It was more than the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor (Hoffman) and Best Supporting Actress (Streep) of 1979. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - TV
