One of the best, Lackawanna Blues <br /> <br /> Great movie, great cast, great music. This is one of those movies that are so good that you wish that when the movie is over, it would take another 90 minutes. I will observe this many times. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that will grab you from the beginning and emotionally twist and pummel you throughout the feature. The cast is extraordinary without the slightest indication that anyone in his role is uncomfortable. You feel that you are really there to do all of this. Great care was taken in the stage sets, costumes and music of the time. The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the film progresses, but Ms. Merkerson's consistent performance is so powerful that the movie ends before we've been filled with the wonderful misdeeds. Picking someone other than "Nanny" is an injustice, because we have very good performances from experienced actors, including: Jeffery Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But it's Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Ms. Merkerson who make this experience a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> The movie moves fast and is short by today's standards, but without question is one of the best movies you make. I'll see you again this year. If you like good periods that challenge you emotionally, tug at your heart, lift you joyfully, and knock you at the same time, then this is the movie for you. I have shown it to several friends and everyone wants my copy, that says it all, the movie is so good. See for yourself. <br /> <br /> Dancability-1, Amsterdam Holland
