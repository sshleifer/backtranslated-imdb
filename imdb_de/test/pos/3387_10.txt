I have 2 complete sets of time life. This is my favorite movie of all time. Love all actors and actresses. Awesome picture. Dear Patrick Swazy. This is the movie that showed his true talent. But he gets no recognition for the ad he has preformed! In these films, a lot of credit was overlooked. They love the depiction of the dry and dusty monologues of the Civil War. They make of it one of the greatest love stories of all time and show through all the obstacles of life, what true friendship means How two divided countries split up. But all and all friends remained solid, even if the war divided the kinship and the friendship can still remain today! Simply the best ... Gone with the wind does not compare to this movie. Patrick Swazy at his best. After seeing this movie a hundred thousand times. I became a big fan of Swazy. And since then I have followed his career. Got all his movies after doing North and South!
