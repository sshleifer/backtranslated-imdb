I saw "9 souls" at the 12th Athens International Film Festival (September 2006), where Toshiaki Toyoda, the director of the films, was also present and answered many questions from the audience. This street movie is about 9 fugitives, who are very different from each other. They decide to travel through Japan together with their red van. Every time the van stops, we see these 9 fugitives trying to escape their past, to build a new life, or to realize a dream. No matter how hard they try, it seems impossible and their violent past follows them and leads them to their final destruction. <br /> <br /> Although this is a very pessimistic film, it is not a dark movie. On the contrary, it is full of beautiful pictures, surreal elements and elegant humor. Toyoda's heroes can not escape their "prison" and face a divine (?) Penalty for their "crimes." These are small pieces of a beautiful painting, where the Tower of Tokyo, represented as a giant knife, is turned upside down!
