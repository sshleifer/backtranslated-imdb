A letter to the boys. I tried guys, I really tried! I tried so hard not to see this movie. I would leave the room when it was on, or jump on the computer if the woman watched it. This is her second favorite movie, the godfather is the first one (which I love). <br /> <br /> I ended up seeing small parts of this movie and finally, after about a year, I actually sat with her and looked at him. I can not believe I say that, but I loved this movie. Dalton plays a great Rhett and has his weakness. Whalley plays a delightful Scarlett. Full of fire and sulfur and NOTHING will stop her. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when she is in (Ireland?) Abroad and the government is going to demolish a farmhouse because they are in the background the rent. Scarlett gets angry about it and pays the entire debt and makes a name for himself in this little town. <br /> <br /> Everything I say people say you might want to try this movie if you're a fan of Gone with the Wind. It takes a bit to get used to the new actors, but I think you will refresh them.
