I have been waiting for this movie for some time. I was glad that everything was expected. The writing of this film has been designed to go far beyond what the audience sees. I found it amusing that so many viewers do not read between very important lines, but if not, the film makes sense in another way and is very brilliant. The film has many stories and characters woven around this one kilo character, a man who has risen from the streets under much suffering and has become a very powerful criminal. After spending some time in jail, Kilo finds a gap in the judiciary and is released by a disquieting turn of events, only to find that not everything is as it seems. Kilo Introduces himself to the higher social sphere and political rule, to make clear how important the word of a man is and what he stands for. A war begins as the street hollows itself against the masters of wealth and corrupt power. <br /> <br /> An explosion of explosive and powerful nonstop twists. This movie will fascinate you. I think the cast of this movie is great and not a movie that should be ignored. Excellent. Rent it today!
