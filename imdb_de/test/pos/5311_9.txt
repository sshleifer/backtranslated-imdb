Few can understand Leland's character, and to do that, you're most likely innate to see both sides of life, and it's very hard to face that reality and can lead a few to bad deeds (like Leland's character ), but for such sadness and genuine reasons that his intentions were good, in the sense that the intention to protect others from physical or psychological (in this case) pain persists for long periods of time. and it's really sad how most everyone in this movie makes mistakes, but the one character who does one by good intentions gets killed by it. The lesson of this film is that the unique person sees, recognizes, corrects or inspires the real life situation that you see and sees, or someone who can correct a wrong situation. But beforehand ... you have to see both sides of something and streamline it for a long peace and for the peace of all human life.aka-don't BE IGNORANT
