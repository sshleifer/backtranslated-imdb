Dylan and Bobby are childhood friends and they love the way young boys are sometimes. But Dylan has met a girl and starts to put these boy things aside. Bobby knows he does not care about girls and misses what he did with Dylan. <br /> <br /> Partly cheesy 80s pop video, part home cinema, part video reminiscing, this film tells a confusing and sad, yet all-too-fitting story that will be at home with many who see it. <br /> <br /> This movie brings back many memories and impressed me a lot, but I wish the filmmaker had gone a bit further and left a happier note. Yes, we all love and lose, even when we are young, but there is always tomorrow, especially when we are young.
