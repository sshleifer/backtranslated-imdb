eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality in which characters run from area to area, from landscape to landscape, trying to beat a game that they do not know, or not exactly the destination they are leading them to. There are several layers of virtual reality games in this virtual reality game. To question what reality they come from is the "real" one. Of course, it's not spectacular to hide the fact that this is not the case, a reasonable response to a true reality, instead questioning the idea of ​​whether it's a real or a video game, even to the very end. I'm not even sure that Cronenberg pretends Twist is not there, it's so unbelievably obvious that it's kind of disturbing. <br /> <br /> However, the problem with this film is, in a sense, its basic nature. Cronenberg questions the reality AND criticizes the gameplay. The same things with which he criticizes the gameplay revel in him: Violence, discontinuity, lack of concentration and, so to speak, the Pixellation, even if there is no such Pixellation in the film. I've heard people say that Cronenberg's violence is actually a critique of hyperviolence in the media, but he hides so well with the fact that it's so much fun, new openings in humans, animals, and amorphous piles of biological mud What is brilliantly written and done in this movie is the use of video game notions (not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes, relative lack of environments or Environments that do not make sense There are very few people who seem to have many, and vice versa (all that stuff) along with the motive of penetration - they definitely deconstruct video game reality in a disgusting and absurd way, but they do does it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal "pods" of biological matter that writhe and shift and, honestly said, disgusting are disgusting degrees. The movie triggers a reaction. <br /> <br /> But why? It criticizes virtual reality, but it is a film: it is its own virtual reality. It seems to criticize the banality of video game plotlines and character design, but it retains this banality. It definitely seems to be feared that killing a video game character is more alright than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their real-life actions, and yet Again, it is extremely gratifying when people, objects, animals, things and organisms are torn to bloody shreds. <br /> <br /> Although it has a main attack focus, it does not matter, not really. The only thing it does is that fear is presented in such an original way that it is not really possible to deny its own glory. <br /> <br /> In a sense, it would be much easier to hate this movie for being bloody and violent, because there is no good reason why I can love it, and yet I can not say it is mediocre or bad to ignore. It would be easier to just not be able to take it, but since I can, I can not do anything with it. I think it's a bit exaggerated, it really did not have to go as far as it went, but Cronenberg's intentions are so confused and confused that I do not know if that was Cronenberg's mistake or Cronenberg's point of view. I think there is really no way to find out, unless you ask him directly. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
