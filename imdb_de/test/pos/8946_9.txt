Two funeral directors in a Welsh village? English humor unlike the other stuff from across the Atlantic? How could I resist? My wife and I saw it on March 6th for our belated Valentine's Day celebration, and we both had some good guts. We wanted to see another movie later, but decided not to, because we wanted to wait for the experience of this movie to stay with us for the evening. It raises questions that are rarely talked about in the community, but I know three funeral directors, and the humor is right with the money. Without them all the actors, directors and the others will not have a job on a Monday.
