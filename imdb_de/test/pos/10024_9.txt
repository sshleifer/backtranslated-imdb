While I can not say if Larry Hama has ever seen one of the old cartoons or not, I would think that writing these cartoons, flashcards and some comics would count for something. For fans Of the old cartoon, this is pretty much a sequel to the same, except for a few new characters - and a crazier Cobra Commander. <br /> <br /> We still have all the old favorites, but on a personal note, one thing that has always irritated me was this "Duchess-Responsible" thing, when instead tons of other * officers * in are near. The main trick here seems to be the CGI. Overall, it's pretty good, if not overdone.
