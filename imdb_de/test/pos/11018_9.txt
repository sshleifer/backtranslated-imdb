I was prepared for this movie because there was nothing else to see. I was immediately sucked by the characters. <br /> <br /> Robin Tunney is nothing short of spectacular in this movie. Her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% credible. That's really not easy. She does it fantastically. <br /> <br /> We know that this movie will come to an early end, but you can not take your eyes off it. The characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies, where people do stupid things because the plot requires them, these people do stupid things because they're out of their minds - and the things they do agree with their characters /> <br /> This is just a great example of IMHO's film production. Great writing, great acting, great direction. A movie for people who believe that film can be more than just thoughtless entertainment.
