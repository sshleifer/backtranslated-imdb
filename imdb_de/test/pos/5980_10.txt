Larisa Shepitko's THE ASCENT (1976) is an extraordinary, grueling account of the partisans' struggle against the Nazis in German-occupied Belarus. The ascent reflects Russian obsession with the horrors of the Great Patriotic War, but is both unusually religiously symbolized and ready to acknowledge the existence of the less than great Russian collaborator. The true struggle is not with the Nazis, who hover in the background as mere extras, but between the Russian Nazi investigator and Sotnikov, the captive partisan, who finds the spiritual power to go undefeated on his death. With its many references to the crucifixion, the story takes heroic proportions and glorifies the suffering of the martyr and his influence on future generations. A remarkable work.
