Most people do not even know that this movie exists. Fox, who paid Judge for it, left it in the can for quite a while and then spent nothing to promote it. I think that made many people think it was one of the garbage films that were washed out in late summer. Well, I'm here to tell you that this is a fun and rather scary look at a future that is not that hard to believe. Basically, Judge believes the fools outperform the Smart by a long way. Then those fools get fatter by basically spending all their time watching TV and having sex, producing stupider people. By 2500, a person of average intelligence today will be a genius who speaks "all wavering." Seriously, that's really hard to believe. Oh yes, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is a great time traveler, hopelessly trying to return to a more comfortable time. Where this story will reach its cult status is in the numerous funny lines, such as "we can make them in the family style" and "Hey man, I hurry here!" This is a fun movie and a pretty sharp social commentary on an American society that seems to be exhausted with self-indulgence, comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee you that I'll buy it on DVD the first day it comes out and about.
