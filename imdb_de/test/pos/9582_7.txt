Long before Terri Schiavo brought the issue of life as "vegetables" to the public, "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg" dealt with it. Alan Bates plays Bri, a schoolteacher whose daughter is almost completely crazy. He and his wife Sheila (Janet Suzman) try all kinds of dark humor to master their lives, but they can not shirk the facts. At one point, they even consider euthanasia. The question that surrounds her and her friends is: what will become of this predicament? <br /> <br /> With this film, Alan Bates continued his series of really good films, which were preceded by "Zorba the Greek", "The King of Hearts" and "The Fixer". We can say with certainty that he is sadly missing.
