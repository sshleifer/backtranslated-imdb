"Thriller" is still the biggest of the pop music promos with a storyline, great visuals and a tip-top song that wraps the movie. Michael Jackson was at the top of the tree at that time (and was not so changed in his plastic surgery that he played a role). Here he is in good shape - the song is fantastic, he leads the zombies in the dance like no other. <br /> <br /> Ola Ray plays the girl who watches in disbelief as her sweet friend (Jackson, Natch) transforms into a werewolf! Then to the pulsing rhythms of the opening line, "It's just before midnight," he stamps with the other zombies and creatures of the night around the cemetery. <br /> <br /> The culmination of all this is the fruity voice of the great horror star Vincent Price speaking in the middle of the record. Great.
