I work in a nuclear power plant, so I get a kick out of those answers. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I do. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Nuclear_Generating_Station and you can see where I work. <br /> <br /> I could not imagine a safer industry in which we can work Smaller events such as papercuts. Any problem identified as a potential nuclear, radiological or industrial safety issue will be reported immediately in the process of corrective action. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Nuclear power plants in the US are at the forefront of their minds
