This is the kind of film that may need to be viewed several times to capture all of its beauty and intelligence (like Frankenstein's Curse of 1957). If you do not like odd, non-mainstream movies, stay away from this masterpiece. For me, the artwork alone in this movie is worth the purchase price of the videocassette. The plot is a bit fantastic, but it seems to be a reality in today's world. Produced in the 1980s, the film is a prophetic vision of Big Government and Big Brother who want to control and monitor us. <br /> <br /> There are many slow sections and the dialogue can be quite difficult to catch in many scenes {that's why I've seen it 6 times}, but if you can digest everything, it may turn out to be yours Be worth the time. The film is basically about a world in which humans have become robots who have lost their individualism. Their concern is only to accumulate and multiply. The hero of the film does not succumb to this disease and was not "tagged" and monitored by a big brother. His mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply that will change the mindset of human robots and make individualism a part of humanity again. At that time, the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the images are absolutely mesmerizing. If you are open-minded, this film should impress and its prophetic visions are daunting.
