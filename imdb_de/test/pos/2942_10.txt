I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we were all excited! It's so sweet and heartwarming, a real jerk! I was still thinking about the story after watching the movie. It is a wonderful story about the difficult things that all families go through. I really recommend this movie to anyone looking for a Saturday night rental. With your friends, your family and your friend it will all be fun! : D It's a real story about a real family that would attract someone's heartbeat. Not to mention beautiful scenery and fantastic spectacle. Look, I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!
