It is no surprise that Larisa Shepitko was married to Elem Klimov, who later staged the most terrible war film ever made, "Come and See" (1985). "The Rise (1977)"? Shepikto's final finished film before a premature death? is built in almost the same form. The film, set in World War II, follows a pair of Soviet partisans trying to secure food for their starving army as they dodge the German occupation forces. The first forty minutes are excruciatingly tense as the two men haul themselves through the rough, snow-covered landscape and the world around them is full of life, warmth, and color (in fact, the landscape is so monotonous that it literally took them long) to realize that the film was shot in black and white). <br /> <br /> Following the arrest of German soldiers by the partisans, the film becomes a cold meditation on loyalty and morality. While Sotnikov refuses to betray his army even under extreme pressure, the less resolute Ryback (Vladimir Gostyukhin) attempts to rescue himself. Is he wrong to do this? Ryback's betrayal is daunting, but the film does not immediately denounce that his actions are treacherous; Instead, the viewer must consider how he might react in such a situation. Shepitko regrets Ryback while the Bible regrets Judah. Both men had betrayed their allies to the enemy and were forced to watch them in their execution. But while Judas committed suicide (at least according to Matthew's Gospel), does Ryback even consider this option closed? In a painfully tense climax, the belt around his neck is opened. <br /> <br /> "The Ascent" draws its emotional power from Shepitko's amazing quest for realism. I do not doubt that the two main characters climbed for days with hands and knees on the snow-covered earth. Your misery is actually so convincing that I actually got a cold while watching the movie (seriously, I did)). Interestingly enough, the film throws up this reality several times as Ryback imagines himself trying for freedom and then being gunned down by his German kidnappers. While this device is unusual, it works well with its biblical allegory. Ryback is facing a process of his worthiness, and given a new dilemma on every corner, he consistently chooses the selfish alternative, his own life the only crucial criteria. He's still alive at the end of the movie, but the nightmare of war and guilt remains.
