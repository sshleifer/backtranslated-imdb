It's awesome! A sick and twisted story of chance and fraud. <br /> <br /> The story is meticulously constructed. It really is a perfect mix: it has everything from suspense to humor and the story is told with a lot of originality ... The film is built like a puzzle, which is piece by piece assembled and dissolves the story ... For the audience there there are many surprises until the end !! I also had a small impression that the director was inspired by some Hitchcock work. I have also seen movies that have the same event from different angles, but this movie goes beyond that. In this film everything is based on what happens to a body that appears and disappears and reappears in another place. Every actor in the story has his own secret and we'll see it in a way that helps put the puzzle together. I especially loved the dark humor scenes ... that made the whole theater laugh, is a must for everyone!
