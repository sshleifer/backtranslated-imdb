Before I discuss this movie, I have to make a confession that makes more of a brave statement than a reviewer. Anyone who has read my previous reviews may know that I've always been controversial in an unobtrusive way, rating flops like "Captain America" ​​and "Creature" from 1985, and film classics like Alistar Sim's Panning brings "A Christmas Carol" and "Shakespeare in Love". With that in mind, this confession should come as no surprise: <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. Woah, do not start to drive me crazy. Let me explain: I certainly do not believe that he is the greatest actor in the world. I admit that he is not. He's certainly not Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins, but I'd say his acting skills are probably somewhere up there with Bruce Willis. What I admire about him, however, are the human qualities he brings to his action heroes. He is just an average person who laughs and cries and bleeds, who is a hero because he has to be, not necessarily because he wants to be. I think it takes a lot to highlight those qualities in a character (especially in the movies he's worked on), and Lambert's heroes are a long way from Schwartzenneggers or Stallone's heroes. Honestly, it's easier for me to relate to Lambert's characters. Therefore, he is not the best actor in the world ... He is just a personal favorite. <br /> <br /> I can not say that for his films. As much as I exempt his acting, it would be foolish not to admit that his choice of films left much to be desired. Most of them, frankly, are terrible, and any mockery he has gotten from me over the years is not because of his acting, but rather because of his bad choice in scripts. <br /> <br /> In that sense, I can say that his debut film "Tarzan" is one of his best films and probably his greatest achievement. As I mentioned earlier, it is effective because the humanity he brings to the role and how seriously the director, writer and actor deals with the material. This is a big jump from the 1940s B-Movie action adventures with Johnny Weismeller. In fact, I would hesitate to call it an action movie. Instead, it is a serious drama that all the material from E.R. Burrough takes seriously and shows Tarzan's search for his true family in Scotland after realizing that he does not fit as a "white monkey". He is torn between his old and his new family, which also includes a wonderful Sir Ralph Richardson. When he tries to adapt to humans, his monkey instincts also appear, and he can not decide what he loves more: his real family or the one he always knows. All in all, it's a wonderful commentary on society and a wonderful character study. If nothing else, Lambert became internationally known in the 1980s with films like "Highlander" and "He Sicilian." Unfortunately it did not stop. But wait a minute ... His recent career moves like "Gideon" and "Resurrection" have shown that, though he still has a long way to go, he is a competent actor, perhaps to make a ... um ... comeback if he just chooses his roles better. <br /> <br /> At the moment, however, is the verdict on his first film: <br /> <br /> *** out ****
