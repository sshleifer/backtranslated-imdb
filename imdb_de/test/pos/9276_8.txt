I suspect there are several sections of this document that make the rounds. The copy I saw focused heavily on Joe's erotic films, pointing out his horror output. There are plenty of X-films that are featured in their X-Class, and EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA's legendary "snuff" movie (the breasts are cut off) gets a generous screen-time Joe is informative and sincere. He is a modest, articulate gentleman and discusses his interest in a shocking audience, why he wanted to mix eroticism with horror and how he was responsible for making one of his performers gay. <br /> <br /> His friendship and collaboration with the Indonesian beauty Laura Gemser is as touching as his indifferent attitude to the hardcore shoot. Joe D'Amato embodies an incredible time in the Continental Cinema, which is now over. It's great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his fine, unique work. <br /> <br /> RIP, Joe.
