I was born in 1946 when I saw this movie for the first time. He left a deep impression. Not only scary because he does not have a better word, this movie has been following me for more than 50 years. John Larch's mob goon was scary The only scene I've remembered in those 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the thoughtless policeman who calls her a "little kid." These words were replaced when the film was shown recently on television, maybe there are two versions of the movie, or someone felt forced to change that heartbreaking scene a bit. Exactly or not, the film has come a long way to formulate my opinion of the South and to this day the next I 'am in El Paso to visit a southern city. This stand may seem extreme, but the story is a bit more. When the film was shown recently, it became clearer why he persecuted me for years. With the newsreel, the film began to give the impression that what is being shown is factual. The film is probably filmed only a year or two after the incidents presented, which enhances its realistic credibility. The terror in the movie is not delivered by creatures or space aliens, but by people living in our society at that time. Killing a Little Girl The recent consideration helped to clarify the impact on my 8-year-old mind. When this movie came out, the only school I ever visited was mainly attended by African Americans. The victim looked like a girl in my class. It was like seeing a real murder. It made a terrible scene even worse. Maybe nobody will find this review helpful, but it helped me.
