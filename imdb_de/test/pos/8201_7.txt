Angela (Sandra Bullock) is a computer expert but since she is shy and withdrawn, she does all her work from the confines of her home. Just as she is on holiday in Mexico, a colleague sends her a computer CD with disturbing information. Angela agrees to meet with her colleague, but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. Angela goes to Mexico, but takes the disc. As she basks on the beach, she makes a great-looking gentleman named Jack (Jeremy Northam). She falls on her and the two land on a boat to Cozumel. However, Jack works for the people who generated the secret information on the CD, and he's on it. Even as Angela escapes from the clutches and returns to the US, Jack makes it difficult.
