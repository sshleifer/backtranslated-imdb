Isabel has just gone out of jail. She is determined not to return, but life is difficult for ex-convicts, especially if they are homeless, like Isabel. When she finds the one who was her friend Rufo, she sees a light of hope, but Rufo is now not only a junkie, but also an AIDS patient. This will not make Isabel surrender, because if there is a will, there is a way and she will fight for her future to lead a normal life with a home and a family. A very hard and touching film that has not been noticed by most Spanish cinemas. The actors are great and the story is very touching. Maybe a better treatment of the minor characters would have improved the movie, but it's really good. I highly recommend it, but it's not a Disney Happy movie, it's tough and dramatic.
