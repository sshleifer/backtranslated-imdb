Lifeforce begins in outer space, where the HMS Churchill tracks Haley's Comet. His equipment detects a 150-mile extraterrestrial spaceship in the comet's head that can not make contact with Earth due to interference. Colonel Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback) decides that this is the only ship's chance to investigate. Go out in space suits. Carlsen and some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship to find the remnants of a bat-like race of creatures and three perfect-looking humanoids, two men (Chris Jagger and Bill Malin) and a beautiful woman (Mathilda May) whom they take aboard Churchill. Thirty days later and on Earth, Churchill is discovered on radar, a rescue mission is only sent to determine that the spacecraft is burned and the entire crew is allegedly dead. However, the rescue team finds the three humanoid aliens and returns them to Earth, where they are resurrected in a space research center in London and begin literally sucking the life force from the human victims who then have to do the same. Stop, in dust things are looking grim as the epidemic spreads throughout London ... <br /> <br /> This English production was produced by the notorious Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus, which in the early '80s was for a lot Cheap money was responsible for low-budget action flicks under their production company Cannon, usually starring with Chuck Norris, and they wanted to pull in the big time and signed director Tobe Hooper to a three-movie deal (these were Lifeforce The Invaders of Mars (1986) Remake & The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) (a sequel to Hooper's own classic), which all come together and both Golan and Globus and Cannon were basically bankrupt. Even so, although I was a commercial flop at the box office, I have to say that I think Lifeforce is a most enjoyable, if pretty stupid, sci-fi horror. When Lifefore first hit the cinemas in 1985, Golan & Globus shortened Lifefore to 101 minutes. In recent years, however, the longer cut of 116 minutes has been almost completely replaced on DVD, VHS, Laserdisc & TV, although apparently it was Hooper's original cut. The movie ran for 128 minutes, so there's more footage somewhere. I will lean on the longer 116-minute cut. The screenplay by Dan O'Bannon, Don Jakoby and uncredited Rewrites by Michael Armstrong & Olaf Pooley is based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel "The Space Vampires", the travel is really ambitious and you get the feeling that in the end a bit chaotic, but damn entertaining. It moves like a rocket and basically there is a really interesting story here, even though the movie is turning into a tangle. There are also some fun moments in Lifeforce, the scene where the security guard tries to convince the naked female vampire by offering her a half-eaten biscuit, a true camp classic. The terribly overwhelmed hypnotic scenes including the scene where Railsback kisses Patrick Stewart and many, many more. I do not know, call me funny, but I just thought that Lifeforce was tremendously fun and entertaining in every way, from stupid characters, weird dialogues, weird ideas that never quite come together and some great visuals that Lifeforce is certainly not. A movie who will bore you. <br /> <br /> Director Hooper had almost more money to play here than he ever had (twice as much as he had for Poltergeist himself in 1982), and he's using everything to get something out of it. Bring it Spectacular movie on the big screen, John Dykstra, the man responsible for Star Wars (1977), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and recently Spider-Man (2002) has been widely used for visual effects. They look fabulous , In particular, the sequences that use space ships in space look great, there are also some really good visual effects on Earth, including the destruction of London, as hundreds of blue souls fly around everywhere. There is some nakedness, but not much blood, there are withered corpses, a few gunshot wounds, someone's skin comes off, blood gushes from eyes, nose and ears and there is a severed arm and some zombies. The special make-up effects are also very good in general. I would not say that Lifeforce is scary, because it's more a sci-fi movie than a horror movie. I loved the way Hooper shoots the space sequences as he turns his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness "solid" ground, so to speak. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 25 million, it made up less than half what cinema did and did not set the world on fire, either on video or on DVD, which is a pity is because although it is a bit chaotic, it is very nice to look at. Filmed on location in England. Well taken in 2: 35: 1 widescreen format, the 4: 3 cut-out picture is horrible and cuts off huge chunks of information from both sides of the screen. This is particularly noticeable during the opening scenes in space, where it is sometimes hard to tell what is going on & the feeling of the vastness of space & the alien spaceship is lost. Acting is fine in a very stupid movie, Patrick Stewart replaced Sir John Gielgud, Nancy Paul's replacement for Olivia Hussey, Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinski, while Anthony Hopkins rejected the role of Caine Movie, no two options, really and anyone who looking for something simple and straightforward, should look elsewhere. Anyone looking for something different in the science fiction genre than choosing Lifeforce is one of those who are so bad that there are good movies with impressive effects. It is by no means an average run of mill film.
