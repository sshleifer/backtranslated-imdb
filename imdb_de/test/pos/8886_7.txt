Inspired by Hitchcock's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN concept, in which two men exchange murders to defend themselves against the two people who mess up their lives, THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN is an original and very inventive comedy. It is thanks to Danny DeVito that he played in both this little comedy gem and in this little movie. ANNE RAMSEY is the mother who inspired the movie's title, and it's understandable why she gets under the skin with DANNY DEVITO a sharp tongue that relentlessly holds him back for a minor offense. BILLY CRYSTAL is the writer whose wife has stolen his book idea and is now praised as a great new author. She even appears on the Oprah show to bask in the excitement he should enjoy. This is how DeVito comes up with the idea of ​​exchanging murders in order to free oneself from these harassing factors. Of course, anything and everything can happen when the writer Carl Reiner lets his imagination run wild with endless ideas of how the plot develops. And it's amusing all the way, lots of laughter and giggles along the way, as well as a lot of excitement. <br /> <br /> For lovers of black comedy, this is guaranteed to please.
