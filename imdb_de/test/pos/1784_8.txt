The lives of three different and distant individuals intersect with the brutal killing of an individual. The one-hour film shows only the event in which the three people come together only after half of the film. I have seen other segments of the "Decalogue", but this seemed to me the most economical in dialogue yet most intriguing in structure. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a law student pleading for a seeming defense for a man accused of murder. Obviously, the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full-fledged lawyer, but this will never be displayed on screen (at least in the short one-hour version of Dekalog 5). We have to imagine that this had to be the case. A taxi driver who is a misanthrope has two facets of his character: the good guy feeds a mangy dog, meticulously cleans his taxi, picks up dirty rags thrown by people who have no sense of citizens, and remembers to his wife while he dies; the bad side scares little poodles, refuses to take a drunk - probably worried that he'll puke in a taxi - and scoffs at pretty girls. The repulsive protagonist, who murders without mercy, drops stones from bridges in fast-moving traffic and pushes strangers into the urinal without provocation, is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh. Kieslowski's film and screenplay are thus the good and the bad side of two of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is not about the death penalty, but about a memoir about killing. The fifth commandment, "Thou shalt not kill," is theologically examined ("Even God spared Cain ..."), sociologically the tenderness of beasts for children and poor abandoned dogs and psychological (aftermath of a drunken night with a male friend) that led to the accidental death of his sister, whose photo he carries with him.) What makes ordinary people murderers - this is never fully explained, but there are many suggestions. <br /> <br /> In Kieslowski's world, there is such a pattern in which events and humans are interconnected in a cosmic sense (note the similarity of Clown to the killer as he hangs in the cab by the mirror). Kieslowski and the young idealistic lawyer seem to ask us to literally look at the command. In the figurative sense - why are we killing? Are people really legally killed? Is there a force outside of society (the drunken night that has led to the life of a girl) that makes us vile murderers? <br /> <br /> The forest for the trees would be missing to discuss the two det painful murders in the film - both without mercy. The film invites the viewer to think about why we are asked by God not to kill. <br /> <br /> I understand that a longer version of the film was made by Kieslowski. But even this short 1-hour version is outstanding with its sombre and sparse writing, the intelligent cut, the interesting cinematography and the first-class orientation, which offers much more than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> more healthy Decalogs 6,7 and 8.
