H.O.T.S. is the proof that the film industry at one time said "F-OFF" to the censors and made films with what they wanted! In today's world, this movie would be too "exaggerated" and "extreme" to be anywhere but behind a velvet curtain. Although BestBuy had multiple copies on his $ 5.99 rack (if anyone wanted a copy)! The film was brilliant in its own way, mixing humor into a T & A movie with Playboy Playmates! Unlike most strips of skin, it had an action. However, that's not exactly why you call H.O.T.S. would look at. <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. is a college movie reminding me of the revenge of nerds movies by taking a group of "average people" and putting them against elitist preps that most people can not stand! The only difference is that the "nerds" in this movie have a much better attitude than to put them! I notice that there are some people who would rate this movie as low, and for me that's ignorant! Obviously, this is not meant to win Oscars or break through barriers in the movie. If you're looking for it, look at whatever the critics are picking for you! You have to appreciate the fact that this movie actually had a funny storyline, decent acting (mostly considering the genre) and a lot of girls undressing! H.O.T.S. is one of those movies you see to free yourself from today's problems and daily stress and instead laugh and have a good time! If you are looking for a funny college-based movie that has enough skin to turn a pink Miata straight, then you should consider H.O.T.S. really try it!
