I have to admit that I had never heard of this movie before. I caught it on TMC last night. I found it hysterical. I laughed so much and loved the end. Imagine what a Marx brother movie would look like if he collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolm X and then dropped all the LSD points of most comedies today and surreal. I had to get up at 6:00 am and saw it by 2:30. I slept too much and missed my commitments. It is still worth it. I would not recommend renting it, I would recommend to own it. It was so good. <br /> <br /> The only warning I have is that the references are outdated and may not be sourced from younger people. Take it with you and use your head. <br /> <br /> I would have to put it in my best comedies of all time.
