It's a unique movie because we have our only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all its ironic splendor. Because he seems so reserved and distant, he is perfect for the role of an unloved cadre, who objectively uses everyone around him. In the deadly serious (no pun intended) final act, when Coward has to do like the Flying Dutchman, he is much less comfortable. <br /> <br /> But his path with an epigram is unparalleled, and Hecht & Macarthur have given him some jewels (really Macarthur - he was the joke of the couple). <br /> <br /> The film is brilliantly lit by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement except for a storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr took care of one thing - to get their dialogue on screen. (NOTE: H & M itself has Blink-and-You-Miss Cameo as a bum in the flopouse scene.) The most notable supportive player is the only well-known Alexander Woolcott, the notorious Broadway columnist and close friend of both Macarthur and Coward, who appears as one of the damned authors who has always waited in the reception room of publisher Coward. <br /> <br /> Curious that Woolcott would approve of a movie that apparently lost the urge The legendary Algonquin Round Table, whose founder he was, and Macarthur were something of an aid member. <br /> <br /> The Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for Best Story, though this win is probably more due to Coward's imposing presence every brilliance in the storyline. It's coward, Woolcott and the dialogue you remember ...
