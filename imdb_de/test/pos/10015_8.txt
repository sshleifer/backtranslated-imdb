Even if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's idiosyncratic work, you will be surprised by this extraordinary journey through the science fiction area. For once, not a single vampire girl wearing transparent clothes is in sight! Traditionally, the budget proved too tight to fully realize the director's vision. However, this is largely offset by his obvious love of genre cinema, his dedication to his craft and his ingenuity. The atmospheric cinematography of Jean-Claude Couty makes the most of the predictive locations, and Philippe Bréjean (a / k / a "Gary Sandeur") delivers a stunning soundtrack that, fortunately, does not resemble any of the juicy stuff he's composed for Hardcore. <Br /> <br /> Before and after working hours in and around a Parisian office building, most of the film was filled with pornographic regulars that Rollin was already familiar with. ck film release Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding lead role. When I play Elisabeth (pretty good, I can add), she made a hike one night on a nearby highway of Robert (Vincent Gardère) and drove home at the end of a long working day. Barely able to assemble the series of events that brought her there, Elisabeth seems to lose her memories just moments after the events, even if she forgot Robert's name and the role of the heroic Redeemer before the night flight in his apartment comes to an end. Before she loves herself, she rightly calls herself a virgin (thanks to Brigitte for being so persuasive in the line of being one of the more active adult actresses of the '70s) because she can not remember a single touch in front of his. Because of this skilful context, the relatively long sex scene that follows follows no more than the "other" commercial "interludes that Rollin had to put into other works to ensure funding. <br /> <br /> When Robert goes to work He has inevitably disappeared from Elisabeth's feeble mind, and a mysterious physician (comedian Bernard Papineau who is effectively spoken against the guy) and his menacing assistant Solange (celebrity porn star Rachel Mhas) go in and take her back during their protector's absence Here's where we get one of the strongest scenes in the movie, when she talks to her roommate Catherine (the late Cathérine Greiner a / k / a / a hardcore actress "Cathy Stewart" in a quiet voice) Both girls provide fictional shared "memories" for each other to overcome their inevitable fate Deterioration is not limited to the mind alone, but becomes painfully clear when served for lunch and Catherine can not control her movements when she tries to eat a spoonful of soup. It is also Catherine who can express the filmmakers' compromise with the demands of commerce while she urges Elisabeth to be naked and hold her, because sex is all they have now, after both the mind and the the physical abilities have left her. <br /> <br /> Several pretty explicit - if not hardcore - sex scenes form the middle section of the film, and French porn fans should join Alain Plumey (a / c / a "Cyril Val"), Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage A blink of the eye from future porn princess Marilyn Jess, whose rape of the hands, mouth and member of Plumey was only present in the rarely shown XXX version of the movie FILLES TRAQUEES. The crucial part of Véronique, a girl whom Elisabeth seems to almost remember and wants to escape again with, is wonderfully treated by Dominique Journet - her unforgettable debut - who would play a sizeable supporting role in Franco Zeffirellis LA TRAVIATA. The six feet below the end show that the condition has worsened as a result of a nuclear overlap, and the quarantined "patients" ultimately leave a barely breathing empty shell unceremoniously placed in a fiery furnace. The final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elizabeth approaches total collapse and a wounded Robert stumbles across the railroad bridge clumsily clasping the outstretched hands of the other.
