This movie has not been seen by me for several years. It came on the Disney Channel early in the morning. I stayed awake and saw it even more entertaining than the first time. The story, the scenery and the characters are as good as they come. I know if somebody takes the time to watch this movie, he'll definitely see it a second time. It is very memorable in many ways. I would recommend this movie to anyone as it is entertaining and educational for all involved. <br /> <br /> s
