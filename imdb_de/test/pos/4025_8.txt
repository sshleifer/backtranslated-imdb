We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival and liked it. <br /> <br /> This film was about the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and above all fear of their own shortcomings. The three main characters, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo, fit well with their roles and are excellent. It was a pleasure to experience the dynamics between the three, as it seemed real. <br /> <br /> I think that Barbora Bobulova is an outstanding point. I hope that we will see much more of her in the next few years. <br /> <br /> This movie is not easy. Thumbs up for the Italian team that put together this film. Highly recommended.
