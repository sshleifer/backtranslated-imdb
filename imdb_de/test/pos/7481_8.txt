I love the premise, but the replay value only applies to certain parts (of course, the opening scene). Some characters are a bit outrageous, but they are still entertaining. I think ballping sh-t has pushed it. I know, to show that Nick and Casey lived badly in LA, and to show why Casey left the lifestyle, I just think the story of the flashback might have been better. Even the Jamaican guy who knocks on the phone is smart and entertaining, but I think the story was told sloppily. It really seems to be incredible. Actually, I believe in Swordfish (the other movie Woods wrote) more than a few pieces on Thursday, because the government has kept a secret all the time and set up organizations that the public will never know about. <br /> <br /> Thursday is the best Quentinine movie I've ever seen. I think Woods is inventive, smart and funny. His work, however, needs more maturity to even get to the Natural Born killer script (not Stone's Movie). How old is he anyway?
