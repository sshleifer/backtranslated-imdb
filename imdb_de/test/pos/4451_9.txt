This film shows a serious side of Fulci's often gore-fest work. Not much blood and courage, but a nice story about murder and the life that affects it. <br /> <br /> A true find that was made in 1972 and will soon celebrate its 30th anniversary /> <br /> Take a look, but be warned, it's hard to find! <br /> <br /> Ron
