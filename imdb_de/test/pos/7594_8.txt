There are worse ways to spend an evening than to watch this movie, though this is a bit predictable. Drew Barrymore is a very good job at being the nerd nerd in this movie - an excellent casting choice. I find it hard to believe that the beloved girls are finally accepting her - in my experience, this crowd has a longer memory than that, and knowing how AWFUL Drew's character (ostrich feathers?) Was miles away at the start of the school year, regardless the rumors that her brother drummed. (And does "Kole Slaw Food" really make him so popular? I doubt it). As far as Drew's character is concerned, to be a great reporter, I hoped she would have a story long before the prom. A bit invented. Despite all this, it was a bit of fluff that will be entertaining as long as you do not expect too much.
