First of all, I have to admit that I had some doubts about the director. He has made several films (with Jarkovsky) on the recent "Czech = Eastern" story or more precisely on families (individuals) as they have survived some historical moments. But it was always sour-sweet like the Chinese food. This movie was completely different. It was pure, it shows the bones of life, it shows the variations of human nature. This movie is an excellent work of art (story, drama, picture, music), but it shows you the life around you in much brighter light that we do not want to see. Incidentally, I saw it on a DVD (with English subtitles), but I'm afraid I will not get it in the US.
