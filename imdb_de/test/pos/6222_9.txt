A wonderful film in the best Scandinavian Eldritch Magic tradition with a far-sighted analysis of the big problems we are currently facing. <br /> <br /> Should be mandatory for all politicians. <br /> <Choose between privacy, nuclear sustainability, global climate change and quality of life. <br /> <br /> Reminiscent of Thoreaus' Walden, but with a modern twist and a lot of humor. <br /> <br /> I am not Finnish, although I have traveled there and have good Finnish friends, but I found it totally accessible and also culturally informative.
