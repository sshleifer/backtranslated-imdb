Mickey Rooney (as Mi Taylor) is a young man who ruins the figurative street where he meets twelve-year-old Elizabeth Taylor (as Velvet Brown) - she loves horses but has a sad story with the animals. Mrs. Taylor is in love with Mr. Rooney's horse sense. She takes him home and puts him down with her family. They are very well supported by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp (as Mr. and Mrs. Brown). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's strained siblings. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy of "National Velvet" is not plausible for a mistake; For example, the circumstances that led to Taylor's ride in the "Big Race" are quite long (but probably more credible on paper). Still, the characters' connection to horses and Ms. Revere is very good. Rooney and Taylor are outstanding in the lead roles. There is a balance between the fading "kid star" of Rooney and the exuberant new "kid star" by Taylor, which adds depth to their traits. <br /> <br /> The outstanding achievements of Rooney and Taylor are further enhanced by fine-tuning photography and editing by Clarence Brown, Leonard Smith and Robert Kern. A sentimental classic. <br /> <br /> National Velvet (14.12.44) Clarence Brown ~ Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor, Anne Revere
