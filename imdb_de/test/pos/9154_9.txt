Great silent version of the story of Francois Villon. Although starring in the thirties as IF I WERE KING, with Frank Lloyd Director, Preston Sturges Scripting and Ronald Colman, this version is even better. Barrymore's comedy comedy plays the cartoon jerk and the wine-driven Villon with an enthusiasm Colman could not find. The photography is amazing in its beauty and innovation and in the minor characters. Especially Conrad Veidt in his American premiere, the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day, and the accompanying comics Slim Summerville and Hank Mann are stealing every scene they find themselves in. <br /> It's a shame that Barrymore made so few first-rate comedies , Among his sound films, only his leadership in TWENTIETH CENTURY and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can be compared to that, and they only stand up for his outstanding voice. In this silent movie, Barrymore has to tell his story without words, and he does it, alternately scary as the King of Fools and tender as Villon in love. He can even jump around in the confusing style of Fairbanks, most convincingly. He also lets his fellow mates enjoy a certain fame that stands out in this ensemble work like any talented comic of the era. Finally, a short word about Alan Crosland, a director who today is known only for directing The first talking film, THE JAZZ SINGER, was released in the same year. Crosland was a careful, innovative and wonderfully original director, and it is a shame that more of his works are unknown. Perhaps this film, which is far more interesting as a film than its most famous work, is an introduction to its other talents. If so, you could make it much worse.
