Jean-Pierre Melville is a director I recently met (I need to see Bob le Flambeur and Le Samourai to fully understand her), but watching Le Cercle Rouge (The Red Circle, allegedly based on a proverb in Buddhism) I realized that I was watching a crime film as skillfully as I had seen it for a long time. Although his film has a dialogue, he should mainly keep the scenes of the film in motion and hold on to the plot. What kept me in seemingly trivial scenes / sequences was the emphasis on the movements or patterns of behavior of the characters. Melville has set out his story, and he takes the time to tell it (which may seem boring to some, but it seems to work, as it emphasizes the weight of the characters / environments a bit more). , <br /> <br /> Take a look at each of the four main players: Alain Deleon as Corey (who has just been released from prison, plans a new robbery), Gian Maria Volonte as a bird (escape and escape from being handcuffed) Prison), meets Corey by luck), Yves Montand as Jansen (an old pro with years of experience in weapons, a friend of Vogel's) and Andre Bourvil as Mattei (an experienced investigator looking for bird and his inner affairs the toes). Each of these actors plays his role with precision and distance, and each has his own moments that show the audience what his personality might be as criminals and cops. The heist sequence gives little clues, such as Bird Cops-A-Feeling of a female statue walking through the corridors or how Jansen takes out a bottle and has just a hint of the content (and what a dream this guy is. ) creates). Even Corey's movements, which include a photo of a woman, arouse interest. <br /> <br /> By capturing and cooling the story and the skills that make it possible (via the cinematographer Henri Decae, the cut and the music of Eric Demarsan), it is the people on screen who win the fascination how they stay true to their nature and their ideals. It is not a movie that French new wave enthusiasts should miss, and modern criminals should take the 140 minutes to enjoy the atmosphere of Melville's work. A lovable piece of filmmaking, which is still one of my absolute favorites.
