I think the basic idea of ​​any movie is to talk or inform. If you want information, watch real films and historical films. Sometimes these are the same. The other side of the coin is entertained. Did Hitch entertain me? Yes, it did. Okay, the formula is standard. Boy meets girl or in this case boy met girl. They come together, fall out and get together again. The way it was done in this movie, however, was refreshing. I especially liked the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. The Allegra Albert romance was a joy to watch the unfolding. Most REAL men are shy when it comes to courting the woman of their dreams. If I had Hitch Rat, I would probably have put my wife on the altar in half the time. The first commentary on this film, which suggests that this movie was played safely and laughed well, has had a few more laughs. I do not tend to have so many laughs that you can put in a romantic comedy without making a fake out of it. In addition to relationships, there are also serious moments. All in all, I found Hitch quite entertaining, the actors did a good job (I'll look for them in other films) and Hitch is a movie that I'm very happy with in my DVD collection.
