I just want to say that the movie was good and touching. The movie tells you the true meaning of being saved or born again, and is very well laid out. The drama was pretty good, but could bring some improvements. The story board is catchy and when my church had youth ministry and we looked at it, 8 people gave it life. I just want to tell everyone who reads this, give your life to Christ and repent of your sin. Please visit www.lifeofacristian.piczo.com. Thank you, Andrew. <br /> <br /> The word of God does not become invalid. So save yourself and repent of your sin!
