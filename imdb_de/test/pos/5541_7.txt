I'm not a fan of this comedy brand - stereotypical characters exaggerating by a farce from cops and robbers. But there are enough sympathetic characters to arouse interest. Michelle Pfeiffer is adorable, but the person who really wears the movie is Dean Stockwell, who steals every scene as a boss gangster (called Tony, not less). <br /> <br /> Stockwell's performance is the reason why I write this report (and the only reason why I would recommend it). They are tickled by his on-screen time. He plays the mob boss perfectly, with comic touches in the right places to avoid a presumptuous clich√©. In fact, Stockwell is a real pleasure to see - a master of the "Double Take" and a real "looker" in these stylish suits and feathers. <br /> <br /> Meesa Says: A good film that can be seen when folding clothes or eating leftovers.
