This movie is a hard to find gem! It's the story of Juliette, a regular cleaning lady who works in the large corporate headquarters of a yogurt company, and Romuald, president of the same company. He does not acknowledge them, he does not notice anyone until several plans to snatch his company from him are taken all at the same time. He is lost, nobody to turn to, no one to trust when he discovers Juliette. As a cleaning lady, no one cares about her, so they say and do incriminating things that she finds smart enough to get used to her helpless and hapless boss. The complications are wild, she is not as ordinary as it seems, with five children from five different former husbands, all still in love with her, and he is not as astute as he thinks he is. This movie does not follow a predictable path and that's what keeps you in the picture. The spectacle is great and there are also some moving moments along the way. The working class is smarter than the one above them, much like "Gosford Park" showed that the upper crust is not everything it has in mind. I highly recommend this movie. See it! 9.10
