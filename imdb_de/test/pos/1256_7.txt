The Child - At age 39, Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he does a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful home, and earns a lot of money. But everything costs something, in this case no social life, no conscience and fear to spend the rest of his life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie, I kept wondering why Disney did not pass on this movie to Miramax - not because it is particularly daring or nervous, but because it is clearly a movie for Adult. This is reinforced by the marketing campaign, which clearly targets children. It is packed with followers for "Rugrats the Movie" and "Pokemon 2000" (not already passe). But I doubt. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject - instead of the typical male mid-life crisis in which a miserable fool buys a Porsche convertible and behaves like an idiot, Willis' character takes on some serious self-observation and inventory of his life. His guide on this journey of self-discovery is himself at the age of 8 (they never explain how Rusty arrives, and honestly, I did not care). The innocence and unrestrained optimism of Young Rusty give him a distinct advantage in finding the truth - he sums up Russell's job as an image consultant: "They teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they are not." But for a good script to work, you need actors to bring it to life. No problem here. <br /> <br /> Although Willis thrice W.C. ignored. He once again failed Fields' warnings about starring children or animals, making fun of both Breslin and Osment. Willis manages to reconcile Russell's daring Powerbroker traits with vulnerability and confusion without being ridiculous. In the meantime, Breslin is giving away a childhood child - the kid who for some reason has always been burned and packed. We also have two bonuses: Lily Tomlin is an excellent assistant to Russell, and Jean Smart is perfect as a revealing charming anchor woman (I loved her in "Guinevere"). <br /> <br /> The Kid is charming, heavy, and genuine. And it will appeal to adults of all ages.
