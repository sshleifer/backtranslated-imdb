I saw this movie the other day at the Santa Fe Film Festival. I loved the honesty and the humor. It was the most thoughtful movie I've seen in a long time - I just can not get it out of my mind for some reason. It can not be for everyone because it makes you think. I do not know if people like to think about movies, which is a pity. The actors who play the Franklin's are quite a find. I could not imagine playing these complicated people so openly. Although I think some of the supporting characters were not as good as the Franklin's, I can totally forgive it - because I think that's an important movie. I did not expect it to be that good, but since I've been thinking about it for a few days, it turns out to be a very relevant entertainment item.
