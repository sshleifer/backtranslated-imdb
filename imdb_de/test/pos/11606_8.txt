I saw a 2 hour version of Choker Bali. I can not say that will take long. The film has a certain natural pace and does not seem to fade at any time. The costume and set are reminiscent of what we would see in old movies. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai has done a good job. It is indeed a mature role with enough room for maneuver within the story. The script also supports the story very well. Aishwarys is the unlucky widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage. The film is about the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict with which she is confronted at this time with the run-down condition of the widows. <br /> <br /> Your best friend in this movie is also well-played by Raima Sen. Her innocence and admiration for Aishwarya's ability to speak and educate English has been very successful. These are indeed some of the prevalent mindsets of the time. We can see how far we have come from such an era! <br /> <br /> The film speaks of the liberation of women as a subtle line of history. I found the development of the story very similar to Ghare Bahire also written by Tagore. It attacks some actions from the struggle for independence and faces the struggle for independence of India against the silent struggle for the rights of women. <br /> <br /> A well-made film that is absolutely something to be seen. Aishwarya's drama: par excellence. Rituparna has treated the story with great care. Another classic from Rabindranath Tagore.
