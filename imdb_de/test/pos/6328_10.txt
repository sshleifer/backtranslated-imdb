A funny trumpet full of silly, if not sometimes cruel jokes. Not the best movie, but definitely worth a visit. David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual charming personalities with Granger as a particularly delightful and refined gentleman. Ava Gardner as wonderful as ever, with such a charming character that is absolutely irresistible. The storyline is typical but full of surprises, especially with regard to the unconventional relations between Granger, Gardner and Niven.
