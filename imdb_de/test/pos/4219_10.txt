I know this movie is not for everyone, and I will not voice my opinion about you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie ... It was the best thing I have ever seen! !! It was soooooooooooooooooo weird and although it was not the scariest movie I've ever seen, he kept me on the edge of my seat because I did not know what would happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have to see them!
