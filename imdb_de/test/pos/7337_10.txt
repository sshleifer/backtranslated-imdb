This movie was beautiful and touching. It touched a place deep inside me and I'm not sure why. I am a happily married woman and never had a lesbian bias, but mine, this movie almost made it what I long for. The choreography, the plot, the dialogue ... the film was a work of art. <br /> <br /> The summary without spoilers is that a gymnast is dissatisfied with her life and is looking for something, anything. She is with a man who does not want a baby, but she does. He's not mean to her, but he does not treat her the way a woman should be treated ... I guess he does not really appreciate her. Over the years, she has stayed in shape and decides to go back to the gym. She meets another woman during her acrobatic training and an intimate and beautiful relationship unfolds. Throughout the film, she has another friend with whom she trained at a younger age, and they have remained close friends. <br /> <br /> The relationship that develops is ... understanding, comfortable, intimate but sexy ... something that could only exist between two women. The kind of relationship that could really make sense in your life. Someone who makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful and confused. <br /> <br /> The relationship with her close friend is beautiful in a different way. They have a close and intimate relationship. Your friend showed me what a true friend really is. Someone who is understanding, straightforward, REAL, fun with someone who is there for you no matter what. Someone who is supportive, and you can team up with your deepest secrets. Someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets. <br /> <br /> The story is simple in the fact that it was not exaggerated, but was in no way suppressed. It leaves a lot of sensual images to capture the moments. The dance and the choreography were stunning. I could watch it over and over again. The way the artist captured the feelings and emotions of the main character was. The dancing and the pictures were very dazzling and fascinating to look at. What a cozy story! I fell in love with this movie. If you have a chance, rent this and have a look !!
