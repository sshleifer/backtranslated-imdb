In Russia, the normal teenager Vera (Natalya Negoda) lives a relaxed life with her drunkard father and her simple mother, without working and waiting for a call to a technical phone operator. Her brother Victor (Aleksandr Negreba) lives in Moscow with his own family and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and Vera. When Vera meets the student of the University of Sergei (Andrei Sokolov), they fall in love and decide to marry. Sergei moves to Vera's house but lives in conflict with her father. This relationship leads the family to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> I just saw "Malenkaya Vera" and I really liked this deep family drama. I'm not familiar with the lifestyle of the former URSS, but there are some unusual behaviors that I find very interesting. The first time Victor tells Vera that she got pregnant, not because her parents wanted her, but because they wanted to move into a bigger apartment. Another when the family goes to the beach in a truck. Many of the difficulties facing Vera's family and friends, repression in the park, and other situations depicted in the film are commonplace in Third World countries. This low budget movie is very targeted and the story is very profound and real. The cast has great performances and the actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful. On the cover of the Brazilian VHS, which was published by the Sagres distributor, is the information that Natalya Negoda was the center of the Playboy magazine. I am not sure how accurate the subtitles are in Portuguese, as many long sentences in Russian are limited to short translations in a few words. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Pequena Vera" ("The Little Vera")
