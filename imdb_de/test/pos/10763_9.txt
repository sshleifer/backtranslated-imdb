I really enjoyed fierce people. I discovered the movie by accident and searched my on-demand movie lists to find something interesting. The film is mainly about teaching in America and quickly gets your attention. The characters are smart and articulate and the story does not follow the usual rules of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is Finn, a precocious but underprivileged 15-year-old who spends his summer with the Osbourne family. Donald Sutherland plays the Patriarch Ogden C. Osborne, America's seventh richest man. Diane Lane plays Finn's mother, a friend of Ogden, who is also an ordinary cocaine consumer and a slut. The Osbournes own a large estate and seem to live by their own rules. At first they look charming and refined, but the super-rich are different. They are used to finding their own way. The movie is especially enjoyable because it has an intelligent dialogue, a great show, and a story with unexpected twists. It's also a R rated movie, so it's not completely healthy. <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. Anton Yelchin is believable and sympathetic in the demanding role of Finn. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. Chris Evans is impressive as a wicked grandson of Osbourne. Kristen Stewart is good as a pretty granddaughter. High quality film.
