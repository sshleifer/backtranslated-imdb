In one of the better films of the year, Tom Hanks plays as a Congressman Charlie Wilson a starring role in this sardonically witty and extremely current (given quite recent events) historical comedy drama about the Afghan-Soviet fiasco of the 1980s. The Soviets attacked Afghanistan and killed hundreds of people. Why should anyone care? People are dying, right? No, the reason why the United States was implicated by Charlie Wilson was because the Afghans were illegally coming to Pakistan for fear that they would be blown up, which in turn deposed Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. To alleviate this problem, Charlie Wilson worked with the sixth-largest woman and religious fanatic in Texas, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), and an amusing and robust American CIA spy, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), to supply the Supporting Afghans with high-tech weapons to destroy Soviet fighters who wanted to attack their land. <br /> <br /> Although certainly not a serious Oscar nominee for Best Picture, "Charlie Wilson's War" is probably one of the best of the many political films of the year. Oscar winner Mike Nichols provides solid direction, as is to be expected, while Emmy award winner Aaron Sorkin (Sports Night, The West Wing) provides a remarkable script that almost perfectly balances comedy and drama. The drama is great for the most part too. Tom Hanks is delivering his best and most gratifying performance since his Oscar nomination in 2000 as a FedEx worker stranded on a tropical island in 'Cast Away'. Hanks takes on a slimy character like Wilson, making him a sympathetic guy with his typical charm. Amy Adams and Ned Beatty are as reliable as ever, but the movie's truly outstanding performance comes from Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman is arguably the best actor in the film industry today, and plays a minor role. From his first scene screaming at his boss before violently breaking his window, he sucks you in. The only disappointing actor is not surprisingly the Hollywood starlet Julia Roberts. Roberts 'frantic walk through another movie, Roberts' overbearing and exaggerated portrayal of a wealthy oil woman from Texas, hits all the wrong notes and is usually annoying. At 97 minutes, the movie is short and sweet, and that does not mean that he does not pull in some places, but when he's pulled, it only takes a very short time. <br /> <br /> In summary, "Charlie Wilson's War" is by no means a perfect movie, but definitely worth a look. Note: B +
