* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I thought Pitch Black would be pretty enjoyable, with some nice effects - I liked the bigger beasts even though they are not aliens from the alien series. There was a pretty good atmosphere, which I thought Vin Diesel helped to do. <br /> <br /> One thing that somehow surprised me was how it rained. If the planet has three suns and has almost daylight, where did the moisture come from to form clouds and therefore rain? <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that Fry died in the end - it reminded me of the New Hollywood movies of the 1970s, with the main heroine not going all the way through.
