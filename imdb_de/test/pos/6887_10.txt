This program is a favorite of our family, and we believe that it has to be released on DVD after seasons !!! The title of "Promised Land" is very appropriate as it is a positive statement about all the good that has remained in this great country and the people who live in it! It's a kind of "God Bless America" ​​program with inspiring stories, old-fashioned values, down-to-earth characters, truthful and encouraging messages, beautiful scenery and well-written humor and drama. It's a show that will benefit and benefit the entire family without worrying about bad language, adult issues, cruelty, violence, and so on. We always felt blessed when we saw an episode and can not wait to see them every time they finally released on DVD!
