"Journey to the Other Side of the Sun" (aka "Doppelganger") is an entertaining science fiction offering in Twilight Zone style by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (the team behind Space: 1999: UFO, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL-5 and Other). In the film, Roy Thinnes (from the "Invaders" TV series) and Ian Hendry as astronauts sent a flight to a planet that has an exact Earth orbit, but on the other side of the Sun; therefore not previously visible. An obtrusive European director of space flight (who died of Patrick Wymark) can accelerate the flight and the astronauts are good to drive after hard training. So the best sequences in the movie, the takeoff, the flight and the landing on the "other" Earth begin. Dazzling rocket miniature (by Derek Meddings) and a dreamlike, elegant space flight (reminiscent of the best moments of "2001: A Space Odyssey") are slight highlights of the film. The landing on the "Doppelganger" earth is both exciting and scary. After that, the Twilight Zone aspect of the movie sets in; with an almost entirely from the classic TV episode "The Parallel" action lifted. Apart from that, the movie is still a solid science fiction game, with a few intriguing "mirror world" things (for example, reverse writing and left-handed handshake). Less successful are the scenes depicting an earth from the middle of the 21st century. where all men wear turtlenecks and nehru jackets and all women wear miniskirts. Some of the relationships with women in the film are also very "non-PC" by today's standards. And the computers, phones and other hardware are (in the most consistent case of most 20th-century science fiction) big, colorful and clunky (straight out of Patrick McGoohan's The Prisoner). Nobody foresaw the age of the digital microprocessor! If you can take those mistakes in the foresight, the movie is very interesting, with a solid lead performance of Thinnes as the disturbed astronaut. And with a nice nihilistic end of the 60s / early 70s! For fans of retro sci-fi (like me) this is a "journey" that's worth it!
