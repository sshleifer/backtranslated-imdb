In a time of bad, if not terrible, comedy, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air. It's one of the 5 best comedy shows of all time, in my opinion. Nothing has been so good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are weird geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to call someone a comic genius. These guys really understand what's funny. I could see ten episodes of Seinfeld and would not get half of it once I saw KOQ. Other funny people on this show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (Carrie's boss). I am so happy that they have managed to get so many seasons from this gem. The show was a funny winner in a time of mostly weird losers. Check it if you do not have !!
