A touching film about a talented woman fighting a society and a love she structurally underestimates. The themes are subtle and timeless, as many of the problems between man and woman in Dutch society still exist today. This film pays homage to all modern women without engaging in feminism. Not only is the story well told, the drama and scenery are great too.
