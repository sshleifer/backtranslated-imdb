To be honest, the original concept of Sleeper Cell fascinated me. After seeing the best part of the series on FX Channel (UK), my Sky went bankrupt, which means I missed the crucial final. But from what I saw about it, I assumed it was a great story, good acting, and since I did not watch "24," I loved it, and it was confirmed for a second season ...> <br /> One the best TV programs I have seen. Much more realistic and credible than "24." Excellent character development and action. Do not beat Islam, but give a thoughtful and thoughtful approach that shows the difference between radical terrorism and true Islam. Everyone should see this show! <br /> <br /> Stringy xx
