Has the drama, suspense and character development you would enjoy if you like a drama that engages and entertains and educates you. The authors know their material and it shows. The direction is always engaging and not bubbly and the spectacle is terrific. Why this show has not won prizes tells me that the "powers that will be in Hollyweird" do not know drama or anything else in this regard. <br /> <br /> There is a twist in this episode that was in the end quite surprising and played very well. I am glad that it was not used as a shock scene for a climatic end of this series, which would have been more typical and boring. Rent this series at once! Let's hope it's brought back from celluloid extinction.
