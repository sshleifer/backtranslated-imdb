Typical Spanish production - slow moving, but with great sensuality and sexuality, which is soaked by the leading actress Paz Vega. (Look at them in "Spanglish"). Great sets, lots of color - you see Cordoba, Seville, the Spanish mountains and the countryside. The storyline tends to meander here and there, but if you follow it closely (I've done it, even though the film is in Spanish), you'll understand the gist of the matter. <br /> <br /> It's about how much The extremely sensual, young Gypsy woman Carmen uses her feminine skills to seduce men to make her bid. Carmen is sent to prison after attacking a cigar at the cigar factory where she works. She persuades Jose, the soldier who is responsible for putting her in jail so she can escape. Jose succumbs to her charms because she speaks Basque (he is Navarrese and speaks the same language). Jose is punished with a month in jail and demoted to foot soldiers. Later he meets Carmen at a party and they eventually become lovers. But Carmen refuses to tie himself to him and continues her lascivious and flirtatious lifestyle. In jealous rage, Jose kills a soldier who was with Carmen. You then have to leave the city. Life on the run makes Jose a bandit. Meanwhile, Carmen remains the same, a wild woman with much promiscuity. In the end, Jose loses his mind and kills Carmen. <br /> <br /> The story is told by Jose in prison waiting for his execution. The person he tells the story is Prospero Merrime, a French writer and anthropologist whose fancy watch (she plays Beethoven's fur Elise) was either stolen by Carmen or Jose. <br /> <br /> It's worth paying attention to the sets of the delicious Paz Vega.
