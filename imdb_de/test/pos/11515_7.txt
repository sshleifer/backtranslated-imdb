This is an important historical film because it was the first all-talking feature film. <br /> <br /> The movie was shot for only $ 23,000. <br /> <br /> More than $ 1 million was spent on publishing. <br /> <br /> This film has all helped define the gangster melodramas that were to become the nuts and bolts of the Warner studio in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this movie ended the silent era more than the more well-known precursor of the part-talkies, the Jazz Singer. The film deserves its place in history rather than as a footnote. <br /> <br /> The only actor you could remember today was Eugene Palette.
