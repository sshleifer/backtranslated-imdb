"Think like a Dinosaur" was a well produced and executed show of the "Outerlimits" series. The actor (Enrico Colantoni as Michael Burr) plays an impressively good and convincing protagonist role. You can actually identify with him and his "thoughtful" feelings about the girl he's fallen in love with (because he's been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until "Kamala" with a timidity his life comes with fear of fulfilling the task of transport, comforting her and letting her know that everything will be fine, which is a delusion for both of them, something bad happens and she (prototype) comes back ... and You (clone) are sent to the other planet of the inhabitants, and although the Dino and "Micheal" do not yet have to figure this out, it's up to Michael to decide whether to kill them or let them live However, before the meeting with her (Kamala) happened, it was very similar to what happened to his wife, and his wife died similarly.This show testifies to irregularities and griefs through most of it..About what should be done and They are at the 50/50 value of the right side of wr ong. Therefore, the "equilibrium" equation that is only there is not a person. <br /> <br /> 10/10 I would highly recommend seeing this show.
