Do not let any reviews (critics, IMDb users or mine) influence you when watching this movie. I just read the plot and became fascinated. After watching this movie is in my opinion definitely worth seeing. It gives an insight into life that many probably did not consider. However, it is not, as Leland himself says, a film that "can be packed in a neat package with a bow and everything else." Other user reviews on this website claim to have a psychological background and imply that the story is not feasible. Obviously they have missed the whole point of the movie, which is disappointing. to say the least. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a well-made movie with good direction. The story is not a good feeling, but I feel that if you do not feel well, you might have missed something. To call it an "art house" is, in my opinion, unfair, but since our society likes labels, this is probably what fits. If you find out that you know everything about the world ... I would suggest skipping these. If you think that movies should be a form of escape from the world ... you will not find them here. But if you see it, you may find something in it.
