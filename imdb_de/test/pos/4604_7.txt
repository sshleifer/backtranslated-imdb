The Black Castle is one of those films that have found their way into a Boris Karloff collection and are unfairly expected as a horror movie. While Nathan Juran's film contains some horror elements, this is truly a multi-genre piece that is strictly produced and effectively portrayed. In addition to Karloff, Richard Greene, Stephen McNally, Lon Chaney Jr., Rita Corday, John Hoyt and Michael Pate join in a small but decisive role. It's not surprising from Universal International Pictures produced. The plot shows that Greene's English gentleman travels to the castle of the sinister Count of Bruno {McNally}. He is investigating the disappearance of two friends, an investigation full of dangers and surprises on every corner. <br /> <br /> This has everything a fan of the old Dark House / Castle subgenre could wish for. Real good and bad guys, a pretty girl, dark corners for dark acts, fiendish traps, ticking clock finale and we even get a good old-fashioned bit of bells and whistles. The cast are all in effective performances, especially Greene and the wonderfully sneering McNally. While Jerry Sackheim's writing is lean and free of the pointless filler that has often stuck to similar films of this kind. A highly recommended film on the reservations that Karloff fans know is not really a Karloff movie and, more importantly, that horror fans do not expect that blood letting is part of the agenda. The Black Castle is a beautiful atmospheric story with a sense of fear. 10.7
