Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There she meets a couple and other swinging couples. They all live in this huge, very touristy hotel with a huge pool. One evening there is a pool party with "real" dancers. It is very apolitical and very cheesy. Later, Emanuelle finally has her photo shoot, which turns out to be one of those drive-through safaris (though the photography is great). Throughout the film, Emanuelle tracks every man she encounters. Photography is very well done in this film. There are scenes with cascading waterfalls, galloping giraffes and ancient ruins. Alone for the soundtrack of Nico Fidenco the movie is worth seeing.
