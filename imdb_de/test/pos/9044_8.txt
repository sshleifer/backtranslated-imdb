This is a Disney movie from 1972. I was 11 years old then and really enjoyed this movie. I felt nostalgic and bought the three serial DVDs of the Dexter Riley movies. Even with 46 years I still enjoyed them. It was about fantasy, magic and fun. And it is still! I was not sure which of the three films came first, then the second and the last one. Now I have the official dates. On December 31, 1969, the computer was wearing tennis shoes - on July 12, 1972, now you see it, not now - on February 6, 1975: The World's Strongest Man. I still think that the middle film was the best. The special effects were amazing for us children in 1972. I definitely recommend it to any age.
