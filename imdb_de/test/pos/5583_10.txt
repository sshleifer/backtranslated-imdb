I also remember that I saw this movie as a teenager in a local small theater showing foreign films every week. It was the bold adventure that has remained in my memory ever since. Particularly impressive was the scene with Noel Purcell as the old sailor Paddy, who has drunk too much, seen or heard apparitions and died of fear in a cave. Decades later, I kept an eye on Noel's career because I saw him then. There is also a younger Cyril Cusack as a miserable boatman James with pretty Jean Simmons designs showing Emmeline as an adult. <br /> <br /> Would like to have a video of this haunting movie and update my picture reminder of it. Where do I send my request?
