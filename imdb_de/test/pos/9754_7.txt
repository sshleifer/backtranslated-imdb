HUNT FOR JUSTICE is a Canadian television drama that has made it onto DVD, and that is a reason for gratitude to those who are starving for educational dramas that inform us about facts of current history that are somehow buried in the media. The film is not a Hollywood production, it relies heavily on footage from court records, but it also shows many of us the heroism of Louise Arbor when he brought the trial of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic. <br /> <br /> Louise Arbor (veteran of Canadian actress Wendy Crewson) is a Canadian judge appointed by NATO as the chief prosecutor for war crimes at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The film begins in 1996 when Arbor travels to The Hague to face the political obstacles that prevent the Tribunal from bringing to justice the war criminals who led Yugoslavia in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia crimes against humanity Form of genocide, extermination camps and other vile attacks. Progress in the persecution of criminals is hampered by generals (including William Hurt) who fear a great world war if the appropriate precautions are violated. With the energetic help of their translator Pasko Odsak (Stipe Erceg), their collaborators, including Keller (Heino Ferch) and the unexpected support of British Captain John Tanner (John Corbett), Arbor cries out with the impossible task of advancing all responsible parties to court three specific events. Two of the three main suspects are captured, but during their trials, everyone comes to an end. This leaves only Slobodan Milosevic himself, and Arbor and her colleagues succeed in 1999 in bringing the war criminal to justice. <br /> <br /> In narrating this well-documented story, stories, some touching subplots are used that makes the point in the story more personal. Some find the footage of corpses and prisoners and extermination camps too strong to look at, but they are necessary to bring the purpose of the film home. Wendy Crewson has the power to bring the message home - the message that war crimes should never go unpunished. There is much current story to learn from this film: The authors Ian Adams, Riley Adams and M.A. Lovretta have condensed the information and made it dramatic. Director Charles Binam√© balances the docudrama with the progress of the story and never forgets that he also has a story of intrigue to tell. HUNTING FOR JUSTICE is well worth it! Grady harp
