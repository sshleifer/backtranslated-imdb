This movie is the smartest comedy I've ever seen. Many jokes are either a parody of another movie (Star Wars, Dragon Ball, Power Ranger, Kung Fu, etc.), or somehow connected to the story of everything (Otis) creates the elevator), many jokes are too modern Connected world and made fun of it, because it was BC (How the wheels of the horse cart are turning) Other jokes are just totally nonsensical, but also funny (like the famous scene where the dog runs after the Roman man with the little music ). In this movie, they mix pretty much any kind of humor. I've seen this movie 6 times and every time I look at it, I find other subtle jokes. (like the scene where Waldo belongs to the Egyptian crowd). It's the funniest movie I've ever gotten, finally a weird comedy that has neither toilets nor sex humor. Numerobis is also what makes the movie. Everything that comes out of this guy's mouth is weird. This movie is almost perfect, except for a few clich√©s, such as the fact that Asterix regains his power because he is kissed, that's just stupid. But overall an excellent movie !! 9.5 out of 10
