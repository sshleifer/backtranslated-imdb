After watching The Lost Child several times since its release in 1995 and reading the reader's comments (mainly on Jane Tennison's background and Helen Mirren's outstanding role), I find myself more than ever to be commented on. After the brilliant role, Robert plays Glenister as Chris Hughes. Even after 10 years, it is still one of the most credible ways to portray the complex personality of a child abuser bearing the weight of his own past. If you watch the episode for an hour and a half, you're always switching between feelings of love, and hate this guy who hates the severity of his actions. I have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor, but this always makes the biggest impression on me. Helen Mirren would never shine next to her without these wonderful actors. Praise for Robert Glenister!
