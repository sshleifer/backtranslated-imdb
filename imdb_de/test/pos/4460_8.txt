TORTURE A DUCKLING NOT (Lucio Fulci - Italy 1972). <br /> <br /> Definitely a top candidate for the craziest movie title ever conceived, and that's quite a hit in Giallo Land. Originally the film was even more absurdly titled "Do not torture Donald Duck", literally translated from the Italian title. A small Donald Duck character is briefly seen as a toy, but barely enough to make such a title, but apparently he was changed for fear of legal repercussions from Disney. I've wrestled quite a bit against Fulci's earlier LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN (1971), but here are all the right ingredients. A surprisingly effective puzzle, a good cast and a fanciful shot against an unusual rural setting. Everything is easy. I think that is rightly considered one of the most successful achievements of the director. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the background of a small mountain town in Sicily, where someone kills young teens. The most obvious among the suspects is a young woman, Maciara (Florinda Balkan), a self-proclaimed witch suspiciously exposing a baby's skeleton and inserting pins in the images. Guiseppe, the village idiot, is also under suspicion, making a weak attempt to benefit from the disappearance of one of the boys, and went straight into their trap. When Milan's a brisk newshound (Tomas Milian) comes to handle the killings, he immediately begins questioning the authorities' suspicions when he encounters two other potential suspects: Don Alberto, the local priest (Marc Porel), one with an open-minded attitude, and Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a bored young city woman with a troubled past of drug offenses that also has sexual relations with the boys in the city. Talk about your premium red herring. <br /> <br /> Fulci contrasts modernity with tradition and the newly built elevated road that leads through the Sicilian hills, past old towns where life is still rooted in tradition and superstition. One could debate the political stance of the film as The North vs. the South, or as a commentary on the virtues of small towns-the conventions of society in general-that are too often dangerously close to moral decay, chaos, and ultimately to themselves , Justice by the population. The film has often been slowed down because of its anti-Catholic tone, but it's hardly an important element here, except for obvious reasons related to the plot, which would betray too much. Compared to a movie like JoÃ«l Seria's DO NOT DELIVER US FROM EVIL (1971) that's pretty tame. Probably the rather unflattering portrayal of Sicily's small-town film (if another boy is killed, the local population portrayed as a lynched-back lynch mob) in Sicily is an occasion for an attack, but given Sicily's problematic relationship with the rest of Italy other Italians hardly problematic, I would think. The movie has fallen into oblivion too quickly to have much influence anyway. <br /> <br /> When talking about Fulci, the amount of Gore is usually a major topic of discussion. Although there are no eye-catching scenes, the film contains two very graphic scenes. In the final, the killer falls off a cliff and breaks his face on the way along the rocks with gruesome results (albeit not very realistic). And the chainstroke series with Florinda Balkan in the cemetery shows Fulci's penchant for sadistic violence. He usually does not stick to graphing what most filmmakers would hint at. Certainly one of the most terrible scenes in Fulcis repertoire. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a tight, well-written, powerful little puzzle that Fulci is keenly aware of, with an impressive cast of genre regulars like Barbara Bouchet, Marc Porel (not very convincing as Priest)), Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkan (damned like the witch of the city). <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
