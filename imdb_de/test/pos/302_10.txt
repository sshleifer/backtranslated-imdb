I decided that I have to extend my review for my favorite movie. Unlike other war movies that focus on the event, Apocalypse Now takes the viewer on a psychological head trip. The sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, but you can not take it out of sight. Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, Apocalypse Now slowly lowers its protagonist Willard (Martin Sheen) to madness, most likely in the same way Kurtz is delirious. The production of this film is notorious for its delays through the monsoon season and for Brando's unprepared performance (he read his lines of cue cards). There is a documentary titled Apocalypse Now: A filmmaker Apocalypse, showing that they all went through. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in every movie. While the helicopter's blade can be heard in slow motion and napalm falls into the trees, the song "The End" by Doors can be heard. The next shot of Willard is in his bed while the fan is on, so that the sound of the helicopter collapses with the fan. We are informed that he carries out special missions for the military, mostly assassinations. When he is given his next mission, he is stunned. "Charging a man for murder is like giving a ticket in the Indy 500." The man he has to kill was a distinguished colonel who has gone crazy and isolated himself with the tribes. Kurtz orders cruel deeds that are carried out by these people, and he has to stop me. Willard is not alone. He is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they see several battles. Along the way, they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore "Hoorah" about the war. Willard ponders that if Kilgore is as crazy as Kurtz might look. There are many scenes in which Willards are plunged into insanity: the tiger attack, the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese, the non-stop rain, the piled corpses, and the deaths of his crewmembers. When he reaches Kurtz's grounds, he is greeted by the villagers and a hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of killing Kurtz immediately, Willard begins to talk to him, and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. Kurtz, on the other hand, wants to die. He is fed up with the war and wants to perish as a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete, while at the same time a buffalo with several machetes is sacrificed by the people. After realizing that their leader has been killed, they worry him rather than kill Willard as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves. <br /> <br /> The cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking. The colors are grain free, which is rare in older films. I can see how it is subdued and admire the beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> The acting ensemble is terrific and everyone plays its part well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think he sees his role as a depressed madman beaten up by the war. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack and the soundtrack are insistent and set the mood for the movie. I wonder what instrument they used in this guitar-like sound when the credits roll? There were many parodies of this film, but my favorite quote is from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character of the same name in a police series behaves like an idiot: "Her character helps the show weirdly, Marlon Brando in the Apocalypse now. "Those who have seen the movie know why this is funny.
