Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I have never appreciated her as much as in this movie. She really pretended to be Adele August. I appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual personality and create a character that is truly credible. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman as Ann August helped develop the ideal antagonist as her characters evolved through the film. The movie was about her, so the other characters were more peripheral. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie at eight, but Susan received a ten of me for her performance. As far as relationship films are concerned, Beaches and Terms of Endearment have had a bigger impact on me than this movie, but I highly recommend it.
