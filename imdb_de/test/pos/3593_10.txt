David Attenborough brings his fascination for the wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode journey to all animals under the sea! <br /> <br /> The cinematography is amazing and really brings the screen to the canvas Stunning shots of these whales! But the best part is how they saw each episode, how they did it! Whether it's models of creatures or these stunning whale shots, they'll tell you how they did it in about 10 minutes! <br /> <br /> In 2001 we had some great TV shows on screen. But unlike this documentary gem, they're pretty lame! But even praising this documentary series as Best TV Series of the Year 2001 does not bring together the sheer brilliance that this series offers in high quality entertainment! <br /> <br /> Overall this is the best TV series of 2001 with no competition and maybe the best TV series of the 2000s!
