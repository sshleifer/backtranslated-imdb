And I love it !!! Wonder Showzen will appeal to a cult audience, and once it's canceled, selling DVDs will go through the roof. This is a very funny show in its own way. It's a parody of children's shows, Sesame Street. Our puppet figures are Chauncy, a yellow fur monster with a hat whose host we are. Clarence is a blue lizard that makes its own segments where it goes on the road. He is a strange dog who refers to himself in the third person. Wordsworth is the Kluge, whose brain always shows. Then there's the newscaster and the pink puppet. It's a very funny show, not really as bad as expected, but rather the situation. They take 7-year-olds to the streets, tell them what to say, and make mean jokes they do not understand. My favorite segments are Clarences videos, especially if someone does not want to be filmed. I prefer TV Funhouse, which was a similar show, but this is still a very funny show that I hope will take years. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** 1/4 from *** *. 30 minutes. TV MA.
