I saw this movie yesterday and can not stop thinking about it. I moved to Norway four months ago and have since tried to find the origin of the strange emptiness that I felt. When I saw this movie, I saw the brilliant snapshot of this company. Yes, that's all! I also found a great job with great pay and live with my Norwegian friend in a nice downtown apartment. But so far everyone I've met left me with that tasteless, empty feeling I've never had before - that's what this film is all about. Dinner parties with nothing to say, but emotionless comments, long silence, no stress, an eerie calm and a frozen smile of friendliness. This Scandinavian nightmare is perfectly reproduced in Den Brysomme. Watch this movie !!!
