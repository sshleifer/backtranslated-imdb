The DVD jacket in which this film appeared described him as "uplifting and humorous." These are not the words I would have chosen - not yet. I would choose a word like "gloomy", sometimes even "depressing". Which does not mean that it is a bad movie. It's actually a pretty good movie with good performances from the leads and enough uncertainty about what's going to happen in the end that you're watching. The uncertainty comes from the structure of the film - it seems to revolve around Ellen's memories of her mother's slow death from cancer as she is interviewed by the DA. So we know from the beginning that something suspicious happened in the end - the question is "what?" and who? "<br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger was very good as Ellen - the somewhat annoying daughter who has to give up her life and job in New York to return home to take care of her sick mother Ellen develops through the film - more than any other character - as she learns to cope with her parents' strengths and weaknesses.Her relationship with her father (William Hurt) is very interesting.My first impression was that she was pretty close Hurt was effective as the freestanding husband, who was not inattentive, but in the sense of being unable to deal with what is happening to his wife, and After all, as a cancer-stricken Kate, Meryl Streep was very persuasive in this role, seeking to live what was left of her life as satisfactorily as possible and then act with annoyance she felt about her increasing exhaustion. In a way, I kind of remembered "Ordinary People" as I watched a family struggle with this kind of crisis, though this movie was much less emotional. So not "uplifting and humorous" (with due respect for anyone who wrote the summary on the DVD sleeve), but in its own way very well. 10.7
