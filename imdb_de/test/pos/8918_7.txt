I have to admit that this movie was horrible, kitschy, sexist, badly dubbed and badly edited, but I loved it anyway. I first saw this movie when I was 14, and it has stayed with me ever since. For your information, this is very close to hardcore porn as I recall. It certainly let my juices flow. This strip gives the Swedish erotic a completely new meaning. It's a humorous approach to human sexuality as seen by hot, horny female aliens who, I think, are just looking for sperm for their dying race.
