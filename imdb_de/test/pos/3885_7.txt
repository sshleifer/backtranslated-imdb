Has the proliferation of relatively high quality broadcasts in the expanding television networks allowed people to produce, direct, finance and / or make stars in their own films that otherwise could not have done so? Is that a good thing? <br /> <br /> This film does not answer the last question in any way, but it seems that Jeff Curb without Curb would not have been able to eat I Want Someone Cheese. <br /> <br /> Like most new producers / directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece sighs far more sensitively than the vehicle he's best known for (Curb). And yet is it a sensitive guy movie? He is not really a sensitive guy. Sympathetic, sure. In fact, reliable. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is about is hard to say, I can only tell you what I've taken from it. <br /> <br /> I rented the movie because of the trailers, especially because of the scene of a consultant portrayed by Amy Sedaris, who informs James Aaron (Garlin) that a particular woman is interested in him, mainly because she is a "chubby pursuer". "I almost fell off my seat, just because of this scene, I walked to my computer to write a note to rent this movie, the reason - I thought the school counselor (Sedaris) was talking about Beth, played by Sarah Silverman I imagined a slightly romantic comedy between the foxy Silverman and the fat Garlin, I did not think the story would be original, but the dialogue would be snappy and the scenes would move at a satisfactory pace. I thought it was a comedy. <br /> <br /> It was intriguing that the movie had started that way, but then he took a much more realistic turn when Beth gave momentum, "I've never been before "That's how we live brutally, and that was completely realistic, I welcome the decision, it just means that Beth has now left the building and with her the only person in the film." James' relationship His mother was also interesting. At this part, I wondered if the whole concept did not start as a play. It had this complicated feeling. (The whole "Marty" movie inside a movie was completely lost to me, as I have never seen this movie before.) <br /> <br /> However, I had serious doubts about the character of James Aaron. Is it really possible that he had no serious relationship with 39? And he is an actor? That did not really agree with me. For me his personality was less acting and more entrepreneurial. I also could not really buy his everyday life. No doubt he was extremely disappointed that things did not work out with Beth. We felt that. But was it really important to him? <br /> <br /> Something else - how on earth can both of you, his mother, get undressed at the same time? Did not he just lose his job? The last one he had? That was one of the reasons why he did not seem ordinary to me. Where does the funding for his life come from? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I have read reviews that deal with the realistic portrayal of urban loneliness, so there is that. Yes, it is very realistic, so we have to be satisfied with what we have, because that's all we have. The way we disappear into interactions of ourselves and ourselves (James and Stella), a kind of self-degradation that only takes place to pass to the next moment. In contrast to the ability to define ourselves through our moments, our thoughts of how James had them with Beth, it's really overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Very well done.
