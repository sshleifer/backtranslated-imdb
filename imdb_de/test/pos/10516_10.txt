Bridget Fonda has disappointed me several times over the years, but she had my attention in BREAK UP. It is true that there are several important details missing in the story, but I kept looking for clues about what's important in the story, and it did not abandon me. The look in her eyes in the last scene, when she has the courage to literally set foot in her uncertain future, is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of facial expression ever. I completely believed her, possibly because I knew and admired several "hard women" who had survived similar abusive situations. And they did this without becoming human. But this is my own hopeful projection of Fonda's character at the BREAK UP.
