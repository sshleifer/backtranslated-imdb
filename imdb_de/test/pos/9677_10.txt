When I saw this show for the first time, I was nine years old and immediately caught my attention as Stewie tried to call Lois at the hotel. I laughed and kept watching. When the episode was finished, I wrote down the name of the cartoon and looked at it regularly. This differs from the Simpsons and other shows on Cartoon Network, because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but TV-14 for a reason. The fast film cuts after every punch line make cute, funny movements and behavior of the characters. Talented Seth Macfarlene is the creator and voice of a whole host of characters on the show. A good theme song and a crazy family that always has something funny makes this one of my favorite cartoon additions to Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Look at it, it's weird.
