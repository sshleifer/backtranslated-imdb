I'm so excited that Greek is back! This season looks very eventful. I am glad that Casey is trying to seriously engage with the school but is still involved in the fraternity. It is really funny that she wants to go into politics and that she emphasizes her "talented talent". I loved Calvin's new hairstyle! It makes him look more mature. You should also shave Cappy's head. All the boys are hot, but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I can not wait to see more of him! I'm especially interested in what happens between Calvin, Adam and Rusty! I also love Rebecca. She is really pretty. I actually think that Rebecca & Calvin should join. Do it, Calvin! Join my team!
