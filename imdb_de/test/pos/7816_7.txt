The cast alone tells you that this will be a notch over the usual Italian Western. Experienced actors Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy partnered with Alex Cord, who was about to be famous at the time. The result is a movie that is both off-beat and down-beat, yet satisfies those looking for more of a western than just a gunplay. Particularly interesting here is the figure of Alex Cord. It is believed that the "hero" in these countries is quiet and introspective, but "Clay McCord" is an extreme example and surprisingly, he often appears in a passive, even weak position. Much is feared by the fact that he is afraid of falling victim to the epileptic seizures that have made his father unable to move, and in those moments of helplessness he is either at the mercy of those who want to hurt him or those who want to help him. To emphasize his passivity, Clay McCord - do not you love that name? - is often aired to the waist, as if it were little more than an attractive toy that is exhibited. There is even a strong masochistic trait in its nature. Most prove that he is used by his enemies as a punching bag and then hung on his wrists and hung over a middle of the road. Not only does he often not protect himself, McCord is just as ineffective in protecting his fellow human beings. Almost everyone who helps him is killed. <br /> <br /> Even though "One Minute to Prayer, One Second to Die" is anything but a complete success, it has a depth and tone that sets it apart and keeps it in your memory , It is also a good showcase for Alex Cord, whose career tended to decline after some promising years in the mid-1960s. He must have been around 36 years old when he filmed this - in his physical bloom - and the scene where he gets stuck at his wrists, naked and sweaty, is a memorable piece of cinematic "beefcake".
