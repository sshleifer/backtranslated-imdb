a nice romantic comedy. errol flynn shows how clever he has the comedy. a talent that probably shows something of his true rogue. the comic writing on this film is excellent. Eleanor Parker does a great job as Flynn's ex-wife, who tries to regain her. eleanor is also eye friendly. The sets exude glamor and 1940s style where appropriate. <br /> <br /> The uncompromising timing and wit of flynn are brought to life here. You see his double takes, his ability to verbally fight the punch with a snappy comeback, or to play the straight guy. And when it comes to his credibility and sincerity, this guy could act! It's a shame that Errol had no chance to play more roles like this during his career, he was extremely talented. If you enjoyed "it happened one night" with Gable and Colbert or some of the William Powell and Myrna Loy comedies, you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> in a good mood and laughed a lot. a lost diamond of a movie.
