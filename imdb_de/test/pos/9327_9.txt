No matter how you feel about Michael Jackson himself, you can not deny that this video is the most unique video ever. There is no other video that is close to "Thriller". The first time I saw it, I was 6 years old and it scared me a lot. Now I watch it with a smile, because now I can appreciate the wonder it is. I love this video and it will be there as long as music videos exist. I think everyone should sit down and watch it, if it comes up at some point, and look back how great it was, especially since it was 1983.
