I really like the opening of the movie when Col. Ted Masters detects on his radar that four enemy aircraft were approaching at about 10 o'clock. The good news is that the film did not mention at the beginning that the colonel, along with a wingman fighter who was a lieutenant, wished to exercise a "freedom of navigation" on the eastern Meditteranean Sea, but also went a bit past the restricted one Airspace zone reserved for a rogue state of the Middle East while inadvertently flying past it. <br /> <br /> I also like all the incidents on the Colonel's radar displays and the computer displays when the enemy plane aggressively chooses The two American fighter pilots commit to hurt their airspace. The first dogfight immediately reminds me of the famous fighter pilot movie "Top Gun". From the growth of the enemy bandits to the thirty-millimeter rounds of the enemy plane that struck the colonel's engines, and to crush the plane, forcing it to launch, all of this reminds us of one thing ... dogfight fighting techniques Keep alive ... but a wrong move can cause you to be shot down. <br /> <br /> The only problem in the movie was the scene "Snake Series". It was a bit too long. Yes, the opening of the movie was great when you see the conflict. It is not until a boy tells Doug Masters that his father was shot down after the Cessna planes landed in the "snake" race that the conflict forces us back. I think the queuing in the middle should be interrupted a bit by handcuffing Col. Masters in the middle of the Bilyad desert on the way to the detention center ... while the music sequence continues for the "Serpent". The movie does not do it ... If that were the case, the details of the conflict would have been smoother at that point. Otherwise good. <br /> <br /> When it turned out that the trial of Col. Ted Masters for treason (violation of territorial air sovereignty) was over and he was sentenced to being hanged on the gallows in three days, Doug Masters decided in action to step. Since the Air Force has made futile attempts to save the man, Doug decides to drag his friends and Colonel Sinclair (played by Louis Gossett, Jr.) for a plan to rescue Masters. He risks a high chance of being court-martialled and spends more than a year in a military portico. He goes against air force policy and plans to save Masters without US government approval. Doug and his friends sneak into several classified areas of the base to learn about the area in which Masters is believed to be hanging around, and the Bilyad area (which turns out to be the wrong Middle Eastern country for the movie) ). One plan included launching fireworks in front of the Air Force's darkroom to obtain diversions to receive classified photos and maintenance supplies for the fighter plane, fighter base, intelligence services, and all other military items around Bilyad. <br /> <br /> When all was said and done and Sinclair studied all the intelligence, he almost rejected this plan because Doug was too naughty. Only when they visited the two F-16 aircraft and tried a dry run on a shooting range, I realized what they would do overseas. I realized that Doug's fighter and bombardment are not good until he hears rock music. I remember when he dropped a Mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target and the bomb was missed by 20 feet. I realized that Doug is unusual. He likes music when he fires the fighter ammunition. <br /> <br /> The last part of the conflict, the last dogfight action in Iron Eagle, was better than Top Gun's climax of the hostile dogfight sequences. I liked the way the final conflict developed, especially when Doug Masters was facing a Middle Eastern pilot who was in fact against Ted Masters in court. Short but sweet, when Doug brought the opposing fighter outside after a second attempt with a crosswindow. Looks like this Bilyad Colonel is related to Star Wars "Darth Vader" ... in the air he can be very angry, because if you've seen Star Wars, Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker, who was an ace pilot Space. Unusual connotation for it anyway!
