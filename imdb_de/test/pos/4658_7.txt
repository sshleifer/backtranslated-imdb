Somewhere in the dark corners of my brain cells there is a song in my head. I can not forget it, no matter how hard I try. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS and will reach you! I wish I could find a copy of it on a 45rpm plate. Five different teams set off one night in LA to search for tracks rather than physical objects. An unkempt game master with two great assistants is the thought leader of this madness unleashed on LA. All teams are stereotypes (this movie dates back to 1980, before political correctness messed everything up): the "good guys," the "nerds," led by Eddie Deezen, the dumb, beer-loving "jocks," the "we do not need a man "especially the redheads. The giggling twins are also a scream. And finally, the "bad guys" with Stephen Furst as leader. Furst is weird like the overweight bitch Harold, whose attempt to decrypt the various clues with a computer results in a mess of chaos. Films like this are no longer being made. Nowadays, movies with some dark characters and other nonsense must have something "edgy" about them. Go back to the days when the "good guys" of David Naughton were still good and did not conflict with each other hopelessly. So drop all serious claims and go back to the year 1980. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS. , ,
