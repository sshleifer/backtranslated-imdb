"Classe tous risques" feels like the forefather of "The Sopranos" by mixing up criminals and domestic workers and feeling the buddy movie as contemporary as "Reservoir Dogs". <br /> <br /> Just like these gangsters are They are lovingly involved with wives, children, lovers and parents. They are cold-hearted, and we are constantly reminded, no matter what the warm situation we see them. They can eat the hair of a child - and then trigger a threat in cold blood. The key is loyalty, and male camaraderie is marvelously conveyed, with no ethnic or class stereotypes, even though their web of past commitments and repayments narrows into suspicion and paranoia as the old gang is in various stages of probation, retirement Deposit or in new, less profitable ventures. A fierce charge is to send a stranger to an old escape scenario. It is a climax of emotion when a woman is told that she is not friends with the gangster, and practically the only time we hear music on the soundtrack is when he remembers his wife. <br /> <br /> Streetscapes in Italy and France are miraculously used in dazzling natural light to dark water and highways, from the opening of a pair of outrageous robbers - traveling with their wife and two children. The rugged, rugged Lino Ventura immediately catches the screen as a criminal father. And the second thug is clearly an accidental presence in her life, coordinating the theft and escape in cars, buses, boats and motorcycles in easy tandem. This is not the clich√©-encrusted old guy who was softened with the big-eyed orphan. These are their jobs and their families and they cruelly cross each other. <br /> <br /> The film is adamant when it kills characters directly and as collateral damage and challenges our sympathy for them unsentimentally, which was probably why there was never an American remake. <br /> <br /> It seems so fresh that Jean-Paul Belmondo is only about a third of the movie and looks as inconspicuous as a young punk, that one finds that it is 1960. Sultry Sandra Milo has smart and great chemistry, from the ambulance to the elevator to the hospital bed. <br /> <br /> While the Film Forum showed a new 35mm print with newly translated subtitles, it was not immaculate. The program notes stated that the title refers to a type of insurance policy and is punishable by "tourist class".
