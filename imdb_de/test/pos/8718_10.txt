Lately, I've been fortunate enough to see Ingrid Bergman's name in connection with a movie I've never seen (or had ever heard) on AMC. What a stroke of luck. <br /> <br /> Seeing your smooth and seamless performance is not the only reason you can not wait for this movie. The writing is wonderfully funny and the performances are excellent. Walter Mathau (not my favorite) was nearly perfect and Goldie Hawn (surprisingly) was fabulous. Sometimes tender, demanding, then just stupid. There are times in the film that even the most stubborn movie viewer gets involved in the story and will forget that it's a movie. Olds was amazing to see. She effortlessly returns to the screen (at the age of 54?). The cast was great and the lines ... the lines are exquisite. <br /> <br /> A top 5 romantic comedy of all time.
