Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as another patchwork of mindless violence. And though there is a lot of chaos, DEATH WISH 3 is not a particularly dreadful effort, especially for fans of the show and its star. This time around, aging Charlies Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief who desperately wanted to clean up a coarse part of New York City. The triggering Vigilante moves into the heart of Gang territory, where he again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good against evil. Bronson, at least the "older" version, is really at his best. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that DEATH WISH 3 is a classic. For the discriminating eye, it actually has a wealth of imperfections. The figures are usually made of cardboard. The violence is exaggerated. A man in his 60s surpasses dozens of young punks. But in the tradition of the original DEATH WISH and later of films like FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas, it has a definite, appealing charm. Who does not want gangbangers to be due? There are also some cheesy moments and one-liners that are so common in movies of the 1980s. For example, when a tenant of his home sees Kersey setting up a detonator, the vigilante says light-heartedly that he is "diluting the flock." A line that only Bronson can really do. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is to accept it for what it is. It is not Spielberg and it is not art. So pop the popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it.
