This is one of the best movies I've seen from the silent film era (unfortunately, with the exception of Chaplin / Keaton stuff, I've still seen too many). Very visually brilliant, with an incredibly influential style of editing and composition. Really unique (especially for his time) camera angle and extremely hectic editing. Definitely a must for the movie nerd. <br /> <br /> The downside is that it's a bit too politics in your face (I have no problem with the politics in the movie, as long as she's subtle or involved in the thing.) At least something to ignore as a backseat to the movie History). It's not an "entertainment" movie either, which is fine, but I will not see it a billion times. This is art, plain and simple, whether it is like this or not. <br /> <br /> Alone for the influence of an A + value, but based on personal enjoyment I give him an A-.
