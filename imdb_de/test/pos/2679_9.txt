I just started watching this show. It is currently being aired in Ireland on the Irish television channel RTE1 at 12:30 pm (as of 26 July 2006). <br /> <br /> This show literally makes me laugh and I can not boast of most sitcom's (apart from Britain's "The Office" with Ricky Gervais in it). In today's episode of TKoQ (July 26, 2006), Carrie starts a new job, invites her friends home and starts cooking coffee, and Doug wants Carrie to have no "outside" friends, so he lifts up Top part up and shows his "belly hair"! and licks plates when he goes to dinner! But another funny episode was the other week when the old guy (dad) won bingo and that episode made me laugh, especially when they had a spare fridge and Carrie's father was standing there watching it anew. <br /> <br /> So I do not know how long this will have to go on Irish TV or at what stage (recorded year) we are, but I hope it does not end soon, because I really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In summary, there are some great lyrics, great characters and comedic plays (namely Carrie, Doug and Carrie's dad), some great punchlines and good results - a little cheeky and close at hand Kids out of the room!), But I think this US sitcom is a winner and very funny.
