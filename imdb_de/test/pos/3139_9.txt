Wagon Master is a unique movie under John Ford's work. Mainly because it is the only one based on a story written by John Ford himself. The story was written by Frank Nugent and the son of the director. Patrick Ford became a screenplay, and because of the director's personal opinion, Wagon Master is the film that John Ford called the movie that "came closest to what I wanted to achieve," not to say, but like Lindsay once did Anderson confessed that his favorite was My Darling Clementine and not any other. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master has all the ingredients you would expect in a John Ford movie. Wonderful cast that does its best, you do not know any big stars except the 'fordian' of all actors? Ben Johnson. Very strange little characters who provide a compulsory comic relief, and Wagon Master has some of them, such as the horn-flowered sister Ledyard (Jane Darwell) in their recordings, but very inspirational appearances. And last but not least, the legendary Monument Valley with John Ford's fifth passage to Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache and She Wearing a Yellow Ribbon Johnson and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey Jr) serving as Wagon Masters or guides for a caravan of Mormon settlers hired to travel to Silver Valley, a place that is like a promised land to them. On their way, they will be accompanied by a very special Dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) accompanied by two beautiful women who are supposed to be his wife and daughter and call themselves actors. They go in the same direction just because they were recently expelled from the next town and have no other place. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens until they meet Cleggs, a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are fleeing the Marshal of the city, where they have recently committed murder and bank robbery. <br /> <br /> Overall, Wagon Master is no more and no less than another precious pearl in a necklace from John Ford's wonderful Western. Something you must have seen. 9/10 <br /> <br />
