I was amazed at the quality of this film, especially after seeing pictures of the barely adult director - all 140 (?) Pounds of him! A boy staging a movie about a boy. I am looking forward to seeing more Luke Eberl films. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a bit too long. It took too much time to show Connor that he was not successful (and unwilling) to engage Owen. Caleb did not try enough. Since Owen was so young, he could have easily approached Caleb, and later decided that it was not his preference. And Owen would still have learned the "valuable lesson" about corruption and politics. Instead, he did not give himself a good chance to learn about his sexuality. And what about poor Caleb? Owen could have had a good influence. <br /> <br /> Although the film wants to show Owen as a hero overcoming perverse corruption, I was saddened for Owen. He was offered the opportunity to have a boy's fun with Caleb, which was extraordinarily beautiful. Owen did not have to join the political perversion offered. But he could have tried to have some fun with Caleb and went away anyway if he wanted to. It was clear Owen took the responsibility - no one forced him to do something he did not want to do. But he could have had more fun, and with a very hot friend about it. <br /> <br /> I hope Luke makes more movies in which attractive young characters have more fun.
