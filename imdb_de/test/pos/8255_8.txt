I recently bought this movie for $ 5 at a discounter on DVD. Although it is a no-frills DVD on the Geneon label (only the movie being played right away - no menu, no peculiarities), image and sound quality was EXCELLENT. The film is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history. Richard Jordan, of whom I have to admit that he has not heard anything, plays the lead role - Pinky Green. A charming young man who had spent too many of his few years in jail and wanted to go straight now, should not! He portrays an American in England. David Niven plays the lead evil, with the great charm he's famous for. Bad, but with scruples as if he denied Pinky his "punch" for the job. Whack, in England, is apparently the fair share of the recording and not a bullet in the head as in American gangster films! All supportive performers have done a great job producing a very credible movie. <br /> <br /> What's perhaps best for me is that the whole movie is quite pleasant and understandable (I often find myself in the confusions of the plot and in the storyline different characters) without any special effects. No blood. No violence. Not even a chase! Only a well written story, well played, well judged and photographed! If I had any complaints about the movie, I would question the music. WHAT makes bluegrass music in a bank robbery story that takes place in England?
