Jewel Thief is a rare kind of film - absolutely noir in the story, but nothing in the presentation. A young man, Vinay, who was excellently played by a fresh-faced Dev Anand at the age of 40, is alienated from his police officer Dad and finds a job in a jewelry store. Soon, random people come up to him and call him Amar. With a few hearty moments, the presence of a "doppelganger" is detected. Then a woman Shalini (Vyjayantimala) appears and claims to be engaged to the doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar) who is so convinced that Vinay is indeed Amar. He lets him take off his shoe and prove that he is not Aamr, the six-headed one. The super sweet daughter of jeweler Anju (Tanuja) is in love with Vinay. In the midst of all this confusion, a jewel thief is at large and steals at will. Slowly we hear from Vinay's encounter with a super hot nightclub singer (Helen!) That the thief Amar is the doppelganger. Many beautiful women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) look for the hero. The police, including Vinay's father, are completely confused. Vinay slowly falls in love with Shalini / Shalu and her brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to Sikkim, where Amar's next raid is scheduled to take place. The rest is for you to see - the duplicate, the girls, the men who hold Vinay to every word and think he's their boss Amar, the loving brother-sister duo - nothing seems to be right, and it needs the skillful History (and direction) of Vijay Anand to complete this story in an entertaining way. The film offers many moments that will surprise you until they are delicately interwoven into a grand finale of a dance in a palace in Sikkim. <br /> <br /> I was not a big Vyjayanthi fanatic, but she's pretty proficient at her fool here. It can subtly complement the confusion in the story, but is best when it is sad or dancing. Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in this movie. I really wanted her to have the man. Dev was good Dev. If he did not walk like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder lower and lower than the other), I would wonder who they found to imitate him! His style, charm and charisma were infallible. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look cool when carrying a fishing rod with a large plastic fish attached to it! Ashok Kumar was just awesome - Dada Moni did not beat the whole movie and turned it into a history book. SD Burman has figures like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen in a Bloodred Rooster (Imitation Dance on a Bar), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera, and my personal favorite seductive number Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye. <br /> < If you want a great story, with more twists and turns than pretzels that are constantly guessing, amusing and entertaining - and then buying or renting Jewel Thief, it's better to buy it again with your mates This is a guardian.
