It is a very good documentary film about Istanbul and its people and their music of all kinds. The editorial staff and the director's success are very impressive. I've been interested in Faith Akin ever since I saw "Against the Wall" ("Duvara KarsÄ±"), and I admired his work a lot, but this work was the most touching for me here. It's not just about Turks or something, it's a very good biography of a city and how music stays alive in it, we can say. There are views of many people and therefore very different ideas about life and love. I really liked it and I think that everybody and everyone should see it, NOT just, but especially those who are somehow involved with Turkey ...
