"Lonely Among Us" is definitely one of the best episodes of the first season. The plot, though somewhat confusing, creates a lot of suspense, aided by the creepy, synthesizer-driven soundtrack. This is a typical "Alien Body Invasion" scenario, but it does not develop into any evil cause (the death of Deputy Chief Engineer Singh was a coincidence for me). The two types of delegates provide an entertaining setting (best make-up so far) and finally lend the series (the closing scene) some black humor. Patrick Stewart obviously enjoys stepping out of his Picard character and exploring some new terrain, as well as Data, by expressing himself as Sherlock Holmes (another classic). The special effects also convince and director Cliff Bole has done his job well. He is the first to try to compensate for Troi's lack of acting skills by improving his appearance. In some scenes she looks beautiful and the neckline enhances her appearance. Picard's "flash scene" on the bridge gives it a touch of the Emperor of Star Wars "Return of the Jedi" (which is a personal impression, but made me smile). <br /> <br /> There is also something to play With the lighting of the corridors (simulation of the night on board) and the first moving camera that retreats from Picard as he enters the transporter room to shine in the cloud ... Good work. The subtle cut that creates a continuous dialogue through various scenes (Trois Hypnosis Report) completes the impression of a really well-made TNG episode. The first one even made Wesley Crusher almost bearable ... <br /> <br /> But the end is a bit confusing, as if the producers run out of time. "P for Picard" is a bit far-fetched and his return is far too easy, but you can ignore that in the many powerful moments this episode has to offer.
