Gore hounds watch out ... this is not your movie. This little bittersweet has very little blood and guts. It is basically a version of Open Water that is effective and worthwhile. What makes it special, though, is that we actually like the three pipes (as opposed to open water) that are on a tree when a crocodile tilts his fishing boat and folds his guide. We want none of them to be harmed. SO, when they get into dangerous situations ... we really do not care. <br /> <br /> Now I like killer animal flicks, but Lake Placid to Primeval did not particularly impress me (though I'm still waiting to see Rogue, and hope it's as good as anywhere here!) but this little bastard did the work and did the job well. The fear is creative, and it only falls into the barrel of the mill, insane sobbing and arguing for short sections of reality, so I never got annoyed. <br /> <br /> I remember reading the real story of three boys fishing and two landing in a tree while their buddy was killed by the crocodile. But what has always influenced me is that the crocodile did not eat the buddy. No, he swam around the tree for hours, shaking the body in his mouth with friends in the tree. Seems to stay, if you come down here, this will happen to you.
