Carefully engineered and played perfectly, To The Ends Of The Earth is an amazing journey from our reality into another age. <br /> <br /> Based on William Golding's trilogy, these three 90-minute films document the journey of both Australia and the experience of youthful aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Benedict Cumberbatch) aboard an aging warrior in the early 19th century moves to a government position in Down Under. <br /> <br /> Under the crew and the hopeful emigrants who share His passage is a stormy bullying captain (Jared Harris), a political radical philosopher (Sam Neill), a cautious first lieutenant from below (Jamie Sives ) and hastily the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman (Joanne Page), whose ship literally passes by at night. In addition to the astonishingly high level of physical accuracy, director David Attwood and screenwriters Tony Basgallop and Leigh Jackson keep an eye on the etiquette and stiff etiquette of an earlier era, creating a thoroughly convincing microcosm of the Napoleonic era. <br /> <br /> Life on board is a brutal, monotonous round seasickness, misery and danger after another and as Edmund becomes involved in the love, hopes and misery of his fellow travelers, he experiences a maddening whirlwind of the Exertions of life, the inhumanity of man and his noblest feelings. Those who loved Master And Commander and the other side of the world loved Patrick O'Brian's series of novels on which she is based? For everyone else, it's a whole new world to discover.
