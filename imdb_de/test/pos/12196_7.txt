Despite some acceptable adjustments to the main themes of the books, the Queen of the Damned / Vampire LESTAT did not remain loyal to Anne Rice's complicated stories. The deep layers that made up all the characters were only torn to their surface, though not to a completely different identity. The chronological order of the main events in the film was distorted and uneven. <br /> <br /> However, there were a few things the movie did to earn my rating of 7 that Lestat (among other vampires) had mostly young girls for the public. The film has also done a pretty good job of focusing on the importance of inheritance and the history the vampires were proud of. The scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfying. <br /> <br /> if disappointing. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have a surprising chemistry that only shows when the play is at its best (not very often). The characters are nothing compared to those set in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. It also lacks the emotional intelligence of THE FAST OF ALL SAINTS, which is a pity because Rice's Queen of the Damned had that and more. <br /> <br /> This film does not give everything it seems to be. The effects are boring and very disappointing. The extravagance needed in many scenes is not given, and the dialogue is tedious. The settings for many scenes are not as I've pictured them in the book, and I think many of them are not even taken out of history. There are few areas of incoherence at the beginning and in the middle of the film, but they wrap up quite neatly and give the viewer a complete story (if they did not read the book). <br /> <br /> Somethings I think the movie needs a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein) instead of the mix of rock music. although I had no problem with some songs. Another thing that would have made the movie better is the better direction setting. The scenery was both boring and unclear, which is important for a story that moves frequently. <br /> <br /> Overall, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was an unfortunate but somewhat satisfying adaptation of the important novel. With a few simple changes, it may have been a very successful movie. I would recommend this film to people who have seen INTERVIEW or read the books so they can get their opinion on the adaptation.
