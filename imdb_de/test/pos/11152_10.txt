This has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns I have ever seen. I have a penchant for the genre (westerns are or were, as they are not made often anymore, morality games too often denigrated by critics with intellectual claims) had read enough about William S. Hart's work (much of which he wrote and directed) ) to arouse my interest and thought I should have at least one of his films in my video collection. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I approached the actual viewing with some concern. My previous experience with silent film classics had disappointed me. Chaney's Phantom of the Opera, Griffith's Birth of a Nation, and Fairbanks' Zorro's mark was good, but not nearly as good as their reputation suggests. They were either too long or too theatrical or both. <br /> <br /> The toll gate turned out to be a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> It's a story told in a simple and uncomplicated way. Black Deering (played by Hart), leader of a notoriously successful outlaw gang, believes that the time has come before the group dissolves before luck runs out. However, his lieutenant, Jordan, steps forward and forces them all to a standstill, promising great wealth but leading them into a trap in which he is partly to blame. Everyone is killed, except Deering, who is captured. When his kidnappers saw him as the man who had once saved several soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an impending Indian attack, they allowed him to flee. Free he tries to find honest work, but is disappointed and ridiculed and must ultimately rob again to survive. Soon he is being persecuted not only by the sheriff's police chief, but also by Jordan (who now thrives on the reward money collected) and his followers. His flight takes him to a secluded cabin where a single mother and her little son live. After initial concerns, they take him into their hearts. Deering sees a chance for a new life, but as the posse and Jordan approach, it becomes clear that this may not be possible. <br /> <br /> Hart was the first big western star and the first to bring realism to the genre. As one of the pioneers of filmmaking, he has created many of the characters and situations that have become stereotypes in Western countries for over ninety years. However, what kept his films interesting was his ability to go beyond the clich√© (maybe his imitators did not go far enough), so the material is still fresh and innovative. Three such cases in The Toll Gate illustrate this: <br /> <br /> 1) In one scene, his character shoots at a crowd to kill Jordan, killing a spectator instead. A close-up shows that he is clearly frustrated. The frustration, however, does not come from the fact that he has beaten down a man who had hitherto done no harm to him, but that he has missed his intended goal. <br /> <br /> 2) In another step, as he flees from the farce, his "borrowed" horse steps into a hole and breaks a leg. Hart pulls out his weapon to free the animal from his misery, but before he pulls the trigger, he gives his head a sad, loving pat as if he wants to say goodbye to an old friend. <br /> <br /> 3) And finally, after strangling Jordan and throwing his body over a cliff, he returns to fetch his weapons and discovers his opponent's pistol nearby on the ground. He steps forward and gives a quick kick before mounting his horse. This is a simple gesture, but underlines the profound disgust he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades. <br /> <br /> And I love the title The Toll Gate. It is allegorical that a man can not start a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old ones. The payment of Deering takes the form of victims. Nowadays, the more demanding audiences can not get excited about it, but if you let it, it can still work for you. Viewers who like their videos in pristine condition will undoubtedly object to the image quality of the DVD, especially the DVD. The end role has deteriorated severely. I do not mind at all. That there is a copy of this film from 1920 at all, is a miracle, since prints have been lost from so many other silent films. If you take this into account and consider the film as a piece of history, its visual defects are not that hard to accept. <br /> <br /> William S. Hart was born in New York in 1870 and grew up in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where he studied Sioux and Indian Sign Language. He counted Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and collected Remington paintings, so that his knowledge of the West was first-hand. If his vision seems overly romanticized by today's standards, it is much closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the '60s and' 70s and the ensuing revisionist works. Both the star and his films are overdue for revaluation.
