Well, it's true that Monster Man is a huge mess of a movie, but somehow several different genres and a clichéd conspiracy come together to make one of the most beautiful modern horror movies I've ever seen! The two biggest styles the movie mixes are a "road trip" style teen comedy and a "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" style, a redneck horror vibe, and one often bumps into another. Director Michael Davis manages to keep things moving, as we are always sure of where the movie is being shot next by the constant change of tone. Things start worrying as we get to know two characters who are both irritating in different ways. Adam is a tiny maiden, while Harley is a fat A-hole. They both drive through the desert to attend the wedding of a chick they both liked in high school. After a few strange events, they pick up a pickup truck and are then chased by a maniac in a monster truck for unknown reasons ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​somebody being chased by someone Otherwise, a bigger vehicle is hardly original but using the monster truck is one of the biggest advantages of the movie. The truck itself looks scary because it's so hard and rusty, and the fact that it hops around the screen makes the deployment action exciting and exciting. After a while you get used to the characters and as soon as Aimee Brooks starts the fight, things start to look up. The teen comedy page of the movie actually works pretty well, as Justin Ulrich is always available for entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes between the maiden and the hot hitchhiker are interesting enough. Just when you think the movie could not get messier, things turn for the weird result in the last third. Without spoiling things, it must be said that Monster Man has an end that is impossible to see before the performance, and is a big surprise with the turn. Some folks may feel torn off by the sudden turnaround - but I actually thought it worked pretty well, as it fits in with the movie, that really does not fit here ... Overall, this is not a 'great' movie - but If you are looking for silly entertainment, Monster Man should be just the ticket!
