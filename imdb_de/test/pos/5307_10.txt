This is a great movie and was immediately added to my top ten (trust me I know movies!). It's one of the films that really makes you think, not necessarily about the plot, but about yourself! The film is about a fifteen-year-old boy (Leland Fitzgerald) who kills an autistic boy. He is sent to the nursery where he meets Pearl Madison, his teacher. His relationship with Pearl is slowly growing and eventually Pearl decides to write a story about Leland and his colleagues, but as he gets closer to Leland's motive, he learns he has to deal with his own problems first. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and a must with great Pixies music and a fantastic score! Look at it!
