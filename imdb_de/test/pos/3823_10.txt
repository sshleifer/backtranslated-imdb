When the new outer limits began, the episodes were pretty optimistic and challenging. As the series began to develop, most episodes just became ugly and devoid of entertainment value. The six episodes reflect the best and worst results of the series. Because The Outer Limits always preaches a morality. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining flops. <br /> <br /> 1. Afterlife: As an institution, the US military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention stupid. However, individuals with great integrity serve our country, and they will obey their conscience at unbelievable expense! In the end, the aliens do not need to say a word. Those who have no conscience are fools who must be held in complete disdain. <br /> <br /> A really subversive episode! One that should be shown on prime-time television. This may be a revelation to some, but people without conscience should not be allowed to serve in our military! The purposes do not justify the means! <br /> <br /> 2. Theory of Relativity: A good person may be forced to make a split-second decision between good and evil in order to save the lives of defenseless intelligent beings at a high cost to themselves. What these Making a decision even more difficult is the strict decision: when you are held together with exotic alien strangers, with whom you can only communicate through gestures, or when you work with a group of people you believe you are protected from unknown dangers, even if they are ruthless and without pity! <br /> <br /> This episode is brilliant! What drives this corruption is good old-fashioned greed. This episode is one of the most horrible charges of capitalism, transnational corporations, and the rape of the environment I've ever seen in my life! Unlike in real life, justice is served here - fast! <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable lines is when the reckless corporate cracker said something like, "We did the same in the Amazon Rainforest War." Alluding to the assassination of Amazonian Indians, who sought to protect their rainforests from mining, as a justification for literally being killed in the name of "the survival of the strongest". Something that Darwin never wanted to take literally! <br /> <br /> 3. Alien Shop: The tremendous power can also be used by an exotic alien. This power can be used to heal rather than destroy. Mortals can learn from their mistakes! Even a criminal can see the light if given enough opportunity. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it takes heavy medication, but we can all wake up and change our self-destructive methods! <br /> <br /> 4. The Grell: An alien can be a Christ-like figure! In the distant future, slavery can be justified once again in the interests of expediency! Basically, good people can be corrupted. Sometimes a person must have experienced great shame in order to see the evil that he is committing. Children are closer to the truth than adults. Those with political power have enormous responsibility! Another work of genius! As a species, "do people learn from history?" <br /> <br /> Flop Number 1: Quality of Mercy: Loose lips, sunk ships! During the war, please keep silent about important military plans. Did I really see a one-hour soap opera to find out? !! I wonder if the creators of The Outer Limits run out of ideas, or did companies pull the plug? Dark and ugly, futile, but desperate! <br /> <br /> Flop Number 2: Beyond The Veil: It's so bad that there's no moral: if you're locked up in a mental hospital, please use common sense! This episode is so bad that she loathes herself. What an X-Files rip-off! Do not waste your time with it! You will thank me later! <br /> <br /> It's a sad comment that The Outer Limits has come down the tubes toward the end of its run. Subversive episodes, like the first four, could not last forever! It was a miracle that they were ever made! Hopefully other brave souls will someday follow the subversive Outer Limits tradition into a new territory! <br /> <br /> If you're such a brave person, a unique title is a good start: "Anatomy Of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction," edited by Neil Barron! For me, the most comprehensive book ever written on the subject.
