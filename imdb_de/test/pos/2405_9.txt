Well, it took 4 tries, but they finally got it right! In this fourth installment of the Karate Kid series, the producers have really made a home run! First of all, I applaud her for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt he had never played the role of the Karate Kid. I would rather have seen Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Most in that role. Macchio has proven to be the best movie of the series and looks where his career is now! Instead they put a girl in! They got Hillary Swank, who is best known for playing different Sheman parts in every movie they are in. Personally, I'm not interested in their fangs, but that's a personal preference. But look how Karate Kid 4 started her career in orbit! She won a damn Oscar. Jiminey Christmas! Meanwhile, where is Ralphy? He should release an amateur porn band like Screech or something. Anyway, my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl who does karate. As a self-proclaimed karate master, I have been the proud owner of a white belt for 8 5/8 years. The first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls ... well, except Judo ... but that's kind of gay. For the sake of accuracy, I think they should stay with another man for this role. I might have thought of Dennis Franz. He would give the role the depth it needs. <br /> <br /> Maybe you'll listen to my suggestions and make the right adjustments in Karate Kid 5. Also Pat Marita is no longer there. I thought perhaps Justin Guarini would be the perfect substitute for the adorable Asian colleague Mr. Miyagi. He will give "wax on wax" a whole new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA funny, right? If you're looking for an exciting movie with karate and triumph of the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Do not waste your time with 1-3. This is the karate kid for you! This is the karate kid for all time!
