This exploration of a unique decade in US cinema begins with the fall of a sick, uncontrolled empire and ends with the relentless rise of another, also associated with escapism and box office receipts. Meet the new boss, just like the old boss. Or, as Peter Fonda noted in Easy Rider: "We messed up." In between, from Bonnie And Clyde to Star Wars, the young Turks (some under the guerrilla tutelage of Roger Corman) sneaked under the ropes to produce some of the greatest works of art of the twentieth century. While the story is already familiar from Peter Biskind's Easy Riders, the directors of Demage and LaGravenese of Raging Bulls are less concerned with muckraking than providing a platform for the filmmakers and stars themselves. <br /> <br /> Everyone from Martin Scorsese to Francis Ford Coppola and Julie Christie are interviewed, and a series of well-edited clips puts the decade in a socio-cultural and economic context. If their answers are complacent (to say the least), they are also highly clichable, witty and enlightening, making this a wet dream of a cinephile. Director William Friedkin reveals how the original The Exorcist Poster was to show a little girl's hand with a bloody crucifix and the legend "For God's sake, help her" before complaining. Former Warner Bros. boss John Calley remembers when he first saw Robert De Niro at Mean Streets, he assumed that Scorsese had secured the release of a psychopath for the shoot. Fortunately, a certain harsh perspective has crept into the mix. As one might expect from a politically motivated, mind-expanding generation, Hopper emphasizes "it's also a lot of real crap in it." Julie Christie notes that US cinema of the 1970s was "not a good time for women". But when Demme answers A spoonful of Sops on women's films - Alice's short clips no longer live here, they shoot horses, not her and Klute - we'll soon get carried away to the usual male pissing competitions. The shift from hard, socially conscious filmmaking to risk-free audiences like Jaws for 'Nam-tired, fantasy-minded audiences is also documented, albeit a little bit rushed less sung but equally relevant films like Panic In Needle Park and Joe: "We were not handsome," he tells Bruce Dern about his contemporaries. "But we were very interesting."
