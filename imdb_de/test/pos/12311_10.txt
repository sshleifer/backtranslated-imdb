Of course, in a movie whose main themes are mortality, nostalgia, and the loss of innocence, it's not surprising that older audiences rate them higher than younger ones. However, there is a craftsmanship and completeness that everyone can enjoy. The tempo is constant and constant, the characters full and engaging, the relationships and interactions of course show that you do not need a flood of tears to show emotions, screams to show fear, screaming to show strife, or violence to anger to show. Of course, Joyce's short story lends the film a pre-fabricated structure as perfect as a polished diamond, but the small changes Huston makes by including the poem are a perfect fit. It is truly a masterpiece of tactics, subtlety and overwhelming beauty.
