When I saw this movie for the first time, I also expected that "our boys" are cute and more like an enhanced version of the TV series. I did not "understand" it then. But years later, at a party YEARS later, in a 70s old PAR-TAY, where certain substances had been smoked, inhaled, and were plenty of tequila, "HEAD" was present late at night realizing what HEAD was all about , It spoofed its own show, as shown in a song that called itself "a finished picture". As Davy Jones wrote in his autobiography, "They made me a monkey," he candidly admits that everyone in the movie had been smoking grass all night. They made themselves about themselves, the society and everything! Excellent movie! Tho, as a 52-year-old grandmother, "I'm not giving up", I'm still watching this movie if I want a good LOL !!!
