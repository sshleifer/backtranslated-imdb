I really enjoyed this short film, even as a fan of Toronto Maple Leafs. <br /> <br /> Director Sheldon Cohen and narrator Roch Carrier have captured all the boy's emotions. From the feelings he had for his hero Maurice "Rocket" Richard, to the excitement, the anticipation and the hope of getting a new Montreal Canadiens sweater, to the horror of getting his sweater from his mother; A Toronto Maple Leafs pullover was priceless and the shame of having to wear that terrible (in his eyes) blue and white Toronto Maple Leafs pullover; Not the rouge, bleu and blanc of the Montreal Canadiens with Richard's number nine like his old sweater. Worst of all, his mother had gotten him to carry this Maple Leafs sweater out of the house. One could imagine and foresee with what mockery he would hit his friends when he hit the ice with his sweater before he got there. <br /> <br />
