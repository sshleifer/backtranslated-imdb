This is a movie that deserves another look - if you have not seen it for a while, or a first look - if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a play of the same name, it is the story of an older actor who leads a traveling Shakespeare repertoire company in England during the Second World War. He deals with his stress of making a Shakespearean performance every night while confronted with problems like bombarded theaters and a company of older or physically disabled actors - the young, sick bodies are taken to military service. It also deals with his relationship with various members of his company, especially his dresser. So far, everything sounds pretty boring, but nothing could be further from the truth. Overall tragic, the story is told with a lot of humor and the emotions are high. The two male lead roles both received Oscar nominations for Best Actor, and rightly so. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves human drama and theater - especially Shakespeare or who has always worked in some capacity behind the scenes. Backstage is another facet of the movie that will captivate most viewers.
