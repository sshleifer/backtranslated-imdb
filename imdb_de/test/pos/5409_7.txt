The kinks warned against media heroes. Outside the movies, most heroes are also "ordinary people". Society demands some role play, but what happens if that extends to the parent-child relationship? Are some parents trying to improve through their children and not vice versa? How do you model, but not matter? A brilliant swimmer who does not want to swim; a brilliant musician who does not play. Unconventional, funny (despite showing "serious" problems), very good multidimensional behavior of all. Many turns of action complete the emotional tension. Celluloid heroes never feel pain. I can not remember ever being disappointed in a Sigourney Weaver movie (I even liked "The Village"!).
