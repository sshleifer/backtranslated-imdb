Going 'Down To South Park is a one-hour documentary about South Park with interviews with Trey Parker and Matt STone and all the other people working at South Park. There really is not much to say, it shows the story of South Park and what it takes to make an episode. It's basically a look behind the scenes of the show. It shows the different goods South Park did (it really was a comedy center that released it). It also shows the controversy that was caused by South Park. It also shows a lot of funny excerpts from the show. It's a pretty funny documentary. Every fan of South Park should find out. You can find it on youtube. <Br /> <br /> 9/10
