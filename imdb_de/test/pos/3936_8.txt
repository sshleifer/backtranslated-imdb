The revelation is the dancing ability of Lana Turner. Although privately known as an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely had the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film. <br /> <br /> Spectators are becoming attentive! Apparently, MGM was still trying to figure out which direction they would take to develop the still-young starlet, so they hired them to do everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire. In "Two Girls on Broadway," however, she has an excellent opportunity to showcase her native rhythm and ability to change the tempo in the lavish production number "My Wonderful One, Let's Dance." This number became a kind of hybrid designed between a Busby-Berkely extravagance and the kind of routines that Hermes Pan designed for Astaire and Rogers at RKO. <br /> <br /> So the number opens with George Murphy and Miss Turner posing as bar patrons (in full chorus) in front of a black curtain in which Mr. Murphy wears the Miss Turner's number, then the camera pulls back (on a jib) in a remarkable crane shot, around a huge stage and a rotating set of steps and pillars From this point Murphy and Turner perform a variety of different moods and settings, including elevators, turns, soft shoes and the En de with a series of electrifying pirouettes that, together with Murphy, lead to a racing orchestra at breakneck speed. All in all a dizzying performance, proving that Miss Turner was well able to assert herself as a dancer, though most of her admirers would dare to abandon her throne as the queen of the melodrama.
