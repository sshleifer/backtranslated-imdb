"Nazarin" by Luis Bunuel shows an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico. As the director and Julio Alejandro, his notable collaborator, wrote, this was a film that put Mexican cinema on the international scene after the Cannes Grand Prix this year. It's a disturbing movie because Mr. Bunuel's busy with what's wrong with the church. Nazarin is, after all, a saint. This young priest lives a poor life in a rundown pension of a city. He does not have enough for himself, but he does not mind sharing a coin when a beggar appears at the window asking for help. At the same time, he takes a prostitute to his small room, who was injured while fighting another woman. Andara, the woman is paying off by burning the room and the whole building! You can see Nazarin begging for food in the countryside. Andara and Beatriz, two prostitutes from his old town, follow him. Nazarin's life corresponds to that of Jesus. In fact, this sacred figure speaks for humility. Of course, Mr. Bunuel had no religion in mind when he and Mr. Alejandro set out to create this movie. It is ironic that Spain welcomed him after the release of this film, because he saw that it showed Christian qualities. In fact, this is a harsh satire of the Catholic Church and its ministers. Francisco Rabal, the Spaniard actor, makes a wonderful Nazarin. This was one of his best roles. Mr. Rabal worked extensively in his homeland, but also in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo is excellent as well as Andara. Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution to her portrayal of Beatriz. <br /> <br /> A great movie by one of cinema's most important filmmakers: Luis Bunuel.
