Of all the big stars of the 1930s, Miriam Hopkins was the most bizarre, most underrated scene. Their series of great 30's and 40's movies is pretty impressive, but is often called stagy or brittle. Nevertheless, she had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies, including in this film, Old Acquaintance (with Bette Davis) and The Smiling Lieutenant (with Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert). Hopkins was famous for his aversion to Hollywood, and the results were a poor representative - undeserved. <br /> <br /> In Wise Girl, she plays an heiress who tries to save the children of her dead sister from her guardian - the sister's brother-in-law (Ray Milland). The film features several fun scenes like Hopkins Bathing is a storeroom, Hopkins and Milland and Guinn Williams in a Greenwich Village restaurant for $ 3 per person as "Bohemians" and Hopkins standing at the ring during one of Williams' fights. Milland is also excellent and very funny. <br /> <br /> Hopkins and Milland are a great couple. The film also provides solid support from Williams, Walter Abel, Henry Stephenson, James Finlayson, Margaret Dumont, Grace Hayle, Leonid Kinskey and Inez Palange. The two girls are fine. <br /> <br /> But Hopkins, drunk on a "wine slice" and in a pegged dress that's twice her size, is weird when she blows stray hair while smoking .... A scream.
