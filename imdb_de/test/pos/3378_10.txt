I just want to say that the role of Chris Diamantopoulos as Williams was worthy of the entire show Emmy. It was scary how well he was doing. And to be as quick and arbitrary and creative as Robin Williams really is ... WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos probably had to say 20 fast fire lines and made 15 different characters while delivering those lines, while he sounds just like ROBIN WILLIAMS playing those characters ... well, my friends are impressive. It's one thing to make a Robin Williams impersonator for a few minutes. It's another thing to do it for a whole TV movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know how I felt about the series, and I do not know how much they played with the facts, but I know it was Chris Diamantopoulos watching me. That's why I give him a 10.
