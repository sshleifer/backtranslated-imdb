full of surprises, beautiful, sometimes cruel. just like life itself. lets you ask for more. The best parts are, of course, the action scenes and chases. I really have to wonder how much work these people put into creating some scenes (whale hunting, polar bear hunts, etc.). It is a wonderful experience and should not be missed by anyone who dives, surfs or occasionally goes to the beach. The music is tempting and the narration is excellent and very well tuned. Definitely one of the best documentary films ever made, worth no less than a very respectable 10 (for its kind). Some of the material is very cruel and may not be recommended for people with a weak stomach (every killer whale material is cruel).
