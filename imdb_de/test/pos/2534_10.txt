"Pixote" is one of the strongest, most shocking and moving films from Brazil. It is about the life of street children on the streets of Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro. The focus is a ten-year-old boy. The camera follows them almost documentary, from the juvenile detention center (where most of the employees are as corrupt as the police) and back to the street. Prostitution, drug use / trafficking, corruption and murder are witnessed by these youths. it's something they are so used to. Director Hector Babenco used real street kids as actors and added to the brutal reality of the movies. Although not for everyone a movie that I can highly recommend. An emotionally devastating movie. <br /> <br />
