Like Steven Seagal, I'm a big fan of Van Damme and have watched most of his films since the beginning of his acting career. In this film, Van Damme takes on the role of Jack Robideaux, who is a police officer. I have just moved from New Orleans to New Mexico to work as part of the Border Patrol. Plagued by memories of his past, it's up to Jack to put an end to a group of ex-Navy Seals by smuggling illegal drugs into the US that killed his daughter is very good, Van Damme is 48 years old and can really move. The action scenes are intense and the movie even casts some action changes to advise you. Unfortunately, Van Damme does not have the same intensity he said ten years ago, regardless of whether The Shepherd: Border Control is the third solid film Van Damme has done to potentially open a larger project. > I definitely recommend this movie to a Van Damme fan or a fan of action movies in general. The Shepherd: Border Control is a great movie, not as good as death, but better than the Hard Corps. Try this once, you will not be disappointed.
