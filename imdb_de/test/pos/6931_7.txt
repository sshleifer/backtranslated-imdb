I was at the world premiere of this movie and met Todd even a few times in the city (once at the Olive Garden). Todd is not a bad guy, he's just a little filmmaker with little to no budget and big dreams. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, it's good if you like zombie movies with very little action and lots of blood and offal. You see some locations in Kansas City and lots of raw meat. What could be better? :-) Look for the same two dozen people playing different zombies (with just a change of clothes or hats). With this movie you can have a good drinking game. Take a picture if you see the same zombie in another shirt.
