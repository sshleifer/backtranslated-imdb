What is the purpose of these news, if not discussed next season and thoughts are exchanged? But let us see. 2. The episode at the end of the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device Penny installed on the Desmonds boat. Now that the magnetic shield has been raised around the island, the signal has been picked up by the observation station and they will send a rescue mission. 3. After the hatch has been destroyed, the island is no longer isolated and other ships / planes will arrive. 4. The others will finally share their secret with us poor observers It has actually been confirmed that there will be 4 squadrons of LOST. <br /> <br /> Cheers Mike
