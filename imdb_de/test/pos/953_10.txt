brilliant script .. <br /> <br /> the script is very tight ..that is gelled in the seat. <br /> <br /> This movie is an example of how a movie can only survive with script and no-story needed. <br /> <br /> story is very simple that you can write in one line , but the script was incredible. <br /> <br /> brilliant performance by Vijay and Prakashraj .. <br /> <br /> although the plot is similar to okkadu .. The director just adapted the plot. The Tamil version is much faster than Telugu. <br /> <br /> The film travels without any possibility of deviation, though you can understand every single background. <br /> <br /> move on
