MONKEY is certainly one of the best shows ever shown on television. I remember when I was a kid, I went to my granny every Saturday morning and turned on the TV so I could see APE. I loved it. There were breathtaking action scenes, cool special effects, a great story, a fantastic theme song that was guaranteed to never leave your head and hilarious dubbing. But it's kind of weird that it's in China and the actors are Japanese and filmed in Japan, but that does not make the TV series a lovable one. <br /> <br /> Monkey is about the adventures of three people: Pigsy (Toshiyuki Nishida), Sandy (Shir√¥ Kishibe), and of course, the memorable and loveable character Monkey (Masaaki Sakai) traveling from China to India, to get some sacred roles to save the world. <Br /> <br /> MONKEY is fun and magical.
