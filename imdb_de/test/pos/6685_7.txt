Following a raid on New York's Grand Central Station, an innocent bystander (Kevin Spacey, "The Usual Suspects") is arrested by the police, who he believes are under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. We can understand why they think that, considering how the man politely informed them that he wears his dark glasses because "the light on your planet is really bright". And so, Prot (as he identifies himself as rhyme with "goat" pronounced) is shipped to the Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan, where a weary workaholic doctor, Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, "The Big Lebowski") tries to understand the so-called Deception of this man. Prots Art is polite and cooperative. When asked why he believes he has been institutionalized, he objectively answers that "you think I'm crazy." Within minutes of satisfying his insatiable new hunger for strawberries, the totally sincere Prot showed he is an alien of the planet K-PAX, which is 1000 light-years away, and the binary star system Agape and Satori orbits the Lyra Constellation. He also describes how his infinitely more advanced species, by harnessing the energy of light, has mastered a faster than easy journey, an achievement that is supposed to be unattainable anyway for the human race anyway. <br /> Powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims, although he is nevertheless intrigued by them and committed to understanding how Prot believed such a thing. Meanwhile, Prot uses his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric department. Finally, it offers all around him something to live and hope for a cure. On July 27, Prot later, he will return to the K-PAX, and he can only take one person. Nobody is sure of what's going to happen that day. <br /> <br /> Originally planned, Dr. To play Powell? with Will Smith as prot ?? Kevin Spacey starred when Smith had to retire from the movie. You can say that he had a lot of fun with his character. The utterly sober delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue ("your product alone was worth it") often provoked real laughter. There are undeniable intelligence behind Prot's many words, but logic says he has to be insane ... does not he? <br /> <br /> The audience is going back and forth between the possibilities ?? For the first part of the movie we almost accept the possibility that Prot is an alien (this is a sci-fi movie, is not it ?!) before we are completely convinced that if Prot inexplicably has an inexplicable knowledge of astronomy newly discovered planetary system. A final investigation by Dr. med. Powell offers us a neatly packaged terrestrial explanation for Prot's delusions, but that's just as quickly wiped away and scratching our heads again. The film is rightly holding its end so that the audience can think about what it has just seen and discuss it with the others. Whether you believe that Prot is an alien or not, two irresistible certainties remain in your mind: the universe is indeed a fascinating place, and perhaps there are higher powers that we humans still need to discover.
