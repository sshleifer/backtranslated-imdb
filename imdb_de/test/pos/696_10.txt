As a teenager, I saw this movie every time he was on TV (and it was a lot) because of his witty, responsive teenage boy. It may not be what critics call 4-star audiences, but I love what it is - a fun comedy that should delight audiences. The teenage actors are from my generation (probably why I love the movie so much) and were like a fantasy cast of all the favorite television shows of the early '90s - Full House, Family Matters, Fresh Prince - all the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90s. While this does not include the high levels of nudity and violence that so many teenage film authors consider crucial to the success of adolescent demographics (or perhaps their absence), I recommend it to young people everywhere.
