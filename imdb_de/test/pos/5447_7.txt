Leno speaks through his punch lines. This spoils the joke for those of you who have not figured it out. His show is held in a micro-sized studio for one or two reasons - the small laugh is amplified, and few want to see it. The set of Letterman is the exact opposite - Ed Sullivan would be proud and the balcony is always full. NBC, sticky NBC, will never get it. Founder David Sarnoff's megalomaniac continues to be concerned with the money. At least CBS has a bit of a family atmosphere. <br/> <br /> Leno collects or stamps cars while Letterman drives cars. The difference is informative. <br /> <br /> When I talked, I asked other Chatters to send me an e-mail when Leno said something funny. I have never received a single email. Letterman has an excellent timing. He can also reuse the funniest joke to make it one of the funniest things on this night's show. <br /> <br /> Letterman has built up other careers. Paul is now well known and respected in his own musical right. Even Paul's other band members get recognition and career opportunity. Biff Henderson has become a name that America knows. Even the shops in the same block as the Ed Sullivan Theater get a boost. What has Leno ever done for others? I'm glad that Dave has moved and Leno got the Carson gig. I have never seen NBC shows and had no reason to do so. <br /> <br /> The top ten list is an American icon. This is also the letterman. Leno is a caricaturist's dream, nothing more.
