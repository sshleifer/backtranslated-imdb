A real Sudsen soap opera here, when Spencer Tracy tackles the role of an illiterate until the age of 20 years. He marries the woman who teaches him and her ambition, and his drive leads him to success. <br /> <br /> Success but no luck here. A n'eer-do-well-son and a staggering marriage lead to a catastrophe and a tragedy. Tracy buys a railroad and can only take a devastating strike with the railway and the death of 406 workers. <br /> <br /> The film initially appeared to be patchy, but is tapered here thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Here's a double suicide. We know that riches can not buy happiness, but that's a bit too far-fetched. Nevertheless, we have exciting performances by Tracy and Colleen Moore. Ms. Vinson is also very effective as a second wife.
