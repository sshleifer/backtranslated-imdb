First and foremost, I would say that I'm just an amateur commenting on movies, and that English is not my native language, but that I had a strong feeling that I was about to write about such a movie. Maybe as a thank you and congratulations to C. Jay Cox, the actors and the crew for such a brilliant production. Yesterday I saw "Latter Days" for the first time. <br /> <br /> At first I thought it might be similar to the movie "Priest", which I liked very much because he showed a gay priest out of the closet. But Priest, perhaps because of his limited Catholic ideology, did not bring the needs of my audience with him, revealing a deep, sad ending. and some others as well, such as the principles of the Mormon); To present a tender and joyful story, to bring it to a happy and emotional end, yet to awaken a feeling of God's blessing and hope. A great movie indeed! <br /> <br /> Somehow I felt like a city of angels at Latter Days. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes amazingly beautiful gay love stories!
