I just saw this movie last night, and I have to say that I loved every minute. If you look at it as a parody of Bond esquire films, it's really superior. The true comedy of the film is the gross disregard of political correctness. The misogyny, cultural insensitivity and almost ridiculous machoism of the films of this genre are used for a big comic effect. It also challenges the illogical and formulaic elements with which OSS 117 constantly learns difficult things (such as Arabic and how to play a traditional instrument) while missing some pathologically obvious clues. Some of the lines in the movie made me laugh for hours after the movie was done ... and I have to say that I've learned some ... interesting ... French vocabulary that would probably annoy my professors if I were use. All in all, I found this movie excellent. Very funny and the first movie I've ever seen that really parodies all aspects of the spy movie.
