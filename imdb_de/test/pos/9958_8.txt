"The Merchant of Venice" was one of Shakespeare's most beloved plays in his lifetime, but in the 20th century it was experiencing hard times for its undeniable antisemitic content. The piece was also referred to as schizoidic, because it came from comedic scenes to tragic scenes. Some say they are two pieces that tried to exist as one entity. Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes, who played William Shakespeare in "Shakespeare in Love") is in love with Portia (Lynn Collins, great), but has to borrow a considerable amount of money to win it. He goes to his sometimes gay lover Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who does not have the money for his person, but receives a loan from the Jewish usurer Shylock (Al Pacino). Shylock is amused and offended that Antonio, who offends him because of his religion, now comes to him for money, but he offers it on the condition that the penalty for the loan's default will be a pound of Antonio Meat. Of course, what happened? Bassanio and Portia offer Shylock much more than the original loan instead of the pound of meat, but Shylock, desperate after his daughter has left him and marries a Christian, refuses to accept him. In a scene where the audience never quite knows where to place their sympathies, Portia deprives Shylock of what should be legal and then strips him of his wealth and religion. Shylock was originally considered a caricature villain, but modern actors and directors have turned him into a tragic figure directed against the injustices of 16th-century Venice. Al Pacino does an excellent job as Shylock and Jeremy Irons is good as Antonio, but I think Lynn Collins' work as Portia is the best part of the piece. Portia is one of the few notable female roles in Shakespeare's canon, and Collins is wonderful in the role. Joseph Fiennes, however, is more than a little boring; I have never enjoyed his often over-excited acting style. I enter "The Merchant of Venice" 8/10.
