Like many sitcoms, "The War at Home" gets better with each episode. The characters start to become real, and I believe that they are a family. I agree with many that the first episodes were not so funny. I thought the show would be canceled for sure. But with the absences of "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Arrested Development," "War" offers the much-needed live-action comedy for FOX on Sunday night. And compared to the rest of the sitcoms being aired, "War" is an even better choice. <br /> <br /> Her charm is, at least for me, in her real situation. Teenagers have sex. Not every parent likes how their children develop. Parents fight and call each other names. But instead of relying on how many shows are "mean," in the end, all that's good is the rule of a good sitcom. <br /> <br /> A distraction from the show is the narration during / in between scenes. The Flashback style "Arrested Development / Family Guy" works well enough, but the narrative can be too much. <br /> <br /> If you need something to see on Sunday night, you should check out "The War at Home". especially considering what the other big networks are at that time.
