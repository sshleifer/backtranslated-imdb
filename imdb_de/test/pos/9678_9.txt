I absolutely love this show !!!!!!!, It's basically the improved version of the fox's Simpsons (cau'se allows the Simpsons to be very dry when they're over 9 years old.) Everyone, who says he does not like it, lies. There's a character for everyone: Peter, Stewie & Sumpfire are my favorites. Peter, because he is rude and vile and just does not give a damn about his amazing intelligence and how he meets you with what a grown-up would say when you least expect it, and dizzy because one of the guilty joys is dirty jokes Mr Griffin goes to Washington (season 2). If you like more of sexual and physical humor, an emission is impossible (2nd season 3) or if you like other types of humor, there is the damned Janet (VOL.1 SEASON2). Basically, I say that when you watch this show, there's humor for everyone. GIGGITY GIGGITY GOOOOO!
