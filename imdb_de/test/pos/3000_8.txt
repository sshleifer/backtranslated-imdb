The hasty rapprochement that Lewis Seiler makes with King of the Underworld leads to a deeper conspiracy while still maintaining efficiency. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and prosperity for the married couple. The audience is immediately transferred from a shanty office to a luxurious suite in the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position in which the doctors were thrown. The intro shows that these two people are generally happy to give medical practice to those who are less fortunate. By suddenly switching from this scenario to the morally contradictory profession (the mob's personal physician), the viewer is invited to experience this sudden turn of events. The Nelsons (Kay Francis and John Eldredge) are used by Gurney (Bogart) without objection. This stylized idea that organized crime is too influential and too powerful to overcome has become a standard feature in every gangster image. One aspect of this film, which raises some questions, was ironically concerned with the pace of the story and the speed with which it was narrated. I think that character development and social identity can suffer if certain aspects of a story are not fully explored. This paradox is a result of personal taste, as I think the movie experience can be improved by rigorous character development. However, for the purposes of this film, I have to admit that the fast action gives the movie a more dynamic effect. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 (of ****)
