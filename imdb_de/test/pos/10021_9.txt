A gem of a silent-time cartoon - rediscovered by CARTOON NETWORK, and probably broadcast for the first time in decades, if ever. <br /> <br /> What's so nice? Varied cameos ... Douglas Fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitoes; Will Hays visits as the "boss" of Static Studios; as well as appearances by Chaplin, Keaton and William S. Hart. The image of a chewing gum decimating the footwear of the population (a money-making idea for Felix's almost bankrupt shoe-selling clerk) can not be described - it has to be seen. A grandiose cultural gem.
