When the Romulans come, they will not carry gifts; no, they bring war and conquest with them. As anyone familiar with this episode knows, this is a redux of the war movie "The Enemy Below" from the 1950s. The obvious difference is that it's not a battleship and a submarine (or an American destroyer and a German submarine) being used in deadly war games, but two spaceships in space. In the Trek story, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth has led the Romulan wars. After about five years of conflict, a stalemate led to a treaty and the establishment of the Neutral Zone, a border between us and the Romulan Empire. At this time, the contract seems broken, as our outposts are attacked and destroyed by a weapon of immense power. Yes, the Romulans are back to test their new war toys, and Kirk now has to earn his pay: he must make decisions that would affect this sector of the galaxy, such as: To find out how to ... oh, I do not know - maybe an interstellar war? <br /> <br /> I think the thing that makes this episode so effective is that they do not shy away from the bleak aspects of the war, as one would expect from a mere TV episode from the '60s - especially one Episode from science show fiction. It's all very tense and captivating, like the best war films, like when Kirk and his key officers make up a war council. The authors and actors do not joke here: this is all preparation for a terrible conflict, possibly the beginning of another, year-long battlefield. After all, Kirk's goal is to keep this battlefield on both ships - but even then, it's an endeavor that's fraught with dangers and potential losses. I believe this episode contains the record for ship victims by the end. Right at the beginning of the episode we see the devastation a battle can cause in this supposedly well-guarded outpost. Then the cat and mouse war games begin between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship - it's as exciting as any conflict we saw on the big screen. If you are not interested in war movies, you need to look for other things to admire in this episode. <br /> <br /> What makes this episode even more exciting is the discovery of who and what Romulans are - it's an electric shock. There is even another conflict between the crew members on the Enterprise bridge - the war is causing the worst for some people. Due to the still uncomfortable attitude regarding the race in this future, the tension increases even further - Kirk has his hands full here. I think the only weakness in the story is the comfortable yielding of the bigotry question by the conclusion. On the Romulan side, the actor Lenard appears for the first time as a Romulan commander in the Trek universe; He's great in the role, the flip side of Capt. Kirk or Capt. Pike. It's up to you to do Spock more than a little. Surprisingly, his character is not war-hungry, as we would expect, another eye-opener for this episode. Next, as Sarek, Spock's father, the actor would return to this universe, so he's nothing if not versatile. It also tells that the first appearance of such characters as the Romulans is usually the best shot, like this one. Next, they appeared in The Enterprise Incident.
