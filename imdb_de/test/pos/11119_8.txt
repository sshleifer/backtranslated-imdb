One year before my birth, Fame was released in the US. I was too young to remember the original version of Fame - and yet I heard and read many things about it. For example, the fact that a television series was created and the soundtrack was directed by Irene Cara, beat Giogio Moroder "Fame". Fame was probably the first of its kind to present the series as a performer and presented a world of performing arts in the form of a feature film. The life, the struggles, the hurdles that the students and some teachers go through were under the eyes of the audience. <br /> <br /> The performances were great, but one that caught my eye was Gene Anthony Ray, who played the annoying but promising Leroy. Angry, frustrated, and at first rude, his character later became less angry and frustrated and more attached to his studies - not just with the practical in the performance, but also in theory. Irene Cara was good as Coco - the scene where she took off her blouse while a perverted director filmed her, which was pretty uncomfortable watching - as well as Paul McCrane for his amazing portrayal of a vulnerable but closed-up homosexual who lives with trying to cope He enrolled at a drama school in New York after being thrown out of the military when he told them he was gay. Ralph, played by Barry Miller, was interesting, but sometimes his character annoyed me. <br /> <br /> The choreography was excellent, there were some good dance numbers and the scene with hot lunch in the cafeteria worth seeing. Another scene that was great was when the song "Fame" was played and all the kids stormed into the streets of New York, dancing wildly and without worries in the world. It was a street jam like no other. <br /> <br /> The only star who really benefited in the long run was and still is Debbie Allen - she later became producer, director and star - although she mostly worked behind the scenes of shows like Everybody Hates Chris and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Paul McCrane later starred with Peter Weller in the movie "Robocop," starring a villain and an ER as the precious, hideous Doctor Romano. <br /> <br /> British director Alan Parker has taken really well. He allowed the performers to dance, act and sing to their heart's content without affecting their style and influencing them. Throughout the duration of the film, we'll see the different stages that students spend during their four years - from their auditions to freshman year, to graduating from New York's High School For The Arts. Celebrity is one of those movies that are directed or directed at a particular audience. It is definitely NOT for everyone. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it very much because I have an interest in the arts - not technical in terms of presenting performers, because I am not one, but as someone who appreciates creativity and Artistic expression can be advertised through hard work, commitment and passion to what one does with one's talents. So, if you're an aspiring dancer, actor, or just a creative, you might be interested in a movie like this one - but whether the events in Fame are like those at a performing arts university is a different story. <br /> <br /> The 2009 remake of this movie was recently released, and frankly, it practically fades in comparison. <br /> <br /> As for the original Fame, almost 30 years later, though a bit dated, it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's not an absolute classic A cult classic from the 80s, which is in line with other 80s dance hits like Footloose and Flashdance, meets Fame just right. Is not it a coincidence that all these dance films start with the letter 'F'? <br /> <br /> Pebbly, moving and fascinating, this is well worth a visit.
