Let's clear the mistake - the movie should have been much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant, fascinating man who led a complex, challenging life. There was simply no way to fit or even touch anything in a standard length movie. With that in mind, the creators of this film have done an admirable (and I'm certainly quite agonizing) assignment to put together a movie that can not tell the full story, but managed to present a representative selection of the man and his music. The strengths of Ray Charles were evident throughout the film and his weaknesses were neither reinforced nor sugar-coated. We could have wished for another hour to document his life after 1980, but I think that would have made the movie a tribute and would have allowed the release of some things that got stuck in the end. Balance I think it was better than shown. <br /> <br /> Now to the big question: What are the criteria for an Oscar? The woman and I have seen countless films in our years, but we agreed at once that we have never seen a performance equal to that of Jamie Foxx. The border between actor and figure was not blurry, but disappeared completely. We had heard a lot about the hype before we saw the movie, but it was scary. Foxx was Ray Charles. You did not feel the movie with the feeling that you saw Foxx portray Ray Charles brilliantly - you saw him somehow believing or understanding that you saw Ray Charles himself. I do not know how to put it another way. We were totally blown away. I admit that this year we have not seen all the other performances for an Oscar, but that really does not matter. Foxx has put it in a nutshell, something we've never experienced and doubt we'll ever see it again. I can not imagine another film in which I've ever played a person who so completely and convincingly plays the role she portrayed. We greet you, Mr Foxx. We know that the awarding of an Oscar has much more to do than just the performance. Whether you win or not, we want you to know that you have done something that is in a class of its own and that you should be enormously proud of your unparalleled achievement. <br /> <br /> PS The music was great, of course. I noticed the woman that if there was a moment in the history of music that I wish I could have witnessed, it would have been the genesis (in Kansas City, right?) What'd I Say? The movie did a wonderful job - I only wish I could have been there!
