This is a great, romantic comedy that deals with love, work, public taste and mid-life crises. The main character is a talented film director who decides to shoot a dumb PG-13 movie to free himself from the IRS. It has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from deadpan to slapstick) and good writing. It is also a lopsided broadcast of the film industry. The meta-commentary contains several excellent cuts between the reality and the film being filmed, and in some places the film deviates from strict realism. The result is a multi-dimensional masterpiece of dry midlife humor.
