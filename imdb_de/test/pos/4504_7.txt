Can a film be too faithful to the book on which it is based? After the time adjustment of Khaled Hosseini's huge seller from the year 2007, the answer is rather ironic "yes". How many was fascinated by the book, an impressive first attempt by the Afghan-American writer / doctor. Of course, it was director Marc Forster ("Stranger Than Fiction") and screenwriter David Benioff ("Troy") who meticulously considered the key details of the story within the film's 127-minute film run. However, the seamless blend of heartfelt events in Hosseini's novel often appears episodic and cut-off, as Forster and Benioff sincerely strive to remain true to the full scope of the story within its time limits. Part of the challenge is how Hosseini carefully used the symbolic actions to lend the essentially tripartite story a literary, contemporary and current symmetry, a technique that can be thought of on the screen as somewhat elaborate. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers, however, do the right thing by giving the viewer an intimate glimpse into a hidden culture that has been transmitted through CNN news reports to ensure authenticity by allowing the characters in Dari-Persian Dialect of the Afghan language are spoken and the emotions are captured entanglements of the complex narrative. The first part of the film takes place in 1978 in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion and the eventual takeover of the Taliban. The focus is on the relationship between Amir, the son of a wealthy merchant named Baba, and devoted Hassan, the son of his father's servant. Connected by their mutual love for kite racing, the two are as thick as thieves until a tragic event separates them irreparably. Unable to find the courage so natural to his father, Amir is guilty of not saving Hassan from an unspeakable act of a trio of local mobbers. Forster highlights the ethnic tensions between the Hazara and the Pashtuns in Afghanistan. After the 1979 invasion of the Soviets, Amir and Baba flee to the US, where the story takes hold nine years later. Fremont, California, a suburban suburb of Afghan emigres. Baba only has to work at petrol stations and run a flea market kiosk. Amir meets an Afghan girl and marries. This is the least interesting passage in the film, as Benioff's supporting characters, like Amir's wife Soraya, only have a few bells and whistles, and most critically Amir is necessarily portrayed as a restrained young man indulging in self-esteem. The final section flashes twelve years after Amir is summoned to publish his first book in the Taliban dictation of Afghanistan to save Hassan's son from the Taliban, to pay for his cowardice years ago. In this part of the story, true tension and fear are created as shocking revelations and old acquaintances pursue Amir on his journey. A British actor of the Egyptian heritage, Khalid Abdalla (the leading kidnapper in "United 93") has a central role for Amir as an adult, a challenging role as he constantly has to convey shame and diminished self-worth to the end. The other professional actors are doing better - Shaun Toub (Tony Stone's rescuer Yinsen in the current "Iron Man") as Baba's business partner Rahim Khan, who holds the key to the truth; Atossa Leoni, who acts calmly as Soraya; and best of all, the Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi, who gives Baba pride and dignity. Three young non-professionals were recruited from the Kabul school system to play the key roles of the child, and all are pretty good. Zekeria Ebrahimi, as a young Amir, has grown to challenge the hardest part, and Ali Danish Bakhtyari is considered Hassan's almost catatonic son Sohrab. But it is the sad, moon-faced Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada who, as a young Hassan, will break your heart, especially in the devastating pomegranate throwing scene. It can be said that his performance is comparable to that of young Enzo Staiola in Vittorio de Sica's classic "Bicycle Thieves". <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are good, especially the clean cinematography of Roberto Schaefer (West China Convinced) (Substitute for Afghanistan), Alberto Iglesias' evocative rating and even the CGI effects the dragons show in turbulent flights , The 2008 DVD features a number of extras that begin with a revealing commentary by Forster, Hosseini, and Benioff, though some of their dialogues seem more coercive. There are two features - the first is the 14-minute "Words from the Kite Runner," which focuses on Hosseini's connection to the story and the evolution of the novel, "a standard behind-the-scenes look at the production the original movie trailer, a few previews and a PSA by Hosseini on how to help the Afghans during their current plight.
