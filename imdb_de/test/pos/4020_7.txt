Hey, you, your crooks, you stonefox, you mean guys. Attention, Slaughter is back in town! If you're looking for a nasty, funky movie that you can watch at night, then this is just the ticket. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to make it easier after his adventures in Mexico. But if you're a tight-knit gangster like 'Duncan', you'll have to take revenge. I dont know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first his brother or what? Someone. The film begins with the old routine "Attack from the plane". We all know that this is the most effective way to take a guy on a picnic with people. Needless to say, Slaughter survived the ordeal, but Cmndt. Eric Lassard, I'm sorry, George Gaynes, I mean, is not so happy. CLAP!! Slaughter's best friend Pratt is also killed. This is the beginning of a great adventure filled with the hippest and funky music James Brown has to offer. That's right. "The godfather of the soul" has left its mark on this evil boy. In addition to Jim Brown in the main part, this movie is filled with some of the biggest names in the blaxploitation scene. How about Scatman Crothers, Dick Anthony Williams, Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters? Elsewhere, we see none other than Judith M. Brown, and not least the fantastic Don Stroud as the evil stooge.
