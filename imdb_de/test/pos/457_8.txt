I've seen several Yul Brynner movies - but this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions at close range when he growls, smiles and laughs. Brynner could have been arrested in Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Glorious Seven, Brother Karamazov, and The Crazy Woman of Chaillot alike, but none of these films has captured his talent in close-ups such as this one. He arrests and teases to watch every shot. <br /> <br /> Equally fascinating and sexy without removing her clothes is Deborah Kerr. The script lets her radiate a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive. She repeated this role years later in the night of the iguana. The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help release the group from the Russians' clutches. She is shown running away from the Russian major (as opposed to the story of Maupassant or the story of Isak Denisen). The film breaks, however, with the suggested but real physical attraction of the Kerr character. <br /> <br /> Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my opinion, but she is an outstanding actress. She places her soul in the dignity of the characters she portrays, which often clashes with the spirit of the figure. This contradiction makes their roles in The Journey, Quo Vadis, and The Night of the Iguana an unforgettable experience. Why is this an unusual movie? It's not easy to see Russian characters as good people in Hollywood - Dr. Zhivago was an exception. Brynner's Romance of a Horse Thief was again a great cinema by Abraham Polonsky, but was never recognized as such due to intolerance to leftists in the aftermath of McCarthy. <br /> <br /> The film is also unusual in its cast - great French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee meet Jason Robards Jr. and British actor Robert Morley. In many ways, the film is internationally American. All four are great actors and add to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has read Maupassant and Denisen's works will find that the film does not correspond to either work. However, the movie can stand alone, as its redone (censored?) Version has a dignified charm - given the reality of the night that led to the release of the group. I think Litvak makes the last laugh by giving an interesting and plausible turn to the stories that led to the film's emergence as he interweaves parts of the two written stories (eg the last bus ride and the last kiss) , <br /> <br /> But I have a grouse - why does Hollywood never recognize the sources that inspire the stories? Only recently (eg Insomnia) were the original works mentioned prominently in the credits.
