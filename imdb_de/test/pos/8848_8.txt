In a time when almost every great horror movie of the 60s and 70s is being weaned off for the not-too-bad horror movie, it's very instructive to look back on John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING remake of a childhood favorite directed by the director, the Science fiction / horror classic Howard Hawks from 1951, THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not such a big blockbuster at first when it came out in mid-1982, he has since found a very large fanbase. <br /> <br /> In fact, Carpenter's film is less of a remake of Hawks's film. It's a reworking, as it goes back to the original idea of ​​the source material, namely the John W. Campbell story "Who Goes There?" an American science team in Antarctica threatened by a changing alien is thawed out of the ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who starred in Carpenter's television feature ELVIS in 1979, and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK in 1981, leads a series of character actors such as Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart and Richard Masur. The paranoia is intensively explored, as the shape-changing "thing", which first comes to its camp in the form of a guide dog, which a Norwegian team tries to kill, takes over one after the other. It does not take long for everyone in the camp to distrust their fellow man. The end of the film, with only Russell and David left, has a disturbing and disturbing ambiguity similar to the codas that resemble both THE BIRDS and STRAW DOGS. Almost everywhere, when THE THING's theme was bought, the focus is on the extremely bloody special effects make-up and alien designs of Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on the 1980s horror classic THE FOG, and Joe Dante's 1981 Werewolf movie THE HOWLING. These effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today they can be quite meager. But all of this would no longer make Carpenter's film a high-end splatter epic if directing, storytelling, and acting were not snuffing; and thankfully, everyone is one of them. Unless he concentrates on the enormously cruel transformation sequences, Carpenter builds tension the same way that Hitchcock has influenced his previous films, HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with cinematographer Dean Cundey's camera work, particularly through the station's corridors made help. Acting improves on an already fine script adaptation by Bill Lancaster; Ennio Morricone, whose work is known for the classic Italian spaghetti westerns of the 60s by director Sergio Leone, including Carpenter, is known to us. THE THING also features fine visual effects by Albert Whitlock (who has worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS) and Roy Arbogast, who has worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD ART and JAWS 2. <br /> <br /> Carpenter's The film was not the success he could have achieved because Universal chose this graphic shocker only two weeks after the release of Steven Spielberg's much more family-friendly ET: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (not surprisingly, that critics and audience then favored Spielberg's.) excellent film about Carpenter equally excellent but very different. Most of the horror movie box office business in 1982 also went to another Spielberg-produced film, POLTERGEIST. As a result, THE THING suffered a lack of attention at a cost of $ 15 million during its time. <br /> <br /> Over time, however, many people have come to see Carpenter's film as it is - an extreme, bloody, yet extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, with a lot of flair and a true sense of humor Understanding of psychological paranoia is at the heart of her story. Although it is still pretty cruel, THE THING should be remembered for the skill with which the story is put together as well as for the bloody alien designs and make-up effects; because it's the storytelling ability and the suspense that make it so memorable in the end.
