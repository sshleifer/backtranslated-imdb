I consider myself a big horror movie fan. One night I just wanted to rent some newer horror movies to make fun of it. Then I rented Milo. I was so surprised by this movie. It scared the hell out of me. I can not say that often. Normally, Halloween only scares me. <br /> <br /> Two other friends looked at me and had a disturbed feeling. Feel good if you ask me after seeing a horror movie. If you are not affected, what's the point. <br /> <br /> This movie was original. It did not follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie. That's why films like Valentine bombarded me. <br /> <br /> Of course, many have unanswered questions, like most horror movies. But it is worth the rent.
