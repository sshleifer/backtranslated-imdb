Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biography of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who worked at the beginning of the 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ("sketching" of poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and his fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealistic imagination. <br /> <br /> The film has included excerpts from Miyazawa's poetry in the plot. His relationships with his students were powerful, especially in a scene where he offers everything he has to a student who was just caught stealing material from class. Miyazawa's selfless compassion for the peasants in his village, his sister and other unfortunate people can be a lesson to us all. In addition, Miyazawa's dedication to science was beautifully portrayed. At a time when Western ideas were still skeptical, especially in provincial towns like Miyazawa, where he grew up, he understands how useful he is to help his roommates, and he is inspired by his elegance. The way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the author was really intense and well-interpreted. <br /> <br /> I felt that the CGI had been integrated into the film, while the road to an innovative, anti-organic animation coupling was in progress. It could be argued that this was intended to portray conflicts within the main character, but I found it rather unaesthetic. I also wish the film had discussed Miyazawa's Buddhist influence, but it worked without it. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very well done. I give him a 9/10, with the one point deducted for the CGI. Otherwise, the animation, the plot and the dialogue were wonderful and heartfelt. I have not seen any other films by Kawamori Shoji, but after seeing this, I will certainly give them a chance.
