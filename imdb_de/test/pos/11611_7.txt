The dreams of Karim Hussain are to be feared. When the right hemisphere of his characters overpowers the left, shocking images of blood, dismemberment and various abominations are released. Religion does not save you, nor will Mother Nature or your own family. Hussain's dark poetry, because that's what this movie really is, and it puts all the institutions of the sanctuary out of action. <br /> <br /> 'Subconcious Cruelty' is a recent crowd pleaser on the horror / fantasy festival circuit. The opening meditation of the film about madness is well written and profound. The protagonist's desire to desecrate the birthing process that brought him into the hell he inhabits unfolds with terrible and credible illogicality. From here, the film goes deeper into the subconscious and attacks Mother Nature. Hussain offers depictions of pleasurable pagan fertility and writhing fervor. Nature is blood-soaked and violently exposed in Hussain's frightening enlightenment. <br /> <br /> "Subconscious cruelty" is for all unpleasant and rewarding for those who explores the shock of the mature themes of life, lust and madness very worthy film. CJ Goldman deserves a lot of praise for his special make-up, as well as David Kristian for annoying sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki for Score.
