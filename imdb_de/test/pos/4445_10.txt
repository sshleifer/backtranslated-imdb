"Torture Not a Duckling" is one of the coolest Italian horror movies I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call a giallo is a little misleading, because it is not really a typical murder mystery. It is more of a pure horror movie. <br /> <br /> Complete with one of the most brutal and bloodiest scenes this movie has produced in this old movie. Fulcis film shoots with a spooky ambience and an Italian classic. The environment is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect. The finale is real and original. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Do not Torture a Duckling", you really have to wonder how Fulcis later things are so out of tune. I like all his things, but he got lost. Maybe he thought he had already done it ... because he hit the mark with this movie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who thinks Dario Argento owns the Giallo genre. Fulci hits him with this. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 children.
