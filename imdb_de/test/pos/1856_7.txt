As a non-theist, I will not go into the big man's theory that changed the world 150 years ago. It is safe to say that science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind belief. Nuff said back then. <br /> <br /> The film was produced by the BBC, and to be honest, it could have been shown on television. The acting is great, but the movie itself is not really worth a movie release. If it reaches a wider audience in this way, then it should be so. But I have seen many style dramas on BBC TV, and they were on the perfect standard. Just do not expect too much from an exciting budget if you want to see it. <br /> <br /> In a way, I found that the movie was nearly running out to apologize to religious fundamentalists. While it gets a good feeling of excitement all the way through, I can not help but get The Origin Of Species published much faster than it actually did (you'll wait until the very end). And it seemed to be much more than I ever knew about Darwin's fight with himself and his wife Emma, ​​almost portraying him as some crazy madman - which is hardly true. There are many other fallacies and facts about the actual history of the run up to the release of Origin, but the film's overall premise focuses almost exclusively on the difficulties faced by Darwin domestically with the book, and a small part on it the death of his beloved daughter Annie. This gives the film its most moving scene in which Annie dies as she asks one last time to hear that Darwin is telling the story of a trapped orangutan who died of pneumonia. In this scene, you probably feel more connected to the primate than to Darwin's daughter. <br /> <br /> With the early controversy surrounding the movie in the US, it will work well to promote it and many more people will see it. But to be honest, there is very little that offends every mythical god. There are hardly any headlines about a theory that is around 150 years old. But since fundamental Christians (and many other religions we all know) like to wave one or two posters whenever possible, I think this movie is a good excuse like any other. Personally, I can not see what the hustle and bustle is all about. But maybe they are just monkeys around ...
