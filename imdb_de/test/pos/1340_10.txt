This was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid. It had everything - music, stories, a talking squirrel and giggling daisies. I wanted to be one of those hippie girls who sing and swing on a swing. I'm 35 and I grew up in South Jersey, but we have three New York channels with our cable connection, and I think it was on Channel 11. They just do not do shows like this anymore (I know that makes me hear me very old, and I'm thrilled that I grew up with only 9 channels on our TV, but I could always find something cool to watch, I just talked to another person who actually heard and saw this show Three years younger than me and raised in North Jersey, I would like to see this series on DVD so that I could show her to my 5 year old daughter, and she could see what stupid (but great) stuff her mother used to see. I just found a VHS tape from a few episodes and a music CD from the show on ebay, and I bought them directly, even if they were a bit expensive, so I can not wait to see them back experience!
