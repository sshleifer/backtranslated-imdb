I finally managed to see this movie ... after so many years of anticipation ... <br /> <br /> I was so curious if this movie is as bad as some people say. <br /> <br /> And my opinion is that this movie was not bad at all, on the contrary, it was amazing ... <br /> <br /> I enjoyed every second of it ... from the beginning until the end ... <br /> <br /> The actors were great, they made me feel that I was living the story at the same time the movie was running ... <br /> <br /> The Landscapes were so beautiful the movies were filmed ... and it charmed me .. the music was exceptional and I have nothing <br /> <br /> to blame. <br /> <br /> I think the plot was very original, I do not think I've seen a movie like this ... <br /> <br /> It's a shame he's not up the world is recognized. I get the chance to see it. I give this movie 10/10
