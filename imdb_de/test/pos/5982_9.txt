An astonishingly shocking report by two soldiers in World War II. Against a freezing background, not only in the fight against the Nazis and traitors in Belarus, but also in the harsh natural elements, this film tells of two soldiers with polarized moral concepts, one of which survives, but it is somewhat impossible to deal with him one's own circumstances and the one who dies have done everything that can be done in the face of intimidation, and all that is possible to break his spirit is actually the "ascendant" of the title. A film that should be seen by everyone, especially for the phenomenal performances of the main characters, and shattering set pieces (especially imprisonment and hanging scenes). An absolute must.
