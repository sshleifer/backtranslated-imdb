The film Classe tous risques, directed by Claude Sautet, was not a film. To be honest, I had never really heard of it until the New York Film Forum said that it would have a two-week film screening with new English subtitles. When I also read that it was the classic French crime films like Jean Pierre Melville, I took the opportunity to take a close look at it (at best, it would keep up with its great works, and in the worst case, I would get something good.) Popcorn in a big theater). It was worth the recognition because Classe tous Risques is one of the French films that are just waiting to be rediscovered (or first discovered). With a tremendous, tense diligence, Sautet holds the suspense tight for the first forty minutes of the film, holds a good (though not great) middle section, and then ends up with what's always to be expected with these films, but with fascinating motivations through the figures. With a movie of this kind you know how it will end, but it's the cool, attentive journey that counts. <br /> <br /> The film offers a performance of true honesty and honesty amidst the "old-school" criminal code, by Lino Ventura as Aldo, at the beginning of the film (one of the best beginnings of a film in this genre and this Country) with his partner in crime steals a huge sum. When late in the evening suddenly an ugly fate occurs on the beach, Aldo is again with two small children on the run. He gets help from Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo, a role that Le Doulos only plays with a little more humanity and charisma), who is also a thief and drives him to Paris. However, there are some problems with some of Aldo's old business partners, and an old score could be just right. A few times the action seems to be slow, but it is not. Like Melville, Sautet does not put any fat in his story, and it's a very tightly structured film, with a few good doses of humor here and there (I sometimes grinned at the audacity of the criminals in the first chase sequence and also at that grin with a certain Woman who had a tricky thing with her cat and a fish). <br /> <br /> Along with a fine evaluation of the great George Delerue, an extraordinary cinematography and a mood that is rarely met, let alone matched up, Classe tous Risques recalls this bridge between the real old-school movie Noir and the latest crime films. Gangsters in these new "Thug Life" films have one-thousandth of the class and honor of the thieves in this film and are a second banana to Melville's and Jules Dassin's works (a compliment I assure you). That it has a good realistic, moral advantage also helps.
