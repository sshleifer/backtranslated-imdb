I also saw this movie at a film festival, but unlike the previous poster, I found it both interesting and original. In a sea of ​​terrible traits shorts are often twice as bad for small budgets and bad acting, but A.W.O.L is a tight little thriller that backs off on "The Outer Limits". The performances are solid, which you would not expect from Morse or McGinley, and the direction is sharp and money-dependent. Personally, I find it difficult to reconcile the comments from the previous poster with the movie I've seen. A.W.O.L is quite aptly written by Shane Black, who plays the genre as usual, paying homage to both the sensibility of the stories and the pulp dances, winking at the audience and never taking himself too seriously. All in all, A.W.O.L proves to be an extremely well executed and entertaining movie.
