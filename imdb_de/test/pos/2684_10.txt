This is the best comedy time. It is underestimated! Smart witty humor, great casting! Jerry Stiller is the jewel on the show, he's hilarious and quirky, just a weird genius! Doug and Carrie have great chemistry! So I do not understand what the hype is about everybody loves Raymond. It is SO flooded with lame jokes, mostly forced humor and just not the funny show. I can not remember laughing in more than one episode. King of Queens is a rare comedy that offers all the right ingredients for a serious belly laugh that is usually caused by Arthur Spooner. I think it's about time that this comedy gets the hype it deserves, not the lame Raymond & CO.
