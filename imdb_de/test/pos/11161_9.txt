In contrast to the predecessor correspondent here, I thought, Shopping Munich (as it was shown at the German Film Festival in November 2007 here in London with English subtitles), was very funny, played very well and excellently outlined. <Br /> <br /> It's pretty daring to create a 100-minute movie that is solely and relentlessly made up of talking heads. I think Ralf Westhoff was successful with humor and verve. There are no standard cinematic tools that follow, for example, the soul-baring utterance of a character with a meditative minor-seventh chord music and long natural cutaways. But when someone said something that revealed his souls - well, we were pushed by the man with the timer for another superficial introduction. That's the point, of course: the hectic tickbox superficiality of thirty-something towns, where everything depends on a quick question and answer. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of the films are so clich√©d and stupid that we English are ready to laugh at a vague intelligent and uncontrolled cinema, but I can promise you that tonight (Curzon Cinema, November 25, 2007 ) the whole audience roared with laughter. So I was not the only one laughing! <br /> <br /> My friend (who speaks German and lived in Munich) thought it was funny. I (who does not speak German and was not in Munich, I think) thought it was funny. I would recommend Shopping (Munich) to anyone (especially couples ...) looking for a smart, witty, original and clever film about the superficiality of modern relationships and the confusion of the generation that missed the lucky one - always after the first time. <br /> <br /> NB In the English subtitle show in London, the subtitles (which were very good) were displayed completely under the slightly reduced image, not within. I thought that would be a good thing.
