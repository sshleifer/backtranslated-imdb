I had previously written only a review on IMDb, as I think most games are unworthy of the time and effort ... Monkey Island's curse is different. <br /> <br /> After playing and impressing Monkey 1 and 2, I had great expectations for the third release ... and was not disappointed. The first thing that hit me was the significantly improved graphics. Do not get me wrong. For games made in 1990 and 1991, Monkey 1 and 2 were groundbreaking and delivered the goods well, but CMI is making progress and delivering an excellent cartoon game that is both fun and satisfying. All scenes and settings have been carefully crafted and thought out and are a perfect match for this style. The animation / CGI is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; a fantastic combination in this case. <br /> <br /> For me, the script was crucial to the success of the last two games. The CMI script is smart, fitting and, above all, absolutely funny. In addition, the script is now in contrast to the previous two audio files, where textual language is displayed at the bottom of the screen. Dominic Armato's voice is perfect for Guybrush: funny, clear and slightly naive. All the other talents fit perfectly with their characters, especially Earl Boen, who is the voice behind LeChuck. I loved every single character in the game: not just the personality and the joke, but also the way each character is animated excellently and unmistakably. To audio effects the soundtrack is worth mentioning. The soundtracks for Monkey 1 and 2 were both monotone. Nevertheless, they were very effective in creating atmosphere and changing the mood. The soundtrack of CMI is again a step up. Each scene is complemented by a catchy, subtle, playful, and pirate-like melody (if that's a word). With a change in attitude or mood, the music also adapts and adds to the entertainment and entertainment the game offers. <br /> <br /> The whole idea behind Monkey Island is to solve puzzles and problems to make progress. This may sound simple, but is devilishly difficult in many places. Some may be deterred by the logic and amount of thinking that can be found on Monkey Island, but in reality this makes the game even more entertaining and entertaining, and also adds to the replay value. The Monkey Island Curse or The Pirates of the Monkey Island Mega Monkey option (with trickier and richer puzzles) is for players of all abilities and provides a good reason to play the game at least twice. Whichever level of difficulty you choose, you will have a different game every time you play it, with numerous language options and other puzzles to clear that will not affect the outcome of the game, but are just for fun. The most entertaining part of the game is Ship Combat, and the sword "fights" that follows. These were particularly well thought out and make the game absolutely worthwhile. Add to this an amazing story that is non-violent and suitable for any age that will make you addicted and want more until the end. <br /> <br /> Finally, a special mention of the designers of this game. The way in which each complex puzzle and problem is thought through is simply amazing. While collecting objects and objects during the game, you can not see how everyone will assist you in your progress, but with a little thought and perseverance, there are solutions and CMI designers must be highly praised. <br /> 10/10 for the best game I've ever played (no exaggeration)
