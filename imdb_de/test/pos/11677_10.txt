I saw this movie in the theater when I was 14, and that changed my life. I immediately cut off my hair and bought all the records of the bands in the film. These were some of the pioneering bands of L. A. Punk Rock filmed at the peak of their power. Bands like Black Flag (Pre-Rolling), Circle Jerks, Fear, X and the Germs have few peers in the history of punk music. I can not believe that this movie has never been released on video or DVD. Great movie for fans of punk rock.
