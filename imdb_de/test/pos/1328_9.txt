The twelve from Ocean are probably better than the eleven from Ocean. I know that most people would not agree, but I actually like it more. After three years, it was good to see the gang returning. The reason for the robbery is the second time a little more inspired. I understand why they stole Benedict (Andy Garcia) in the last movie. This film gives them a little more motivation the second time around. Ocean's twelve is more entertaining and cooler than Ocean's eleven. With a funny cameo from Topher Grace, he said, "I just went into this new Dennis Quaid movie" and other things. I think Ocean's Twelve is probably the best in the series. <br /> <br /> The Plot: About a year after Ocean's Twelve, Terry Benedict (the guy they robbed in the last movie) returns, saying that Ocean's eleven does not pay him back the money they stole , he calls the police. Then Danny Ocean and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old policewoman Isabelle. After she has met him again, she follows them. In addition, the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a bit better than himself. With many funny scenes like when Tess (Julia Roberts) goes to Europe and pretends to be Julia Roberts, Ocean's Twelve is a pretty clever movie. It's cooler, funnier and more entertaining than the Ocean's eleven.
