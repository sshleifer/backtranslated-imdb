I've always loved this scratchy, voiced guy in all these Westerns. He was the buddy (jingles) in the Wild Bill Hickock Show in the fifties. In it he has the perfect vehicle for his wonderful, boastful character. He is harmless and no one believes him, but he is not nervous and still goes on. If you have a guy like this, there is no challenge, because the details are not there. Of course, in this episode, he is taken by a group of aliens aboard a spaceship who have no sense of humor and believe everything they hear. They do not have the word lie in their vocabulary. As it turns out, he is so unbearable that they can not treat him. and then of course there is the secret weapon. Just see it to watch Andy.
