I really liked that. I know it's very common with today's clich√© plot lines and way too much play, but it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> In our search for horror cheese of the 70s and 80s we come across many flicks that are so bad are good. We also have some that are so 'good' sucking, and then we have some that are so bad that they are just bad. This is definitely so bad that it is good. <br /> <br /> Some teens on the move find an 'oasis' in the middle of nowhere, a forgotten piece of America by the roadside, and they decide to give it a try. They cross each line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it. They pay dearly. <br /> <br /> Normally I would not give a movie like this a 9, but the girls in this movie are the ones we miss from the 70s: ditzy, sparsely clothed, and FIT. These are not the anorexic puddings of today's horrific horror; In prey shorts they look great. <br /> <br /> I give 9 out of 10 children, children.
