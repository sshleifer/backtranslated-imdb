This is another movie that I can remember for a long time to watch TV, to scare myself out of myself at the impressive age of about 12, and then condemn myself to a life of horror film obsession. This is a great movie that serves as living proof that CGI actually had realistic effects. <br /> <br /> Located on an isolated base in the Antarctic, this version seems to have almost replaced the original version (The Thing From Another World). The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base a few kilometers away. Everyone is dead, and only the half-charred remnants of something unidentifiable that has been glowing outside the facility could provide answers to what may have happened. The thing is brought back to the American base and too late the scientists realize that it is alive and deadly. The thing appears and is gone, not only kills everyone and everything that crosses its path, but also absorbs it, makes it to who, and whatever it wants. The film then becomes a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspicious, anyone can be The Thing, and nobody trusts anyone anymore. The strength and security that is found when people despite their differences fight against a monster have disappeared. The group splinters and fears the rules. Who is that thing? <br /> <br /> The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and chaotically realistic. I could have gone up without the head of the dogs like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me who's picky: kill all the people you want, but leave the kittens and puppies alone. Reason and reason dissolve quickly, as people are gradually taken over by the shapeshifter. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer it; The real threat lies in and is frightening because it can not be seen or easily recognized. When forced to hide, the anger is huge and the results are terrible. <br /> <br /> This is one of Carpenters' best movies, right at the top with The Fog and Halloween. All actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so strong that they are considered their main character. This movie has something for every lover of the horror genre. Do not miss it.
