Or maybe not. Whatever anyone thinks of "broadcast news", "good" or "bad", almost all of the merit of this "thinking" belongs to author-producer-director James L. Brooks. As a scriptwriter (of whom he has long been one of the best) it is not easy to plunder an entire business - in this case the "business" is about television news - but to do it with a smile and a wink knowing nod and a laugh practically on every step of the way. To do all that, you need real talent, something that Mr. J. Brooks has in abundance. <br /> <br /> One user of this website summarized the musical question: "Has Walter Cronkite behaved like that?" Answer: No! Of course not! And the reason is Walters - er, Mr. Cronkites - day - the only thing that mattered was bringing the news to people. The same applies to John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Sure, they had to pay lip service to their ratings, if only to please their bosses. But all they really cared about was THE NEWS ITSELF. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything has changed. For the last 25 to 30 years in the network news business, the only thing that really matters is ratings, ratings and ratings. The quintessence. How much money will our news department deliver to the network? Do not you believe that? <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at "The Big Three": Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (also known as "Stanley Stunning"). All three have been working on their respective Anchor Tables for the last 15 to 20 years (Peter had already received his first shot at the National Anchor Desk in the 1960s, but was totally unprepared for the job). Of the three, Dan is the one who has the most training as a reporter in the field. Personally, I think all three of them are great anchors and deserve their positions. All this has nothing to do with the reason why all three are actually in these jobs. All three are now in their 60s (Dan pushes the big 7-0) and all three still look very good. And if you think they still look good, imagine how good they looked in their 40s when all three were hired for their current jobs (let's say "set"). But do you really believe that one of these three would have been "put in" if he had looked like Fred Gwynne ("Herman Munster")? Or how - heaven refuses me! Not only that, if Dan retired tomorrow, a younger Walter Cronkite (as he is today) could not get his old job back. Why? Not nice enough. And it does not matter if he is or was the "most trustworthy man in America". <br /> <br /> And that's what "Broadcast News" is all about. Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), the next handsome boy national news anchor who has trouble with a few minor things, such as thinking, writing and knowing for himself. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the brilliant news producer with news standards and ethics, who all fall into the wind, even if she falls in love with the handsome boy Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, no relation to James L.), a top Newswriter and field reporter who has no hope for a national job because he is "flop-sweats" behind the anchor table. And many other such flawed characters that you truly know exist in the news sections of the various networks. <br /> <br /> "Network" has paved the way. Eleven years later, "Broadcast News" wore the torch as a worthy successor. What will be the next movie in the new millennium that will determine the network news business "News that you can use" ... maybe. Or maybe not.
