My father's hero is cute, funny and cute. Gerard Depardiu is great as Andre, a divorced father who takes his fourteen-year-old daughter Nicole (Kathrine Heigl) for a holiday in the Caribbean. There, his daughter meets a man named Ben (Dalton James.). She impresses him Andre is her lover and that her father is in jail for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute she ran away with her pimp. Everyone on the island has the impression that Andre is a child molester. One with Isabelle (Emma Thompson making a cameo at the end of the movie) and Diana (Faith Prince from Spin City). My father, the hero, has many funny moments. Like when he's on a talent show and everyone asks him to play Some French. He plays "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" by Gigi. Everyone gets disgusted and leaves. My father, the hero, does not deserve 5.1. I think he deserves a 9.0.
