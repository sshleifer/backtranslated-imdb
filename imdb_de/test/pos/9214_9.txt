I have to admit that I'm a fan of kitsch 80s cartoons, but this is one of the best. Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer are one of the most observable and entertaining cartoons of the Rainbow Brite and are much better than the TV series. I especially like the relationship between Rainbow and Darian and find them very amusing. However, my favorite character is Starlite, who is definitely the "most magnificent horse in the universe". <br /> <br /> I also recommend Rainbow Brite: New Beginnings, which tells the story of Rainbowland. Have a rainbow day!
