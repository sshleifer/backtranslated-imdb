I have seen this movie twice and am very impressed. <br /> <br /> The conversations between Nimi and her mother, as well as Nimi and Matthew are very touching. The Nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colorfully as it normally is. <br /> <br /> Although certain things could have got away with a little more explanation; If we knew why Matthew was ever in the South of France, the scenes that follow Matthew would have been found in his car, more understandably that helps to better understand such scenes. <br /> <br /> I would see it again, but unfortunately it had a limited release in London and is no longer available. I hope the video release makes it accessible to a wider audience because the movie deserves it.
