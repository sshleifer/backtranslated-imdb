Maybe it had something to do with seeing this movie at a low point in my life, when I was really trying to figure out where I wanted to go and what it took to make me happy, but this movie really spoke to me. Jane is a Everywoman: Although she has so many positive things for her, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. She is strong and intelligent, but she was prevented from reaching her potential by an unfortunate coincidence, and lives a second-life life. Seeking new challenges and happiness, she desperately wants to fill the hole in her heart. Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane. As we travel with her, we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her despair and, finally, the strength of her conviction. The beautiful Addie Yungmee is also very well staffed and a gain for the production. Allison Mackie is a scene stealer as a cheeky character with impeccable timing. I highly recommend this movie. Although it is a low budget, it has large budget values ​​and production values. PS- great aerial photography with two beautiful sexy women. Women will love the story and the characters, but there is something for the men too. :)
