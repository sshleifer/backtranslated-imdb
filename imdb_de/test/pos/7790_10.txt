Well, starting with Rajkumar, Santoshi is not a comedy filmmaker, and that's really unfortunate, because the only comedy movie he made is a masterpiece. This movie is really funny really laugh riots and characters r really full of fun. Story-Line in a simple daughter of a Billionaires, who came to India to marry. Two young boys are standing behind her. The story has a twist with the connection of a gangster. An Amir who plays a street smart guy Amar has played his role with brilliance and Salman played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection. Ravena has done well, but Karshima is really irritating in some sequences. But real showstars Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor, they step into the frame and start laughing automatically. All in all a so entertaining movie that you can not see it. without getting bored.
