That's why Dark The Night is a difficult challenge: it's very difficult to write about in detail without ruining it for those who have not seen it yet. Since it stays pretty dark, this includes almost everyone. The film will meet those familiar with the well-known titles of director Joseph H. Lewis in the Noir Cycle. Gun Crazy, The Big Combo, even My Name Is Julia Ross, which resembles in their brevity? as an odd choice. <br /> <br /> For beginners, the rural landscape of France serves as a backdrop. Steven Geray, a middle-aged detective in Surété, Paris, is on his way to the village of Ste. Margot (or maybe Margaux). Quite unexpectedly, he falls in love with the daughter of the Inkeepers (Micheline Cheirel), although she has become engaged to a rough farmer from the area. However, the siren song of Parisian life is hard to resist, and she agrees to marry him, despite the age difference that inevitably becomes the talk of the town. <br /> <br /> But on the night of her engagement party, she does not return to the inn. Soon, a hunchback finds her body by the river. Her jealous, hooded lover is the logical suspect, but he too is found dead. Then anonymous notes threaten more deaths that occur. For the first time in his career, the bereaved Geray is dull ... <br /> <br /> A particularly weak script. It seems that Cornell Woolrich is crossed with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. But Lewis makes this squeaky vehicle proud. He takes his time in the beginning, but then the story? and storytelling? you gain momentum (unfortunately, at about the time the script breaks an axis). Burnett Guffey illuminated and photographed the film with a fascinating leitmotif, to look out of windows and to look into them; There is also an effective score of Hugo Friedhofer, who provided many noirs with acoustic threat. So Dark The Night wasted a lot of talent, but in the end it's not much more than a gimmick. and not very good gimmicks. It's a one-trick pony of a movie. <br /> <br />
