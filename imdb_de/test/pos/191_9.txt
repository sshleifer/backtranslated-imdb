Director Mikhail Kalatozov's film The Cranes Flies (Letyat zhuravli) is a glorious piece of cinema. From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov, based on his own play, Kalatozov shows a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering of the home. Flooded with countless war films that show us the front and the carnage, the subject itself becomes boring and avoidable. However, this Russian jewel shows how the story of distress can be told differently. Speaking straight from the mouth of a soldier, how war is hated by all, that they hope the dead will do so for a cause that will bring peace and the end of the fight, we see a new vision of World War II. We have young men who voluntarily wage war for peace to keep their families and loved ones safe at home instead of fighting armed forces they do not believe in. With so much hatred of our present situation in the Middle East and on the people dying for no reason, against their will, it is nice to see a movie that shows how selfless and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those who are waiting for their return , <br /> <br /> Communist Russia shows how much everyone was involved in the war. While Boris volunteered to go to the front, his father is chief physician of a hospital helping to heal injured soldiers, and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl Veronika, doing everything possible to deter her from the fact that no letter has come from her love. An entire city comes out to send the boys to the party. Even the factory, for which Boris and his friend Stepan work, sends representatives with gratitude. Whether all this is a glorified view in Russia at the beginning of the Second World War or not, I do not know. There are no protests or misunderstandings of these boys risking their lives for a country, it's all praise and thanks. Some in America could learn a lesson from it, because whether you agree with the coming war or not, protesting and devastating in his name only Sullies, what these men and women sacrifice every day and every day. <br /> <br /> The acting is consistently top-notch, but some deserve to be highlighted. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris' grandmother. She is the only family member he can trust, and her grief over his leaving is evident on her face and in her body language. Vasili Merkuryev, perhaps the best performing patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich. As stated in the end, fathers have to hold back hidden tears, Merkuryev embodies these feelings. He pulls on a tough face, especially when he jokes and rides his son hard when he finds out he volunteered just hours before he has to leave. But as Boris leaves to go to the collection station, we see the true pain of the man sitting in grief at the table. He loves his son very much, and although he may not be able to show it to him, his actions throughout the movie leave it to the public. Aleksey Batalov is happy as Boris, a happy young man and idealist who does what he thinks fit, and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as a vicious Mark because he stays home because of his talented piano skills or perhaps just steals his cousin's love , This love, played by Tatyana Samojlova, really draws the audience into their grief, their depression and their thin glimmer of hope. The true star of the movie, she has to go through many emotions on a journey where she loses her way and has to return on course, hoping that she did so early enough for Boris' return. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realism of the story and the fear of a tragedy to convey the theme, I also liked the visual style of the film. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is amazing, especially considering that the film was shot in full-screen mode. It's one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama. It is totally different to do this in a square frame. Right at the beginning we get a nice static shot of a winding catwalk on the water, in the background a bridge in the background, while our two lovers jump up the screen into the distance. There are several cases where the camera is behind barriers and yet the action becomes visible, creating a unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are used as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated stringing of characters in the frame. <br /> <br /> The real exploits, however, are the cases in which the long shot is great. Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers, it's been great ever since she strolls through those who say goodbye to their loved ones while looking for Boris, saying their own farewell. The planning for this shot must have been extensive, as the camera, as it moves in and out of people, concentrates on kisses of couples, on people screaming at each other, and more, intentionally in the picture at certain times while the camera is moving moved through it. Everybody had to hit the bullseye and a brilliant cinema was born. It's just part of a towering masterpiece of sound and style. The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and Mise en Sc√®ne can show the public what it takes, as easily as possible. Composition and professionalism of actors and the crew can do wonders and add something that huge set pieces and special effects can never offer.
