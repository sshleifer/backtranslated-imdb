I think John Houston's "The Dead" is a true classic. It's not just Houston's last film, it's quoted as saying, "Everything I know about filmmaking is in this movie." Adapted to the Dubliners by James Joyce, the story is a great ensemble piece featuring Sterling performances by Angelica Houston, John's daughter, and a cast of English and Irish actors who bring the story to life. This is a movie that should be part of a serious collection, not only because it is visually elegant, but also because the story is timeless and very appealing. The movie is not rushing and not burdened with acts. Rather, the story unfolds within the characters, which lend the dialogue light and meaning. The end of the film is breathtaking, poetic and haunting. I can unreservedly recommend "The Dead" as one of the best films ever made.
