Decalogue 5, according to the fifth commandment, "Thou shalt not kill," can be considered a violent charge against the death penalty: it is not by chance that he brings the idea of ​​a state fully in line with the provisions of an unjust law at the same level as a murderer. " But the law can not imitate nature, it could correct it, "says Piotr, the defender, a true catalyst character," punishment is a form of revenge that aims to bring evil back to evil without preventing crime whose name does the law take its revenge, really in the name of the innocent? "The frightening and detailed sequences of the last half hour of a man sentenced to death add value to the uselessness of the deterrent function, which is applied to the death penalty, to intimidate all potential criminals. "Desperate grievances do not require desperate remedies," Kieslowski says in his message, and teaches us how unjust the act of disobedience to a commandment of God can be that judges punishment in the same way as crime. There are three different moral attitudes: the innate sense of rebellion of the MURDERER, which aims to arouse the hostile hustle and bustle of the environment; the strong sense of VICTIM's chronic indifference tended to laugh at other people's needs; the meritorious conduct of the DEFENSE COUNCIL, which is always ready to fight adversity in favor of human life. The struggle for life is ruthlessly vivisected all the time; The characters plunge into scenes of suffering and distress, in a cityscape accented with greenish tones, seen in their own reflections through the windshield of a taxi. Everything in "Decalogue 5" conveys a terrible sense of alienation and isolation: descriptions of a wasted undergrowth of violence and stupidity, scenes of precarious working conditions, gloomy appearances of buildings immersed in an anonymous aura of desolation, aimless detours through disenchanted environments. Jazek, the protagonist, is forced to fight an opponent stronger than himself: a city that is completely engrossed in deep indifference, apparently hostile and deaf to all its mutes, asks for help, while a faded photograph of one little girl in a first communion dress appears to gnaw his soul. He irrevocably directs his steps on a separate path to damnation, as seen by the deformations of the 18 mm. Wide-angle camera lens with the aim of distorting every detail, changing reality and masking it in distant and strange echoes. Unlike some Hollywood stereotypes such as "I Want to Live" (by Robert Wise), Kieslowski does not create mitigating circumstances in favor of the defendant with honey-tongued melodrama tones. He does not disappear on the banana peel of useless, pathetic scenes to mitigate Jazek's guilt and mitigate the brutality of the crime. He is not interested in obvious psychological motives to justify any representation of extreme or violent behavior, and refuses to take unnecessary legal action. In other words, according to Kieslowsky, "crime is always a crime": on the principle of "par condicio", he puts the prosecutor on the same level as the convicted man, using many signs or symbols to represent a society, the one in the most sinister light. And we can not remain indifferent: even if we disagree with him, Jazek's cries of pain touch our hearts with compassion in the same way as Terri Schiavo's mesmerizing eyes.
