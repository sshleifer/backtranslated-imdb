I saw that in a theater in 1982. I was expecting a stupid T & A movie. I do not have that. <br /> <br /> Basically it's about three teens trying to have sex. We get the expected sex jokes and scenes - but for once they're pretty funny! <br /> <br /> Yes, they are stupid, but I enjoyed them anyway. There was also a surprising amount of male nudity. Then, about halfway through, the film makes a sudden dramatic turn when one of the boys (played profitably by Lawrence Monoson) falls in love with a girl. Then the jokes stop and it gets very dark. I will not reveal what happened, but I was very surprised by the sudden turn of events. The film addresses some very important topics and treats them realistically and with intelligence. And it has a really heartbreaking ending. <br /> <br /> I give this a 10 because this is probably one of the best teen sex comedies / dramas ever made. It mixes fantasy and realism together and works! What more can you ask for? It also has a great soundtrack.
