If you are tired, the first hour might be slow. The story's story has a natural, leisurely pace without haste - so we have time to recognize everyday life and the situations in which the main characters are located. Once you have reached the climactic part of the plot, you will be addicted to the turn of events: how will things develop, what will happen to our precious Fanda (presented to absolute perfection by Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský), how will it be Woman (wonderfully played by Stella Zázvorková) treat? Ed (played by Stanislav Zindulka - a fitting buddy to Brodský) and Jára, the son with a selfish, hidden program, blind to the kindness of his parents (sigh!). Vladimír Michálek conducted the film sensibly with sprinkling humor, while preserving the enlightening script by Jirí Hubac. Thanks to clear subtitling, for every "complaining" sentence from Fanda's wife, I could tell that between the lines there is a hint of "caring" to see / bury - and so the sensible judge noted. Fanda is in '76 going 80 'and the affection of her enduring (lovable) marriage manifests even in her bitter arguments. His playfulness can be contagious. <br /> <br /> This is 'Growing Old Together 101' for (at least) the fifties and the lessons sons and daughters have learned not to take parents for granted. You may have to rethink, assuming that "nursing home" is a means to an end, so to speak. The film gently calls us to live life to the fullest for as long as we can. (Note: It's a pleasure to stay and watch the end of the credits. <br /> <br /> We're fortunate enough to see a Czech movie occasionally, the "Dark Blue World" by Sverák ("Kolya ") Father & Son of 2001 was enlightening with pathos, it is good to be slow from time to time and appreciate a strange gem - its subtitles, scenery, melodic notes and a rousing human story with elegant performances." Autumn Spring "( aka Babí Léto) is available on DVD. Enjoy!
