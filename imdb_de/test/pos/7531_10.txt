When I watch this movie, I can not help but think of Wild Reeds, another pensive film about teenagers growing up. So if you want a quick fix for things, do not look at them. This film is like a piece of life, begins imperfectly and ends imperfectly. There is no solution to anything, never happy for anyone, just like in real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is as real as it can be. The spectacle is surprisingly good. The director loves long, really long recordings and the actors and actresses are characterized by subtle and inner thoughts. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I almost did not see it, but now I am very glad that I did it. It's not a movie for everyone, but if you're ready to take it on, you'll be rewarded. <br /> <br /> 10/10
