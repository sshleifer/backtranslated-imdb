This movie was well done, but sometimes I felt very bad too. For anyone considering show business, this is a must because it shows the raw deal in terms of what's going on for these struggling workers. The soundtrack was definitely cool and the acting and the dance complemented him well. Some of the student's attitudes might have been a bit far-fetched like Leroys's, especially because I'm sure someone like this one would have been immediately thrown out of the game because he refused to read, and if that was the right high school for performing Arts would be. The Coco screen test is hard to watch for people with a weak stomach. Please note my warning. Although it's very hard, I know it's the truth, which in this respect is that the movie is going right. All in all, it is entertaining and even if some parts pull on the majority, this is over very quickly. <br /> <br /> Final Grouping: <br /> <br /> Movies: Probably skipped this one. <br /> <br /> DVD purchase: Not something I would have to see again and again. <br /> <br /> Rental: Worth to rent at least once in a lifetime!
