Pretty good movie about a man and his wife involved in the murder and the police officer investigating the case. It starts wonderfully, but somehow hits a wall. We are sure that we know what happened. Then a small plot thread appears, which initially looks like a red herring, and disappoints. Still, Clouzot's direction is great and the acting is pretty good. Louis Jouvet, who also starred in Marcel Carné's Drôle de Drame, shows the best performance as a clever detective. I wonder if the Coen brothers were influenced in writing Fargo by this movie. Similar to this film, the police officer appears almost half way and then becomes almost the center of the film. There is also a lot of droll comedy around him (though his methods are somehow fascist at times).
