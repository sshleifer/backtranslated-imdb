This is a really great movie! They think about their parents. As we all have fragile relationships, we all have them with them, unless we really strive to know who they are as human beings. Equally important, we remember to open ourselves and show them our true selves, not just who we believe they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb makes me write more text before posting my comment on how strange. Usually online comments have to be short, and here I am asked to write more! Well, I saw the movie with my parents, I thought later that they wanted to talk about their parents, but my dad always wanted to talk about himself and the things in his life that he thinks he's screwed up, which is unusual, my dad It is not a reserved man, but I was surprised that he wanted to talk about mistakes that he thinks he made. Mike and Kitty came to the film to ask questions and answers, and there was a funny moment afterwards when my dad talked to Mike while my mom talked to Kitty! Just ignore my last sentences to refill this comment and just remember '51 Birch Street '.
