It's a wonderful movie about people. Strange people. The characters in the film all have a very tragic past, so they all have their problems. Their problems develop in a way that makes the action of the film very absurd; but that does not make the movie any worse, only better, because it's turned into a kind of fantasy world, so nothing is real. This review may sound a bit strange, but then again the movie is not quite normal ... It's also often a hilarious movie. If you have not seen it, you will see it. Enjoy!
