This is a masterful piece of film, with many themes that simmer and occasionally boil over in these warts, and all the studies of the poet's Bohemian, selfish war years, which include the London air raids and the outward calm of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borders between friendship, lust and love, commitment to art and experience to practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and selfishness towards heroism and self-sacrifice and more. A sophisticated, subtle script that suggests the underlying tensions and occasionally into dramatic focus is well served by perfect performances (aside from the strange inappropriate smile that Keira Knightley tends to have, though this time maybe under the guidance of the others Characters often mention it). But above all, the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with imaginative and elegant use of close-up, camera angles and lighting, including pointillistic home cinema imitations, is a miracle and a joy to behold. It is as beautiful as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more appealing than some of the works of this master. Nowadays a very rare kind of film - it keeps the attention and awakens the emotions without giving up artistic integrity and falling into manipulative, superficial shortcuts.
