While not the most entertaining in the world, I think it's better than most. I mean, it had little laugh and a good feeling all around. It's not too often that we see two old geezers just having fun with their age and having a good time with the jokes. Walter and Jack had such great chemistry as friends / brother-in-law. It was funny to see them flirting with these women, and you became rooted all the way down because we have to admit them or not. They still had a game for their age! : D I loved the whole story of being able to move on and have fun, no matter how old you are. I would recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want one. <br /> <br /> 7/10
