The story of three eclipses (maybe even indigo, ha) of children who start their love of murder. Oh, and the people who are "hot" in their tracks. <br /> <br /> Bloody Birthday, a rather mediocre title for the movie, was a nice little surprise. I did not expect a movie about bloodthirsty psychopathic children. And I can say, it's also one of the best movies I've seen with kids as villains. At the end of the movie, I seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible ways. <br /> <br /> It's a really solid 80's horror movie, but how these kids get away with all the mess and murder is just that you can not think about it. Even the slightest examination could easily uncover these little killers. But there seem to be only a few policemen in the city, in the end only one, and he seemed like a fool, so they could have got away with it. Haha, yes, and I am a Chinese jet pilot. Even so, this movie did bring some nasty kids who were more than entertaining, a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage. No joke! If you are deterred by the less than outstanding title, knock it out of the head and give this movie a shot. It's a highly recommended and underrated 80's horror movie.
