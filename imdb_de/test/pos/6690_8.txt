This movie is brilliant ...... without a doubt. I saw it a while ago, after family members who are stuck in their sci-fi movies (which I'm not) were molested, and thought it was pretty good. But after watching a couple of recent documentaries about space, we looked at it again ... and it's good. Kevin Spacey is without a doubt one of the greatest actors I've ever seen, and I like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski, blown away, Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home claiming to be from another planet. Yeah, right, do you think ... but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist starts wondering if he's telling the truth? <br /> <br /> So the story unfolds when Bridges goes through all sorts of emotions dealing with Prot (as he is known), his own psychiatric colleague, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his cosmological astronomer co-workers (who, after receiving some data from Prot, quite agree that he could be telling the truth!) A great movie to wonder at ..... <br /> <br /> 8/10 Dave
