If you want to see the true, hideous nature of communism, watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. (Tvamomodr√Ω Svet) It tells how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender had fled to England to join the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared they had taken up dangerous Western ideas of freedom. So they had these heroic Czech pilots thrown into a nightmare prison, where some of the guards were the same Nazis they risked to defeat. <br /> <br /> If Hollywood wants to understand why so many movies fall flat, they should compare the character drama parts of "Pearl Harbor" to this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really connect to all the characters. In Pearl Harbor, everyone is like a chic cartoon version of a real person. <br /> <br /> There are countless examples of brilliant writing in this film. A funny scene that comes to my mind is when the character Karel is taught English by a more formal Englishwoman. If he can not utter a word, he taunts the lesson. In a typically Stoic English manner, the teacher Karel confronts calmly but energetically and shames him to behave. <br /> <br /> The aerial combat sequences in this film are amazing and help keep the movie alive. I read that it cost $ 11,000 an hour to rent the planes, but it was worth every penny. <br /> <br /> Ladies, you have to cry at sad movies, but guys ... beware! This movie would make General Patton cry. And if you're a dog lover, you'll need half a box of Kleenex. Do not say I did not warn you.
