In my review I just described the young actress as Katerina, as Veronika should have been. I was so busy with the character and the action, I guess I did not bother with names. Anyway, she and the movie are brilliant. As I said, the camera and the installation of the director deserve Eisenstein and his cinematographer Tisse '. The production design is first class. The placement of actors in the foreground, in the middle and in the background within a particular scene is worth a study. Breathtaking, memorable camera moves and an end with an emotional punch that leaves Hollywood movies far behind. Gee! Heroic self-sacrifice instead of going in the rainbow. Thanks again, John Hart
