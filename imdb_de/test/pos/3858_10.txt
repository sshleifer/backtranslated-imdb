The Aristorcats is a funny movie that not many people have seen. Obviously not that many because it only got 6.8. There is nothing wrong with that. It's my favorite of the Disney classics that have made many fantastic films. Like the Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the movie is. I hate to say that, but I do not blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would have done it too. I would be devastated by an old bag I had worked with for so many years, and decide to give her cats their will. I would have killed her, too. I do not like cats, so I would not mind. I think that The Aristorcats is so funny and sweet. There are many characters that are weird, like Edgar. The Aristorcats are my favorite of the Disney classics, and that's final. The cat is out of the bag. <br /> <br /> The Aristorcats: **** / ****
