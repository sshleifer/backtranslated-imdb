I can never tell if this is the Artiest Soap Opera ever produced, or the Soapiest Art Movie. Anyway, John Seales movie is absolutely gorgeous. Ondaatjes novel is not reduced, but raised to the movie. If there is a mistake, it's the original novel, not Anthony Minghella's beautiful movie. Anyone who has a problem with its length probably has not read the book and probably can not read it. I do not like repeating adjectives, but digression serves the purpose. <br /> <br /> Apart from the plot, the players stand out. But ultimately, the Australian sense of light and shadow prevails. Like a Dutch antipode master, Seale uses a ray of light in which Van Rijn has used shadows. You could cry for this great cinematography.
