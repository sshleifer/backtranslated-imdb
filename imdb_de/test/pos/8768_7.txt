An excellent Hitchcock thriller with Robert Cummings proves once again that he could really bring a storm. This time around, he's an armor worker trapped in a terrible plot when his best friend is killed in the plant. <br /> <br /> Priscilla Lane is the girl who suddenly finds herself interested in Cummings as the action thickens and he is persecuted from California to New York. <br /> <br /> There is a vicious conspiracy to destroy a group of wealthy Fifth Columnists from within. It was known that during his long career as a director, Hitchcock played in the upper reaches of society in chaos. Ironically, the movie implodes at the very end. While we see what happens to the guy who killed Cummings' boyfriend, we do not see what happens to the rest of the gang, many of which are the upper crust of society.
