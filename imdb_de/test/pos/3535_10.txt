I saw the Messiah: - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programs I have ever seen. It was one of those programs that you think you can not see the rest of, but you feel compelled to just see who did it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor who was able to switch between two completely different characters, one being the evil, evil person who did it, and the other person, Jez Clifton the policeman. To be able to do that, I would certainly not be able to do it, well not without cracking. I really love and care for Jamie Draven with all my heart and I will always do it. By the end of time, I think Jamie is the cutest, sweetest and sexiest guy in the world. I absolutely love Jamie in Ultimate Force, also because he looks damn sexy in the blacks he's been wearing. I love Jamie Love Paula Draven <br /> <br /> -X-
