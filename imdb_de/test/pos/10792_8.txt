I've never been a big fan of Oliver Stone, often because I felt his films were compulsive, preaching, and generally flawed. The two Stone movies that I really like are JFK and Talk Radio. Nevertheless, Talk Radio is the best choice for Stone. Stone is a director you're either a fan of or not with, so you can be sure I did not like the guy and was considered one of the most overrated directors in the film industry, even though I've seen Talk Radio before Some of my perceptions have changed. Talk Radio is a disturbing and amusing attack on what is now called "reality TV". <br /> <br /> Talk Radio follows a selfish, dysfunctional, determined, hysterical, outrageous and confusing radio host named Barry Champlain host of a controversial late night radio program in Dallas. He quickly became known for his bold and bizarre airborne presence and becomes a nocturnal sensation, calling out spoiled junkies, delinquents, racists, sociopaths, the sick, perverts, and idiots to be ridiculed in the air. The film shows the rise and fall of the man's career and honors the freedom of speech with care. Originally adapted from a stage play, the film ties in with the theatrical theme in which it was originally set up and miraculously conveys the wild nature of the film. <br /> <br /> With the wild energy and non-stereotypical atmosphere, Talk Radio brings all the fun of "blatant media". It's even worse today than in the late '80s. The film goes deep and investigates arrogance, self-obsession, offensive behavior, controversy, hypocrisy and ignorance. The film shows in a controlled manner how it is good to have a personal opinion and freedom of expression, but it is something that should be used rather than wise. Stone tries to show that freedom of expression plays a crucial role in life, but we should be careful and careful. The film asks, "Is our main actor the same as the sad people who call the show?" <br /> <br /> Stone fabulously creates the film's key phrase (the radio station) with ambition and cold atmosphere. He then manages to capture the isolation, fear, ambiguity and dangerous emotions of the radio station. Eric Bogosian is perfectly cast as the isolated, self-absorbed and complex genius of Barry Champlain. He fits the role that is perfectly dismissed from his ranks with so much enthusiasm, urgency, perplexity, brusqueness, and ultimately the bold serenity of his insulting nature. The performance is bursting with sparks, which were apparently robbed of an Oscar nomination. His voice fits the character, as he is a primary element of a radio host and his acting power works well with tragedies and comedy. <br /> <br /> In Stones movies and talk radio ranks, much editorial work is done on some of his cleanest, most rhythmic arrangements. He uses beautifully controlled camera techniques that evolve from quiet to suddenly turbulent. Behind the film is a living energy whose rough and wonderfully delightful script serves as the centerpiece for the size of the film. The impressive and virtuoso cinematography is characterized mainly by the moments in and outside the studio and captures the city at night impressively. Not to forget that the nerve-racking, yet darkly funny climatic "descent feeling" is ultimately a remarkable cinema. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is an indispensable modern masterpiece. I'm sure you'll be surprised how great it really is. I recommend Talk Radio to anyone who is interested in media or film. Talk Radio is a prime example of first-rate, intellectual and insightful entertainment that still brings a well-deserved wake-up call. If Eric Bogosian were not, the movie would not be the funny, sexy and enduring masterpiece that he is today.
