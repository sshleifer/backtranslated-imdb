While cartoons and / or references to people in the entertainment industry or things or even brands of products are usually a staple in shorts like this, they are not used in the crowd here. Most individual gags are more generic. I will give examples here. Spoilers are listed below: <br /> <br /> There are only three (well, technically four - at the end of the cartoon there is a quick) cartoons that I've discovered. which is rather low for this type of shorts, even though this figure is a prominent figure with a lot of activity. They are Jack Benny (as Jack Bunny), Leopold Stowkowski and the inimitable Ned Sparks (as a crab on a Can-Chances are very good chances that if a crab was involved in a Warner Brothers Short in the 1930s / 1940s, the Cartoon used would be Ned Sparks). There's also evidence of Billy Rose's Aquacade and a riff on a radio show called "Henry Aldrich" (Coming, Mother!), A game with Superman (Superguy here) and the villain is a launch of "King Kong." That's all for this kind of gag. <br /> <br /> The products themselves are mostly generic and the gags play more basic things in unusual situations, such as turtles coming out of soup cans and attacking the villain as tanks, making tomato soup cans "The can-can", Gingerbread men who turn into paratroopers, use handkerchiefs for parachutes, and so on. The gags are very good and it's an excellent example of a Bob Clampett cartoon director at the time, and although it's not nearly close to his best work, finding those shorts on Looney Tunes Golden Collection is nothing special , Vol. 3, an excellent set that I can highly recommend itself is also recommended.
