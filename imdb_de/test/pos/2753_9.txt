The show is great. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors could not spoil it, not because they were not that bad, but because the show is really so good a scene without a cut for more than 15 seconds. It's okay to show different angles, but the guys worked with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they'll remind you how many cameras they have on average every five seconds. Jump with a camera, cut them in the middle and show the rest at a different angle. <br /> <br /> No matter how hard they tried, they could not spoil this wonderful show. It is a must for dance and music lovers.
