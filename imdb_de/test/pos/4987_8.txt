"The Violent Men" was the best collaboration of Rudolph Maté with Glenn Ford in a most satisfying drama of harsh, primitive justice. <br /> <br /> Ford is John Parrish, a former cavalry captain who cries to marry and start a new life? His fiancée Caroline Vail (May Wynn) desperately wants to move east and see him sell his spread to Lee Wilkison (Edward G. Robinson). <br /> <br /> Parrish is not even a Cattleman? but he understands that something big is forming in the valley? In the army they called it "enemy pressure". First, Cole Wilkison (Brian Keith) returns from Texas to help his brother lead the Anchor. Then a tough boy with a fancy gun (Richard Jaeckel) appears on Wilkison's payroll? Then all small ranchers are forced to get the same offers? Parrish either saw themselves running as they were or standing and fighting? <br /> <br /> But can he easily handle a man who sends six killers to shoot an old man in the back? Can he easily argue with a man who started out on a few acres of land and now owns virtually the entire valley? <br /> <br /> All this grass and sand meant for the former Confederate Army officer the last three years? It was a place to get well again? From the habit of taking advice, Parrish assures: "What happens in this valley is none of my business." And much to the disappointment of the remaining ranchers and farmers who press him to stay, he decides to accept Wilkison's offer to fulfill the promise he made to his fiancee the wrong step when he tried to parrish by a lynching Defeating one of his ranch hands, Parrish got angry and warned the two brothers that he would stay and fight against them, to have the privilege of being left alone? <br /> <br /> Brian Keith plays the treacherous brother who is behind the murder ... He dreams of having position and respect in the running of a day. <br /> <br /> Lee's ambitious wife Martha (Barbara Stanwyck) secretly hates herself and her husband? Stanwyck plays the role of a loving woman who can not stand the touch of her husband's hands? <br /> <br /> Edward G. Robinson is good enough as a crippled Anchor owner to promise his wife the whole valley, unaware that she's having an affair with his younger brother. <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is too sensitive like the anti-social adult daughter who is aware of her mother's burdens. <br /> <br /> "The Violent Men" uses widescreen technology to underline the scope and power of this shattering action drama, making it a perfect example of the most enduring classics in the genre.
