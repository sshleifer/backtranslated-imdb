POSSIBLE SPOILER <br /> <br /> Nobody will likely pick up a DVD from Red Dust without knowing that it is the South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank plays the lead role of a South African exile who returns to her hometown as a lawyer. He represents Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African Parliament, who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), to escape jail by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Surely you could have found an actress who could or might have imitated a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt to cover her unmistakably American accent. Still, she's the only known actor in the movie, and it probably would not have been done without her or someone equally known. She does a passable job. Emphasized are Ejiofer and Muller (pronounced in German with a Umlat on the "u"), as well as Jamie Barlett as police chief, who is responsible for the murder of Mpondo's comrades and fellow prisoners. The torture scenes are shown in short flashes, but they are lively and believable. What is not credible is the process of truth and reconciliation - unless it actually happened. "Red Dust" should be seen for that very reason because it was incredible and is that the ANC prisoners could actually forgive the torturers, and this is as close as we will likely see the process in action.
