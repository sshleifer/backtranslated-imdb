I saw Pola X because Scott Walker composed the score and I admire his music very much. Honestly, I expected a somewhat presumptuous and possibly incoherent French film. I was wrong. The vision of the movie quickly caught my attention - beginning with the opening sequence, which shows black and white footage of military planes dropping bombs on graves, music sounds, and the beautiful plaintive voice of Scott Walker. The film examines the identity crisis of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - a brilliant decision for the role) and its resulting (self-) destruction. The story is divided into two parts? The first shows Pierre carefree life in a beautiful house in the French countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he has given up everything and moved to Paris to live in misery with his alleged half-sister. Both parts contain amazingly stunning photography? the first very colorful and bright, the second completely dark and almost apocalyptic - a true aesthetic feast. Pola X is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience.
