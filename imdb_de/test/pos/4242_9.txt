Chucky (the murderous doll from "Child's Play" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (with "Voodoo for Dummies") revives him. Then she is killed by too complicated circumstances and her soul is put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to bring them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again ... <br /> <br /> Much better than it sounds. After the last two sequels of "Child's Play" (both were terrible), I expected the worst, but it was really fun. The movie is not serious for a second (seriously - how could he?) And the lines and situations are actually pretty funny. There are also a few VERY bloody murders that satisfy horror fans, and the movie never stops moving. The film also has a few things that are not usually found in a horror movie - a gay best friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett) who plays smart and not laughable, and a sequence where Stabile takes off his shirt to show his muscular body. John Ritter also has a nice cameo as sheriff. <br /> <br /> The acting is good - Stable is young, very pretty and personable; Heigl does not have much to do but pulls it off and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) and Tilly are hilarious as murderous dolls. My favorite part is when the dolls have sex (do not ask), and she asks for a gum and he replies, "But I'm made of rubber!" The special effects are good (there is no bad CGI here) and this is one of the few horror films that mixes humor and violence in an entertaining way. Worth seeing. I give a 9.
