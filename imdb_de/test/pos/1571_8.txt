After working professionally with young girls, I found this film surprisingly authentic. I never thought a friend would not borrow his video. Here are classic themes: Coming of Age, Eternity of the mother / daughter, The limited opportunities of the underprivileged, Who is the Good Samaritan, The tragedy is in every life and the many layers or relationships. Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice acquires a weapon, we know that she is familiar with using it) and does not end in a clich√©. The cast really "sells" their roles. It's adult material and the tone is a bit too grainy. Leave it for 15 minutes to invite you.
