I've already seen spin-offs of cartoons like The Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry, and Looney Tunes, and most are great. <br /> <br /> When I saw the All Grown Up pilot in 2001, I found it interesting to see what the Rugrats would look like in their early teens and teens, and it contained things that were normally at this time of the year Life would happen, such as attending a concert, going to school and being on the floor. <br /> The actual TV show is better because the Rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and Angelica does not seem so much is punished as in the original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie are punished in this series. <br /> <br /> I also noticed hints on Rugrats and even flashbacks on the look of the Rugrats in the original series on this show. They actually talk to the adults on this show because they are 10 years older. <br /> <br /> This show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show may like this.
