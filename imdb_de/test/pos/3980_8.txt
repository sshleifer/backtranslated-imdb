That's what movies should aim for. Funny, without being totally stupid, a bit sexy, with no woman in the cast showing off her breasts, biting without resorting to any F-bomb. I have seen Justin Long appear in many films in recent years. I thought with what role he might break out. (Commercials for Mac not.) This movie could put him on the A-list. The rest of the cast has also done its job perfectly, this is an excellent little movie with a beautiful message. (But you do not have to buy the message to have a good time.) Lewis Black is funny as always, and Blake Lively is a fresh-looking beauty. <br /> <br /> Take a few hours and watch this movie, they will not be wasted.
