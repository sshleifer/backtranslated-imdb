There are many movies on DVD now, but the producers forgot some important things that were important to many viewers. The Egyptians, along with El Cid and other favorites of the widescreen era, earned big budget epics. Many people of my generation learn a lot about the history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas Egypt or Rome saw many "bad" epics of the era. Many production values, excellent use of color (The De Luxe color was more Brigit and sharp than the ordinary Technicolor), maybe the cast was wrong in some ways the engine to buy the novel, my Mika Waltari, one of the best if not the best historical novel ever published. And also the outstanding result of Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann was ousted. I saw this movie many times when I was a boy. It was not the big box-office hit that Fox Studios wanted to have tremendous success behind The Robes. In CinemaScope and Stereo this was a wonderful eye-catcher. I have the Lasser Disc version.m the only way to see Ito in wdisescreen format. I hope to see you soon.
