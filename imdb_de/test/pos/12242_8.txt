Spoiler Alert <br /> <br /> I've never seen comments on a movie that I agree with more than the comments that people made about it. One can learn from critical views of this film. As an educational film I appreciate it very much, because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not see any films for learning; As a rule, we pay attention to entertainment. As entertainment, I estimate it low: the end is downbeat and cerebral / intellectual. This conflict leads to my eight-star rating. The film follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network manager introduces Tom Grunnick (William Hurt) to study the position of the On Air News anchors. Tom immediately charms people with humility. Another potential newscaster has been waiting for years for his on-air opportunity, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all the news, inside and out. <br /> <br /> The manager of the network wants Grunnick to be in the air and Jane argues that Grunnick is not ready, he does not know the news. They do not listen to her. In order to blow up Grunnick, Jane contacts Altman to receive information about the news and passes Altman's comments through an earphone to Grunnick while Grunnick speaks. We observe the sharp contrast between the words of Altman / Jane Craig and Grunnick, while Grunnick cleverly rewrites everything that Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear to make the audience understandable, sympathetic and entertaining. Altman gets a chance on air and the network managers ask him to coach Grunnick, the new man. This new (news ingnorant) guy training him? Altman does not see this justified, but reluctantly agrees. <br /> <br /> Grunnick trains Altman and is excited to discover hundreds of Altman's inadequacies in appearance, audio and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him leads Altman to a panic sweat when he's in the air. Grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and Altman resigns before being released. But Grunnick fails in his attempt to find a romance with Jane Craig because she learns from Altman that Grunnick sometimes pretends circumstances to make people like him. That's what sets her off him. This sends the message that in relationships we want people who are sincere and do not try to make us like them. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the message is sent that the job's most important ability is to get people to like you. However, this is especially true for broadcast news. There are many people who comment on how this is the case when TV news is dormant and how Grunnick is a good-looking but stupid guy or any style, but no substance. The opposite is the case, Grunnick had skills and a very complex mind to make people like him, including the presence of the mind, to know exactly what he looks like and sounds like when he is in front of the camera) , Grunnick's mistake, which costs him the relationship with Jane Craig, is that he is too motivated to be sympathetic and to deceive a situation. Many people call Altman very intelligent or brilliant. Altman, played by Brookes, is not as bright as Grunnick, and the "flop sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that Grunnick has on air. Altman is annoyed at the fact that he knew the news and Grunnick was more successful in getting people to like him. There are also people who comment that these things apply only to the TV news industry. The idea that winning friends is the most important skill in a job is obviously not popular, but my experience shows that it's true in most jobs. This movie is fantastic, if unpopular. Educational, yes, but it has no uplifting end.
