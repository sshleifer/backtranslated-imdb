In this early fulci work, the director shows his mainstream side as well as talent for catching storytelling and a more than reasonable explanation for the genre. I personally believe that he was wrongly injured throughout his career as an esthete of Gore. It is a fairly capable process and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative, which shows its mistrust of small-town urban mentality and the inefficiency of the police as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic Church, whose final effect seemed to have been cut off. This film was on its first release under the knees and could possibly have given the director a different direction early on. The comparable lack of blood in the film reveals a more pressing and psychological imperative for this film in its prevailing "mystery," but the gore and puppetry it uses is used primarily in the scene where a falsely accused murderer is useless Mob lynched by men in a cemetery and sat in a show of abominable and outdated vigilance, choreographed by a Diegetic radio expertly to the modern tunes. Another example was the final scene, Awesome), in which a strikingly beautiful priest falls off a cliff and the used doll is clearly shown in a medium close-up emphasizing his demonic appearance and obvious ugliness. Oddly enough, considering his later works, Fulci also recalls the idea of ​​modernity, that the hamlet clung to its anachronistic superstition and ignorance when the idea of ​​black magic is just that, a curious idea of ​​supernatural evil that is itself never really manifests voodoo dolls while they make their witch no more than a disturbed woman. I also liked that he added these character levels by turning a bourgeois city girl into an ambiguous character - is she the devil the priest fears for his stations, and perhaps even for himself? This Giallo offers itself for Fulcis more personal and content-related films, because we actually get a veritable inflow of ideas from him.
