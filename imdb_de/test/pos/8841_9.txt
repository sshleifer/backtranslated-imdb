I saw this movie by chance for the first time when it was shown on TV, and I was far too late ... I was really lucky there. It is really incredible. from the position (to be as isolated as possible on this planet; "the abyss" looked like ET in the pool of council), by the interesting characters (Keith David is especially good as reactionary children - "What if we are wrong with him? "-" Then we're wrong. ") and the effects (luckier than Alien). <br /> <br /> In addition, the real tension and anxiety in the movie does not mean anything with the effects. It is the people you are afraid of; to know that one of them may or may not be "everything they seem to be". It is certainly the feeling "who goes there?". <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great; It really plays the isolation, the fear and the gravity of the situation. <br /> <br /> Finally, the epilogue scene really cuts off. Even more than that, "But who does that?" Pointe by Bladerunner. Enough said.
