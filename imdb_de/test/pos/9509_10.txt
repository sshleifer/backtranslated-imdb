I've seen movies come and go in my years, and when I watch a catastrophe movie, I hope I will not be disappointed. And I was not in the least with this movie. The story of a whole country sinking into the ocean was great. The concept was written by Sakyo Komatsu, a novelist with intense theories about where this earth goes. The characters were first rate, and although I'm not Japanese, I did not need a translator to convey the idea of ​​how people are in desperation. Needs can come together for the common good. The special effects blew me away, I was literally at the edge of my seat, watching the tidal wave lava flows and land blasts that would have taken months of work to perfect. Yes, that's the best of the best, the emotions are spread throughout the movie and I cried in the hardest scenes. For moviegoers alike, you do not have to speak or understand Japanese to see this movie. Feeling of every person and character to understand and follow it well. I am with Shinji Higuchi for directing. I hope he can outdo his work with another breathtaking experience. As I said, .... Fantastic movie.
