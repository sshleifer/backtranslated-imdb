Although sexiness is a variable quality for most of us, I can not remember a movie that did what it does for me. It brought me into a terribly familiar kingdom of yearning and desire. All this compulsive attraction, the uncertainty about the result, the tangible anxiety, and the enthusiasm that this state of arousal brought with it, were turned into a fever by this movement. So French and what dare I dare! No matter how you orient yourself, I think that the danger of pursuing your desire comes into its own here and puts much more emphasis on it ... much more than with Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut".
