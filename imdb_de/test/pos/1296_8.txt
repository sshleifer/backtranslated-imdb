Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye is a great family movie. Salman Khan looks good and great as ever! There is even a scene where he takes off his shirt! What a surprise!!! Rani Mukherjee is great, too. Pooja Batra had few lines to say, but I'm glad she was recognized for her role because she definitely has potential. <br /> <br /> It's about Prem (Salman Khan) and he's a wedding singer. He is about to marry Nisha (Raveena Tandon), but gets up. Prem goes to Nisha's house and asks her why he was abandoned and because her brother is ill and she has to marry an NRI, Rahul (Indian Kumar), to get the money for the treatment. Prem moves on and arrives in Priya (Rani Mukherjee). Prem falls in love with <br /> <br /> love with Priya, but it's a shame she's about to get married to an NRI! Who could be this NRI ?! Priya also falls in love with Prem while Rahul is with her. Prem gives Priya an insulting comment one day, and she leaves for Agra to marry Rahul. Will Prem stop her? Take a look at KPNHJ to find out! <br /> <br /> The movie was very funny! The songs were great, especially the song "O Priya O Priya". It's a shame that the movie flopped in India and I do not know why ?! Every movie in India is flopping these days !! This movie deserves to be a hit. The only problem I found with the movie is that they were obsessed with NRI! They think that all NRIs are rich! The movie deserves a 9/10!
