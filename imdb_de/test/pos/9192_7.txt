I read the last comment on this movie and absolutely do not agree. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm Portuguese nationality and although this movie may not say much to anyone from Boston, it certainly says something to both the Portuguese and the Brazilians, as well as to the immigrants everywhere. <br /> <br /> And why are you wondering? Well, first, this film is about two sibling nations: Portugal and Brazil. Brazil gained its independence in the early 19th century (at the hands of the Portuguese heir to the throne), and since then relations have improved significantly. <br /> <br /> As meaningful as that may be, there are still many prejudices. Due to the economic climate in Brazil in the 1990s, immigration to Portugal increased massively. You see, Portugal is not only a country with a similar language, culture and conviction as Brazil, but also a gateway to the rest of Europe. Some people were forced to make the decision to cross the Atlantic and seek a better life, and Portugal was the first logical place to emigrate. <br /> <br /> As is still the case with many immigrants, they were paid averages below the minimum wage and treated as "dirt". Only in this case, because the language is similar, were they constantly made aware of their status as immigrants. <br /> <br /> Another curiosity in this film is the idea of ​​how a man so well versed in the history of his own country has still tried to get a quick price by exporting coveted national resources , It is precisely these people who keep Brazil in a state of permanent arrest as the country is well endowed with natural resources and can easily scale the economic ladder if it offers a fair chance. This shows that colonialism still exists - Pablo represents the exploited people, Igor the man whose status as a "noble" (or at least rich or "wealthy") is ensured by the foreign colonial power, which in turn is represented by force. <br /> <br /> If you have seen other films by Salles, you will recognize this as a recurrent theme - the fight against a repressive power. I do not want to teach or patronize teaching history to anyone, but I thought this movie was symbolically very powerful. I'm not saying there was no room for improvement (as it always is), but I think the last comment written on it was not only narrow-minded, but undoubtedly ignorant. <br /> <br /> One last thing to say I have to assume that you saw this movie through the eyes of an American Film Watcher. No harm intended with this remark, but I mean, "foreign" films can not all be of "beautiful landscapes" - art deals with the problems of their time. For example, you would not expect Otto Dix to paint all the beautiful places in Bavaria and the Black Forest ... Why would you expect a filmmaker to focus exclusively on the scenery if he thinks there are more relevant topics? ? <br /> <br /> In short, you do not judge movies easily and with only two or three criteria. This film is very interesting, his photography is pretty good, and even the idea that conveys the black and white coloring goes hand in hand with what it's all about. I think the picture is deliberately grainy ... like the reality, no? :) <br /> <br /> Watch it and come to your own conclusions ...
