Nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema with a movie with the Twins, Ekin Cheng and Edison Chen. But what you get is a funny movie that spares your eyes and brain. There are a lot of vampires in the Hollywood style (there are no Chinese bloodsuckers here), nice girls, pretty heroes and occasionally very funny moments. And Jackie Chan. <br /> <br /> Sure, the kung-fu relies heavily on wire work and CGI. Sure, the script reminds you of Blade. And sure, the whole thing is immediately forgotten. <br /> <br /> But for a really enjoyable movie fluff, it would be hard to find something better.
