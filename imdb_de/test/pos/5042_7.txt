The title of the film seems quite appropriate given the person of the main character Fanda. He is an elderly man who lives in the late autumn of his life, but romps around as a boisterous schoolboy who has just entered a spring meadow. The weaknesses of old age and the warning signs of death are illusions to him. His wife supports this idea when she observes, "Fanda laughs about funerals and death." In other words, death does not take Fanda too seriously; He has more important things to do than worry about what is already inevitable. However, the life and pursuit of life to the fullest is the philosophy that governs Fanda's existence. It is not easy to exist, it has to live for every day and every moment, because tomorrow is not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> The film seems to give a strong commentary on life as if there were no tomorrow or even death. Too many people take life too seriously and fail to miss the real part of life. Fanda's wife, for example; She is so worried that she does not have to prepare for death in a religiously connotative way, but in a way too practical, even lifeless, that she forgets to smile, laugh and just have fun. Her humanity seems to have turned into the zombie autopilot mode. By contrast, Fanda may be too stupid and too absent-minded for his own good. He needs a human like his wife Emilie to balance him. <br /> <br /> It's as if Fanda possesses the invincible spirit of a child, like a child trapped in an older man's body. He is introduced as an adventurous type; He pretends to be people he does not want to win, wastes money, de facto lies and is always ready for a good laugh. Deep down, however, he is a kind-hearted and gentle old man who wants to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife. The two are doing quite well, though none of them really appreciate the binary quality of their relationship until they have metaphorical coincidence in death: meaning, their divorce. During this courtroom, Fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means when separated from his only love. His wife emotionally remembers all his mistakes, yet is tenderly asked to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior. The moment she forgives him, Fanda realizes he is selfish enough to drive his wife and pledges to make her happy. <br /> <br /> Ironically, after this commitment, he becomes what his wife later calls "a living corpse". The life blood in him flows away as he becomes more like her - a zombie that goes through everyday movements. He does not seem to live anymore but exists. For example, he gives up his crazy pranks, wastes no money, quits smoking for his wife (not his health), and overall, he just gives in everything she wants him to do. In short, he changes because he wants to make her happy. So the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly disappear. When her husband realizes that her husband is not who he once was, there is a part of Emilie missing the old Fanda. She misses the seclusion of her husband and the struggles they cherished, because they really lived in those moments rather than just existed. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers were trying to convey a message here. True and loving relationships are not always easy or comfortable, but often they need sacrifice and perseverance to break the seemingly bad times. The possibility of death every moment reminds people to live for every moment. Life is often taken for granted, but when it is threatened by death, be it literal or figurative, people awaken from their ungrateful sleep and are moved to live life to the fullest. It's like they're scared that they'll never live again, so they should make the most of it as long as they have it. Fanda and Emilie had been married to struggles along the way for 44 years, but only when they threatened to separate from death did they reveal their true colors. The old maxim says: "Love does not know the depth until the hour of separation." Both begin to see what matters most in life, and these are the people they meet on their way. More importantly, the intimate relationships they make with their important other people.
