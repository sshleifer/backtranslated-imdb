This short is one of the best of all times and proves (as do most of Charlie Chaplin's works) that sound and color are not prerequisites for quality work. In fact, some of the gags and gadgets that became the standard of animation in later years (such as the aforementioned Chaplin) have been used (and animated) by cartoons. By using word balloons, just like in the comics: Since Felix has started in the newspapers as a comic book, this device is a natural dimension element (literally and figuratively) and makes these shorts a joy worth the wait is to take your time and effort.
