Obviously cheaply made to capitalize on the infamous "Mandingo", this blatant, limping piece of upbeat, rancid, Italian sexploit junk streams with a laudable lack of taste and reluctance to put on the dirty stuff slave plantations spend much of the screen time doing, to engage each other and their various slaves with Hanky ​​Panky. Director Mario Penzauti and scriptwriter Tecla Romanelli stuff up that filthy filth with an ebullient surplus of sizzling sleaze: we have nasty rape, a mix of different races (a white lady loves wild muscle while tied to a cross), lush woman nudity brutal floggings, heinous demotion, lots of lurid softcore sex and a very twisted, tragic surprise outburst that blends elements of incest, murder and deception in a questionable attempt to make a statement about the terrible inhumanity of slavery. Special praise goes to the foxy brunette actress Paola D'Egidio, whose lusty and uninhibited portrayal of the corrupt and lascivious evil bitch Rhonda positively burns the screen. In addition, Marcello Giombini's funky, pulsating tribal score hits the groovy spot. Maurizo Centini's pretty polished cinematography also does it. A satisfactorily seamless chunk of slimy runny nose.
