NO SPOILER !! <br /> <br /> After Hitchcock's successful first American movie, Rebecca, based on Daphne DuMarier's lavish gothic romance and intrigue novels, returned to some of the more well-known themes of his early British period - mistaken identity espionage. When the United States settled in World War II and the civilian population, which built planes, weapons and other necessary militias, went to war on a grand scale, the booming movie entertainment business developed into paranoid and often jingoistic wartime thrillers. These thrillers were often networks of fraudulent and skilled operators working in the shadow of good, law-abiding citizens. Producer Jack Skirball knew the director was at home in this spy genre. He turned to Hitchcock to run a property that dealt with corruption, war sabotage and a helpless hero in a whirlwind of chance and false identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary artist Dorothy Parker (during her brief residency in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in New York), who had written the script, fit perfectly with Hitchcock's feelings. </ P> <This oft-neglected film tells the story of unfortunate 25-year-old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), who meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) while working in an aircraft factory in Los Angeles, and then cometh away moments later invites sabotage. Fleeing the authorities who do not believe his far-fetched story, he encounters several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally to New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful "freaks" and the popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane), whom he fell in love with during the worst crisis of his life and national security! In the land of Hitchcock Patricia, who was abducted by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls in love with her conqueror and adds so romantic tension to the mix. <br /> <br /> In good shape for this excursion, Hitchcock brews a national network of old ladies, average joes and serious businessmen who act as secret agents to terrorists who house criminals, draw weapons and detonate bombs to keep things moving to keep. It's a terrific conspiracy that takes time to move forward, and once it's detonated culminates in a memorable finale of Hitchcock. Look out for unbelievably interesting places like NYC's attractions (all recreated by Hollywood art directors for public interest due to the "shooting ban"). While not one of Hitchcock's best-known films, Saboteur is a popular B-movie that's certainly solid and engaging, with lots of clever twists and, as always, great hitchcock villains. In the second half of the movie, remember to look for Hitchcock's appearance in front of a drugstore. Hitchcock's original cameo idea that was filmed (he fought in sign language with his "deaf" wife) was disregarded by the Bureau of Standards and Practices, which was afraid of hurting the deaf!
