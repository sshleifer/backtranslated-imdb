This movie is a fairly fair adaptation of the novel by Prosper Merimeé. In the novel Merimeé itself is a figure, Don José comes from Navarre (Northern Spain, and historically a Basque zone, they speak Basque). They are in Seville (Andalusia, southern Spain) and speak only Spanish with an Andalusian accent. They do not speak Basque, but Carmen tells Don José that she lived in Navarre. Believe it or not, at least this is the version of the book. Then you can not look critically at the movie about it, be with the book! It should be noted that the novel by Merimeé and Bizet's opera are different, and this film is an adaptation of the novel. Anyway, Don José is still Spaniard from Navarre in opera, he's never French. Why do so many people think Don José is French? I do not know, but I think because the novel and the opera are in French, although it should be in Spanish. <br /> <br /> The only important difference between the film and the novel is that in the film Don José also kills the "torero" lover of Carmen and not in the novel (neither in the opera). I think they wanted to keep the movie a bit more gore! I think the movie is pretty good anyway.
