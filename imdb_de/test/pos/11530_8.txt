It's 1969. Phoebe (Camilla Belle) is an 11-year-old girl who grows up with an idealized vision of her 19-year-old sister Faith (Cameron Diaz). Faith is the culprit, the seeker of truth, the fixer of all abuses in the world. One day, Phoebe and her mother Gail (Blythe Danner) receive word that Faith is dead. The faith has killed itself. Both Phoebe and Gail are overwhelmed by this news and, though she is sad, Gail is mourning. Phoebe can not let it go. Phoebe decides to go to Europe and find out what happened. <br /> <br /> It is now 1977. Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) is 18 years old and decides to go to Europe because of her mother's objections to learn the truth. During her lifetime, Faith was inseparable from a man she called "Wolf" (Christopher Eccleston). Although Wolf claimed to know nothing about Faith's last days, Phoebe convinces him to tell everything. Within days, Wolf realizes that he has not let go of the past, and he accompanies Phoebe on his pilgrimage to Portugal. <br /> <br /> In the end, Wolf may report Faith's propriety regarding substance abuse and substance abuse does not prevent his own guilt from suicide. Though furious, Phoebe in the end realizes how human and fragile Faith really was. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. I am old enough to remember the bank robberies of the Red Army, and in 1969 I was 10 years old. This story was familiar to me. I can still remember young men trying to decide whether to go to Canada or not to avoid the draft. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but probably occurred several times in real life during that time. Camilla Belle was very enjoyable and fun to watch as she portrayed the young, venerating sister who was excited by what was happening around her. Jordana Brewster slipped easily into the role of the older Phoebe. Blythe Danner was the always supportive mother, a role she unfortunately knows only too well on American television. I would have wished that she works with stronger material. Cameron Diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly. Sometimes her performance as a 1960s activist seemed to come from a news role. Of all the characters, it was the Wolf of Christopher Eccleston who achieved the biggest growth. When we get to know the character at the beginning of the film, we can see that he is a worldly man. He is a patient and friendly man who is full of anger before the injustices of the world. In the end, he realizes that the direction he and Faith are in is wrong and he begins to "grow up" and decides he should fight injustice in his own way. Faith refuses to join him and eventually leads to her death. Eccleston's Wolf is the most real of all characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It was pleasant and thought provoking. "The Invisible Circus" is classified as a TV-MA, but there are hardly any curses, sex or violence. The theme of the film is the reason for the rating.
