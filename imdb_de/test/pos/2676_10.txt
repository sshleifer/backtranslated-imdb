This show is the best, it's full of laughter and Kevin James is the best. So if you want to have a good show, I recommend the King of Queens and it is a flop that they have canceled it. In the end, this show will make you forget your worries. If you have a cast with Kevin James and Jerry Stiller, you can not go wrong. So I do not know why the show is canceled if someone knows someone knows it. Please tell me. Now you can not find many shows that meet your needs as an audience break and when that stops, I do not know what to do. If I had to recommend a show at the end, it will be king of the queens.
