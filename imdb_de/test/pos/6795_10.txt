After my 6 year old daughter started taking lesson lessons, I started looking for horse movies. I had always heard of National Velvet but had never seen it before. Boy, I'm glad I bought it! It has become a favorite of mine, my 6 year old AND my 2 year old. It is a shame that films like these are not made anymore.
