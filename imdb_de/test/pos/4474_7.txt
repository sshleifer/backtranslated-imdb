The story begins with a soldier being transported to a desert town and goes back in time to tell how he came to this place. He began as an officer in Napoleon's army, fought in Egypt, but was separated from his unit. After starving and / or dying of thirst, he came upon a leopard who somehow became his bosom friend. It brought him food and in a short time the soldier became almost totally wild, so acute was his attachment to the animal. All things end, however, and the man decided that it was necessary to leave the living entity. A very strange movie, well written and portrayed. Beautiful landscapes from Jordan and Utah, which are not always perfectly merged, but who cares.
