"How can we not get drunk with all the misery of the world?" ?? Mia <br /> <br /> A beautiful aerial view of a big city becomes ominous by the approach of a fleet of aircraft bombers; a mad barber responding to a perceived racial slur cuts a road through the bushy hair of a businessman; A man dreams of being dragged onto an electric chair after a failed magic trick, and a teacher collapses in her elementary class because her husband called her a witch. These and about fifty other vignettes, ranging from the downright depressing to the wildly humorous to the joyously uplifting demographic of Roy Andersson's You, the Living, are his first appearance since his critically acclaimed, if not commercially successful, second-floor songs /> They, the living, are filled with the same imaginative set pieces as songs filled with black humor, surreal situations, and odd-looking characters. Slightly overlapping and less focussed than his earlier work, Andersson's signature style remains consistent with its stationary camera, sterile-looking backgrounds, and meticulous attention to detail. If there is a theme that holds the sketches together, then our time on earth is limited and "tomorrow is another day," so we treat ourselves with kindness. Along the way, we will be entertaining with tuba and drum music from the Louisiana Brass Band, dinner guests in a banquet hall that stands on their chairs and sings a rousing song, and a house that turns into a moving train. The emotions range from the gloom of a daughter trying to communicate with a daughter Alzheimer's is the ecstatic dream of a young woman marrying a good-looking guitarist named Micke with the cheers of a crowd: Although there is no continuous narrative, dives The theme of Greed and Despair in several sketches features two corpulent individuals and their tiny dog ​​sitting on a park bench, the woman laments the fact that no one understands or loves her, yet she effortlessly ignores the man's consoling and reassuring words. <br /> <br /> There is also a juicy addition of irony. In one apparent executive lunch, one man tells another over the phone that the workers do not appreciate the quality and how nice it is to appreciate the money and things they can buy, such as fine wine. If he does not look, a man at a neighboring table quietly lifts his wallet out of his jacket on the back of his chair. Although Andersson's cynicism is sometimes not very well hidden, You the Living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human situation. It's a cautious story that looks at the chaos we've got into people, but suggests that there's still time to turn it around, if we pay attention to the warning of the poet Goethe, who opens the film: "Rejoice, the living 'In your gloriously warmed bed before Lethe's icy wave licks your escaping foot.'
