Like Grains of Sand is an impressive and thoughtful observation of modern life for young people in Japan, addressing in a subtle and meaningful way issues such as rape, homosexuality and adolescent anxiety. It gives an insight into youth culture, which strives to define itself outside the boundaries of its parents' generation with its rigorous adaptation and facade. What is not typical for Japanese cinema is often more important than what is wary of those who are unfamiliar with Japanese film and Japanese culture. It can be boring and minimalist (almost like any movie that comes from the Japanese bar Mangas) if you do not know what to look for. I saw it for the first time when I was 15 years old and originally aroused my interest in Japan, its culture and its language. I am now 22 years old and learning Japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years. Needless to say, it's a strong movie. Enjoy!
