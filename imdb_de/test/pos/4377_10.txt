It may be a bit boring to say this as an inveterate Carlin fanatic, but the material, both written and performed, in It's Bad for Ya is one of the best late-stage material ever. At 70, Carlin recovers from the despair (and some of the tripping in the act itself) of Life is Worth Losing into a special that's tight-lipped but laid back and playful - or something like the "old F ***". can and is continuous, incessant, funny. And funny as in remembrance of what some of us intended when they first saw "Back in the City" or "Sick". The material is always fresh, with a touch of truth to everything that burns the mind during (here goes ) tickle the funny bone. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about death (how long do you have to wait to scratch a name from the book? Six weeks, unless on the computer scheduler), the facets of communication, view from the sky, Patches of God (of course), kids, and just annoying gestures that involve religious hats, and whether people really have "rights" form the bulk of the special, centered around the premise that this is bad for you. They're simply BS , A complete, complete BS, which, as we also learn (or if you have really learned, like the child who waits for a week on the street corner, after it was not accidentally dropped by the parents) holds the country together. While not necessarily angry, Carlin seems to express the contempt in most twists, even to see what dreadful teeth look like. It is skepticism and the feeling that everything is NOT "OK". <br /> <br /> It matters: Carlin is a filthy, witty, cautious stand-up comedy that's Yoda for Jedis Anywhere, what crystal clear wisdom in a world where it's damn hard, something to get a little spark of hope. At least we get classic GC outrageous lines and bits from the man's 13th Comedy (or is it the 14th), including an eyebrow-uplifting observation of people playing Mozart music during birth!
