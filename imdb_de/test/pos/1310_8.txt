I've never heard of Mishima before I saw this movie, and although parts of the movie are a bit boring, I still find it exciting to watch it when it's repeated on the box. At the beginning of the film we are told that a famous Japanese writer behaves like a madman and publicly commits Seppuku. As you move through the movie, you are gently drawn into the twisted logic of Mishima. His life stages are presented in four chapters. Each chapter itself is a mixture of two contrasting narratives. The first chapter continues the story with scenes from Mishima's life and appears in black and white. The second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel that are staged like a play in vivid colors. Each chapter presents a different novel. Between each chapter, the narrative returns to the present, while Mishima goes on to his later ritual suicide. This means that the drama and the suspense will last until the end. I suspect that many people find this movie boring and artful. I respect that, this is not a movie for people who want action and a strong plot. If, on the other hand, you are the person who takes the opportunity to kick a bizarre man in the eye while you see her life story in a collage of beautiful images by Philip Glass, you will love it. I loved it. <br /> <br />
