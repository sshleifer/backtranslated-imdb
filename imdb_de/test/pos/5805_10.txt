The show was great and very professional. Madonna is a nonstop that dances and sings for 2 hours. The opening was pretty good when she came out of the disco ball and also the jump was a really good performance. The entire show was full of energy, so it's hard to say what the highlights were because each song had something special and unique. I've seen some of their previous tours live (Drowned World and Reinvention Tour). They were good, but you can not compare with them. The dancers were fantastic, the lights and the whole show were just perfect. Madonna still looks very good. If you have not seen it yet, I strongly recommend that you see it. You will enjoy the show from start to finish. Madonna is still the dancing queen.
