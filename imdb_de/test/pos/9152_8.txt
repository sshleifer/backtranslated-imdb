The beloved villain is a wonderful piece. It depicts Paris of the 145th century in a splendid Hollywood manner, but offers its existence a worse side than the poor would. And the snow. It is constantly whirling around and contributes to the rigor of the environment - brilliant! The scenery is enhanced by the odd cast of characters such as beggars, cripples and dwarfs. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore delivers a brilliant performance that only trumps the great Conrad Veidt, who plays a degenerate, reprehensible role to perfection for Louis XI. And yes, Veidt deliberately reaches for the nose and pushes his presentation to wondrous limits.
