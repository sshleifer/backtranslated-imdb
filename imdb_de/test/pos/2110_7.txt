First, I'm a teenager. OK, and I have to say that this movie was pretty good. I think any child under the age of ten will like it, but people my age may be a bit, um, well, we would call the movie LAME! But I liked it. It may be that I still behave like a child or visit a cattle farm every weekend, but this movie was cute. I liked the way the actors were like children, not the little blond Cutesy Pies who wore three layers of clothes, a fashionable hat, and about a thousand asections (like most of today's shows, just to name a few, Drake & Josh, Lizzie Mc Guire Well, every kids show.) And the setting was perfect, but there was a mistake. The family was in debt, right? Why in the world did your inner house look like something out of a "Western" store? That was a mistake. <br /> <br /> The cameos are great, there are about five hundred, and the only one to explain is Julia Roberts, the little girl's aunt. How on earth did you get everyone else? This movie seemed to have a tight budget. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, it was fun to see it, and I thought some parts were far-fetched (like a cow sold for $ 750,000? Ha! My butt sells a cow so much!) But otherwise it was good, I liked it and could watch it again. But I would never buy it, there are not even features on the DVD! What about it? But rent it, especially if you have small children running around in the house.
