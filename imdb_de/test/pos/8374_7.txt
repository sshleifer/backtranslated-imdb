An unusual movie for a non-US audience. Lena Horne looks fabulous and Ralph Cooper too. There is no background for tap steps as in other musicals, so you can not hear the taps' taps, which is very realistic. The music is dumb to hear the dance steps. The acting is a bit stilted and the actors talk slowly, so you think the movie is older than it is. In the end, the costumes in the dance routines are daring. It often feels like you're part of a crowd at a stage show. Which furniture you see is very modern, which reinforces the feeling of the other worldliness of the film. A must for all movie fans.
