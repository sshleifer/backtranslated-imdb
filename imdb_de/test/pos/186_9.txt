This is a great and in many ways impressive movie. I saw it on TV as a little boy, my neck was almost strangled with tears, and today again on the critically restored Criterion DVD. Cranes is the real essence of War Weepie. Imagine the umbrellas of Cherbourg without music and without color or the Waterloo Bridge without class consciousness. Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, looks deep as a pretty girl whose fiancé intervenes not to write or come back. The fiancé Boris dies at the front and his death scene is indescribably romantic. Very daring, because so close to "over the top". But this scene will stay with you. <br /> <br /> Although the soviets of World War II were so defined, the film is rather unspecific and more powerful. The scenes from the pre-war and post-war period feel very much. No attempt is made to detail the period details. The entire film is becoming more and more stylized, to the Siberian scenes, which feel like a modern operatic movement (that's a compliment). The final cathartic scene is milked to the last drop - again comparable to Cherbourg. The production feels like a big budget (these staircase scenes must have cost a pretty kopek). <br /> <br /> Go for it. Do not expect a bitter socialist pill (although of course it is very sad). The Cranes are Flying is an impressive piece of world cinema, considering where and when it was made.
