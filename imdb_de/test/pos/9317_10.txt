Before I continue with the new millennium, I will go back to the past, because I had completely forgotten these jewels !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 1987, Disney was still a "low" company. In the 1980s, a series of films titled "Not Quite Human" about a geeky teenager who looks like a human being like "Inspector Gadget" could start but really is a robot !!!!! Well, this SCREAMS 80S, along with other movies like "Tron" and "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids" because it combines everything from the past with the technologies of tomorrow !!!!! <br /> <br /> My parents remember seeing this on TV back when I was just born or something. My very first encounter with this film, however, took place on the Old Disney Channel (I once saw this and the other parts on my 12th birthday in May '99 !!!!!) <br /> <br /> "Not Quite Human "is a very good series of movies that you should see if you can ever find those movies again. <br /> <br /> Has this been shown recently? If so, give me an e-mail or a personal message. <br /> <br /> 10/10
