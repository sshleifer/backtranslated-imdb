I am deeply grateful to have seen this movie. The drama is amazing, the movie itself is powerful and clear and the issues involved are treated with subtlety and depth. <br /> <br /> This is an important movie. It could be profoundly transformative. <br /> <br /> I would never pay good money, never see it again. Because it is so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to see. I admit that my taste in movies tends to be easy for easy conversation; The visual medium can be so strong that I avoid it for something really important. Those of you who are stronger than me will probably be able to handle it more easily. <br /> <br /> But I urge people to see it at least once. Preferably with others, so you can talk and have someone nearby reminding you that there is more to the world than just the movie.
