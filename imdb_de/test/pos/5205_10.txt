Apart from the low budget, there never seem to be more than 50 Germans in a scene, plus the same two half tracks. This movie is absolutely top class. Everything is exactly right. That's the point, I think, from uniforms to horror and disillusionment. Everyone is as gray as the field gray uniforms. Gray men with the life that ran out of them. Forget that the US made gung ho garb like Blackhawk and Private Ryan. This is one of the best war films of all time. Only Cross of Iron suggests this for suspense and history. Could we have a proper German language without synchronization with English subtitles in the UK? Without paying ridiculous import fees from Europe. Most other DVDs are multilingual. Why not this one?
