Despite all the stylistic and cinematic inventions, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same kind of plot favored by old favorites like Silence of the Lambs. A police team follows in the footsteps of (especially disgusting) murders, someone else is seized and they somehow have to figure out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case is the only person who knows the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) in a coma, and we need the science-fiction machine of psychologist Jennifer Lopez that goes in his head and forces him to do so tell everyone. Here, the movie becomes brand new and different when we enter (via a 21st century CGI update from Dr. Who's kaleidoscopic favorite, the trendy Time Tunnel) a kind of Hellraiser-crazy world full of weird, crazy things, place of D ' Onofrio is dominated, now a kind of superking supremacy of his twisted spiritual world, in his comatose body. The sequences inside the mind are well executed and often quite stunning. All the leads are working properly, the degree of cruelty is maximum, if you like these kinds of things, but the hype around it all led to disappointment for me. I expected something completely new and unforeseen, not this pretty good mix of serial killer and special effects -Horror genre. Sometimes frightening, often pretty, a pretty gripping story told by talented movie people with care and attention, but by no means the big leap into the unknown when it's been marketed.
