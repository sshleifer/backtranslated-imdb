(Spoiler warning) I can not say enough good things about this movie. It's a great horror comedy / parody that does it all right for a change. The humor is great, ranging from funny to funny. In one scene, Ed goes crazy and erases a big scene. When his boss looks at Ed's cut, he shouts, "Where in fu% # is my beaver rape scene?!?!" Hysterical. There are also many other great, humorous and memorable quotes and moments: Ed yells, "Can not you see me !!!" while he repeatedly slaps a poor fool in the face. Very funny stuff. The plot of the movie itself is so ridiculous that it is invaluable: Ed is a mellow, everyday guy who gets put into the horror film editing department and goes crazy after a while, seeing monsters and attacking people while citing the horror Movies he has worked on. This movie has it all and is just funny. The DVD costs only about 7 US dollars and is a great bargain, since it is the unrated widescreen. I own a lot of DVDs, most of them cost a lot more money than these, but not many are as great as this movie. My Evil Ed DVD is one of the highlights of my collection and I would beat someone with a telephone if he tried to steal it. Evil Ed radiates style and quality - something that Hollywood filmmakers mainly have to learn. Evil Ed is a rare gem and I want to thank everyone who worked on this wonderful movie - they did everything right and I love Evil Ed! 10 out of 10 !!!
