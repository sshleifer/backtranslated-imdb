I can not remember the series, I think it was "American Masters", but it was aired on PBS around 1980. probably think it's a pretty dry topic. Anyone who has looked at this 7-part series does not feel that way. They learn about the uproar in Oppenhemier's mind and how evolution has changed his life forever. They understand the tragic figure he has become and why. With 7 episodes you get to know the most important actors as well as the intrigues and backstabbing. I've contacted PBS about the chance to get a video or a DVD, but have never received an answer. A pity, I would like to see it again.
