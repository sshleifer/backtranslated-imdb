It is well known that Hayao Miyazaki is a master of his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful storylines and similarly imaginative characters. His films from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA and MONONOKE to the new HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE are not only great in terms of art, but also in terms of filmmaking. Can not this man go wrong? Not really, but one can not expect that each of his films is always a five-star wonder. His latest film, PONYO, an outrageous family-friendly story about a "goldfish out of the water", is as vivid and alive with interesting characters as one would expect ... and yet this is the first film to be released in "Lesser Territory." Do not get me wrong, PONYO is by no means a bad movie, as I said, it is a feast for the eyes and is as charming and enchanting as TOTORO and KIKI The problem is that the story does not stay afloat to satisfy everyone who is after In the opening PONYO is a Miyazaki storytelling at its best, where a hooligan and the overzealous young goldfish (later called Ponyo) makes a forbidden journey into the human world where he is later adopted by a boy of the same age named Sosuke (interestingly modeled after the director's son), which appeals to Ponyo's father, a mysterious sorcerer It's not like Fujimoto, who is very angry with people for destroying the sea (this environmental topic is not very different from other Miyazaki films) ... a problem he desperately wants to fix by creating jellyfish from the bow of his submarine. He separates the couple and tries to persuade Ponyo to stay underwater with him. However, the goldfish has already tasted both Sosuke's blood (a cut on his finger) and some of the human food (ham on which she inexplicably becomes addicted) and of course steals into her father's forbidden potions and turns young into a hyperactivity Girl (who is the spitting image of Mei by MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). This triggers a dangerous tsunami that threatens to engulf the entire world with water. Fujimoto, who has teamed up with his wife Gran Mamare, a translucent sea goddess who alternates between an oversized Titan and a human being, decides to test the love of the two adolescents among themselves. They do so by raising the sea to the level of Sosuke's home and causing the teens to pull themselves through their now-infested ocean with an oversized toy boat (made possible by Ponyo's own magical powers). <br /> <br /> At this point PONYO starts to run the steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are adorable and the scenes they relate to are funny and cute, they slow the movie down. Unfortunately, where the movie really gets water is the culmination of Sosuke's showing his love for Ponyo, in a way that is strangely anticlimactic and over-hasty, bringing an otherwise sexy story to an abrupt halt. This is unlikely to enthrall audiences and awaits another instant masterpiece from the man who has provided far more interesting finals for many of his other films. Do you remember the destruction of Laputa? Satsukis looking for the little Mei? Kiki's rescue from Tombo? Porco Rosso's fight with Curtis? The rescue of the Waldgeistkopf? Or even the test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All these resolutions were far more satisfying and more complete than these. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, PONYO can not be criticized. The animation is absolutely beautiful to watch and was produced completely without a single image of computer generated images. Of course, Joe Hisaishi gives us another breathtaking music. The best moments are the thrilling sequences under water, accompanied by a choir and a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed as in all other Ghibli films. <br /> <br /> After Ghibli's previous films have translated and outplayed first-rate results, Disney Studios and Pixar once again feature English dubbing with a mostly capable cast of actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke and sounds very natural and believable throughout. Noah Cyrus as a ponyo, on the other hand, sometimes goes overboard screaming its lines before finally settling towards the end. Apart from that, the rest of the cast includes Liam Neeson as overly cautious Fujimoto (who does not surprisingly well manage himself in the character), Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamare (in a ubiquitous tone that is not very different from her Galadriel in LORD OF THE RINGS ). Matt Damon as Sosuke's ever-sailing father Koichi (who is good but nothing to write home about) and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of them, Fey is the best voice in the entire cast, giving the character just the right amount of spirit and personality. Her scenes with Sosuke show real chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was spectacular as Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY, is disappointed as one of three older disabled women (she has barely any lines!), Which is also voiced by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Of them, only Tomlin's character, a Kantian-born woman named Toki, shows a real personality, but if I were to make the film, I would switch Tomlin to Leachman. Dub's only real drawback is probably a blasty techno-remix of the catchy (but ridiculously repetitive) title song of the movie, which thankfully plays in the middle of the credits. <br /> <br /> On the PONYO is a good movie. a fine animated work that is perfect for teenagers and family audiences. However, due to the loss of momentum towards the end, he remains well below the classic status. Since Miyazaki is at least still better than most other animated films, I am generous and give PONYO an unqualified star recommendation, as each of its features is still worth watching, especially on the big screen. (Make sure you catch it in the cinemas as long as you can.)
