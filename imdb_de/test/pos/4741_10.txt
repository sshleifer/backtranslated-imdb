After seeing "Waco: The Rules of Engagement," I was simply sitting in disbelief at what I saw. A big cover-up by the FBI, a gung-ho massacre triggers happy government agents? I remember the Waco argument well, I was 17 years old and saw everything on CNN. I remembered thinking about all the children when I burned the burning of Mount Camel in April 1993. I remember the children were sorry, but I clearly felt that it was their evil leader David Koresh and the other Davidians. Gazecki's film shows clearly and unambiguously that the FBI has lied again and again. I think that this film made a major contribution to the reopening of a new investigation into the incident in 1999. The result of this new study was predictable in a sense. The verdict was based on facts that were as grave as the facts that the Davidians have demonstrated. I was very disappointed with the verdict because, as far as I know, it did not take into account all the lies, misinformation and cover up of the FBI and other officials. Why was no one prosecuted for obstructing the work of the Texas Rangers investigators? Why were they allowed to contaminate the scene shortly after the incident and shoot the site? These are questions to which the government has given me no answers. Most importantly, what about the children? In this new investigation I was not informed who was responsible for spraying the flammable CS tear gas into a compound with many hazards to igniting this gas, and I have found no answer as to whether the muscles of the children are affected by the effects have contracted the gas while they lived. If so, I would certainly think that the Janet Reno, or whoever was responsible for the raid, should face charges of mass murder or manslaughter. The question raised but not mentioned by Gazecki is: Was it a direct plan for those responsible and their tanks to drill holes and deliberately burn down the building? (A plan that would have been achieved with 112% effectiveness) or were the responsible officials so incompetent that they were unaware of the consequences of their actions? Both are equally scary. Even if the Davidians set the site on fire, the officials in charge certainly gave them the opportunity to get the job done. If those in charge knew how they claimed the Davidians were setting fire to the facility, why? Did the tanks cut all the holes in the building into an oven and why did not they have plans to deal with the fire that they knew would happen? Dark Questions That Still Do not Disappear The final and most relevant output of this film is the way the Davidians are demonized by the government through the media, which they simply expose to the public. I remember the resentment I felt for the evil Davidians I saw on CNN in 1993. Now that I'm older, every time you prepare for a massacre of civilians, I can formulate a clear line of communication from the government to its intended goals. To demonize people with words; "They have other unlawful values ​​than we do" "they do not enjoy freedom" and "they are a threat to our freedoms and way of life," making them much easier to kill.
