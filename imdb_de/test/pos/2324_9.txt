I just discovered this movie and I love it. Just the right mix of fast moving story, entertaining characters, funny moments (but not overloaded with stupid jokes) and fun performances by Kelsey Grammar, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron Schneider, Rip Torn and more. Buckman is especially good, and I really enjoyed seeing the guy who played Stapanick. <br /> <br /> I also find it interesting that they used a real submarine, the Pampanito, to run in top scenes and almost exactly imitate them for their sets. The decoration of the set is really impressive when you make a digital tour of the Pampanito online and then compare it to the scenes in the movie. You have done an excellent job in this film. <br /> <br /> What a light entertaining and really enjoyable movie!
