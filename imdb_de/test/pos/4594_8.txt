"Idiocracy" is the latest movie coming from Mike "Office Space" Judge, and he's certainly following a similar theme in this film because it's an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity ... relatively speaking. It's a story about Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is literally the most average guy that exists. Joe and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph) became test subjects for a military project for a wintering chamber. They should stay suspended for only one year, but because of the missing oversight, Joe and Rita are forgotten and wake up accidentally 500 years in the future. <br /> <br /> Here's the scary part: This movie explains: In a very realistic and plausible way, the entire population of 2505 has been left behind. Without natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the fastest, brightest, and strongest people for the advancement of genes ... only the most brooding people. Unfortunately, these people are sanctuaries, trailer garbage idiots who breed like rabbits. This rich reproduction of the stupid people has had a negative impact on social growth, and now Joe and Rita are the two smartest people in the world. If it helps, imagine the entire population as a mix of rednecks, jocks, cholos and hoochies. When Joe sees this nightmarish dystopia, he learns and tries to locate a time machine to see if he and Rita can come back when they come, and that's basically the whole story. But despite how one-dimensional I like to sound, this movie has a higher forehead than one can guess. Nuances are everywhere and anyone can see looks (warning signs, if you will) of modern stupidity, permeates the facets of everyday life and turns them into the wreck that is featured in "Idiocracy". The film has some really impressive showcases of realistic delays that stand on a pedestal. I do not want to betray anything and ruin jokes for you, but let's just say it's pretty thorough. I can see, as some would say, that it's just a lot of toilet humor, but it may be strange, has a purpose. to show how stupid and crass these people are. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor "Office Space"; No one will see it in the cinemas, but everyone will brag about discovering this awesome / funny movie when it appears on video. My only complaint for the film would be that the flow of the narrative is sometimes interrupted, so that they can do some animation tutorial for the galaxy, how things have gotten where they are, but it is a necessary evil and will be here implemented better. Otherwise, good characters, funny jokes and above-average social commentary, which are wrapped in a funny bow. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: When our youth sees gangbanger-will-be, they behave like redneck / ghetto trash and be proud of it ... if you are educated and cultivated anyway and can see how our country is out of control gets into an abyss of stupidity, for God's sake, look at this movie.
