Aaliyah blows all female actors out of the water, including the official love interest Marguerite Moreau. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to have seen this movie as Akashas Power Trip. Aaliyah is simply electrifying when she's on the screen. It makes you sensual, beautiful and threatening to the power of 10. Watching her play in a bar full of vampires is an unforgettable sight. That is extremely unjustified. She looks awesome and with 46 (according to IMDb) she still looks stunning. Unfortunately the story is very limited in terms of plot, we've seen it all before, and so on. <br /> <br /> Most angry is Akasha's death scene, especially considering what happened with Aaliyah after filming. <br /> <br /> All in all a remarkable vampire movie.
