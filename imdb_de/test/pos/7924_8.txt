This film must be seen for the music, which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Of course, the original soundtrack is not exactly hi-fi, but there are many great versions for classical music selection. The cantata can be appreciated for itself, but after seeing the movie, it helps. <br /> <br /> The story itself is fairly standardized Soviet anti-German propaganda. An amusing anecdote is that Stalin was so obsessed at the beginning of World War II to soothe Hitler that Eisenstein was briefly deposed in a German film. Prince Alexander Nevsky (revered by the Russian Orthodox as a saint), who earned his nickname by defeating Swedish raiders on the Neva, ended the Russian resistance to an invasion of the Teutonic Knights and his victory with a stern warning to other invaders. <br /> <br /> An interesting scene: Alexander sees a convoy of Russians being made slaves by Mongolian soldiers, and does not object, as the Teutonic Knights have their priority. The historical Alexander Nevsky praised the Mongol Khans as his father before him as he worked to consolidate the future independence of his empire.
