This is the follow-up creation of Better Off Dead. In a competition, Better Off Dead would undoubtedly win. But for Starpower, One Crazy Summer surpasses the better script of Savage Steve. Problems with a crazy summer (OCS): casting. Better Off Dead (BOD) was so much better. Friendship: OCS shows how Cusack Bill Murray's little brother looks hateful. Trouble on the set? More outrageous friends in OCS, but more sincere friends in BOD. Plot was good. You will predict some of it, but even the predictable parts go further than you think. Although this is the ugly stepsister of Better Off Dead, it's worth taking a look. Look at Demi Moore before the plastic surgery if there is no other reason. John Cusack fans, you have to see it, just to say that you have it. If you do not like Bobcat Golthwaite, I'm sorry. I do not like him either, but you can not escape him. At least he does a great job in the movie by paying tribute to another movie monster. The editing needed help on the beach, but for the most part not much to complain about. All in all, it's good and funny. But do not try to compare it to BOD, or you'll find it's missing. *Sigh*
