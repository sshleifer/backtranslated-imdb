Night of the Demons (1988) was another movie from a series of teen horror movies released on video and pay-TV. during this meeka of the eighties. But unlike most things that were carried around here, this watch was actually a decent watch. A group of bored "teenagers" decide to celebrate the Halloween night with a pair of bizarre sisters (Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley) at the notorious Hull House. Her usual cast of stereotypical teenagers is invited to the party. But an average teenage bash turns into a night of horror as he tries to survive the Halloween night when the undead Hull House residents decide to crash the party. Who survives this night of bloodshed and horror? <br /> <br /> A beautiful horror movie that is best seen in the unrated version. If you look at the R-Rated section, you will miss all splatter effects and nudity. Stay tuned for the amusing epilogue! A bloody movie, followed by an equally entertaining sequel. Only for horror fans! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
