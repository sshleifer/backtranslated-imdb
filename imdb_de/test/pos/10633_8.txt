Erika Kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. At the beginning of the movie we see her coming home late. As her older mother protests, Erika goes mad and attacks the older woman without pity. As it turns out, Erika is a musical teacher of some standing at the Conservatory where she teaches. The next time we see her, she is the model of serenity, but she shows a cruel side to the way she attacks a young male student because she believes he wastes his own time. The same goes for the unsure Anna, a talented woman who hates Erika, perhaps because she sees a promise in the young woman that she does not want to promote. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day we look to Erika goes into an amusement zone and goes to one of the booths, where pornographic material is shown. Erika is fixated as she sees the things being shown on screen. On another occasion, Erika comes to a drive-in, where a film is currently running. Her attention is focused on a parked car in which two lovers perform a sex act. The camera clings to Erika as she falls in love with dreams and watches what the two lovers do until she is surprised by the young man in the car. Erika flees horrified when she was discovered. <br /> <br /> As a rich couple invites Erika to play in an opulent home, she meets an eager young man, Walter, who is related to the hosts.

Walter decides to audition for Erika's master class, and is accepted. <br /> <br /> So begins to persecute Walter Erika, who is stunned when she realizes what the young man's motives really are. In return, Erika begins to fantasize about Walter in a way that only her mind could do, imagining what she would like to do when and when they come together. Walter is dismissed from the letter Erika wrote to him in which he describes sexual acts that are contrary to the young man. <br /> <br /> The end of the film was reminiscent of the final sequence of Mr. Hanke's current "cache." , We will be taken to a concert hall where Erika will perform. She sees herself in the lobby looking for the arrival of Walter, who walks into the hall without noticing her. Erika's expression shows much more about her state of mind in the final minutes of the movie. When she escapes from the lobby after she has had a wound, the camera leaves her and focuses on the facade of the building, which seems to be lying on the screen for a long time. <br/> <br/> "La Pianiste" is a personal appearance triumph for Isabelle Huppert. This great actress is doing one of her best performances on the screen, guided by the sure hand of Michael Haneke, one of the most interesting directors working today. Ms. Huppert works with economic gestures, but projects as much of her soul as she burns the screen with her Erika. <br /> <br /> The minor cast is directed by the director Miracle. Annie Girardot, always excellent, is perfect as Erika's mother. She seems to be the key to what went wrong with her daughter. There is a hint of incest, which is played subtly in the context of the film. Benoit Magimel is perfect as Walter. This young actor does a wonderful job in the movie as a young man and is so in love with a woman possessed by demons, so that he will never be able to move or love him in the normal way /> <br / > Michael Hanke's films are always disturbing, but they offer so many rewards because he dares to go where other men are not. The great music that can be heard in the film comes mainly from Schubert and Schumann, two composers who are Erika's own favorites. The film is enormously supported by the cinematography of Christian Berger.
