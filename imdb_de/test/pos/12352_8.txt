Pam Grier, who grabs the gun, takes names and kicks as a heroine in "Asylum of Satan" director William Girdlers entertaining blaxploitation actionist "Sheba Baby" with D'Urville Martin and Austin Stoker. "Sheba Baby" is one of several hard chick strips in which Grier performed in the 70s, including "Coffy", "Foxy Brown" and "Friday Foster". The short-lived Girdler wrote this thoroughly routine private eye-water boiler with producer David Shelton in one night. He has a wayward female Shamus who does not have to rely on a man to help them with their business. Unfortunately, "Sheba Baby" is nowhere near as good as the Blaxploitation films that Grier did under the supervision of director Jack Hill. Hill led the African American from North Carolina to Coffy, Foxy Brown, The Big Bird Cage, and The Big Doll House. Anyone who analyzes images of African American women in the cinema should be familiar with these epics. The main problem with "Sheba Baby" is that our heroine gets too many practical breaks. Of course, the secondary bad guys triggers happy clowns who could not bump into a barn with a howitzer. As the main antagonist, Dick Merrifield qualifies as both selfish and smarmy villain with exquisite lines such as, "Anything worth stealing." In addition, the composer Monk Huggins delivers a strong, atmospheric orchestral sound, and the best song with Barbara Mason is "Good Man Is Gone." "Sheba Baby" occupies Grier as stylist Chicago Gumshoe Sheba Shayne. She leaves Windy City to return to her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to help her father. When she arrives in Louisville, Sheba learns that her father Andy (Rudy Challenger of "Detroit 9000") has problems with a local black gangster named Pilot (cigar crier D'Urville Martin of "Hammer"), who demands Andy sell his loan company to pilot or die. <br /> <br /> First, Pilot sends a squad to drop Andy's office, but our heroine's dad kills her. They turn Sheba's father into a punching bag. Interestingly enough, during the fight scene, Girdler rarely shows fists shattering meat. Previously, Andy's right-hand man, Brick Williams (Austin Stoker of "Horror High"), sent a telegram to Sheba asking her to return to Louisville, but she did not receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who did not know where she was can be found. Brick and Sheba join in, igniting their romantic flames and spending a night in a sack. Brick spends most of her time pushing Sheba to stay calm in the face of adversity. As a former police officer in Louisville, Kentucky, Sheba prefers to shoot first and secondly ask questions. When she arrives home, Sheba borrows her father's car and barely escapes bursting. As she walks through the door to get into her father's car, Andy receives another harassing call from Pilot. Previously, Andy had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan company to Pilot, but Andy changes his mind and agrees to talk with the drug. A satisfied pilot warns Andy about the dynamite that was attached to his detonator with an ignition delay. In other words, if you turn on the car, the explosion will not trigger. The explosion comes ten seconds later. Andy and Brick save Sheba before the car explodes. Previously, Sheba had agreed that her father would deal with his problems without any problems. "Dad, I know you think I'm doing a man's job, but I'm not just marginalized just because I'm a woman," Sheba says. After her near-death experience, Sheba praises finding out who sabotaged her father's car. She attacks an old contact from her time as a police officer and threatens the man with her weapon to find out the information. Only after Sheba rubbed the guy's face into a bucket of chlorn dust did he give in and tell her about amortization in the city's railway museum. Brick escorts Sheba and the shooting is done with a nervous pilot who pulls away from the chin. <br /> <br /> Later, Pilot sends a quintet of out-of-town contractors armed with teeth to Andy's office. These cannons ignore their no-kill commands. They not only shoot the loan company's office, but Sheba's father with a shotgun. Sheba takes revenge in a short time. She swung her nickel-plated revolver and knocked down three of the four Dirty Harry-style attackers. The last batsman puts down his weapon and asks for mercy. Sheba has her finger on the trigger when murder chief Phil Jackson (Abinger's Charles Kissinger) arrives and a uniformed policeman arrives. In the hospital, Andy Shayne dies from his daughter's hand. Of course, Pilot is angry with this revelation and his anger is bordering on apoplexy. Sheba then seeks out a loan shark Walker (Christopher Joy from "Cleopatra Jones") and gets him information about the pilot while she holds him in a car wash at gunpoint. This is one of the better staged scenes where the carwashes whirl and eerily eerily. Walker warns pilot in front of Sheba. Pilot and his followers face Sheba in a parking lot and swap the lead. Sheba flees on foot to a nearby carnival. While the police enter one of Pilot's men, she takes care of the others. The pilot accidentally shoots one of his own and Sheba drops him. She jams Pilot on a roller coaster and threatens to hold him there until the roller coaster cuts off his head. The pilot manages to escape after telling Sheba about the identity and phone number of the great man Shark (Dick Merrifield of "The Hellcats"), who is so flawless that Detective Jackson calls him "the man with everything." became the right answers. "" Sheba Baby "is not first class Pam Grier: The idea that our heroine can do it all alone without the help of men makes it interesting and entertaining.
