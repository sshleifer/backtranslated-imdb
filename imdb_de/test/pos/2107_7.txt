Alexander Lou, a star of classics like "The Super Ninja" and "Mafia vs Ninja," beats the headlines in this fun martial arts celebration. The plot refers to the evil Abbott White (who has some honest and honest names), some scary-looking white eyebrows) who take the help of a Ninja clan to overthrow the Shaolin Temple. He achieves this goal and extinguishes most of his members, though it is needless to mention that he needs one or two survival and more predictable revenge on the rogue Abbott. <br /> <br /> .... Ok, the plot is not exactly in terms of creativity, but someone watching a movie with a title like "Wu Tang vs Ninja", also known as "The Ninja Hunter, "is it really important that such a negligible factor as a conspiracy is significant? Of course not! - It's the fights that are important in these movies and chewing gum - here you get your money's worth! It shows some excellently choreographed martial arts from all involved, and rarely does a minute pass without a fight breaking out for any reason. <br /> <br /> If you dive into martial arts films, then this is worth seeing!
