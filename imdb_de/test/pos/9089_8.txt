This film has a very strange backdrop, it takes place in a school that is very old at first, but it certainly does not look like a sterile medical school. Very gothic and atmospheric. As far as the movie itself is concerned, the premise is a bit far-fetched, but hey, that's why we watch movies, right? And it's less far-fetched than part of the garbage that's traveling today, that's for sure. Medical students experiment with short-term death by briefly letting themselves go to see what life after death looks like. In some cases, it's kind of nice to see some of it coming back with the traveler and getting involved in their earthbound life. I had not seen this movie for years until I got it on DVD, and I have to say that I forgot how good it was. And it struck me that Julia Roberts looks really nice in this movie, not like today's actresses, who are supposed to be great, but dressed like cheap hookers and make-up. Ahh, the good old days. Anyway, this is a great movie, maybe not for fundamentalist Christians, but many others like it. 8 out of 10 stars.
