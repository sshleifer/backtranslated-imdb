Scientist Carl Lehman (well played by David McIlwraith) gets something awful in a deliberate chemical blast. He has transplanted his brain into the body of an almost indestructible metal cyborg suit worn by his evil colleagues led by the malicious, obsessive colleague Alex Whyte (a hated depiction of Richard Cox). Lehman sets out on a deadly spree. It's up to the evil mercenary Hunter (a wonderfully despicable turn of the divine Pam Grier) to stop him. Director Jean-Claude Lord, who previously led the underrated Slasher psycho-thriller "Visiting Hours", stages the rich action scenes with considerable momentum and maintains a consistent tempo, ensuring that this movie is a pleasantly trashy sci-fi / Horror action excursion. Paunchy character of Maury Chaykin Cops easily tops acts as a disgustingly thick crawling Burt, who in the only, tasteless sequence of the film has a brutal fist fight with Lehman's pregnant wife Lauren (an award-winning performance by pretty Teri Austin). Stan Winston's fancy make-up f / x and Paul Zaza's exciting score add to the muddy fun.
