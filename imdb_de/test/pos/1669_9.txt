A recent remake of the French thriller (original title: "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes") with its famous 20-minute Silent Jewel Heist sequence is now released in the US in a beautiful new print from the Criterion Collection with improved subtitles and some Extras. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut), who had to make films because of his blacklist in Europe. Rififi was well known in the US and did well in art houses. Later, Dassin became more widely known in the US through "Never on Sunday" (1960) with his wife, Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was once again glorified and popularized for Americans and others along with Anthony Quinn in Mihali's Kakogianni's 1964 "Zorba the Greek", which was even a great success in Cairo.) The new Rififi DVD features a recent interview with Dassin. I did not know before that one of the main robbers, Cesar the Milanese, was played by Dassin, who intervened when the original actor was no longer available. He is one of the most memorable characters, a dandified Italian cracker who does not speak French. <br /> <br /> Although this classic has all the virtues of French film Noir - the black and white Twilight world of well-lit apartments, shiny black cars, men in suits, the nightclub scenes, including a dramatically filmed and lit theme song, the stony faces and the Gauloises in hand or mouth - I do not think it's so atmospheric or very different from a style like Melville's movies. But there is the hypnotizing robbery, which is considered a feat of strength to this day. It runs like clockwork, with a fine sense of craftsmanship and teamwork among the robbers. Some curious police officers are treated efficiently. When they go home and distribute the loot, it quickly goes awry when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a lady a ring with a million-dollar bangle. Has there ever been a robbery movie, whose perps happily lived after it? <br /> <br /> It's the wordless Heist sequence that gives this place a special place, and Dassin, a US-American director with an unusually diverse and exotic career, deserves it completely. He took such a conventional novel that he would reject it, adding some key elements that make him special. In this case, he could not pass the adjustment: he needed the money too much. Jean Servais, starring Tony le Stephanois, was an actor who did not appreciate his luck. His grim face is perfect for the role. Later, he starred in Dassin's He Who Must Die (1957), which used French actors in Greece for a political story. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing capricious film from 1964 (it fades in comparison to 'Rififi'), which was also distributed in the US. It has a good backdrop, but it is wasted, very mild and radiant and pretty. From Dassin's post-Hollywood work "Never on Sunday" with his catchy title song and the charismatic heroine is the popular choice (and won the best film in Cannes in 1960); "He who must die", the political decision; 'Rififi' the genre choice. A strange piece is his "Phaedra" with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). Purists of the harsh Hollywood genre work would miss these and prefer the early films of Dassin, including a prison drama, "Brute Force" (1947), a police movie, "The Naked City" (1948); and two hard core noirs, "Thieves Highway" (1949) and "Night and the City" (1950). Personally, I tend to like French Noir and American neo-noir spin-offs better than the original American Noir source material - hence my continuing fascination for 'Rififi'. Dassin, however, is unique because he not only made Hollywood noir, but also went to Paris and produced a memorable example of his French derivative of the fifties.
