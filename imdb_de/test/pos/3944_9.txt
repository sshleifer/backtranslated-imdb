HISTORY Chinese Tall Story tells the story of the sincere monk, Tripitaka, who travels west with his guardians Monkey, Sandy and Pigsy in search of ancient sutras to finally reach the final stages of their journey to Shache City. It's not like it seems when the city is attacked by evil tree demons. Monkey tries his best to fight it but is overwhelmed. He knows that his master is in great danger. He uses his trusty golden staff to bring Tripitaka to safety. <br /> <br /> The monk is knocked down on landing When he wakes up, he's in the presence of a young lizard snack called Maiyan, which pretty much glares our young hero. After many verbal misunderstandings Maiyan is convinced that Tripitaka loves her. When the monk decides, he has to rescue Monkey and the others, she insists on accompanying him. So the mismatched couple starts with his adventure. <br /> <br /> EVALUATION Okay, it's another Journey To The West movie, which for me is not a bad thing, as I love the story and the associated characters. I was a bit excited to put the DVD in the To get hands. I think I'll start my review with the story going on everywhere. At first it was your standard fantasy movie. Then it became a ridiculous comedy, and suddenly it became a full-fledged science-fiction movie when director Jeff Lau I experimented with mixing genres and made a pretty scatological work with this film. I think it's a pretty unique approach, focusing the story on a character other than the infamous Monkey King, especially a pacifist character like Tripitaka, and then putting him at the heart of a love story. All in all, I liked it. <br /> <br /> The acting is for the most part solid, with the lead roles Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi doing some really good performances, though Ah Char spends a lot of time on the screen behind some pretty ugly makeup. The minor cast is nicely put together, it contains all the usual EEG main stays, so Boy'Z and Isabella Leong appear. One actor I want to mention is Wilson Chen, who plays the Monkey King with whom he did a good job. The limited material he seemed to have played was a version of the Monkey King, who was submissive but arrogant. I felt he was retreading the area of ​​Twins Effect II, but fortunately, this is not the case. I hope he can continue on with himself in the lead role, as the film is open to a sequel. <br /> <br /> Okay, let's get back to directing what's going on again. Somehow everywhere, Lau gives too much time to the Stephen Chow-Esquire nonsense comedy, which involves a scene in which Tripitaka is around struggling, disguised as a Spider-Man, which leads to many head scratching moments as the film plays in ancient China. He creates some really nice and tender moments between the two leads and plunges into lush terrain, but this reviewer occasionally likes some juice, so it did not bother me in the least. <br /> <br /> Right Well, the CGI, which for the most part is quite bearable, has many moments that are likely to belong to a PS2, as has been noted in many other reviews. But there are some cool moments, especially the scene where Monkey fights a flying servant. Many of the CG gags come in the form of the golden staff, which turns into a variety of things, from giant fly swatters to a Mech suit straight out of the Matrix Revolutions. Yeah, that sounds crazy, but I think you have to see it to believe it. Right, so at the conclusion of A Chinese Tall Story is not a flawless movie, but it lasts long enough to be entertained and generally a pleasurable movie overall. If you do not see everything to see how I phrase it, it's much better than Twins Effect II.
