Not an ordinary movie, but a good one. Billy Bob is very funny in this movie, the way he talks, what he says etc. I was kind of surprised when I saw him because I just thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more than that had a very good story, great characters and a good balance. <br /> <br /> Favorite part: Probably when Billy Bob walks around in his robe and shoots the Ripper
