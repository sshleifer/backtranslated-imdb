Maybe I'm one of the few eager horror fans who thinks the overload of Asian shockers is so over the top! Films like "Ringu" or "The Eye"? which are praised around the world? I just could not convince myself and they seemed more boring than frightening. Well, that blunt opinion does not apply to the South Korean jewel "A Tale of Two Sisters." This is a stylish and extremely complex psychological horror story that really gets under your skin! The storyline, based on a local folklore story, may be a little too confusing to count this movie as one of the greatest achievements of all time, but the atmosphere and the build-up of tension certainly evoke feelings of great respect. This is one of the few films that can not be named: The events in "Two Sisters" qualify as stunning horror, as an intense family drama and as a deep psychological portrait. In addition to a mesmerizing story, "A Story of Two Sisters" contains all the great elements that are usually missing in Asian horror movies, such as: B. captivating music, good acting and innovative camera work. The mansion where family events take place is brilliantly portrayed as a truly scary place with secrets and dangers lurking behind every door. Several sequences (like dinner with relatives or the nightly performance in the girls' room) are pretty much the last weird thing. They really made me feel uncomfortable and I like to think that I have seen my part of the scary horror. "A Tale of Two Sisters" is a terrific movie adventure and an absolute must for Asian film fanatics. A little warning for people with a short attention span, this movie forces you to keep your eyes and ears focused. It's also a movie that has to be viewed several times, even though nobody really gets it 100%.
