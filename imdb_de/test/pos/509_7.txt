I hope the summary will not irritate you so much (it's a small tribute to the Chappelle Show / Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I will try to summarize all the things that I liked about the film into a paragraph and everything that I did not like in another paragraph, so that it is easier to read! <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things! The quote "Strong, Bloody Violence" (which is used by rating boards to describe the content of a movie fits in very well here.) This is not a movie for kids or for the powerless!) Blade as a central element character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal ) and a crazy story thread to hold / justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. The action scenes are great here too The things I did not like, the overall story is too thin. It's enough, as I wrote above, to keep the action scenes together, but there could be more, and a character like Blade deserves more (imo) is not the best ... even the use of clich√©s does not help, some Characters are signed ... That's it !: o)
