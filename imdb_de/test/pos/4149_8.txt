This report is a response to the original, in which he wondered how the film actually was right ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants, like mine Italian grandparents who passed through Ellis Island at the turn of the ... century would undergo any potential invasive inspection just to enter America. <br /> <br /> It was definitely an eye opening, as my grandparents had never talked about anything terrible there. My grandmother was 5 years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrived. <br /> <br /> I have just returned from a trip to New York, where I had the pleasure to visit Ellis Island, and the museum actually guides you through the immigration assessment process - the filmmaker has obviously done his research until towards medical examinations and equipment, questions and riddles. They are all in the museum. Even the wedding pictures and the evaluation room - factually correct! Who has grandparents with a migration background, should see this movie. To say the least, inspiring.
