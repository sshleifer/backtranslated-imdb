This is a great movie. I read the short summary and was not impressed, but when I saw her (mainly for Caroline Dhavernas), she grew up with me. <br /> <br /> It's a nice change to watch a movie in which girls / young women are not punished for their sexuality. The girls get the full license to explore and even the ability to make mistakes without ridiculous effects. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are absolutely funny - and many of them are supposedly erotic scenes that were not over the top or uncomfortable. The male characters in the movie were brilliant - David Boreanaz was great as an inconsistent guy - and the great thing is that the movie does not make us hate him so much. The other two younger male characters were good too, without being overbearing. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and has girls growing up, and is very empowering to see how they recognize their mistakes but ultimately come through and continue with their lives instead to take their mistakes with them.
