I can not believe that there are people who did not like this movie! I thought it was the funniest movie I've ever seen. I'm Mel Brook's biggest fan. I know almost all words and become very discouraged when they censor them when played on a Family Channel. :) This is one of my favorite movies, so I do not know why anyone would disagree! thanks Kristina
