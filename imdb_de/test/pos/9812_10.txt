Simply an amazing bittersweet film that is a side of life that is often skipped in feel-good films. I saw this as a kid and I came back to it recently and fell in love again. <br /> <br /> As a kid, it sparked my interest alone in building a plane dark world and a young man fleeing this world. <br /> <br /> The image of the king was great, the camera style chosen with low shots and shots focusing on actions and hand movements was, in my opinion, well done to the character and almost portrayed him as a force not human (which may not be far from reality), for interesting developments <br /> <br /> worth a clock every day
