Let's face it, you know what to expect when you engage in a movie by Corey Feldman after 1990, probably breasts, weapons and cars. I say there is more to this film than just naked ladies (I'm sorry to say), because it's mostly people who kill themselves in a series of unusual things and, as the name implies, are often "mystical". I love crappy horror and I love this movie. If you do not, you probably will not. But I think it's worth it for most people to try it. It's not that shitty it's ruining your weekend or something. All in all, if it's a pointless fun, a bit of a corpse, and a '80s superstar you crave for, then you've come to the right place. It's a cracker !!!!
