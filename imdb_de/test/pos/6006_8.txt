That's what I first saw when I was a teenager at junior high school in my senior year. I was riveted to it! I loved the special effects, the fantastic locations and the trial version and the Flashback method to tell the story. A few years later, I read the book and it was interesting, and I could definitely see what Swift was. I'm trying to say, I think even though it's not as perfect as the Social Commentary, the movie's history is better. It makes more sense to have a long adventure than to let Gulliver return after each trip and to make a profit by selling the small Lilliput sheep or whatever sheep still make a cameo. As a side note, when I saw Laputa, I was stunned. It looks like the kingdom of zeal from the video game "Chrono Trigger" (1995), which made me even more appreciative of this mini-series. <br /> <br /> I saw it again about 4 years ago and I realized that I still enjoyed it as much. Really high-quality material and a superb series of sweeps mini-series for NBC, which continue with the solid Merlin and the interesting Alice in Wonderland.
