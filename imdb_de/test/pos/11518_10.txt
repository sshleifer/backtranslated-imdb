LIGHTS OF NEW YORK was the first "all-taking" movie to come in 57 minutes under the direction of Bryan Foy (of the famed Variety family). <br /> <br /> The story has two dopey barbers (Cullen Landis, Eugene Palette), who longs for a chance for the "big city life" and deals with gangsters and robber buyers. One of the boys is framed for murdering a policeman but is rescued by a minor minor (Gladys Brockwell) at the last minute. <br /> <br /> Much of the story takes place in a nightclub called The Night Hawk, run by a rogue named Hawk (Wheeler Oakman), who has a pretty chorus (Helene Costello) in her eyes who is the girlfriend of Landis is. Costello makes a short dance, and we hear Harry Downing (remembering Ted Lewis) singing "At Dawning" in his best Al Jolson style. <br /> <br /> The acting ranges from good (Palette and Brockwell) terrible (Oakman): A few actors shove their lines, but then stay in the scene, as noted elsewhere, this should be a short reeler and was created with the least budget surprisingly good, the voices are all clearly heard, and the silhouette death has a neat cinematic touch. <br /> <br /> The movie was a blockbuster, even though it was shown as a silent movie where there were no theaters. We did not expect this little movie to bring in incredible 1.3 million dollars, it has short stars from Costello and Landis made and launched Palette for his long career as a star character actor. <br /> <br /> Co-stars include Mary Carr as mother, Robert Elliott as detective, Eddie Kane as street policeman and Tom Dugan as a thug
