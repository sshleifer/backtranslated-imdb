In many ways, this film defines the essence of everything I love about the cinema in terms of capturing those strange, elusive moments of unguarded truth. In other ways, it is undeniably an amateurish, unfocused result of junkies fooling around selflessly with a camera. Eventually, there is somewhere between pure brilliance and unsurpassedness (luckily much more than the former). Part of me just wants to reward it for its absolute power of innovation and moments of pure grandeur, but at the same time I can not completely ignore the occasionally downright terrible "action" and obviously bad production values. At first, the cut seems overwhelmingly sloppy and unnecessarily distracting (or maybe just "innovative"), but after a while I get used to what is ultimately the real sign, whether a movie leads to its own conditions or to its success. I guess that answer basically summarizes my feelings for the movie. That is, in spite of the not insignificant shortcomings, it works very well overall. And last but not least, a movie like this one really shows how wrong and wrong the faux documentary, which can sometimes be shaky-cam style, when it's so obviously applied only to the effect (as in films like the otherwise admirable Roger Dodger) , The aesthetics are derived here clearly from the needs of the shooting situation and is not arbitrarily used to make them look "cool".
