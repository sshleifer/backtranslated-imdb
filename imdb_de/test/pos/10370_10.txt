Despite some less inspired opening string music, we somehow know that this is heading for the "big fun drawer" right from the start. By the time we see Monica Dolan (in a genuinely ingenious casting) screwing up Cora at an early stage, we're already addicted, but it's not until later that she shows up in her wonderful screen creation that was disturbed by The Wicked Queen of Murder and Fraud posing in the guise of the stern Miss Gilchrist, she not only effortlessly steals the entire telemovie, but simply blows anyone who approaches her off the screen, including the ever-well-proportioned David Suchet, who himself seems to have some of her acting talents Being astonished and allowing her very gentleman to be the center of attention. Dolan is the true engine of the film, and her Miss Gilchrist is a really well-rounded character in this Christie rendition, backed by a dashing script and sprightly directing - and also by the other performers led by Geraldine James and Dominic Jephcott All show signs of sympathy for the given material and play accordingly with pleasure. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are just right as usual, and if there are weaker links, they could be found in the comparatively inferior music score, the majority of later Poirots, and perhaps the lack of a real Italian-born actor for the role of Cora's husband. That being said, this is one and a half hours of pure television enjoyment that is just as selfish and entertaining as it is lovingly put together.
