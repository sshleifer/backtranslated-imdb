That's screaming funny (well, unless Bruce is on the hospital scene, which is a bit sad). <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are both excellent and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not a big blockbuster in the budget suit, but it's all it promises to be and more. By the way: The women are wonderful in their roles, even if I do not know them from other films. I would be very happy to see you again for Bruce's excellent physical comedy - he is a delicious guy! <br /> <br /> Thank you, Bruce, for your brain, this is your baby!
