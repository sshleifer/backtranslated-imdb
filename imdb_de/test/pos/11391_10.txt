Boogie Nights was without a doubt the best movie of 1997. I could see and love this movie over and over again. I'm in no hurry to see this exaggerated Titanic of romance / catastrophe again. The fact that Boogie Nights did not even receive a Best Picture nomination only proves how predictable and narrow-minded the Academy is. Only Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Jenseits and Robert Zemeckis' contact were almost as good as Boogie Nights. No other filmmaker in recent years has approached such a good film as Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" - until now. Paul Thomas Anderson took up the challenge and was successful. Just as Tarantino John Travolta's career kicked off, P.T. Anderson has given Burt Reynolds the kick his career needs. Boogie Nights will undoubtedly be stars of Don Cheadle, Heather Graham and John Reilly. Overall, a wonderful movie. The best since Pulp Fiction. Maybe even better
