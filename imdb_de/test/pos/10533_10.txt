I had such high hopes that Teletoon Retro would radiate this, but instead of showing those shows that do not get the treatment they deserve, things are broadcasted that I've seen dozens of times. <br /> <br /> The Centurions were the highlight of my previous years. I know that's a bit clich√©, but it's true. After Duke of G.I. Joe, Jake Rockewell is another of those cartoon characters I really fell in love with. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Teletoon Retro does not see it the way people of my generation do it. Otherwise Teletoon Retro would be much better than it is.
