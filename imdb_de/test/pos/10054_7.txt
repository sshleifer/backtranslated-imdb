Nicole Finn (Madonna) is just released from prison. Although she is asked to travel by bus to Philadelphia, she wants to stay in the place where she was arrested. This is because she claims that she has information that would erase her record. Louden (Griffin Dunne) is instructed by his future father-in-law to accompany her to the bus. Louden will drive through the city anyway (in Rolls Royce's future mother-in-law) picking up the wedding ring and a rare big, big cat for an eccentric collector. Nicki, however, starts the mess as soon as she jumps into the Rolls to take over driving. Advocate Louden knows he is no longer in Kansas, between big cats, taxi drivers, hitters, bridesmaids and a wedding cake with guns. Is there a way out of the madness? This movie is a wild journey into the comedy. Madonna and Dunn are perfect slides with each other and make their connection restless, by performing their role as a former lawyer or right-wing lawyer. The script is praiseworthy in its ability to induce the viewer into hysteria bouts, while an implausible scene makes room for the next and the next. All the trivial things, from the supporting actors to the scenery to the costumes, are also very nice. If you know someone who needs a jolt of pleasure, rent this movie for him. They will both be cheerio pronto.
