I love these young people who are trapped in a horror movie. Not only because I'm a big Linnea Quigley Jill Terashita fan, but because it's a lot of fun and sometimes scary. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, especially Linnea's scene with the lipstick and towards the end, when almost all are dead and obsessed. <br /> <br /> A lot of nudity from Linnea and Jill, lots of humor, cool soundtrack, high body weight, etc. ... By the way, if you have I've never seen this before. Try and buy / watch the unrated version, which contains more gore and some scenes where the rated version is missing.
