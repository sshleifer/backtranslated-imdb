Again, I have to play something from the opponent. Most reviews for Ab Tak Chappan have been extremely positive. Mine is positive, but only slightly. A 7 out of 10 corresponds to a "C" grade of me. <br /> <br /> It seems that much of the praise is due to two factors: First, Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than a typical Bollywood movie and two, that he tries to make things different. <br /> <br /> The first point I could not care less about. I'm not looking for realism in movies, and I do not score higher for a movie that shows a story and characters that come closer to realizing my belief in the real world. I'm a big fan of Surrealism, Fantasy and Absurdism And so on, although I do not just hate realistic movies because they're realistic. <br /> <br /> For the second point, I agree that it is a good idea to try to do things differently. However, I do not believe that "originality" versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse movie in itself. A movie can be "original" and bad, just as a movie can be formulaic and excellent. What matters is how well the movie does what it wants and how pleasing or aesthetic the viewer is. <br /> <br /> From Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai policeman named Daya Naik. Naik was a "meeting specialist". Meeting specialists, who might be considered early instantiations of real "Judge Dredds", are trained to operate on the criminals and gang members who persecute them, and they are basically licensed to kill - effectively as a police officer, judge, jury and hangman a few moments. Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar), the Naik-based encounter specialist. We see him at work, in dealing with his colleagues, whom he encounters, and by force. We see him at home and try to live a normal life in his less luxurious environment. We see him trying to adapt to a new Commissioner in the middle of the film. And we see his strange relationship with a notorious Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). <br /> <br /> All this has the potential to make a fabulous, gritty movie. I agree that it's nice to miss the typical Bollywood numbers and romances - not every movie needs it. Ram Gopal Varma, producer of Ab Tak Chappan, is known for letting music and romance in the background or on the track in many films he directs or produces. In addition, Ab Tak Chappan has some good performances - Patekar almost releases a Death Wish (1974) - Charles Bronson-Vibe. It also has an admirable cinematography - for example, the handheld material at the beginning of the film was particularly effective. It has a great score that blends a moody Hollywood-sounding action / crime rating with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. The violence is good and hard. <br /> <br /> There is also a decent exploration of subtexts, including the morale of (encounter) specialists, the idea of ​​following instructions, and so on. The encounter specialists must largely separate themselves from ideas of right and wrong. Worse, the movie asks for the merit of blindly following orders. It draws parallels between the encounter specialists for orders and about members of a country's military, and it shows what a corrupt situation this can lead to. <br /> <br /> But (you just knew it was a "but" coming, was not it? "Director Shimit Amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters and far too many rambles, and it works All these problems could be due to the fact that Amin and his crew are looking at the godfather films to which Tak Chappan has some (at least superficial) similarities, albeit from the point of view of a police officer Most of the encounter specialists We do not learn very well apart from Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid), these are flat-drawn characters Narayan, I did not know who he was, at least halfway through the movie, his name is mentioned several times, but I would just take a look catch him until the scene changes, then everyone would change as soon as they reappear and I would have to start over to find out who Narayan was. <br /> <br /> The same passie with Agashes first commissioner. The film was already far into the new commissioner before I could find out the relationship. It seems like there are new characters in every scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. This may be of artistic value, as the encounter specialists mainly kill people of whom they do not know (because they usually do so on order), as we also do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists to find hard-to-find characters, and do that not exactly a thrilling movie. <br /> <br /> The main villain is Zameer. But up to half of the film, there is no evidence. He does not have much more time than the other villains moving through the movie, and he literally talks on the phone with his performance - he's in a different location (Dubai), communicating by phone only for the majority of the movie. We do not see that Zameer does much. To a certain extent, the movie depends on a few "twists" that do not require Zameer to show a number of things, but we could see him doing other things, and many other villains might have been left out. <br /> <br /> That would have tightened up the movie a bit, made it more focused, and made it shorter by about half an hour, both of which affected its effect. This is by no means an action-packed movie. For at least the first 45 minutes, I admired Tak Chappan's remarkable style, but said, "Okay, keep the story going."
