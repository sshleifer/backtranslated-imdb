The Stooges are back and weirder than ever. "Brideless Groom" was probably the best Shemp movie in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Shemp has the opportunity to inherit $ 500,000 (which was probably more than $ 1 million compared to today) from his dead uncle. BUT! There is a catch. On this day he has to marry someone at 6 o'clock. Shemp is a bachelor with not too many admirers, except for an aggressive annoying vocal student. But he does not want her, he wants something more of Victoria's Secret. But obviously he has no choice because he is not Collin Ferrel himself. But when it is printed in the newspapers that he is to inherit all the money when he is married, his ex-girlfriends are attacking "I want my husband back!" <br /> <br /> What a great hangman movie! This is with the winners of all the henchmen movies up there! <br /> <br /> 9/10
