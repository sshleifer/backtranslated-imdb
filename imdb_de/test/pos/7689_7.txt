I recently had the privilege of watching the last 35mm, Technicolor and stereo print, and found it much more vivid and touching than thought. Also closer to the original material - in essence, the scriptwriter N. Richard Nash was anything but reconstructed, much recitative-changed to spoken dialogues, and one or two transitional scenes inserted (including a very funny scene for Pearl Bailey). Oliver Smith's production design is in the 50s adaptation mode "Li'l Abner" - "Guys and Dolls" stagy, but it works well for the folkloric, unrealistic quality of this work. Although stereotyping and racism are present, they are not decreasing. It is quite open to a film of its time - the adultery, violent behavior, drug use, and self-destructive habits of the people of Catfish Row are not minimized in this regard. However, there are direct debits that begin with all the deviations from the stage text. Losing so much compromise makes Gershwin shine - no wonder the family does not like it. The revival, especially of the material of Sammy Davis Jr., is amazingly trendy and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, people. you did not have to deal with it that much. And while Poitier and Dandridge behave well and sing their vocal double well, there is a big gap between the singing and talking voices of the characters - they are constantly aware of the artistry. What really matters here is, of course, the music that is one of the greatest ever written for the theater. Despite the crafting, it survives, and one would have to be made of stone so as not to be moved. If the treatment is not (and should not be) the taste of the property, there is still no reason not to spend any money restoring those ambitious recordings of Gershwin's masterpiece and sensitizing new generations to his genius.
