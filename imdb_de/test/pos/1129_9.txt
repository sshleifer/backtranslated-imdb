I've seen two episodes so far, I really like it. Although I am no longer in college, I miss the wonderful college life. I wish I had spent some more time socializing. I somehow identify myself with rusty. When I spent a brotherhood, my big brother was not at all like Cappie, I wish I had a big brother like him. So if a show like this can make people identify with the characters, it's a pretty good show. <br /> <br /> It's more realistic than an American pie with less explicit sex jokes. Can we call that a younger version of "desperate wives"? Some of the authors themselves must be Greeks, history seems to reflect something of the real life of the Brotherhood and the student body. It was shot in high definition. And they actually filmed outside and not in studios. The picture quality is very good. You could easily make this a good movie. Unlike a movie, which can only take a few hours, I can have about 45 minutes of fun watching it on television weekly for free. <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, the actors are about the same age, and they are new and fresh, that makes them more real. This show is about everyone. There are also Asian and black guys and student girls on the show. It's almost shocking that they had a little story about two brothers in the Brotherhood who had sex in the first episode, and then tried to connect in the second episode. I do not think I've ever seen anything like that on TV. This show somehow reminded me of a TV show titled "Young Americans" by Warner Bro, which was canceled in early 2001. In this show, a girl dressing like a man kissed a man, and this guy believed she was a homosexual. <br /> <br /> Greek life can be fun, but at the same time students need to learn for exams, etc . By the time people actually have some free time in their lives, there is no brotherhood left for students. I do not know how long this show will take. Sooner or later, these people will have to go to college. Maybe you'll find some new actors for another 4 years of college life fun!
