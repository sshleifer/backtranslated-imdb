Italian soft X-Exorcist clone. <br /> <br /> Woman buy statue of the crucified thief. The thief comes to life and turns out to be the devil with rape fantasies. <br /> <br /> Ivan Rassimov plays the devil brilliantly. Mostly because of his gift of bad looks. And because he was never about nudity. Good for him. <br /> <br /> The leading actress has done a good job. Her wide-open innocence and the fact that she looked great naked helped. <br /> <br /> This has a similar plot to most Italian horror films. The girl's parents are dirty and spoiled. Look at it for the details. <br /> <br /> Laura Gemser's husband, Gabriel Tinti, also appears as a random stud. His part is basically called by phone, but like a cheap beer, it has done the job. This could have been a horror / sex classic.
