A quick look at the premise of this movie suggests that it's just another stupid inbreeding / backwoods hit of the 80's. the guy where sex is like death and the actors are all annoying clich√©s that you really want to die for. However, "JBD" provides significantly more. <br /> <br /> Instead of focusing on bare flesh and blood (though there is something of everyone - no sex), the film focuses on providing impending tension / growing tension in the midst of suspense - a beautiful scenic backdrop. These feelings are reinforced by a cast of realistically sympathetic characters and antagonists who are more amoral than the pent-up definitions of evil. Oh yes, George Kennedy is here and when is not that a good thing? <br /> <br /> If you liked "Wrong Turn," check it out to see where much of its methodology came from.
