The Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Watkins <br /> was filmed in the southern <br /> <br /> California desert with its patented faux-style documentation style, making a movie like no other. He follows two groups of prisoners (one <br /> <br /> before sentencing the other convicted persons) throughout the picture. After being tried by a military court, they have the choice of either serving a prison term or being able to take part in the punishment. <br /> <br /> Park (a grueling three-day trek through the desert with nothing but the clothes on its back) while being pursued by local law enforcement agencies that use the park as its Live action training (ground). I can not say enough about this movie. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a real documentary. This is one of the most accessible films by Peter Watkins. I advise you to pay attention. You will not regret it! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended <br /> <br /> A + <br /> <br />
