Valley Girl is the definitive movie from the 80s, in which the film is filtered with beautifully played phrases. The characters are so convincing that you forget it's a movie, not a video of an actual "day-in-the-life" high school in the US. This strip is for the 80s, which is the Brady Bunch TV series for the 70s. If you do not like it, then "gag me with a spoon".
