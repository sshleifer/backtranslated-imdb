I wish the show did not end so quickly. Although the drama is not the greatest in the world, it ends with a positive note and gives the audience morals and values. Hilary Swank did a fine job of portraying a high school student who had lost her parents. If you are not into the happy ending, this movie, like the previous 3 in the series, is not for you. On this day we live, you can not see enough about the bad guys who get what they deserve and the good guys who are at the top. The Bible teaches that good will always triumph over evil. That's exactly what happens in this case. It's a great family movie. Please see it if you do not already have it.
