Warm-hearted flick that portrays the Archangel Michael as a cocky, overweight, smoking cigarette smoker who loves to dance and frolic with the opposite sex. He does, however, have a good side, as he endeavors to put the situation of some burnt-out losers back in order before being called back to heaven. Funny, well-played movie; very enjoyable, if a bit disrespectful.
