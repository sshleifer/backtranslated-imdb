If you loved the cyborg movie "Nemesis" (Erotic, Science Fiction) of 1993, you will love this movie. I loved it when the Elvis Pompadoured hero pulled out a samurai sword during a shooting. Like "Nemesis", it takes place in a post-apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police killers, in which the well-armed hero must deploy well-armed rebels to solve a power plot against the unwashed masses. But here the similarities end. The ambiguous mayor tries to calm the masses with the drugs he sells. Supported by mercenaries and a cyborg, the rebels try to stifle their suffocating grip on their subjects. After several unsuccessful attempts to bring the rebels back, he sends his best policeman to assassinate the rebels. This movie follows in the footsteps of most action adventures, but is not afraid to paint outside the line.
