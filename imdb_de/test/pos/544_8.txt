This film is considered one of the outdated dramas of the last few years that Hollywood has handed down to us. This film is characterized by the fact that others have failed completely (especially given the most underrated performance in Natalie Portman's most recent dramatic character) unanimously driven by the chemistry shared by both Susan and Natalie. They seem so natural during the movie that they would be confused with a real family. They go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in history that it's hard not to grasp their acting skills. I have the feeling that the talented performances of these two actors have picked up where the story was missing and were almost too familiar (full of clich√©s), and really saved the ordeal. I would recommend this movie especially to those who like one of the two actresses or such superlative dramas.
