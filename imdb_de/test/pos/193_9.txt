As if in a circle, the film leads back to the starting point, the image of the cranes crossing a sky of Moscow. You represent the freedom to live your life according to your wishes in order to achieve the greatest possible fulfillment. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Veronica and Boris have such a promise of happiness, and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in amusement. It seems they can live their dreams. <br /> <br /> But man is not a bird. Life sets its own rules that no human can escape and that we can not change - not even by the highest efforts. The war breaks out and Boris unhesitatingly announces himself at the front to fulfill his patriotic duty. He can not even say goodbye to Veronica, because she arrives late at the rally point where the soldiers are sent away. Surrounded by a jubilant crowd, all their attempts to attract Boris's attention must inevitably fail. <br /> <br /> Boris is finally killed in the war without Veronica finding out about it at the moment. His brother Mark, a powerful musician, who has achieved liberation from military service through corruption, is anxious to take his place. Veronica initially refuses, but on a terrible night of bombing, she eventually falls prey to his charm. A marriage takes place that is never accepted by the family. Veronica soon feels guilty and realizes that Boris' return is the only thing she really yearns for. It therefore alleviates her guilty conscience and despair by the sacrificial work in a field hospital. When the war is finally over, a crowd of enthusiastic people gather again to cheer for the victorious soldiers. Again Veronica is among them, forcing herself through a body wall. In her hand she carries a bouquet of flowers, until she finally has to give it to strangers, because one of the returnees has just raised their hopes by confirming the sad certainty of Boris' death. <br /> <br /> Again the cranes penetrate into the sky and draw their wayward lines. But now Veronica is watching her alone and the look in her eyes looks different. She had to accept the impossibility of living according to preconceived plans, following the guidelines of her dreams. For all humans are nothing but helpless puppets, which hang on inscrutable threads. <br /> <br />
