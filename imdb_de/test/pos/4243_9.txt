The bride of Chucky starts late at night when officer Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) sneaks into the evidence room of his police station and steals the remains of the Chucky doll from all the horror movies in joke props, the serial killer Charles Lee Ray long ago owned in the original Children's Game (1988). He drives the remains into a remote area where Ray's ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) slashes Bailey's throat and brings the remains back to her trailer. There, Tiffany & Chaples (voiced by Brad Dourif) rejoins and uses a "Voodoo for Dummies" book to bring him back to murderous life. Things are not going the way Tiffany had hoped, and Chucky does not turn out to be the man of their dreams, so she locks him in a game holder where Chucky is less fortunate. While Tiffany takes a bath, Chucky escapes, suffers an electric shock and brings her back to life in the form of a female bride. They do not want to be stuck in plastic bodies and have to work together to get to a New Jersey cemetery where Ray's natural body was buried with the amulet needed to turn her mind back into human bodies. The corpses of Tiffany's neighbor Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), both escaping Jade's corrupt uncle Chief of Police Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), are going to be fine ... <br /> <br / > Director: Ronny Yu I love the bride of Chucky. The screenplay by Don Mancini is fun, fast, entertaining and contains many other horror films with good affection. From the opening sequence, in which we see the ice hockey mask Jason Voorhees from the films of Friday the 13th films, Freddy Krueger's razor blade glove from the series A Nightmare on Elm Street and the mask of Michael Myers from the Halloween franchise. To Bride of Frankenstein's (1935) clips, when they re-enact virtually the same scene. The bride of Chucky never takes seriously, which is good. There are many one-liners, self-directed gags that Scream (1996) had a few years ago. There does not seem to be any fear of making fun of the horror genre. In general. I love the scene where Jesse & Jade perform a clich√©d, romantic conversation that Chucky hears and he makes weird derogatory comments and gestures. That does not mean that there is no damn good movie there, because it is safest. Director Yu manages to create a good atmosphere and create a real sense of fun. Both human and plastic character phrases are sympathetic and glittering, as each couple suffers from its own domestic problems that would obviously cause the trail of the bodies they leave behind. Technically, the bride of Chucky is for the most part great and has the big budget, and at about $ 25,000,000 I should hope so. The only thing I want to say is that some of the puppet effects of Kevin Yagher are a bit stiff and unconvincing. I also can not remember CGI scenes in Bride of Chucky. Fortunately, the film does not neglect the blood and the blood with a cool, slit neck. In a tribute to Hellraiser (1987), nails were struck in someone's face, people were impaled on glass splinters, someone was bloodily wiped out by a huge truck, a ripped-off human lip piercing & various stitches & shots. The acting is pretty good and Dourif, as Chucky is very funny when he launches the two liners. I also like the scenes with Tiffany at the beginning and find her very sexy when she wears all those fetish clothes. I can not be the only one? Personally, I think Bride of Chucky is a fantastic movie, total entertainment from start to finish, great humor and horror alike, and at only 85 minutes in length it never gets boring or boring. A personal favorite of mine, check it out as soon as possible!
