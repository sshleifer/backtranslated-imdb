I have enjoyed this movie since my childhood and still do it. I always liked Batman back then, but the real difference is that this movie was not dated when I grew up. I noticed some scenes in this movie that did not make sense, like 'Hhmm ... the crowd is angry. Hello! Where did you get these tomatoes from? Then I thought: Who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway! "<br /> <br /> The original by Tim Burton Batman was also great, but in some places it was a bit cheesy and I did not like all the actors. This film improved in almost every way with a wonderful cast, a more Gothic style and no involvement from Prince. <br /> <br /> Today, many fans of Christopher Nolan Burton's films do not like them because they claim the Nolan films are more serious and therefore loyal to comics. I do not think this is completely true: - There has never been an adaptation of the original concept of Batman, a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. Batman has taken many forms over the years and seen his stupidity in the 60s (and a bit with Batman & Robin). A director can freely choose what kind of Batman he should represent, as long as he is good. <br /> <br /> My opinion: Batman does not have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointed ears. Burton has managed to strike a perfect balance between the stupidity and the darkness that surrounds the whole idea. <br /> <br /> I have recently watched the Nolan movies and I love them too (especially The Dark Knight). There's just something about this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character more depth, seeking an explanation for almost every aspect of Batman. That's too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of Batman. The Burton films are more theatrical and focus on the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> My conclusion is that you should not compare Nolan with the Burton movies. They are just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. My respect goes to both directors.
