I am a 20 year old guy from England. I do not cry for movies. But that moved me. I cried like a girl! This is absolutely the most moving movie I've ever seen, though the story was questionable. Joseph Mazello's small face as he dreamed to cry made me sob each time. How could anyone hurt such a cute looking kid? I'm going to cry now, just thinking about it! Remarkable.
