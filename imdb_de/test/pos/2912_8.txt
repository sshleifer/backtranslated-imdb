If this movie works right, it will be right. And if it goes wrong ... I would say that a third of the movie is great. I can even isolate the bad piece. It's all about romance. Everything you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes, but it takes about 30 minutes. I would recommend skipping this section if you can. It does not do anything other than explain his exile. It should have been a small plot point that was quickly pushed aside. Fortunately, the period of about 0-30 and 1: 00-2: 19 (The End) is excellent. <br /> <br /> There are a number of great achievements and just as many horrible ones in this film. Just like everything else in this movie, the play is either perfect or terrible. Peter Ustinov as slimy one-eyed slave Kaptah is perfect. It is one of his best achievements, with his role in Spartacus. Victor Mature as an ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Again one of his best roles. Jean Simmons is wasted as Merit, the perfect girl in love with our hero John Carradine gives a nice supporting role as a philosophical grave robber. and Michael Wilding is honored as Akhnaton, the idealistic pharaoh who seeks to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt, only to see it fall apart because of his unwillingness to fight. Now for the bad. Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is sadly wrong. This is doubly regrettable because he is the main character. The entire movie revolves around him. He's actually pretty good as the disillusioned exile and the wise old man. This is because of his painfully limited range. He does not seem to put passion into his words. This is especially evident during love scenes, which are impractical. He spends the last half of the film as an old man, a feat in which he is decent enough. He has the perfect voice for the character. The less said about Bella Darvi as Nefer, the treacherous Babylonian woman, the better. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets are great. This is the only film that I know to try to portray life in Egypt that is not overshadowed by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the 14th century BC. that is even before Exodus. The only monotheists are the pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers. In most epics, there is the same strong element of religious zeal, but it is done differently and shows up only at the end. An interesting note: Akhenaten, followed by Horemheb as Pharaoh, skipped the most famous pharaoh ever: Tutankhamun. It seems a strange thing to use the name to increase awareness of the movie. Attention: This is an epic movie from the 50s. If you do not like these kinds of things, do not expect that thing to be different. It's different, but it's still an epic. I appreciate this movie and I appreciate what he did and what he tried. This is a movie that should be remembered better than it is.
