Fire at the Kon Ichikawa-led plain, written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada, is a WWII film that does not show how the Allies fight the Axis powers, but the Japanese who are fighting for their lives in the Philippines and fight. The name of the main characters is Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier who leaves his regiment because he is ill. He has only a hand grenade, his weapon and some potatoes. So he tries to get to the hospital to get a doctor and get a cure for his illness. But since the hospital rejected and destroyed him, he starts a long walk. Throughout the film, Tamura remains a little cowardly, but very polite, as the other soldiers become more animalistic, using their basic instincts to survive. Tamura still remains a human and would not break down. One scene that has greatly influenced me to think positively and differently about this war movie is when Tamura arrives in a totally deserted Phillipino village. There he fights with a dog and finds many bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of a church. This makes Tamura think and be even more scared than he already is. This shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine, but above all a servant to higher beings and humans. After turning away from the corpses, two Phillipinos (one couple or brother and sister: very close relationship) return to the village to retrieve their salt stock. The main character of the film wants to be friendly at first, although he approached her with his gun, but the woman shoots as soon as she starts screaming. Her brother / boyfriend / husband then runs away in fear and after a moment Tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing Filipino. He does not hit him. After Tamura has picked up the salt bag, something very precious, he drops his weapon into a river. This gesture is very important to understand the profile of Tamura and the war of Kon Ichikawa / Shohei Ooka. If you compare this movie with other World War II films, it is not typical at all. Of course, all the films have suffering heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. He expresses everything that is human: he is manipulated, he is weak, he is afraid, he has hope. This is typical of Japanese films from World War II and Japanese society. Since World War II is not an issue in Japanese society, it is likely that Japanese will play the role of victim during World War II. This harassment is also very visual in this film. One example is Tamura, another is the piled-up bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church, and another important case is when Japanese soldiers try to cross a street and the Americans are already waiting for them and all shoot Japanese soldiers, who have worse equipment and are poorly fed and have no health equipment or anything like that. In my personal conclusion, I have to say that it's worth watching this movie to finally see a movie from the other side than usual. There is no nationalist propaganda that could easily be installed. When you have fully seen the film, you can see the horrors of World War II in full.
