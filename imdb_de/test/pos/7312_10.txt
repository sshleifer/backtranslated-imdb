A rich old lady asks for a flirtatious divorce to win over a Lothario from her soon-to-be-married granddaughter. <br /> <br /> LET US BE GAY is an interesting little domestic comedy with a harsh dialogue (Courtesy of famed scriptwriter Frances Marion & Good Performances.) While this may be a bit dirty at times, this may likely be due to the difficulties to be traced back to the early sound technology that tended to limit action and movement Norma Shearer is more likely to prefer this little movie She used her undisputed influence as a spouse of Irving Thalberg to insist only on pictures of A-Grade She is particularly effective in her first scenes, which are almost unrecognizable by the grubby, flat makeup, and her extreme transgogation from goose to swan could only happen in Hollywood, but it's hardly profitable to spend a lot of time herself worry about it. <br/> <br /> Rod LaRocque is not very well suited as an avid husband of Shearer very popular with him, the conversations were not very friendly to him and his career would suffer. Here his role is not exactly sympathetic, and one must ask oneself which masochistic impulse induce women to desire the Kad so much. <br /> <br /> Magnificent Marie Dressler is available as an eccentric Long Island Dowager. As a great friend of Frances Marion, it is easy to imagine that the part was written expressly for her. She is full of cranks and crotchets and is very humorous. However, the tremendous warmth and essential goodness that would soon be Hollywood's biggest star is largely absent. <br /> <br /> Among the side actors is Hedda Hopper as a sloppy social snake, and Wilfred Noy plays a cartoon servant. Filmmates will see little Dickie Moore as Shearer's son and older Mary Gordon as housekeeper, both uncredited.
