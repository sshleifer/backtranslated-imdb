It's interesting that someone compared the "fifth rocket" to the Star Trek episode. It should be noted that the original episode of Star Trek TV, in which the crew of the Enterprise experiences a space delusion while orbiting the planet Si 2000, is titled "The Naked Time" and not "Naked Now". The "Naked Now" refers to the first regular episode of Star Trek's The Next Generation, in which the Enterprise-D encounters a research vessel. This episode, however, refers to the original series "Naked Time" and is based on this. <br /> <br /> Now to the Firth Missile. While crew responses in the Star Trek episodes were due to an alcohol-poisoning reaction, the condition of the crew aboard the Montana was caused by a far more serious situation, namely the paint fumes emitted by the faulty splashboard surface. There are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than under a crew that has as heavy a task as a crew in a submarine with ballistic missiles, and that of course makes the movie exciting and such a thriller. The plot is very credible. At the same time, this movie, along with "Crimson Tide," "The Day After," "By Dawn's Early Light," "The Hunt for the Red October," "Ice Station Zebra," and many other similar films give us much insight, how easily things could go wrong and how easy it could be for an atomic holocaust. Fortunately, such an event did not occur, and (God willing) such an event will not take place.
