Allegedly, Hans' isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically cold, middle-class mother, a nagging wife and the rejection of a lover. And despite the complex presentation - Hans himself does not exactly make this claim - the above must also be an integral part of Fassbinder's thinking (his use of Freud and Marx). The onlooker, however, can not look further than Hans's sex and sexism to find the true cause of his crushed mind. First, it is highly unlikely that the lack of love of his mother caused him to report to the stranger Legion. It was far more likely, and in part, to indicate that it was a quest for adventure, male camaraderie, and masculine identity itself-both the Legion and the War offered. <BR /> <br /> Secondly, Hans loses his successful job as a police officer because of his own sexism. By falling in love with the work of a prostitute, he not only stamps out prostitution as an oppressive institution, but also shows that he can not even control his sexuality in a professional arena - and is even willing to jeopardize a desirable career. Thirdly, he commits severe verbal abuse against his wife in front of his sheep-like male buddies and makes no distinction at all between their absence and, if they seek it, their presence. In fact, he is more brutal in his presence. A few hours later, in a violent and drunken state, he beats his wife in front of her daughter, who intervenes for her mother. The horror he gives her and his daughter is palpable. But both he - and the audience - move without a conscience or protest. Why? Because his wife is cruelly called nagging and sexually promiscuous (this may be Fassbinder's view of what capitalism does to women - possessed of unsafe, unsafe goods and a commodity), but that does not relieve Hans's brutality or Fassbinder's exploitation of her wife the battery scene). <br /> <br /> And then there is this male roller print that Hans could refuse and protest but accept instead. He is too short for a man and too unheroic to achieve the worldly success that the male role advocates. But how can these causes of despair be when he not only earns his lost love as a mistress, but marries a great woman far more attractive than himself? Finally, Hans, his wartime comrade, allows his wife's persuasiveness to persuade her to continue in her house. By making this decision, he not only makes it clear that he is more attached to Harry than to his wife, but that the male bond replaces his love for women. And in the end, he represses his own life, for it is Harry's superior competence and spirit around the house that drops Hans's star. Hans, the merchant, may be to some extent the victim of capitalism, but the more he is the victim of his own attachment to his male identity. His inability to let go is the ultimate reason for his isolation and despair. <br /> <br /> This is something I think, not only with Fassbinder, but also with Hans's sister Anna - though - only lost to a degree. For Anna's (and Fassbinder's) support of her brother - her mother only goes so far. She insists that only he can save himself - that her support and love can not end it herself. Unfortunately, she does not offer his wife the same support and love that needs to be much more fierce than Hans, who can ultimately pick up the pieces and rescue herself and her daughter to make a clear contrast to Han
