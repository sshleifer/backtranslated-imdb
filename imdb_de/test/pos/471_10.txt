This was a fantastic movie about two people, a young teenager, and the other, a middle-aged man, both looking for someone to help them fill a void of their former relatives. <br /> <br /> Both actors perform brilliant performances that different audiences can relate to. Although the script was written by Gorman Bechard, it seems that it was written from the point of view of a woman. At the same time, men can refer to the male characters because they were developed and described in the film. The end of the film has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that left you speechless. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one. It is clear that you are not alone in this movie.
