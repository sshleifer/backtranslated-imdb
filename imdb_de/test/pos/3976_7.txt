I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was positively surprised. The plot is a little outlandish, but everyone involved in the movie has made a pleasant movie that is good for many laughs. The writing and the jokes are much more legible than I expected. Better yet, they are accomplished by unknown actors, who all do a good job. <br /> <br /> The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long comes from "Ed" and the new Apple computer displays. He had just appeared as an actor in "Ed," and he was excellent here. He is a natural in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who does not hit. He's in "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central about every two weeks, but he's really good at HBO's "Red, White, and Screwed." I catch him regularly in the uncensored comedy channel of XM Radio. Give Black an idea and let him improvise. Whether his sayings and lines are scribbled or improvised, does not matter. He is priceless when he expresses his thoughts about the fear of the middle class. A matter of Black's delivery, his hand gestures are not those of a comedian. It seems like he is having a conversation with you, and I think that makes him unconsciously more effective.
