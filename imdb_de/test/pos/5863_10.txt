This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror. It has everything you could ask for ... excitement, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, Native Americans, brain eating ... If you're looking for the ultimate end to all brainsucking movies, look no further. The story of a man who is seeking revenge. And how can you get it better? "I know, I will suck her brain!" With great sound effects and impressive special effects, I can not recommend this movie enough.
