A surprisingly well-made, well-written movie about hard rock, but a decent young man getting this coveted ticket for the star: his favorite Heavy Metal band wants him to replace their vocalist. Not far-fetched, the film tries to keep things in perspective and does not go too far; It will certainly make you think twice about these youthful fantasies, whether you are in the music business. Despite the solid dialogue, the script follows a proven, formulaic pattern and is jammed in the last act by its own stereotypes. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fleece ball "Almost Famous". His heavy metal decadence has a nice, bitter accent, but a stronger finish might have made it more memorable. ** 1/2 of ****
