I went into "Night of the Hunted" and did not know what to expect. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> It's basically a mystery / thriller where this girl, who can not remember anything, is "saved" by a man who happens to drive by. The two become fast friends and lovers and try to find out what's going on with them. With some vague flashbacks and grim memories, they finally get to the bottom of the game and the end is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I really liked the scenery of this movie: a deserted, postmodern Paris is the background with a lot of gray skies and tall buildings. Very big city. Groovy soundtrack and a lot of nudity. <br /> <br /> It was surprisingly made in 1980; seems to be ahead of the times. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
