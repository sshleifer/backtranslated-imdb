The 1973 released version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful and coolest musical film of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about the legendary SHANGRI-LA! is a special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mix of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. The difference is that it is the ONLY musical fantasy of war ever to be filmed. <br /> <br /> This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money abroad. Only in America did it fail. Very different and unique in his approach to a film musical, it deserves far more recognition than it is given. As a story, LOST HORIZON is an incredible adventure, and both the 1937 Frank Capra movie and the 1973 musical are faithful adaptations to the James Hilton novel. What I like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the music numbers are presented. The film has a prestigious cast and a talented director and cameraman. This is a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it is a wonderful place. Songs like THE WORLD IS A CIRCLE, SHARE THE JOY OF LIVING TOGETHER, GROWING TOGETHER, call forth a bliss Hilton wrote in his novel. Why should not Shangri-La be a little stupid? The two love songs, I could revive him and the deleted I COME TO YOU - are the sensitive parts in the picture. Both songs have a peaceful and quietly spoken quality, which is very much in keeping with the philosophy of the story. THE THINGS I WANT NOT MISS is a good duet with a strong melody. It's a nice exchange of perspectives, and who can complain to Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman when they stomp on tables, sing and dance? They are a wonderful team and the number is well staged. <br /> <br /> I've always found it interesting in this story as the High Lama abducts someone from the outside world to take their place in Shangri-La. The character of the High Lama is a gentle soul, but in his view of humankind as a whole something radical. He has no hope for the world outside of Shangri-La. If this film were to be redone today, it would be interesting to see that the main character, the conflict of RICHARD ONWAY with what he has left in the outside world, is emphasized more than compared to what he in Shangri-La In order to make the film credible, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must end up being portrayed as suffering amnesia, just as he was in the book. None of the movie versions of LOST HORIZON was faithful to the novel in this regard. Did Conway find Shangri-La or was it introduced? Did they all die in the plane crash? Every man has his own idea of ​​what his Shangri-La would look like. The conflict with Conway, who believes in Shangri-La and wants to return to his old life in the outside world, is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy, and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interesting, as Conway does not want to leave paradise, but is displaced by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both can challenge James Hilton's ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. In a sense, therefore, it is anti-capitalism in its theme where money and materialism are not the motivation. Human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and harmonious living together are the rule. <br /> <br /> LOST HORIZON has a much stronger history than most musicals. It tries to answer the basic questions of life, and you can hardly blame it for not succeeding. It should be remembered that LOST HORIZON was 1973 CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for jaded critics. The expectations were high, almost unreasonable. There were two objectives to be met, the producers ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH. The critics wanted to get both. Ross Hunter had decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow up to his blockbuster AIRPORT of 1970. Until then, this film was the biggest donor to Universals, and the success of this image sparked a decade of disaster films. AIRPORT has been the most watched movie ever seen on television for years. It has been nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. At the time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the country's most successful songwriters. The blatant sentimentality of LOST HORIZON had little chance after the collapse of censorship in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODPATHER. Sex and violence were a new frontier in the late 1960s. At the beginning of the 1970s, viewers flocked to movies with content that they could not see on screen. Elaborate musicals were no longer well received, no matter how well they were made. Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. It's the ultimate escapism movie with a strong history, wonderful music, an expensive budget and a little quirky humor. It is unconventional in the sense that the music is introduced only 45 minutes after the beginning of the film. In the middle of the course changes when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly movie that deserves to be rediscovered. A lost and legendary treasure that earns far more than its reputation.
