I saw this movie with my mother in September. I expected a good movie and I saw a great one. This is now my most appreciated movie. It did not leave me after I left the theater. The situations in this film reminded me of my deceased grandmother. Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger were just as incredible. This film has shown me how important family relationships are. Rent it. I can not recommend it enough.
