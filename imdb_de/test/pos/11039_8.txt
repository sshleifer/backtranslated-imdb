This short was the first short film released by Paramount Famous Studios, and was one of several that the studio performed. Popeye showed up directly against the enemy, mostly the Japanese. While Warner Brothers, Disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios made short films depicting Germans as films, most of Famous Studios' efforts focused on the Japanese. Given the naval ties of Pearl Harbor and Popeye, this is understandable. This is an average short. Seein 'Red, White and Blue' and Spinat For Britain have aged better. But it's still worth watching. Recommended.
