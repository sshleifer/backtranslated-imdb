Radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt in his heart was right. The viewer has to wonder what he or she would have done. The difficulties that faced Jones and Radio were both tragic and predictable. People did not understand it; They also did not want to understand. But in the end, the power of circumstances forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they had done before. Radio is a mentally handicapped teenager who understands very little. Apart from three of the most important things that are too often forgotten during maturation: intuition, compassion and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who can not ignore the plight of the underdog, who just tries to play a bad map hand in the best way he knows. It was sad how coaches Jones and Radio met. The practical joke that frightened life outside the radio was enough to severely punish not only the boys involved, but all the boys who knew what was going on and did nothing. However, on the positive side of the scale, the incident led to a friendship that would affect as many lives as most of us believe they only appear in the movies. This movie is a real fairy tale and should not be missed. Ed Harris was his usual brilliance. Gooding was impeccable. Radio is an inspiration.
