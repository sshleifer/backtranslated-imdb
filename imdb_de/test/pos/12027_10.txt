I laughed my ass for an hour. I had no idea who Dan Finneity was. Why have I never heard of Dan Finnerty? He is hysterical as well as his backup singer. They make all these women's songs so that we never want to hear a new experience. They blow these songs away. That was on Bravo last night. Why is not this Dan so "ultra famous"? Great voice! Charisma to burn! He blew me away with this show! I just read on the internet that he once was a member of "Stomp". I think there is nothing he can not do. I saw "stomp" years ago at a UCLA theater, and these people were amazing. This show was made by Dreamworks last night! Does that mean Spielberg did that? Why do not you play this Dan Finnerty in a movie? There was a standing ovation at the end of the show, and every time the camera came to the audience, everyone was so excited, singing or dancing. The whole show had this amazing energy. My only complaint was that it did not take much longer, but looking back, when you see how much energy these guys consume, it would probably be impossible for a person to play for over an hour with so much fun. Man, I loved this show!
