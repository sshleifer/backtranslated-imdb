If you exclude the rigid historical perspective, this movie is actually very entertaining. It has action, adventure and romance and one of the best cast members of this era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As you can see on this panel, the picture is not punished by purists who pay close attention to the accuracy of their storytelling. To get beyond that, you just have to put the history book aside and enjoy the story as if it were a fiction. I know, I know, this is hard to do considering Custer's recent stalemate at the Little Big Horn, and its importance in the history of the American Civil War after the Civil War. I suspect there is an unsolved problem with the image, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to see here, although the picture has more than two hours plus runtime. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first scratch to fully rake. Sharp's practical joke (Arthur Kennedy), who pitched him at the major's headquarters, probably would have put them both in trouble. Ironically, this military film features many scenes for the comedy, such as Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon and subsequent encounters, including tea-teller Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I had not noticed it in other films before, but McDaniel reminded me of one of my favorite actor from the 1940s, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it looked like Moreland had hammered in a dress. Against this background, the owl scene was a shout. <br /> <br /> As far as Flynn is concerned, it is interesting to note that a year earlier he had J.E.B. Stuart vs. Ronald Reagan's portrayal of General Custer in the Santa Fe Trail, both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In this film, Reagan has not put any of arrogance and flamboyance in the character of Custer, which the story remembers, while in Flynn's portrayal here's more than obvious. But it does not come close to Richard Mulligan's attitude to the military heroes of the "Little Big Man" of the 1970s. Let's just say, you were a bit over the top. <br /> <br /> The better picture for me was the way in which Custer insisted on maintaining his good name and not daring to risk gambling. That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle and the discipline he developed throughout history. Worst of all was the final confrontation with archrival Sharp just before he'd ridden into the Little Big Horn, declaring that hell or fame was completely dependent on his own point of view. Previously, a similar remark might have given us the best insight into Custer's character when he said, "You take fame when it's time to leave."
