It was wonderful. As a librarian and participant of the New York Library Association's Vitality Fund event on Thursday evening, October 18, I had the privilege of seeing an advance screening of the new film The Kite Runner. The release of the film was delayed due to concern for the welfare of the involved children actors. I am grateful that the NYLA event was allowed to continue as planned. <br /> <br /> As far as the film is concerned, I feel it was done masterfully. I think that had just as much impact on me as Stanley Kubrik's A Clockwork Orange, though it's less graphic - MUCH less. There is no comparison between the terrible, shocking violence and rape shown in A Clockwork Orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in Kite Runner. Only the subject and the implications for the human psyche are comparable. (I've written more details on violence and child rape and how it was treated on my MySpace blog.) My overall impression was that this movie was fantastic; one of the best movies i have ever seen. The depiction of Afghan boys climbing their kites showed some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most people in the world. The theme is extremely serious, and the film brings the emotions of the audience into the subject, without many "Hollywood touches" that have ruined other films. Although the overturned wagon of pomegranates (for me) was an obvious symbolism. <br /> <br /> Finally I have to mention the excellence of the soundtrack. The recitations of the poet boy of Rumi as two main characters fleeing the country during the Russian invasion - under terrifying circumstances - really showed the power of these poems. I ask all viewers to ignore the subtitles in this scene, as far as possible, and just hear the beauty of the language. I do not even know in which language Amir quotes whether his normal Persian Dari dialect corresponds to Rumi's original Persian dialect. Please also note the sound that you hear when a kite string is cut. I found it a deep, distinctive sound, though the librarians who were with me did not notice it at all. I can not help but wonder if kites actually sound like they are "cut" or if they give a sense of the vibration / noise the hang glider experiences during the competition.
