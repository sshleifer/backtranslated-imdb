This was a romantic, simple funny movie. I really enjoyed it and would definitely say to see it and enjoy it. Will Smith was funny, dumb, nervous, sweet and just a simple guy hit by Love. It was cute to see him fall for someone and to be so nervous and lost, what he should do or say. It was great. He was great and funny as always. Eva Mendes was better than I expected, she would be fine. I thought there were moments in the movie where Will got the shaft, he did all he could to be a good guy and still be treated badly. The end was romantic and happy and it was great. I have seen it several times and would like to take another look at it. A funny movie, something you can not see much about. It had the old time with a fresh new look.
