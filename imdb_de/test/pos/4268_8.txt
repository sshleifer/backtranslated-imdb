I liked the end of this movie very much - I really felt what the characters must have felt, which in my opinion is a sign of good direction. I was thrilled to see the record store refill - a great character development there, though his "role" is likely to be considered insignificant. <br /> <br /> I was also impressed, while he was dark in his subject, he was free from unfounded nudity, obscenity and violence. Sadness, sexuality and darkness can all (often better) be communicated through the unsaid, but it seems that this is often unique only to "classic" films and actors. A big compliment to the filmmaker for that.
