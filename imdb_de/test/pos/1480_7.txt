All reviewers make a big mistake. This movie should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> Designed for kids and teens in the late '80s or early' 90s, it was a true movie of its time. If you hated that time or loved the first movie so much that you can not even make a joke about it, then that's garbage, but only because it was not meant for you. The low budget here and the failure of the Beastmaster 1 at the box office (under four million on a nine million budget) were obviously the reasons to reject the seriousness of the original and to put into the present. You can complain about the story, the dialogue or the logic, but this was again designed to win races, not to win races. If the movie had tried to take itself seriously, it would be a total failure, but it does not do it for a second (in "our" world, Dar sees a movie starring The Beastmaster 2 enough). To describe Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry movies: This movie knows its limits. It is more of a comedy / parody than an ordinary adventure. Soundtrack (for the time) was great too. Actors are not so serious, so that even the most irritating "spoiled rich brat" (played here very well by the young Kari Wuhrer) performs well. <br /> <br /> So, if you're nostalgic for the (cheese) culture of the 80s / 90s, or if you liked the first part and you do not mind going out on a cheese limb, then you have a lot of fun with it this attempt to revive Dar in the 90s (literary). This is not really the successor of the first, and do not watch if you want to. It's rather a "what if" fantasy sequel. <br /> <br /> As for the question "why different dimensions and not just other times": When we had the big winged humanoid creatures in the story that absorb the lightning bones (from the end of Part 1)? Incidentally, the film ends in the zoo, because a cheap (monetary) grand finale was tried. It is believed that dar is the best place to show all his movements (he is the animal manipulator).
