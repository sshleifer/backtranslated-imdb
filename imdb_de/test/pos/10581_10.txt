Haggard: The Movie is the true life story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend, who cheated on him, even with the help of his two friends: 1. A skateboarder who does not live for anything and 2. A funny scientist (who does not really work) played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo. <br /> <br /> The movie Haggard The Movie also has many characters from Jackass etc, but to say that he was written by Bam Margera and Co. This is a very weak attempt, it seems to me like that It would have been written when he was bored or as a project that did not attract much attention. <br /> <br /> The films also stars Bams girlfriend Jennifer Rivell, who plays Glauren, Ryan's girlfriend, who basically cheated on him, again a very bad acting by Jennifer. Another actor that some people might be interested in is Steve aka Hellboy, played by RakeYohn, who does not feature his character. With the story, again bad acting, this character does not really have many lines in this movie, which basically bothers him is very boring. But worst of all is Raab's character. The voice sounds like a smoker who basically has cervical cancer. I think he could have been improved! Overall, I think that the characters in this film are not in the story, as in a scene, it would be a specific person, a minute later another scene, another character. <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be a film, a kind of documentary that is not played by the characters as a documentary, acting makes you think that it is a cheap attempt to make a movie with your free time to turn. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie we lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn, although much attention is focused on Bam and Brandon. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is OK when you laugh at things. These are not funny, stupid stunts, horrible drama and occasional nude scenes! I also think that there are too many scenes in which one just does not speak and only music! 10.7
