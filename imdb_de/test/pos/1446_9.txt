Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict who returns to his Chicago neighborhood after a long stay in a clinic. He wants to stay away from the drug and find work as a drummer, but he can not help but meet his old friends. Originally, he was not arrested for drug abuse, but because he was caught in the illegal poker game. His poker credentials have earned him the nickname "The Man with the Golden Arm," and the men running the game, one of which is his former heroin connection, want him to take care of it again. Meanwhile, Frank has to look after a woman he has injured in a car accident, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), and make up with his old girlfriend Molly (Kim Novak). The movie is great to bring us into the spiritual state of Sinatras. When he felt safe at the beginning of the film, I felt good for him. But if a promised call does not come one day, he gets into depression and goes back to the table. Later, when he finally comes to the audition, he is completely exhausted. His embarrassment, if he can not play the right tact, is devastating. He had such big dreams and the other musicians do not even give him a little bit of attention when he storms out of the room. The film moves quickly, showing Frank's drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a picture of the social message. The actors are consistently fine. Elmer Bernstein's score is one of the best of his time. The only thing I do not like about this movie is the end. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although I like the character of Zosch and Parker very much, he is very good in the film, she could have done something more to fill her backstory. The end is a bit too bad. While there is certainly pathos that will stay with the characters after the film's completion, Zosch's death ties all the loose ends a bit too neatly. Frank loves Molly and does not go to jail. Even his dealer is dead, so that at least the immediate threat has disappeared. I think in Hollywood there is always the desire to put everything together in a neat little package. It's hurting the movie a little bit, but the way it is, it's still one of the best and most mature films on drug addiction I can think of. 10.9.
