If you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes, this cartoon is not for you. But if you're interested in seeing rare wartime animations, come in! In this cartoon Popeye patrols the seas and discovers what looks like a Japanese fishing boat. The two Japanese fishermen persuade Popeye to believe that they want to sign a peace treaty. But looks can be deceiving; The fishing boat turns out to be a Japanese naval ship! What follows today is considered moral propaganda. <br /> <br /> Be warned, the Japanese portrayals in the movie are made in a nonprofit way. Remember, though, that war was going on at that time. However, I recommend this cartoon to anyone interested in the time of World War II.
