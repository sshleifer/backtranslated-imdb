Viva La Bam was one of the shows I did not expect to see before I saw her, and I never knew about it until I saw my friend looking at him. I thought Jackass was pretty funny, but the stunts were really funny and I never really came on the show. When I saw Viva La Bam for the first time, that was the opposite effect. I loved it. It had more of a TV show that many of the "reality shows" have today. I was addicted and wanted to see what new scheme they would bring up for each episode. It caught my interest until the last episode and although some of the ideas were at times imitated, it always had a newer and funnier twist. Viva La Bam is one of those shows that make you addicted, and I have not seen any other show that's quite similar.
