The opening of Imamura's masterpiece avoids mere sensations in the depiction of the unfathomably frightening events of August 6, 1945, when 90% of Hiroshima and tens of thousands of people were destroyed in a moment. Instead, Imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the cataclysm and focuses on such outstanding images as the diabolical mushroom cloud quietly running in the distance, and the black rain splattering the face of a beautiful young woman. The rest of the film tracks the effects of this incident, bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath (over 100,000 people died of radiation poisoning) to the understandable level of Yasuko's plight (Yoshiko Tanaka) and their small "community" bomb. "<br /> <br /> The survivors strive for normality and continuity, especially by trying to find a suitable marriage for Yasuko, but the imminent possibility of a radiation sickness overshadows every aspect of their lives.Yasuko's potential candidates, of course, shy away a young woman, no matter how attractive she is, who suddenly falls ill and could die, real love, when she finally appears, happens unexpectedly and ambiguously, and we wonder if love across all classes is more a sign of Yasuko's status than " Damaged goods "or for a common humanity, boldly relieved of hardships that go beyond class distinctions.The film A classically understated style enhances the effect.The understated, eloquent interiors remind us that Imamura is his assistant career of the great Ozu began Imamura's championship shows up as Beis piel in the pairwise scenes of Yasuko-bathing. The first one emphasizes her beautiful back and her beautiful legs and the second how her hair falls out. The images are almost as bookends for the trajectory of the narrative and distill their tragic essence. The documentary realism of the film is repeatedly violated for expressive purposes, perhaps especially in a scene where the troubled inner life of a shelled veteran is revealed. Both the score of the famous avant-garde composer Toru Takemitsu and the stunning black-and-white photography contribute significantly to the brooding atmosphere of the film. In the final shot, when Yaksuko's uncle (Kazuo Kitamura), the film's laconic narrator, seeks an empty rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration, the black and white image suddenly becomes so poignant that it's almost unbearable. Few films from Japan (or anywhere else) were comparable to the great humanist Japanese masterpieces of the 1950s. This movie is one of them. When I first finished, I sat stunned and could not move for at least five minutes, overwhelmed by the emotions that were supposed to trigger a big tragedy: terror and compassion.
