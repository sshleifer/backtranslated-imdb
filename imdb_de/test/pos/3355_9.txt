I saw this fine strip shortly after college. As I sat there happily watching Alice turn from the oppressed virgin to the sexual adventurer, I wondered why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered - Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the psycho-sexual developmental stages, essentially the temporal shift, at which point of the body and the associated stimulations, our main attention as well as the shifting emphasis on what makes us happy. Alice's first encounter is bathing, with a focus on the genitals and buttocks. Your next encounter is an oral encounter with the madness of Mad Hatter. I forget the rest of the talk and the sequence of encounters with Alice, but I remember how well they fit together. It's interesting to see a skin film with a few brains behind it, not the clich√© "I'm here to deliver your pizza. Let's screw it." <br /> <br /> I do not understand how Kristin DeBells career could have been destroyed by this movie since it was her first movie. Reagan's boring hypocrisy had not yet devastated this country on his release, but in a sense, he and his henchman Meese influenced Ms. DeBell. When Meese staged his anti-pornography commission (to distract people from his own criminal activities), Meese hired the services of an anti-porn activist named Judith Reisner. Reisner was obsessed with pictures that she felt as child pornography. She saw the cover "Alice" made by DeBell for Playboy and immediately revealed that she had scientifically proven that Mrs. DeBell was indeed a collage made up of adult women and the face of a ten-year-old man. Yes exactly....
