Along with virtually every republican image, "Murder in the Music Hall" seems to have fallen into disuse. Too bad, because this lavishly produced, expertly written and cunning Mystery Suspense article throws a seductive thriller against the backdrop of the Radio City Music Hall. Murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments gives suspicion to the luscious Rockettes - including Vera Ralston (who offers not only an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerability, but also a few dazzling ice-skating series), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop and some other delicious B-movie starlets of the 40s. The tall, fair-haired and handsome William Marshall (usually played in musicals) chases the killer as the complex and increasingly scary action unfolds against the most sophisticated scenes you'll ever see in a movie Noir. The end is just as surprising as this sadly forgotten, noble murder mystery. Restoration and revival on cable TV, VHS or DVD worth. Republic has a solid budget in this Grade A production, and "Murder in the Music Hall" is as smooth, disquieting, and immensely enjoyable as the films of the big studios of its time. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Pay attention to the rhapsodic song that the victim composed shortly before his death. In the midst of the showgirls' uninterrupted chatter in their dressing rooms, try to identify the one who is humming that deadly tune. You'll find out who the killer is, just like William Marshall. Great fun, the kind of movie they really do not do anymore, and what a loss - both for moviegoers and actors.
