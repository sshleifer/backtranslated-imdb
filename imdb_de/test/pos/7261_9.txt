I saw the previews everywhere before deciding to look at them. And what do you know, I really liked it! It has a new variant of English England from the 18th century. Although the music in the dance scene has obviously been modernized and the colors of Liv Tyler's clothes (though it's pretty!), They fit very well. <br /> <br /> If you just want to have a good time, you should check it out. Very different from other detail films of the 18th century.
