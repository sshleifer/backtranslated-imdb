The story takes place on the streets of Sao Paoulo, Brazil, where a boy named Pixote grows up alone without his parents. Crashed and without direction, Pixote and other youngsters are taken from the street to a children's home. Behind closed doors, terrible things happen in the staff and in the children's groups. And there is one last trigger that blows up the place, the last incident where Pixote and his friends decide to break out and flee. From then on, a journey begins that is filled with things with strong, close friendships, torn-up friendships, love and hate, criminal activities, and easy beach relaxing. I think this movie is perfect in many ways because it puts you on so many Plains touches that he did that to me anyway. The documentary style depicting Pixote and his surroundings seems more realistic, and the actors, who are truly street children and lead a similar life, make mankind appear more natural in the conditions. There is also a social commentary on child abuse, but I think what makes the movie so great is the pressure on history and not on political views. The last scene I find for the best part of the film seems to me as something I have not seen before. So full of emotions and yet so unsentimental makes this film a true, believable, unbearable, unforgettable story. A true heartbreaking masterpiece that is so underrated! <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10
