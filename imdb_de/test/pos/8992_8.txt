I'm a great movie lover and also an active rugby player who thinks rugby is the best game ever played. Forever Strong is a mix of Coach Carter and sloppy rugby. This movie is full of great acting, well-developed characters and action shots that make you duck and dodge in your seat, but with more arm tackles than pee-wee football and almost every shot cuts off as soon as a player filmed touching the ground to look almost like football. If you want to show your children a movie that can build the character from within and inspire a blind man to see you again, I can give him 9 out of 10 points if you want to see a great rugby movie that really shows the sport You have to wait for the next one, because Forever Strong consists mainly of practice, running and a one-jerk movie. I give 7.75 out of 10 points.
