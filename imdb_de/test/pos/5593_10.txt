Great spectacle of the 5 stars makes this hotel a must. <br /> <br /> THE SILVER CORD is based on a play and is about "motherly love". The film was highly controversial for both sons because of its implied homosexuality of the younger son and the mother's unnatural "romantic" feelings. Irene Dunne plays the new bride (and biologist), who travels with her husband (Joel) to McCrea) to visit the family before moving to New York City for their new jobs. But something seems wrong. <br /> <br /> The mother, Laura Hope Crews, seems rude to the younger son's fianc√© (Eric Linden) (Frances Dee). But Dunne puts such thoughts aside and ignores a few weird things the mother says. Then she finds out that "her" room is down the hall from McCrea, and his room adjoins the mother's room. Later she comes in as "Mummy" sits in McCrea and kisses him (on the lips). Good night. Mummy has also worked on Linden and made him doubt his feelings for Dee. Everything goes up in the air and Dee runs into the snowy night in the direction of the frozen pond. As the boys run after her, Mama screams out the window that the boys should come back and get their coats! Dee falls through the ice and is saved. <br /> <br /> When the girls leave the house the next morning, Dunne tells Mummy what she thinks of her and her attachment to the boys. But Mama has a firm hold, fakes illness and always praises her victims. The girls go, but the boys stay behind ... Crews is great as the greedy mother (repeats her stage role); It is a part that few actresses would dare to play. The sexual overtones are unbelievable for a 1933 movie and crews take advantage of their best movie role. Dunne is also excellent as she tries to maneuver the course without losing McCrea. Dee has some excellent scenes after being dumped by confused linden trees. All 5 stars are great in this drama, which is bizarrely undervalued and unknown. <br /> <br /> A neglected treasure for those who like good acting ......
