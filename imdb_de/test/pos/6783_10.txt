This game is one of the best horror / shooter games I've ever played. The plot is a bit choppy, but the game always fails to give you a lot of chill and excitement. Many people put the game down when they found out that there are no cheat codes for it and that very few health potions and ammunition need to be found. But once you've gone through the game, you'll be more familiar with the monsters and different rooms, so you'll be fine the second time around. The puzzles are great, not too heavy and not too easy. There are tons of different monsters, so you never get bored. And there are many play areas. You really feel like you're in a good Stephen King novel while you play. It is beautiful and scary. Get this game cheap and have fun.
