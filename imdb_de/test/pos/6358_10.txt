I was very impressed by this movie by newcomer Dir./Writer Jose Reyes. The cast was excellent. "Jorge Cordoba" performed as a main character of "Rafa" a powerful <br /> <br /> performance. It's inspiring to see independent films with this talent level. <br /> <br /> It takes talent, courage and determination to make a quality movie. <br /> <br /> I admire anyone who can take an idea from idea to conception and go the mile. <br /> <br /> It's easy for people to judge young filmmakers harder, but I applaud "Jose Reyes" and the talented actors for their successful efforts.
