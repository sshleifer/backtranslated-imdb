I am really sad that this film has received so much negative criticism. I think it's a nice little comedy and really funny. The humor in this movie is somehow warm and innocent and I like it. I also like Madonna's character and I do not agree that she played herself. She has created a character and a sympathetic. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes were the fight scene on the sinking car and Madonna climbed over the fence in a smart dress to demand her love. The humor in the film has a slightly syrrealist note and may not be for everyone. But it's her problem, not the movie. <br /> <br /> I found this movie healthy and sunny. The day I saw it for the first time, for some reason I was incredibly sad and this movie illuminated my day. And Madonna can act. Just take off your glasses of negative thinking.
