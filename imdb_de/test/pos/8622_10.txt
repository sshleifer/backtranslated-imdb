I liked the movie, but it should have been longer. The actors did a great job. Portia De Rossi is a great actress and Kristoffer Polaha is a hot man. He did not look 100% like John, but preferred him from a distance. I'm looking forward to seeing more of him on the big screen. He had no charisma from John, but he definitely has a charm about him. He has beautiful eyes and a great smile. He reminds me a lot of my friend. Mrs. Bissett was just too breathless. She should have this asthma examined. I will not comment on the Darryl Hannah character. My mother always said, "If you can not say anything beautiful, then hell!" So I will do that. <br /> <br/> Molly
