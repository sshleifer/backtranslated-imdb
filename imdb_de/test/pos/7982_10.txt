Every Batman fan knows how great the films are, they were a great success. Batman Returns is by far the best movie in the series. A combination of brilliant directing, brilliant acting and outstanding backdrops make it worth to watch this movie for one night in a row. <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, the director of this movie, has made sure that this movie creates a realistic atmosphere and he's done a great job. Danny Devito (Penguin Man) is a man who has inherited the characteristics of a penguin as a baby and has become a hideous and ugly thing. Michelle Pfiffer plays the slim and very seductive "Catwoman" after cats gave her genes that were bitten. The result of both character changes is excellent and both Catwoman and Penguin Man play a very important role in this excellent film. The mysterious Catwoman is great fun to look at - her classic sayings and a fun part of skipping the whip in a jewelry store make the movie even more fun. Danny Devito is also doing well, his ability to embody a strange creature was crucial, and it gives the movie a great atmosphere that brings us back to the boring sewers where he lives. <br /> <br /> You can not forget Batman though. Micheal Keaton pulls off a comfortable performance again and shows us a side other than Batman. His affection is unleashed when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the film, and his meetings with her, when she's a normal person, Selina Kyle, make him seduced into his own house. After leaving, there is a smart part, and the movie is full of great scenes. It's worth noting that Bruce Wayne's Bat Mobile is not used as frequently as in the other Batman movies, as melee and storytelling scenes make up this movie. <br /> <br /> The winter landscape is perfectly laid out in Gotham City Most scenes are filmed at night and the city is filled with snow. If you look at this movie like I do in summer, it does not feel the same. It's best to see it in winter. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an amazing movie. All praise goes to Tom Burton and the performers, they have done an incredible job.
