Stanwyck and Morgan are in many ways a perfect match for Dickens's Christmas carol in his sensitivity. The film's success depends on the cast of Sydney Greenstreet as Alexander Yardley's character. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he controls his employees - until the Christmas spirit overtakes him. The role is a "walk in the park" for Greenstreet, who was one of the great Falstaffs on stage when he belonged to Lunts. Greenstreet had only been in the movies five years earlier when, at the age of 61, he appeared in a classic movie, the first and best film John Huston ever staged: "The Maltese Falcon." "Cuddles" Sakall was probably never better in his traditional role as the embodiment of Central European modesty. The attractive set that is used in most films is a real gem.
