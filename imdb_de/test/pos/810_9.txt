The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that offers everything you can expect from Agatha Christie and, of course, Poirot. It's on a weekend in a country house. As always, all guests are suspects and it is up to Poirot to find out the truth. For such films, it is always best not to betray too much, so I stop here. What I loved about the Hollow was that it's old-fashioned, a mystery. For example, when Poirot arrives, everyone is around the body. Everyone seems to be the culprit. There is this suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story. <br /> <br /> You can expect a wonderful time guessing who made them and how and why and maybe even surprised in the end. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you've had a pretty enjoyable experience. <br /> <br /> The actors are all very good. As a curiosity, we notice Edward Hardwicke, who in Sherlock Holmes. Watson was playing. Nice to see him after a few years. Suchet is amazing as always and thankfully most of the time is on screen. <br /> <br /> I found out who the killer was, but still unpredictable and very credible. <br /> <br /> So finally a great movie and as always a pleasure. <br /> <br />
