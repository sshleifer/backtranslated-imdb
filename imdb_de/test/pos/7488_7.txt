A vehemently cynical, sarcastic and intense film that mocks and imitates the style of Pulp Fiction and stylized gangster films, Thursday is a fun, repulsive and funny thrill. An amazingly eclectic mix of superior characters and bizarre entertaining situations. This everyday life of an armed gunman proves to be a worthy addition to the film series, which seeks to imitate Tarantino's genius, the dark-hearted masterpiece Pulp Fiction. Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) comes by Casey's (Thomas Jane) house to track old times. Casey was a former canon for drug dealer who since then reformed, became an architect, married a successful business woman (Paula Marshall), and now considered adopting a child. Still linked to the gangster underworld, Nick leaves a briefcase full of drugs on Casey's while he borrows his car to do some errands? a.k.a. unfinished business. Annoyed and annoyed at the introduction of medications to his home, Casey washes them all into the sink. That's when Nick's double-crossed accomplices, rapacious rafafarian drug addicts and crooked policemen are gradually knocking on the unsuspecting Casey, who is expecting an incredible Thursday movie begins with a funky sequence in a gas station where Nick has the best deal for one Cup of coffee is looking for. After thinking about what cup size to get, a fiasco with the cashier breaks out as he asks for a free snack cake and uses a $ 50 bill as a form of payment. In a weirdly brilliant bloodshed, the situation gets worse and worse as a police officer intervenes and finds himself in the most unusual circumstances. This opening segment creates the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes itself too seriously, and contains outrageous characters who seem self-conscious in this nonsensical gangster movie. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into segments based on different events and times during the course of a day. This effect is similar to the Pulp Fiction method, which is also similar, although the Thursday has no chronological order except for the occasional flashback. Like Tarantino, music beautifully presents every scene and every character. Strangely, witty creatures, such as the Jamaican hit man pizza guy who rattles over the phone and shares his hashish, and Paulina Porizkova, the narcissistic Dallas who wants to rape Casey, add humor to any event, no matter how horrifying and disturbing it is is coincidences. When Mickey Rourke's quietly scratching cop Kasarov is unveiled, the careful staging and intricate set-up is completely put together, and Casey's difficult situation becomes even bolder and more commendable. Definitely a wannabe pulp fiction with lots of violence, witty dialogues, and extremely scary antagonists Thursday does some things right, but other attempts at homage may go so far as to suggest rip-offs , A flashback sequence in which Casey shoots up bad guys and wears a haircut exactly like John Travolta's in Pulp Fiction is a step too far away. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie, www.MoviePulse.net
