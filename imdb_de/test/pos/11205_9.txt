This is a film about loneliness and how the distance? Physical and emotional - between people tend to stupilate relationships. <br /> <br /> The story is simply banal: A young man, Yusuf (Emin Toprak), from a rural village, arrives in Istanbul to stay there and his older and successful cousin Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir); Yusuf wants to work in the big city. After spending several weeks trying to find work without success, the effort to live with Yusuf is too great for Mahmut. They argue? nothing physical, only verbal. Finally, Yusuf leaves and leaves Mahmut alone. End of story ... <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best in the movie. Much is said visually; Dialogue is used to evoke differences of opinion, mistrust, hostility and insecurity that exist within and between the two men. <br /> <br /> There are many visual gems in this film. When looking for work, the young Yusuf, who needs a relationship, tries in vain to attract the attention of various young women in the city. The expression on his face, as he is defeated each time, says it all. <br /> <br /> Or, because he wants a cigarette, Yusuf opens the door to the balcony of Mahmut's apartment and glows in the cool December air. leave the door open; Mahmut finally gets up from his desk, goes to the door (all glass) and the cousins ​​look at each other, which seems too long. Then Mahmut closes the door and leaves Yusuf out in the cold. The metaphor is complete. <br /> <br /> Or Mahmut, who cleans up after Yusuf, reluctantly and with increasing anger; and meanwhile, Yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking for work seriously, and spends Mahmut's money on a toy for a nephew? Yusuf is emotional, messy, impulsive and vulnerable. Mahmut is rational, logical, self-confident and a demanding control freak: the right brain and left brain dichotomy wonderfully expressed by two actors who say more with a glance, a gesture or a frown than any word can convey /> <br /> But Mahmut is not completely unemotional: he still loves his former wife, who tells him she's going to Canada with her future husband. Mahmut combines a distant and trusting friendship with his ex and makes sure she's fine. He wishes her all the best. He says goodbye. He leaves the cafe where they talked. When she calls for her last farewell on the way to the airport, Mahmut goes there and secretly watches her leave. The feeling of emotion in his face as she disappears through a door is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an outstanding piece of work by the two leading actors and director Nuri Ceylan. Some may argue that the pace is too slow; But life is usually slow, especially for those who are alone. Camerawork is also relatively simple: select the scene, set up the camera and lighting, and let the actors walk across the scene, enter the scene, and exit the scene while keeping the camera steady. There were some panning shots, some high-tracking shots, some rural scenes? However, the film is mostly shown as on a fixed camera stage with a wide-angle lens. Apart from television and radio music in history, there is no musical sound. And there are so many long silence while the two men are sitting together watching TV and / or having very limited conversations. On some occasions, I have watched TV since they have also watched TV. The silence in the film was in line with the silence in my house (I was awake, everyone else in bed); My chair and position corresponded to that of Mahmut as he watched TV. Pretty scary to make me feel like I'm almost with him? And I guess I was in a sense. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying anymore because I want you to enjoy the other scenes that I did not describe. It's certainly not a movie for everyone. More than any movie I've seen, does it show how much we die when we're alone? Just like we are alone when we die. Mahmut's face, as it turns black in the final scene, will stay with me for a long time ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for serious movie lovers.
