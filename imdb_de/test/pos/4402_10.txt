Since I'm not a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney, anyone can spot the skepticism I brought to the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to do something different. This time it was this Zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens who made "her thing" one of the great works of literary history. Who would ever have thought that Homer was going to do that? I do not know where this movie will fit into Hollywood's history books, but it will be in both my and many other DVD or VHS libraries. It's one of those movies that you can see again and again. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and entertaining, with a few Gumpesque brushes of great fame, great performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson and a short but funny Holly Hunter. I was born in Mississippi and grew up in other parts of the South. I wish more people would make us so much fun. They even demand a soundtrack for the rural South. You're NOT doing any better this weekend, check out this movie! <br /> <br />
