I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and was only able to see the original TV a few days ago, which is far superior to the sequel. Okay, it's not a million miles from the plot of SEVEN, but it's still convincing. Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott's performance as DCI Red Metcalfe, a policeman who seems to have lived a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret. It would be easy for Stott to outdo the top, but he plays the role in a subtle way. Likewise, the murders are very shocking, but unlike the sequel where the murders are shown on the screen in a more OTT way, in fact, little violence is shown. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that the red herring was also Obviously a red herring, which means that I was not caught by the shock twist (and you would probably see the shock twist, so I'm not with a spoiler alert) and that when the real killer was revealed, it both seemed far removed and brought some action holes into the story. If I remember correctly, the sequel had similar problems when the killer was uncovered. Maybe it would be a good idea not to do MESSIAH 3
