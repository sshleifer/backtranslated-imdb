The book "The Railway Children" is a children's book published in 1906 by Edith Nesbit, an early British socialist who spoke a great deal about the importance of family values ​​in the education of children and whose story was presumably contemporary. Somewhat surprisingly, there seems to be a significant incentive for today's children, one hundred years later. A movie adaptation of an Edwardian children's story starring the children does not sound very exciting to most moviegoers of that time. But a truly great performance by Jenny Agutter, who (at the beginning of her long and distinguished acting career) played the role of the oldest woman, Roberta (Bobby), combined with notable work by scriptwriter and director Lionel Jeffries and superb photography by Arthur Ibbetson, has this film made into a film that is still not to be overlooked and most viewers find quite memorable. It is noteworthy that this 1905 book was shot five times between 1951 and 2000 (four of them from the BBC for British television), and all these versions are not only still much admired, but also much appreciated (something that the user commented in this database will confirm this), even if this seems almost unthinkable for a nostalgic story that is primarily intended to appeal to children. Since I have not seen the four BBC TV versions, these comments refer exclusively to the 1970s movie version, which was shown for cinemas. Unlike most movies with children's books, The Railway Children appeals to adults rather than children. The structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children feel completely lost in the way they are portrayed in the film, while many older people feel that it has a nostalgic appeal. Perhaps compensating are the children seen in the film, full of life and vitality, while the adult characters, though well-rounded, are mostly "stuffed shirts." History is a mature story of love, support and encouragement, not only timeless, but appealing to all ages. It can be described as rather sentimental and more than a little idealized, but it is in no way dirty and the rarely justified adjective "uplifting" fits like a glove. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead. <Br /> <br /> The film opens with his Edwardian family celebrating Christmas in a comfortable and spacious London home, when two unexpected visitors take Pater (a senior government official) with them. Mother has to move to a very small cabin next to the railroad in a remote part of Yorkshire, and the children are beginning to build a new life, mainly related to the railroad and the few passing trains. This life proves to be quite eventful in a small way and the older daughter Bobby is growing up fast as she takes more responsibility from her mother. Once she turns off a train as her keen eyes realize that a landslide is a natural hazard. Father's story is never emphasized, but he will never forget, and it is beginning to become clear that he is imprisoned and suspected of treason. Eventually this suspicion is clarified (we are not told why or why) and he unexpectedly returns to the local station to join his family. <br /> <br /> This movie was not available in any home video format in North America for many years, but Anchor Bay made a DVD out of it three years ago, and they've clearly recognized that this pretty straightforward movie has not lost its appeal yet , For anyone who does not have one, I would strongly recommend buying a DVD while it's still available. You will most likely not be disappointed, unless you are completely cynical or your minimum requirement for a DVD movie includes buckets of blood and / or intense sex scenes.
