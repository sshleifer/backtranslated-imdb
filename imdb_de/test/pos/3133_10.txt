Two horse dealers arrive in a town and meet with the leader of a group of Mormons who go down to a valley where they can settle down and live in peace. The scenes of the Corral in the city, where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea (Johnson and his partner, played by Harry Carey Jr.), who lead the train into this valley, are some of the best in the movie, when Johnson, a real cowboy, carves a piece of wood while scolding Bond. Once on the trail, they come across Joanne Dru, who may have seen John Ford in Red River, and offered her a much better role in this movie. There are a number of notable characters on the Morman train. The Mormans are a peaceful group challenged on the way by a truly low group of outlaws. In her case (the Outlaws), in the case of the people on the train, and later a band of Navajos they encounter, and in the well-written characters played by Ben Johnson and Ward Bond, the film completely avoids the stereotypes Die Camera seems to spend so much time giving the viewer the big picture of Monument Valley framing the train as he passes along the way with a few water crossings in breathtaking black and white and then returns to what is rolling in that Community everything happens to the beautiful singing of the sons of the pioneers.
