A brilliant and sensitive film with interwoven lines of action. As a general warning, half of the film is halfway dark. As sudden as it is, I found this change to match the theme of the film, especially the comparison of the Ishkanani with the filthy rich and (as Finn says in the end) how each person makes up the tribe, and how the whole tribe in each one Person reflects. <br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin (Finn Earl) is spectacular in this movie. He's probably best known as Chekov by Star Trek or Kyle Reese in Terminator Salvation, but he has been involved in a wealth of films you've probably never heard of (Alpha Dog, another brilliant performance in Yelquin's Part, House of D, Hearts in Atlantis, just to name a few ...) The boy really takes this movie and makes it his own. Other outstanding performances by Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland make this film from great to outstanding.
