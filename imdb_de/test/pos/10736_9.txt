I do not think so! Yes, if you compare this movie with The Godfather or a slightly older movie like Casablanca or maybe even a slightly newer movie like The English Patient. There is neither the camera nor the camera like these other films, but that does not mean that this is a bad movie or not? I think the reason this film is underestimated is that many people always compare it to other great Oscar-winning films (you should never do that), which makes it hard to appreciate the beauty and the realism in this film understand. In the categories Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this movie has really earned everyone. The great Dustin Hoffman again gives us one of his best performances. A few times in this movie I forgot that it was not his son because it was so real! I have never seen a film about relationships in different families, where actors have had such an easy time playing this specific role, but still so beautiful. So in my opinion Dustin Hoffman passed the test with flying colors. There are some actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can not help but think she's great). Meryl Streep, though she is in a supporting role, is amazing and real and you can easily avoid being attracted by her talent and the way she does it. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great considering his age, tears and relationship with mom and dad. <br /> <br /> While I saw this movie alone for the third time, I could not stop crying. I tried, but I could not. Thank god I was alone! This is probably the purest movie I have ever seen. Other films nominated for Best Picture included Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I'm ashamed because I did not see any of them, but from what I've heard, Apocalypse Now is great, but when I heard about Norma Rae, I just thought of Sally Field. I think this film has earned five Oscars in the face of the other nominees, and that it will continue to touch other people in the future, as has been the case over the last 28 years. Good work, all actors and actresses in this film who have given us great performances and memories of the movie that we will never forget. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
