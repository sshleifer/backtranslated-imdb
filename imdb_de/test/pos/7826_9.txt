It is very easy to find out why The New Professionals was an idiot, at least in New Zealand: it followed not only the footsteps of the original, but bodyguards, the show with their boss-and-two-agent formula. Cmdr McIntyre was a recent George Cowley: hard on the team, but one who would defend her to the death against others. The shadow of the show was huge. <br /> <br /> Well, not as big as it should have been in the UK. Here it was networked in prime time. It was even marketed in the promos as "you are the pros". Someone else has obviously noticed the difference. We were lucky that this show was not released in different regions at different time windows. <br /> <br /> It was the high production values ​​that sealed the deal for me. As other critics have noted, he followed the great British tradition of the one-hour actioner while adding personal touches. There is a slight undercurrent of something that develops between Liz and Ian, though this has never distracted from the real conspiracy. Most episodes were based on inflammatory diplomatic incidents, the kind that favors spooks from time to time. Unlike many 2000s shows, the action was not sacrificed at the expense of fantasy photography or beyond -stylish direction. Directors like Christopher Young kept up the pace and did their work. They used good places and made bodyguards leaner than if they had been shot on back roads and lanes. It was contemporary, it would hold its own today, and it was one of the better examples of British action in the 1990s, showing that Britain can still do better than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Maybe with the exception of the Germans and their cobra 11.
