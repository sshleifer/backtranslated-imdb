When I first heard that this movie was about to be shot, I was very excited to see it. The ideas of making a movie with this caliber must have been so difficult. I was not really sure anyone could capture the pope's many amazing features in a movie, but the movie did justice to his memory. In my opinion, the most important task was to show the people the Pope had started. Until his days in Poland, until his last days at the Vatican, this film followed every aspect of his life. Thomas Kretschmann, the man who played the pope in his adulthood, has conveyed the emotions very well. Overall, this film was instructive, but also very entertaining.
