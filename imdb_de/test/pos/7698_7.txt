The storyline of "Sally of the Sawdust" is the usual melodramatic stuff - an orphan, rags-at-riches - but the movie rises above most Silents thanks to three people: <br /> <br /> That's not Of course, DW is Griffith's masterpiece, but it shows his skills as a filmmaker in full maturity. He uses all of his innovations that we take for granted: close-ups, cross-section, a mobile camera and the ability to modify the spectacle of theater exaggeration to cinematic subtlety. <br /> <br /> W.C. Fields also shows his abilities - not his unmistakable, gruff delivery, but his remarkable dexterity as a physical comedian. He's doing some imaginative juggling, too short a cut to be fully appreciated, and some very ingenious pickpockets, but it seems every prop that comes within reach is manipulated for a weird effect - hat, stick, car roof, Dog, cash. It is a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> Finally there is Carol Dempster. There was a lot of talk about this actress, but her performance is also very funny. She was 22 at the time and played a teenager, and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and awkwardness that may not be convincing, but she's really exciting when she's on the screen - especially when she's dancing. She is not beauty - although she radiates positively in the one scene in which she was clenched like a Talmadge sister - but her clarity only adds to Sally's character, especially in the many moments when she has very obvious affection for Fields as her guardian shows. "Father." If anything, Hollywood actors could compete with Fields in terms of comedy, but Griffith gives his lead actress any chance to compete with her co-star, and Dempster can stand it.
