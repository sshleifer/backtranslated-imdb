Every time I see this movie, I really want to go out and have a good night! My buddy uses "the weekend has landed" to track down the psyche itself before it goes out! and me too ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> This film is a great debut for the writer / director - a good buddy! <br /> <br /> The show is great, all characters are believable and larger than life! The "weird" scenes are a pleasure to see, Jip's running floppy flashbacks / explanations / visuals from Jip are all great! The scene in the huuuuuuuge pub, where everyone gets up and sings the played national anthem, is also a laugh. There is a lot of comedy here - Howard Mark's speech on "Politics" is weird! <br /> <br /> Oh god, you just have to see it. Mind you, I felt that the movie has glorified the use of ecstasy, but hey, that's the truth of the matter, eh? At least the movie does not shy away from that fact. I suppose the film also has a decent message - DO NOT take life too seriously, you'll have to skip it someday. And of course, chatting in the pub when Moff tries to explain to his buddies that he's getting off drugs is a sure reminder that the game is over when the rundown times have passed the good times. <br /> <br This is sometimes a very clever film in terms of using the camera, lighting, etc. It was a real piece of cinema and a great story about comrades, love, clubs and drugs. <br /> <br /> Get out of the 'Rat Race' people! <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Have fun!
