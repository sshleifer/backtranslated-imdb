William Haines tells this story of a brazen cadet who believes West Point will now really become something now that he has arrived. A grand goon comic performance by Haines was his trademark - one that made him a top box office star from 1928 to 1932 and one of MGM's biggest stars. Joan Crawford and William Bakewell are good too. And although this act may now seem banal, this was a great success, which made Haines and Crawford a college football story (a national craze in the 1920s). After Haines blows off his big mouth too often and is almost shunned by other cadets, he does a wonderful job as he swallows his pride and goes against the Navy. Despite a broken arm, he wins the game for the army and regains his place in West Point. From this movie and from Show People (with the ever-underrated Marion Davies) it's easy to see why Billy Haines was a big star of the times. He needs and deserves to be remembered!
