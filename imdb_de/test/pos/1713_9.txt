I enjoyed some of the older Doctor Who many years ago, and when the new one came out I just had to check it out. I was so happy - I became addicted to the characters, storylines and updated look! From the first season (27 for the old fans) to the second season (28) it is getting better. It also goes well with the old shows, although you do not need to know the old shows to enjoy this newer version. <br /> <br /> Although the cast was changed, I recommend Doctor Who - with Chris Eccleston AND David Tennant. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that they gave the characters so much depth. The doctor seems to be more vulnerable in this series, perhaps because he is the last TimeLord. The range of emotions that Chris and David are showing is truly remarkable, and I felt their pain, anger, and adventure feeling. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper (Rose) brings a very human element to every episode, though she is much bolder than me. With her talent Billie will go far into the industry.
