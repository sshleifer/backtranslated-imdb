I remember seeing this in the cinemas here when it came out, having no idea what it would be about, and I was so pleasantly surprised that I had promised to buy the video when it came out. <br /> <br /> Even though I do not want to go too far this movie, I will say that I have given it 8/10, for all the reasons that you can read in the reviews of other users. <br /> What I want to say is: <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of this movie are incredible. It's so close to a textbook gripper I've never seen before. I once showed this movie at a party where everyone got ready and set off. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> All who saw the opening stayed until the end.
