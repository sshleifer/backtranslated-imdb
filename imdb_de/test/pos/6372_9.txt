A great show. <br /> <br /> First to the people who do not like it. I do not like it, then DO NOT FIT ... <br /> <br /> That's (was) a great show. Better than Jim (a favorite of mine). It shows a REAL family household (as opposed to 8 simple rules etc where everything goes peachy). <br /> <br /> They are loud, they are messy ... I can understand their garbage in the kitchen. It happens in real life ... Sorta like the "Portal to Hell", and everyone growls like a dog over the fast food boxes, but fun to see because YOU've been there before. <br /> <br /> A good cast, they work great together, an admirable show that justifies a DVD release. Mel Gibson's "safety videos" were also a highlight of the series. <br /> <br /> opinion? Good show, really deserves a DVD release (not to cancel).
