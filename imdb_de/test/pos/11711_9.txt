In the tradition of "neo" movie strips like "Chinatown," this film focuses on a criminal secret in a dark realm with a little bit of insight into the character traits. The typical Noir characters, including the policeman who proves himself girl in trouble and a bad, bad guy. Sharky's Machine first scores 9 out of 10 for his cinematography, direction, story, strong character and jazz score. Available on DVD even though the soundtrack itself is out of print (but "used" on some auction sites). Filmed locally in beautiful downtown Atlanta (Romans Diehl's hometown) and the tidy, about 1979 appearing city view, an old citizen or visitor from Atlanta would be interested in the old days for a long time before 12-lane interstates cross the city traversed across, what the cameraman is aiming for a dream this time. This was Rachel Ward's first American feature film.
