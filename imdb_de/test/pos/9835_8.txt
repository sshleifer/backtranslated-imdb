As a fan of history, mythology and fantasy, the show "Mystic Knights" attracted me from the beginning. It has pretty decent scripting, the costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), it has pretty good acting, and the heroes and bad guys are playing well. <br /> <br /> SCRIPTS - Half a script is pretty good, the other half is flat, but everything is mixed together, which means that many episodes are so-so. In addition, some of the key players repeatedly receive deadlines (for example, King Conchobar and Angus). You have to do something ... more. I'm not sure what, but the authors should come up with something. ACTIVATE - Apart from some overblown behavior of the villagers (terrible lines that in the end mean too much effort), the casting chose the leads very well, and so on. Everyone, good and bad, works well together! COSTUMES / WEAPONS - The everyday wear that everyone wears is spectacular! Mystical knight armor that is not enough is Deirdres and Garrett. A chainmail bikini would probably have better protection in their case ... and would not look like plastic. he looks like a bunch of snapping brown plastic pieces when he should look bronze. Ivar's trident looks like he's been bought at a discount store, and while Garrett's guns look cool, they look vivid too. <br /> <br /> Lately, "Mystic Knights" has taken too many "Power Rangers" drawings, if you're careful In the show, you'll know what I mean. However, as the series progresses, she should find her niche and perfect her style. All in all, it's a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and I see it and we're all over 20 years old). The plot thickens and twists, though in some places it gets a bit youthful, and everything becomes more and more interesting. It might be of interest to fans of the movie "Willow" or the TV series "The Adventures of Sinbad". A lot of adventure, a mystery puzzle, a touch of romance, a wealth of nature ... Look at that! (My score: 7/10)
