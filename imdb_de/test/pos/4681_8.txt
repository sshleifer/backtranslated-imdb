The Italian job is a real eye-catcher. It's a really entertaining movie that you only see for fun. It is not difficult with drama or emotional wranging, it has no cosmic statements about life and it is not violent or profane. It's just a funny movie. Between the little mini-coopers flying through the busy streets of LA and the great pieces of a stereotypical computer geek (played by Seth Greene), I had a blast watching this movie. > Special kudos to the background music. You're really giving a masterly tone to such a movie, so subtle that you stay out of the way when needed. Apparently, many artists have contributed to the music, I found it the most classic part of the film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Not impressive, but a great movie you can see at the end of a movie lousy day in the office. <br /> <br /> Barky
