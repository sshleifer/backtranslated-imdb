This movie will not win any prizes for size. But if you have an hour and a half free and want a bit of carefree entertainment, you could do a lot worse than look at it. <br /> <br /> The actors are mostly young and pretty, the script has some really funny moments and the soundtrack is pretty cool too. Rupert Penry-Jones as Jake seems to have the most fun, while Laura Fraser is cute, sympathetic and funny as Justine. <br /> <br /> I rented them because I like the 'Spooks' series where RPJ is currently starring And here he is young and ready to buff and the perfect eye candy for a girls' night. <br /> <br /> Get wine and ice cream and drink delicious.
