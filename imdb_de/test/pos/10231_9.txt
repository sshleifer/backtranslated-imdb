I've just seen Nightbreed for the first time since I saw it in the theater almost 20 years ago, and although I remember I liked it back then, I do not remember what it was like today. I can not complain about anything in this movie. Craig Scheffer is outstanding as the main character of Boone. I never understood why he did not make a more successful career because most of his early work is excellent. As good as Scheffer is, Cronenberg is even better. His portrayal of Psycho dr. Decker is memorable and steals the show. The rest of the cast, which includes Doug Bradley, is very good, except for the ridiculously towering Redneck sheriff. The visuals are good and great in some settings. The score composed by Danny Elfman is as good as it gets and is one of his best works. The end was epic and lasted nearly twenty minutes. Overall, Nightbreed is a tremendous achievement for Clive Barker and is one of my favorite movies, just ahead of Hellraiser. 9.10
