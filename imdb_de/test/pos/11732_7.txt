I have not seen every single movie Burt Reynolds ever did, but this movie (which I've just watched for the third time) may be his best! It only suffers from some slow stretches; Burt may have tried to make it "more artistic" than it should have been. On the other hand, he managed to avoid many of the common stereotypes in presenting the role of the "hard cops" he plays. For example, notice the scene in which he tries to kiss Rachel Ward for the first time, or the fear he expresses just before the final showdown with the indestructible Henry Silva). In fact, Silva and these two Ninja assassins are three of the most memorable villains of the 80's cop thriller. The film also has some unusual accents, surprising humor, a brutal and gripping fist fight and many targeted punches. (***)
