I went to the movies in 1973 when the movie was released. At that time I was 11 years old. I remember how much I enjoyed it and wanted to live in Shangri-la, so naive and young was I. I recently came across a video from the movie I shot on TV several years ago. I've looked at it again and am not ashamed to admit that I still enjoy it the same way I did 29 years ago. I also like to listen to the words of the songs, because I think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of cannons does not knock in our ears and when we look at our reflection - we should be satisfied with what we see. This is what I call a "feel good movie" because I feel happy after watching. Maybe I'm still naive, but it makes me happy and I'm sure it will make you happy if you look at it openly and enjoy what it is - a good family movie. I have to be one of the few who made this movie on VHS PAL video and DVD (made by myself). I recorded it on DVD, as the videotape recording from the TV was slowly worn down. I still watch it now and then.
