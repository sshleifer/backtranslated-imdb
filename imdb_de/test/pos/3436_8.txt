In December 1945, a train leaves the central station from Stockholm to Berlin. There is not much left when it arrives. Not from the train and not from some passengers. <br /> <br /> This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle that looks like it was traded in the 40s and also photographed (in b / w) as it used to be during that period. The actors must have had a lot of fun. They are not much of a character as if they were not in their 40s, but the story is well told and everyone has a timing. See it if you did not think the Swedes are capable of humor.
