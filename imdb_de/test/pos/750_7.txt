Personally, I have a penchant for horror movies playing in hospitals and institutions. So I had a good feeling to see this Do not Look in the Basement, though its reputation is doubtful. Now it turned out that I was right! This is a great, trashy conversation with a few efficient shocks and wonderfully absurd characters. Of course, you have to look beyond the bad production values ​​and the illogical plot, but if you can do that (and if you're a fan of this kind of horror, this is an essential feature), then you'll be too, with an outrageous "video eyebrow" rewarded, in which blood and madness form the main elements. Young and sweet sister Charlotte arrives at a secluded sanatorium to start her new job. She finds out that the doctor who hired her has been killed by one patient, and the replacing doctor who takes over the master seems reluctant to accept the new arrival. Life in the sanatorium is quite strange, patients walk around freely and every door stays locked. After a series of bizarre events, Charlotte discovers the terrible secrets hiding the institution ... The first 10 minutes (pre-departure) are great as well as the totally crazy climax. Everything in between is next to no surprise or tension, but you wait patiently because you feel like the finale will be really fun. Asylum patients are textbook lovers, but I still love them. My favorites include the former judge (who still speaks only legally), the suspicious army coffin and the crazy old lady. "Do not Look Down The Basement" is an entertaining fun that is especially recommended for fans of the 1970s trash cinema, sick puppies and other types of scum. The lunatics have taken over the asylum, yes !!
