A surprisingly good movie considering the production circumstances. With performances by nameless actors who can compete with the top talents of the earth (unfortunately, no career pursued a career). <br /> <br /> Also has the godlike ability of Christopher Nolan to write perfect dialogues. The dialogue carries this story, which is about a man who likes to search people for material for his books. Well done, VERY well edited, even better written and surprisingly well performed. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything a great movie needs except the people who saw it. 9.10
