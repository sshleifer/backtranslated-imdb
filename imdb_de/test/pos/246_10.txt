This is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. The glorious Technicolor shows Rita Hayworth's beauty and spectacular hair. She should have done more movies in color, but then Columbia was barely able to inject money for Technicolor spectacle. Rita is a WOW as Rusty Parker - she holds more than with genes in some of the glossiest numbers ever. She also looked beautiful at the turn of the century, giving her the chance to play her own grandmother. The movie begins with "The Show Must Go On" - it looks great to me - but Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is unimpressed. His motto is work, work, work !!! One of the dancers, Maurine (Lesley Brookes), is determined to improve herself and will audition for Vanity's Golden Wedding Cover Girl Competition. Rusty also happens to be in the castings again. In a very funny scene, Maurine just had an audition and Rusty to see, give her some tips on how to impress the jurors !!! "Do not be shy and reserved - chatter and sparkle". Rusty does that with enthusiasm !!! <br /> <br /> They opt for Maurine and go to the show to see them, but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past. Cornelia (Eve Arden) still has nightmares about Rusty's audition. "Whose Complaining" shows Genius (Phil Silvers) and the dancers, dressed as a working girl - (Rusty is a taxi driver). John remembers a long lost love (Rusty's grandmother, Maribelle Hicks) For the first time he saw her sing "A Sure Thing" - set in the races. In the meantime Danny, Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls in their local restaurant. They then start in the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - "Make Way For Tomorrow". <br /> <br /> "Put Me Test" is a spirited song and dance number with Danny and Rusty. In the meantime, Rusty has been selected as cover girl and Danny McGuires is the place to see. Lee Bowman appears as Danny's romantic rival and mutes things. Lee Bowman is probably the most boring leader of all time - so Danny never has to worry. Rusty (christened by Martha Mears) sings "Long Ago and Far Away" and is beautifully danced by Danny and Rusty. The clothes that Rita wears are stunning. Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling designed it. Danny wants the best for Rusty, but fears he might lose her. Gene Kelly is also fantastic in the Alter Ego number, where he dances with himself. "Poor John" is another turn-of-the-century retrospective - written in 1906 and is extremely A fun song that makes fun of rich relationships - Hayworth looks gorgeous in an amazingly curious outfit. Look for Al Norman in "Poor John" and "A Sure Thing". He was an amazing eccentric dancer who appeared in several early musicals, including "King of Jazz" and "Paramount on Parade." He was easy to recognize. <br /> <br /> The "Cover Girl" dance is just wonderful. Rita was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer. After a throng of beautiful models through the front pages of America's top magazines, Rusty breaks through in a beautiful golden gown and dances down a ramp to the very catchy "Cover Girl" song. Gosh, I love this movie! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
