This is one of the best films we have seen, and we strongly recommend him to expose the injustices of bigotry. Billy Wirth is an incomparable actor and really impressive like Corby / White Wolf. However, I felt that the story would have been improved if his character had more scenes. This is a movie that can be watched over and over again without getting tired.
