This movie has a decent story, very good fighting scenes in my opinion, but I was a bit disappointed at the end of the movie, her character has also become more interesting and she was a decent opponent of Cynthia. I think when the director filmed the last fight between cynthia and demier, he wanted to finish the movie earlier, so he did not care about the end. All in all, I think fans of Cynthia Rothrock will be very pleased when they watch this movie , It's not like "Yes, woman"! or sworn to justice, but it was entertainment enough and cynthia looks fantastic in this movie, so my rating for this movie is solid 8/10
