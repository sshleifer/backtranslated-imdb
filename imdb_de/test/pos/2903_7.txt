I would give this film good marks for the film photography and the performances. I've just read a user commentary on the performance of the actress, who plays a compelling courtesan that volatilizes Sinuoeh, the main character. I remember a miniature biography of this actress who had last seen the movie. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee who was discovered by a French husband and a wife in the film industry, who was thrilled by her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and in tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film. Like other neo-biblical films of the 1940s and 50s, "The Egyptian" reflects the customs and values ​​of that time, but is still a good conversation because the performances are terrific and the story is told so well.
