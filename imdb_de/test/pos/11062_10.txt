I would rate this movie at the top of my list of Ingrid Bergman films. Aside from Ingrid's beauty, her talent is evident in every scene. She was sad, mean, funny, snobbish, flirtatious, delightfully funny, loving, affectionate, sad, desperate, happy, etc. They call it, she was all those things and more. -And so <br /> <br /> convincing. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Clio), who returns to New Orleans and falls in love with Texas player Gary Cooper (Clint). I especially loved the scene where they sit at the dining table, say nothing and just stare. She, in an elegant white dress and he in a pretty white cowboy outfit, sat and looked at her admiringly. What chemistry! What for love!
