This movie is an eternal favorite of mine. I am sorry that IMDb is not more positive. I hope that those who have not experienced it will not be deterred. <br /> <br /> I always loved this movie. I look at it about once a year and am always satisfied with the film and, above all, the excellent representations of the entire cast. <br /> <br /> I've always wondered if Jean Stapleton really did graduate with Travolta ??? ? If anyone knows these little things, please leave a comment. <br /> <br /> Thank you and ENJOY!
