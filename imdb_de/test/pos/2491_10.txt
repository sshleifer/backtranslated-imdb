To think that this movie was born in the year I was born. To think that people are still being deprived of their constitutional rights, now in the name of "Homeland Security". To think that this movie was deliberately banned by the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK addresses the political divide in the United States better than any movie I've ever seen. Would it have seen something more, would it have changed something? A movie like this is so polarizing that it can trigger uprisings. It shakes you up and forces you to take sides. It asks you the question: Are you in favor of the right of appeal of people in times of war or for the impairment of the Constitution in the name of "national security"? The protagonists are forced by the government to run in a game to the American flag, in which the ideals under which the flag stands, are undermined. The spectacle is absolutely convincing. I can not see anything happening here at all. If it's a script documentary, it's more compelling than any reality show on TV. PUNISHMENT PARK is possibly the most important movie ever made. It really makes you think.
