This is probably the best movie of the year 2002 in terms of Romanian cinema. I recommend it as an intense drama without action and thrill. The film focuses on teenage life in the suburbs of Bucharest by the main character, focusing not so much on the shape or definition of the character, but rather on the anger he and other characters feel. The title "Furia" means anger rather than anger, but could be seen in the film in both directions from the actors' behavior. The rather strange love story (not a typical romantic, but rather modern suburban concept) is well formed in the end. It's a charming picture, and the cinematography is pretty good at catching the nightlife outside the city, making it a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> You will not be bored for a minute, I promise!
