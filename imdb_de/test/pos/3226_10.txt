This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is unique as Lane Kim's best friend of Rory. I love the funny dialogue that makes the show unique. Kelly Bishop is great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is great as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a pleasure as Luke Danes and the members of the band are unique. The community, Miss Patty, Babette, Mrs. Kim, Taylor Doose, Kirk and others are always laughing loud, funny, quirky and interesting, which always characterizes the snappy one-liners. This show has changed so much over the years that it never ages. Gilmore Girls is an original and clever show where you are always careful. It's that good. I give this show a rating of 10/10.
