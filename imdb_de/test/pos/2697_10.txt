I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it as one of the best ever. I have just returned from Arizona to Arizona from American Airlines and had coincidentally shown several episodes. I laughed my head and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did it. Thanks, AA. The spectacle from the entire team is first-rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but by all actors the acting is outstanding. I love the whole cast, they are so funny. In King of Queens there is a hard edge that I love and rarely seen in today's television comedy. Both Leah and Kevin are playing so well that every situation is believable and witty. I just bought Season 2 when I was in Az this week, and I plan to buy the complete set next time I'm in the US. My son, who is 20 years old, also loves this show, and his brilliance is that he has the magic of reaching different generations. I'd like to thank all those involved for this amazing show - it's very much appreciated that this type of TV show in my opinion is an era of bad TV show in general, with the exception of repeats of Seinfeld and so ... Thanks for a great show ..
