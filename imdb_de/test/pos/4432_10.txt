I have never heard of architect Louis Kahn until this documentary. In this almost two-hour documentary, which is very fast, his son Nathaniel Kahn explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia, where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton and La Jolla, California, and to New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families, including his wife Esther, who refused to divorce, and her daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel includes his family members. Louis also has another half-sister Alexandra Tynge from his father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a friendly architect. Louis' passion was his art.
