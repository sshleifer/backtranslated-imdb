I saw this movie when it hit the cinemas. It's definitely a reminder, I had forgotten the title until recently. A friend found it through the online search. <br /> <br /> One Dark Night is rather unusual for the suspense / horror genre of the time because it contains no blood. It's the teen-fear variety, but the teenagers are respectable in their own way. It's a nice old movie with props and scenes that reflect the times. For example, our hero drives a motorcycle without a brain bucket. <br /> <br /> As mentioned by other reviewers, One Dark Night is currently available on DVD. The original negative was not available for the DVD transition. Some role changes are a bit rough, but that does not take the story. Apart from that, the colors are alive and the lighting is very good. Adam West plays a minor role in this film as the son-in-law of RayMar. His role as arrogant and indifferent husband is thankfully brief. <br /> <br /> The story becomes more and more important as the movie progresses. Unlike many horror films of the era, One Dark Night is a great thrilling story that gives the viewer time to grasp what happened. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of One Dark Night make it so memorable. RayMar's telekinetic capabilities are used to open ancient graves in the mausoleum, extract the coffins, open them, and move the bodies. In the final scenes attention was paid to details. The rotten worm-infested bodies look pretty real.
