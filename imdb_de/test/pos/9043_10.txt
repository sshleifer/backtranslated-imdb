The unjustly neglected classic "Intruder in the Dust" is one of the great films of the 1940s, which unfortunately has been forgotten. Based on a story by William Faulker, filmed in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, "Intruder" tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (played with great dignity by Juano Hernandez), a black man who is unjustly accused of murdering a white man and a white boy (Claude Jarman Jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to settle a previous blame on Beauchamp. Great spectacle, especially from two great character actors, Porter Hall (as the father of the dead) and Elizabeth Patterson (best known as Mrs. Trumbull in "I Love Lucy") as an old woman ready to stand against the citizens, to see this right done. This straightforward, tense and honest study of racist bigotry deserves to be seen more.
