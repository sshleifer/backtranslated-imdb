MINOR SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The misunderstood classic is still one of Henson's most beautiful and personal films. It may seem weird to call such a popular movie "misunderstood", but people seem to remember that film, especially for Jerry Juhl's snappy screenplay and Paul Williams's knockout songs. While these things are admittedly great, as well as the film's formal playfulness (screenplay script, movie break, etc.), "The Muppet Movie" differs from the other Muppet films in the serious, wistful thread of the picture. It's a road movie, all right, but like most road movies, the joy of getting there and the achievement of the characters' goals is tempered by uncertainty and the knowledge that they will never return. Throughout the film, we are shown the dark side of show business even before the Muppets make it: Piggy leaves Kermit without a second thought on a call from her agent. Gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of the actor from the street in his haunting "I'll go back there someday," and most of all, Kermit is constantly being tortured and tested by Doc Hopper, who wants him to commercialize his art for the most unholy purposes. (One can only wonder what Henson would have done to his family's management after his death.) Kermit himself is tormented by his choices in the desert talk scene, and the final "Magic Store" number wonders if it all paid off , before you come to the conclusion that it probably does not matter either way. All this is interrupted by the anticipated chaos and satire of Muppet and deliciously terrible jokes, and of course the serious stuff would not work if it were not for that. However, "The Muppet Movie" is not just another fun as the rest of the Muppet movies would be with decreasing impact. No, it's a charming, gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business, and is as effective today as it was 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10.
