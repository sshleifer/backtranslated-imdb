At the beginning of the 80s I was able to record THE DION BROTHERS on television (with the commercials). I've lent it to many friends, all of whom agree it's one of the best "bandit" movies ever made. One day, when I went to my apartment in NYC, I saw Stacy Keach filming a scene for his television series Mickey Spilane. We had a moment to chat and I told him how much I enjoyed THE DION BROS and thought it a classic. He thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable movie experiences of his career. He was very friendly and sincere, and I was grateful for the few moments he needed to talk to a fan. This is a classic that needs to be on DVD.
