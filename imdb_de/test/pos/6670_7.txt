Who is the man ~~~ What do I hear? An echoing cry from Kevin? If you did not scream for the 'usual suspect', I would recommend changing your prescription prescription. Anyway, this is not a first class movie, just a very well produced story that is almost credible. Considering that this is an alien, you are probably wondering what that is? All the plays are top stuff and the first one I've seen is a balanced, sarcastic alien. Just kidding everything and almost for the whole family (if not for the scene later in the movie). SEVEN STARS
