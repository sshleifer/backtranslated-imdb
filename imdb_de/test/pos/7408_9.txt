It is characteristic that this film is not better known. It obviously lacks the most elements that a successful theatrical film needs: heroes, villains, conflict and dissolution, romantic love interest sad, angry, hurt and hungry and no one has a solution for anything. In short, it's war and it's hell for everyone involved. People are trying to do the best, but interfere with interests, loyalty and so-called duty. The picture takes us back in time to the Civil War, with an intensity that is rarely seen in today's cinema. Uncomplicated honest pictures of intense beauty. The actors are very well-staffed for the story and let the characters really come to life before our eyes. <br /> <br /> A silver dollar in a pile of nickel!
