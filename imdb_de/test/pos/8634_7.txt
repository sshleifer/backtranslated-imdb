Bud Abbott and Lou Costello have always had a good following among children, but in their careers, one could say that they made only one film that could be intended for children. Jack and the Beanstalk was the one movie. <br /> <br /> It was part of a two independent Warner Brothers image shop, the second film was Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd. These were the only two films the guys made in color. <br /> <br /> The two, who are out of work as usual, take on a job as a babysitter for a very precocious and vile young David Stollery. Although Costello begins to read the boy, Jack, and Beanstalk as bedtime stories, the young fellow ends up reading them to Costello. Lou falls asleep and in his dreams he fantasizes that he is indeed Jack the Giant Killer. Buddy Baer, ​​who threatens the boys in Africa, plays the giant and has a huge size, Dorothy Ford, as housekeeper. Dorothy was a big girl, 6'2 ", and you can imagine that she had trouble unless her height was used as a joke ... One of the few players who ever looked down on her was John Wayne in Three Godfathers, 6 Years' 4 ". Henry Fonda and James Stewart in On Our Merry Way were barely above her, but their size was again part of a gag. <br /> <br /> Shaye Cogan and James Alexander were the princess and the prince of fantasy, and they sang beautifully, but could not be worth anything. This was the last film by William Farnum, whose career came from the early days of silent film and even from the turn of the century. He played the father of Princess Shaye as king. <br /> <br /> Some unremarkable musical numbers came from Jack and the Beanstalk, except for the theme song. I still remember well, when I was a kid, having Bud and Lou's 78 record sang the song and recited the story. I was in my early single-digit years, but became a lifelong fan of the television series and its television series. <br /> <br /> Jack and the Beanstalk is still a good picture for the little ones, though I would warn parents, to warn their little villains not to imitate the young master Stollery.
