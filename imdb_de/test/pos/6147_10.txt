When I saw "Wirey Spindell" I could only laugh at what was happening on the screen. Wirey sure has a lot of play by guys and women, but I was confused as to why the actor, the Wirey in H.S. was 10 years old. Then the actor changed his age to 20 to play Wirey when he was a senior in HS ... but whatever, I thought it was funny.
