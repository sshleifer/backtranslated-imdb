"Bride of Chucky" is one of the better horror films of the past decade and could be one of the best horror movies of the 90s. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Chucky's girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) finds his spent remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of Part 3 and wakes him up their caravan park to life. Her neighbor Jessie (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) are tormented by her uncle. (John Ritter) Tiffany angers Chucky when he refuses to marry her. She buys a doll that he can play with. Chucky kills Tiffany and transfers her soul to the doll she got him. To get them back into the human body, they have to travel to New Jersey to get an amulet. Jessie sees this as an opportunity to run away from Knight, and they set off, but not before knights of Chucky and Tiffany are killed. Along the way, they force some bizarre incidents to stop at a bed and breakfast. If several people are killed, they call their best friend (Gordon Woolvett) to improve the situation. They convince him that none of the killers is because the police have started to clear up the crimes. He finds Ritter's body in a trunk behind the van. He thinks he has been set up and introduces them to them. Chucky and Tiffany then become real to prove that they did. Woolvett is killed. The group steals a camper and arrives at the cemetery. Jessie and Jade make Chucky and Tiffany attack each other and give them enough to escape. Chucky recaptures Jade and forces her to get his amulet. Chucky and Tiffany start their feud again, leaving Jessie and Jade enough time to kill them both when the police arrive and free them from the crimes. <br /> <br /> The good news: I have to give the most money from props to the FX department, as Chucky and Tiffany as dolls are completely convincing. The scenes with them together are the main highlights of the film, including a fun conversation in which Tiffany Chucky discusses how serial killers work in the 90s. That being said, the number of one-liners in this movie that are actually funny is unbelievable. Chucky gets most of them, but Tiffany also cracks some gems. It's actually funnier than what Hollywood calls comedies nowadays. The Gore is plentiful and frighteningly realistic. Several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative. Making Knight a new form of pinhead was an absolutely brilliant scene. The wedding couple was also a beautiful death scene. For the love of young people, the combination of Stabile and Heigl is great. They have great chemistry and actually behave like a normal couple. I must also admit that when I saw this movie for the first time, I jumped in certain scenes and that shows what an incredible job director Yu did. He apparently learned enough to do the same with Freddy vs. Jason. He knows how to stage setups and pay-offs, and here he shows some great skills that have an influence and style from Hong Kong. He could be the next big horror director if he fills himself with movies like these two again and again. Nice soundtrack like "Freddy vs. Jason". <br /> <br /> The bad news: For fans of kitschy films, this is a great find. However, this movie has a high cheese factor that can stop the serious horror movie fan from enjoying this movie. The movie knows it's a cheesy movie and indulges in it, turning off a serious fan for things like the one-liners. It's not so bad of a movie, but it has to be seen in the mental image that it's a cheesy movie and that the cheesiness of certain scenes contributes to the movie, not to take it away. Get away from this state of mind and you might enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: fans of cheesy films and the other "Child's Play" films will enjoy this film a lot. For serious horror fans you should check it out, but remember that this is not a serious movie and that the dairy should be there and you may like it. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Graphic violence, graphic language, short nudity on a doll, a cheating puppet sex scene, some drug use and numerous drug names.
