I liked that pretty much, but I have friends who hated that. There is no sex, but in each of the episodes there is very little nudity - which is a good thing. Keitaro also has a toilet fixation that has been studied in at least half of the episodes. (Toilets are much more advanced in Japan.) Hmm, I wonder why I rated it that high ...? It's certainly not like I like naked cartoon girls. In some ways, Keitaro Oe (the main character) is analogous to Johnny Bravo, except that Keitaro is not an annoying, muscular jock, but a hyperactive nerd. Or you can think of him as Japan's answer to Leisure Suit Larry. It's easier to take if you see it subtitles instead of syncing it, but it will grow with you if you give it a shot. He is the goldenboy. <br /> <br /> The formula is the same for every episode. Boy meets girl, boy tries to conquer girl's heart, although he is a stupid pervert, boy somehow manages against all odds. Usually the girl does not know she likes Keitaro until he's beaten to pulp and / or has put on a spectacular trick, such as developing a modern operating system within a week or winning a race against a gasoline motorcycle with his bike. <br /> <br /> Episode # 1 features a rich software tycoon. I think that animating her breasts seriously affects the budget because she is the only woman who has this kind of animation. She also dresses completely unprofessional. Most people who judge this negatively probably never passed the first episode. <br /> <br /> Episode # 2 has the rich, young daughter who loves to tease. She is only 16 years old, but in Japan is the minimum age (and in some US states I could add). Her father is also a brutal Yakuzza type who has a reputation for killing people who are interested in his daughter. <br /> <br /> Girl # 3 is the sweet innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner who is mixed up with a bad friend. Apart from the fact that Keitaro was disturbed for the girl and kissed by a man, there is virtually no ecchi in this episode - a significant decline from the previous two. Nevertheless, Keitaro and the bad friend really beat each other. <br/> <br /> Episode # 4 lets Keitaro try to impress a first-class swim coach. Keitaro seems to be more concerned about his intentions with this particular girl than any other ... and in return she's pretty straightforward ... <br /> <br /> Girl # 5 is the Biker Baby. She is probably the most headstrong of the 6 (even if she's not overweight like Girl # 1) and "rasseste" in terms of sexuality and vulgarity. This particular episode is slightly surpassed in terms of (missing) realism. Keitaro would have had to break every bone in his body at least twice during the race against the Biker Babe, but I think the producers and authors said, "It's just a cartoon, we can do it all!" This loss of reality makes him a fan favorite. Finally, episode # 6 introduces a new girl (this works in animation), and the previous 5 girls help Keitaro while trying to deal with an impossible time and resource constraints to get an OAV up to get out of the door on the deadline. In terms of Ecchi, this is also very tame, but there is a lot of humor. In the end, all five extremely pretty girls of the past team chased Keitaro, who slipped unnoticed, allegedly with the intention of rape him. Yes, that happens -ALMOST in real life. Someone crossed Ukyo Tachibana (aka Samurai Shodown) with Steve Urkel (ala Family Matters) ... All in all there is no middle ground. You will either hate it or love it. If you're new to anime, you probably do not want to start with it. If you can stand characters like Happosai (by Ranma 1/2) or Johnny Bravo, or if you like comedies that are more stupid but have very sexual overtones, you should try it.
