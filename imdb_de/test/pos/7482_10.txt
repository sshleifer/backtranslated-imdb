I was referred to this movie by a friend. I had never heard of it, but I thought it had Christopher Lampbert, so I rented it and found out it was not Christopher Lampbert. It was Thomas Jane who was great in this movie. I think it's great that almost the whole movie plays in this suburban home. The characters were great and the script was awesome. I really wish I wished Skip Woods would write another movie and direct it. In my book Thursday is the immaculate story of this man trying to kill the woman and the child after a dodgy past, but then his old drug dealer buddy turns up and it gets pretty Thursday. This is one of my favorite movies, and it shows a real potential in Thomas Jane. But this movie is very rare, but I found it in a few Hollywood videos on VHS. Dust the old video recorder and let it get up on Thursday because it receives the seal of approval of Pee Wee
