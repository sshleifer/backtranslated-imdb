Samuel Goldwin has been trying for years to bring his friend Jascha Heifetz to the screen. When Goldwyn and his wife Frances dined with Heifetz and his wife, silent movie star Florence Vidor, one night, Goldwyn suggested Heifetz be made a star in a movie. After some conviction Heifetz agreed, on the condition that his action is kept to a minimum. And the movie, originally titled "Music School", was born. <br /> <br /> The story itself is rather exciting: a street boy (Gene Reynolds, known as the producer of "M * A * S *"). Has run away from home and lands at a financially troubled music school by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan). In an attempt to raise money for the school, the boy and several other children come through Heifetz at Carnegie Hall. After a long appearance Heifetz appears at the school concert and sponsors the school. <br /> <br /> Although the story is predictable, it's surprisingly well written, though the film contains several smaller gaffs that put together different scenes. The most obvious is the young cellist who is sent out of the orchestra room on a stage errand and is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, how good the drama is. As usual in studios back then, the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with seasoned talents: Brennan, Joel McCrea, Andrea Leeds, Porter Hall, Marjorie Main (later famed by Ma and Pa Kettle), Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey and Who's Who of character actors. The actress Diana Lynn and the singer / actress Kaye Connor debuted in this film (as did the longtime Nelson Eddy vocalist Gale Sherwood (as Jacqueline Nash)). Child veteran actors Reynolds, Walter Tetley and Terry Kilburn also appear. Goldwyn hired the Peter Meremblum Symphony, a highly regarded youth orchestra from the Los Angeles area, to participate in the film. Most of the children in the orchestra were not actors, but they were excellent musicians and professionals (who later became many). Many of the children in the orchestra made notable careers: Kaye Connor and Diana Lynn both in the theater and in the films, Richard Berres was a producer and director, Mitchell Lurie founded a well-known music company, Elliott Rapaport As a prominent cardiologist, Lewis Elias was the bandleader, Thomas Facey Conductor with various symphonies, Channing Robbins a prominent instructor at Julliard School, his sister Joyce Robbins an instructor with SUNY Stonybrook and many of the orchestra's children followed the musical career with great symphony orchestras. <br /> <br /> While Heifetz's acting was kept to a minimum, his salary was not paid. He offered $ 70,000 for seven weeks. When some scenes had to be re-shot at a later date, he received another $ 50,000 for another four weeks. Luckily, what was not kept to a minimum was his musical output. The composer Alfred Neumann (former conductor of the Meremblum Orchestra) took over the score. Heifetz performs the "Introductionne and Rondo Capriccioso" by Camille Saint-Saens, his own arrangement of Manuel Ponce's "Estrellita" (with an off-screen Teddy Saidenberg), Dinicu's devilishly difficult "Hora Staccato" (from a Vitaphone recording with Emanuel) Bay at piano), an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's "Melody", arranged for violin solo excerpt from Tchaikovsky's well-known "Adante Cantabile" from his Opus 11-string quartet (played at the beginning of the film at the beginning of the film), and the final movement of Felix Mendelssohn-Barthody's E minor Violin Concerto. In all of these performances, there are many close-ups of Heifetz's performance, including some close-ups of his fingerings and inflections, which would be of value to violinists who want to study his technique. The Meremblum Orchestra also shines here with the arias "Caro Nome" by Verdi and "Casta Diva" by Bellini (both with Sherwood vocals), an arrangement of the overture of Rossini's "Barber of Seville", a short excerpt from Mozart's "One Little Night Music "" and the already mentioned Mendelssohn Concerto (with Heifetz) Diana Lynn can be heard in the background of a scene in which part of Chopin 's Nocturne in B minor is played, and a five - year Mary Ruth performs Chopin' s popular "Minute "Waltz up. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an excellent movie, AMC has shown it regularly until early 1992. I have not seen it on TV in recent years, but copies of it are not hard to come by If you have the chance, I strongly suggest you watch the movie.
