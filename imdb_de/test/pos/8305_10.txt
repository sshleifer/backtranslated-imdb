My father took me to this film when it was released in 1976. I was just a kid and it scared the shit out of me. So much so that I had to leave the theater during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene because it was too intense for me !!! I went home for the safety of my family. I saw the film through and through as I got older and really enjoyed it. Pity about the men in monster suits. If you overlook the cheapness of production and immerse yourself deeper, you will find a great performance from Cushing, an impressive opening score, some nice photos, and the ever-reliable Mr. Douglas McClure, my childhood hero, come to an end! Titty bang bang cave woman! Monster with beaks! Actors in monster suits gliding on wires! That has everything! Outstanding.
