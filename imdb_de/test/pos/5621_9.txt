David Lynch shot his first movie "Erasurehead" for several years, adding new scenes every time he could raise some more money. Kevin Smith did "office workers" at work while working as an office worker, and Robert Rodriguez could boast that "From Dusk Till Dawn" cost exactly $ 30,000. But $ 30,000 is still a lot of money if you work as a cleaning lady in a cemetery. And what if an aspiring filmmaker had not only such a job, but the ambitions of such luminaries and all the Dorkishts of Smith, but absolutely no talent. Such a character is Mark Borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary documenting his years of trying to make a couple of films. Borchardt combines his crazy dreams with depression and a deadly inability to call it every day. one senses that he would prefer the endless work of finding impossible perfection to almost one lodging, with the reality that he is simply not very good (due to the evidence presented in 'American Movie'). And like a modern Ed Wood, he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of losers, his sincere affection for which he represents his greatest salvation. The collection includes his martial parents, his best friends (a criminal, a reformed drug addict), his own unfortunate children, and his best uncle Bill. Bill may live in a caravan park and have almost given up on life, but he owns a small fortune ($ 280,000, to be exact), and the touching but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men is central to the film. Borchardt manages to win some actors (of course, next to himself), but most of all, he relies on friends and family to complete his work (even Bill has a role in front of the camera). On British television, the BBC has planned a brilliant screening of American Movie with Lost in La Mancha, the story of Terry Gilliam's unfortunate attempt to film Don Quixote. In this film, one was impressed by the great professionalism shown (inadequate for the task at hand), and how damn difficult it is even for experts with millions who have to spend on a film; Borschadt, on the other hand, is not only destitute but also such a clown that he can not properly pronounce the name of his own work ("coven"). Ultimately Borschadt is so human that you want to succeed, but terrible enough that the viewer can still laugh at his mistakes. If this movie was a fiction, you would dismiss it as unbelievable; But it's one of the funniest documentaries you'll likely see.
