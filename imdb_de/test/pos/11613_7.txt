I finally found the excellent Sazuma DVD of this movie, loaded with interesting extras. I read a lot about it and unfortunately missed it at the Stockholm Film Festival. It's not quite what I had imagined, but it's still worth it if you like strange and unique films. I prefer to watch that, as so-called Hollywood horror movies have been inherited in recent years. What distracts me from the experience are certain musical features that are outdated and rely too much on cheap synth sounds. For me, all these tonal / harmonic elements of the score could have been singled out and replaced with the outstanding sound design of David Kristians. However, this is only my opinion. Otherwise, this is a bold, angry image with welcome meditative and poetic parts, such as the fading of the image sequence, which is beautiful. I look forward to seeing Ascension, and I welcome Mitch and Karim for their efforts to produce non-mainstream films. They are a great inspiration as I can soon start my own short film production.
