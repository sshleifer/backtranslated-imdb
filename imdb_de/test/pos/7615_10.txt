I saw it when it first came out and have seen it several times since then. I have the DVD. It's one of Drew Barrymore's best works and one that's more than worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Not being popular in high school was one of the things I could relate to. I was not as tortured as Josie (during her high school days) or Aldys, but I was never the type to count on the big parties. The prom scene was when the three beloved girls fell victim to their own prank while Josie pushes Aldys (the intended victim), my favorite scene is and I slapped when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> I can still see this movie today. it is excellent.
