The sad thing about Frontline is that when you've seen three or four episodes of it, you really begin to understand that it's not far from what's happening in real life. What is really sad is that it is also extremely funny. <br /> <br /> The Frontline team of the first series consists of Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence) - a man who really lives and dies only on the basis of the ratings that his show gets. Occasionally, his stunts to reach those ratings are seen by his line producer Emma Thompson (Alison Whyte); a woman who has not lost her journalistic integrity and is willing to occasionally defend moral concerns. The same can not be said of Reporter Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) - a reporter who has all the substance sucked out of her - so much so that when she interviews Ben Elton, she has to be told to laugh. Her reports usually consist of interviewing celebrities (with whom she was previously "crossed" or not) or scandalous, unethical reports that usually backfire. Martin De Stasio (Tiriel Mora) is the reporter with whom the team relies for gravitas and dignity, having the intelligence of 21 years of journalism behind them. He does not have as much principles as a good journalistic history, though occasionally he draws a line. Mike Moore (Rob Sitch) is a selfish, na√Øve reporter who can not see that he's just a pretty face for the grubby journalism. He often finds his morale being compromised simply because Brian addresses his vanity and his stupidity does the rest. <br /> <br /> Frontline is the kind of show that needs more, because it shows that happiness, security and deep political insight are interesting things in this day and age. It's a lot easier to rate with scandal, fear and boulevard celebrities.
