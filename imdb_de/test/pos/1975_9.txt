This was a great movie, I would compare it to the movie The Game. They come to the end of the movement and can not move ... Their brain was removed and shaken (not stirred) and put back in your head. Do not plan for this movie, you will need time to think about what just happened. <br /> <br /> Do not come to this movie and expect the Matrix style, which is spent with multi-million effects for special effects, they keep you involved, no, they suck you in and leave you during the the entire duration of the film does not go off. Great show, great plot ... very enjoyable movie, I can not say enough. Very original plot, many twists and ideas that I never thought of. The end is abrupt and leaves you wondering, was that really? Is that really the end? Good end, not to say that it is bad ... leaves you wondering, and a little bit crazy. <br /> <br /> Great movie for those who like action, like a good action (do not make up for a swim break in this movie, you'll come back lost) and like brain games because that's exactly what it is ,
