*** Contains Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> A nice movie with Brad Renfro and the always wonderful Joseph Mazzello. I like Joseph Mazzello. Of all the films I have seen so far, I loved each of them for a variety of reasons, and The Cure is no different. Brad Renfro is also very good in this movie. The Cure is a film from the perspective of a sick child and his friend. The basic idea is: Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) has AIDS. He makes friends with the boy next door (Brad Renfro), but Erik's mother is very narrow-minded, ill-informed, and a little bit thicker when it comes to Dexter's disease. She considers AIDS as contagious as the common cold, so she does not want her son to be near Dexter. After many attempts to do their own healing without success, the boys go to New Orleans to find the cure after reading a pamphlet about it. After Dexter got his tricks from the Playboy magazine, he goes south shortly afterwards and as his health hurts, there are still enough lives left for Erik and two pranks to catch his breath. Unfortunately, poor Dexter is actually dying of his illness, leaving poor Erik to wonder why he could not find the remedy. Throughout the film, he associates more with Dexter's mother than with his own. <br /> <br /> It's a very heartwarming movie that's not necessarily perfect (movies are rare), but that does not interest you since you're more involved in the movie. A must for Joseph Mazzello fans, one of his best performances ever. Highly recommended must-have movie - if you can find a copy :)
