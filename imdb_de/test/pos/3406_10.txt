This was the movie that was about the Civi War. Actually, my aunt played extra in the wedding scene of Justin and Madeline in this movie, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was real and accurate. The costumes were tastefully made, the order was fine and even the accents were good. I love Patrick Swayze and James Ried a lot. They were the best 2 choices and even had a great side cast. The Civil War is my favorite pastime in American history, and I love movies about it. I've already seen a few, and this movie and its Sequal North and South Book 2 tasted the cake. If you have not seen it, rent it. As fast as possible. It's quite a training.
