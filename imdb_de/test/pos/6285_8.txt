When I first saw this film being watched on TV, I was just new to pauly shore, as that joke of a comedian who wore weird outfits back then. I still decided to look at it, and I was impressed. Shore brings fresh wind to the screen. In this movie he plays a college counselor who probably needs his own counselor. carla gugino plays becca, a midwestern farm girl with a simple family and a cinematic friend, travis, in an underrated role. As she sets off for ucla, she learns to crawl and quickly turns her into a bubbly Californian girl. She decides to bring crabs home for the Thanksgiving break. If Travis chooses a suggestion, Becca needs a distraction. crawl then decides to make everyone believe he and becca are already busy. As a result, crawling spiced up romance between becca's parents, making friends with her brother and even making the dancers at the local bar lose a little. I will not reveal the end, but I liked it. Still, do not rent it if you want a gripping performance. rent it, if you want to laugh your butt and enjoy an often missing part of the 90s humor.
