I was really surprised to see this movie on cable television a few years ago. History is a wonderful example of how our country is constantly changing and how to stick to it and use it as needed. Contradictory wishes of the "population" and the government. The actors were amazing in their depictions and I absolutely fell in love with Tantoo Cardinal - she's so believable and was such a character in this movie, just like Rip Torn. The story was also a love story about the country, the past and between the two main characters. I tried to buy this movie and could not find it - but I would like to own it.
