Angels are a bit of an American obsession but are often boring. They are the messengers of God, and also the Arc Angels are great warriors (Lucifer is the hardest and best looking until he was kicked out of heaven). What happens when you do not believe in it All, not to mention angels, and you are sent to investigate an angelic story just to make one with wings rather than an angelic attitude. <br /> <br /> Perhaps what America needs to be a Puritan is different from the good. Michael is a rude, abominable, female messenger of the sky who will fulfill your desires and make you look after the world so that you are touched sentimentally, intelligent without being smart ... it's just a good one , simple, little comedy. Watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
