Crazy Scottish Warrior Race, stranded deep in space, with no food and no budget, started now with ten years that will help these men, with visual effects that are only halfway shit, but I liked the crazy being when I hit one, then I would have fled, but not if I had Scottish buddies, we would swear and avoid this fate, and in the end it was not messy, it was a DVD that I was glad to have watched, but if ever they had one Continuing to make some actors empty, not all were the same, some were good, with rough drama, some were made of wood and perhaps should pack it, but the action made me watch everything, the shooting, the screaming, did not stop, I say my friends, that they should not be afraid, and look again in another year.
