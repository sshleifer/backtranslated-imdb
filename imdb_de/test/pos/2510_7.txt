Although it's definitely a pleasant way to spend a few hours, and it's always worth a watch, this movie never quite reaches its destination for two reasons. First, after the first 45 minutes, she focuses heavily on Helen and Johnny, who are far less interesting characters than most - Janet, Jennifer, George, and Miss Scattergoods are all much more tempting. Although this works initially, in life we ​​do not always know everything about everyone else, and because Helen is interested in being somewhat self-responsible, it quickly becomes lean and we want to see more of the other characters. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the movie seems to be losing in the second half in terms of plot. The letter itself has far less meaning than the first half, and although it works well in some ways, it seems strange to leave so much of the potential shown in the first half. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is sweet and good-natured, with some really funny moments - for example, Janet explains spices to an enthusiastic audience. The lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that Helen feels is heavy and the feeling of living in a small coastal town is well illustrated, but the movie is not quite as intelligent as it tries to be. It just lacks a light romantic comedy and a smart portrait of life. However, it is still good and if you have the chance, it is definitely worth a visit.
