When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it would be a terrible annoyance, directed by first-time director Liev Schrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely changed my mind. Everything is Illuminated is based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer and tells the story of a young Jewish-American collector (masterfully played by Elijah Wood) who tries to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in World War II. He travels to Germany and signs up with the help of a 20-year-old club that beats translators and his grandfather. This leads to a rigid search across the country and they are determined to find what they are looking for. Shot in one of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, Everything Is Illuminated provides tensions between the translator and his grandfather, as well as the help Jonathan needed to find his quarry. There is also much religious theme, as the grandfather Jonathan described as "the Jew". All in all, this is a movie that deals with finding your own family and family. I give this wonderful, though not lit, film a 10 out of 10.-Arjun
