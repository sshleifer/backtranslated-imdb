Conrad Phillips plays in the action-adventure series of the fifties - William Tell. William Tell is a recalcitrant freedom fighter who plays in the 14th century during the hostile Austrian occupation of Switzerland. William Tell is the Swiss version of Robin Hood. Conrad Phillips plays the protagonist fantastically. It is possible that Pascal Bugnion had a greater success in this role, but was not available at the time of filming. The classic action show consists of 39 series. The episodes are in black and white, but this does not affect the entertainment in any way.
