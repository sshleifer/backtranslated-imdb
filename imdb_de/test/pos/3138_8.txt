It takes a while to get used to the sound of Sons of The Pioneers, but then you enjoy it. If the soundtrack were played by an orchestra like Max Steiner or Dmitri Tiomkin, it would lose its folkloric character. The music directs the film, everything seems to follow its rhythm. The whole cast is excellent. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. are the young men who lead the caravan. Ward Bond is the Mormon leader and Joanne Dru is a flirtatious actress. Ford could make out of a common Western, something completely different and original, that showed us the music, the dances and above all the people.
