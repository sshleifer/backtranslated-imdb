... but you probably saw it or you would not be here. It's so dark you probably stumbled upon it like me because this little-known gemstone does not get word-of-mouth. <br /> <br /> From the beginning you know how the action will shake out, but you look like our innocent red-haired nurse puts together the pieces of the puzzle and provides high-quality entertainment. Most horror movies bombard audiences with graphic depictions of torture, but Do not Look in the Basement plays it subtly, which creates supreme suspense. Note for horror movie makers: Some of us like subtlety! Pretty and homely nurse Charlotte takes a job at a sanatorium, but is shocked to learn that the head doctor who hired her has had a horrible accident and now reports to a mysterious doctor we all know. The tension comes from clarifying events by Charlotte with the help of many patients, but which patient can Charlotte trust? This is a gem and is my absolute favorite TRUE HORROR movie. I love Re-Animator and Evil Dead, but they play more for the audience of HORROR-COMEDY. <br /> <br /> VIOLINCE: $$$ (Pretty tame for horror standards, but there's a lot of spray throughout the movie The opening scene is classic, no other horror movie starts off better, and the end also has a decent one Share of thrills. <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$ (eager to fall in love with Allyson (Betty) Chandler) spends a lot of time naked and tries to seduce half the men in the sanatorium.Betty Chandler is a knockout and I'm shocked that this is their only movie credit. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ $$ (The story is handled well, though the Hollywood premise has covered many miles.) The script has the ability Tension builds up and brings poor Charlotte into a precarious situation again and again.) <br /> <br /> $$$$ (Betty Chandler does the best job here as Allyson and captures dementia with naivety in an ethereal way.) The judge was great, too, and weighed the facts before moving on to Rosie H. Z A verdict came Olotik as Charlotte gives a real performance as you will feel for her character.
