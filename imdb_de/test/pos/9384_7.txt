A big bed that has a demon eats people, among other things. I do not mind that. <br /> <br /> Completed in 1977 and officially released in 2003, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe. You probably know it thanks to Patton Oswalt's excellent contribution as well as the important book "Nightmare USA" by Stephen Throwers. While you see it, you're wondering about the following. <br /> <br /> -Who is George Berry, and what kind of drugs did he smoked / injected / snorted before he wrote and directed this movie? <br /> <br /> Is this a horror comedy? A combination of a horror movie and an art film? A funny prank that is drawn to the audience? <br /> <br /> -What the hell am I watching? <br /> <br /> "Death Bed" really defies any explanation. I know that term is overused, but it could not be truer than here. This is really a description for beggars. It's a horror comedy as well as art movie / horror hybrid. But the whole thing is so surreal, it has to be seen. The score sounds like the electronic pieces of an old Candlemass album, acting is terrible and disconnected, the direction is surprisingly competent, and the movie sometimes feels like a Jesus Franco movie - if his films were deliberately funny. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is really no right way to describe this movie. Lord knows, I've tried it, but actually only a few films are as strange, unique or insane as these. See it ... but you have been warned. This is also the only movie George Berry has ever made. He has definitely left his mark on the exploit genre, I'll tell you.
