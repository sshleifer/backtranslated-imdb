I should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in art because they are human and the vast majority of people are naturally lazy. The simplified idea that Ingmar Bergman's 1968 big film Shame (or Skams) is just an anti-war movie damages the reputation of this very complex and highly nuanced film. Compared to the more cinematic Showoffy predecessors Persona and Hour Of The Wolf Shame is in terms of narrative a rather classic film. But the key word is apparently, because while lacking persona's bravado-pop psychology and Hour Of The Wolf's gaudy horror movie homage, it's one of the best films ever made about war - and not an anti-war movie yet War Movie. As such, it has to be rated Wild Strawberries as one of its biggest films, as well as one of its best scripts, if not the best. <br /> <br /> Although supposedly a more psychologically outer film than the movies Against this background, it really says much more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive. It features Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps a nod to the notorious American spies who many European intellectuals considered innocent), two musicians who played for the local Philharmonic before the outbreak of war. and they retired to live on a small piece of land on an island, and were content to work in a greenhouse. The country they live in is not named, as is the island they live on, even though the film was filmed on Bergman's small island of Far√∂, at the northern end of the Swedish island of Goddess. It seems that their nation has been at war with an invasion country for some years, or perhaps waged a civil war with rebels from another province. This is all deliberately blurry, as this war is supposed to symbolize all wars. This is compounded as the movie begins with various wartime quotes on the screen as the credits roll. These include quotes from American military figures from Hitler to Vietnam. After early scenes depicting the prosaic nature of their rural life, and after the war, in which even old men are drafted, an air raid ravages the land of the Rosenberg, while enemy jets fly overhead, dropping bombs and being chemical An agent's weapons seem orange like nature. A plane is hit and a parachutist jumps out and lands in a tree. Jan, who starts the film as a sniffing coward, refuses to help, so Eva goes alone. Jan comes to her and they find that the pilot was shot. It seems that he is actually part of the invading or possibly rebellious force. A few government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask for the dead pilot. Then they advise the couple to leave home as the invaders are nearby. There are the misinterpretations of the film at the micro level, such as that of Bergman scholar Marc Gervais, who provided the film commentary on the DVD of the film. Like many other critics, he claims that Jacobi is a quisling who worked with the intruders. However, this is clearly and demonstrably wrong, because Jacobi is with the original fascist government. First of all, the invaders are repelled as evidence after they invade the land of the Rosenbergs and shoot their agitprop interview. We know that because the government, which asks her later after the fake interview, and the words of Eve's mouth, are alleged evidence of her betrayal, and Jacobi clearly cooperates with them, the fascist Big Brother extras. Second, Jacobi is responsible for deciding which inhabitants will be sent to concentration camps to work with the invaders, and the Rosenbergs are among the most vulnerable. Third, Jacobi says in his seduction of Eve that his son is on leave from the military. Of course, if he were an invader, he would not be so happy to speak of his son serving the state. Rebels are not official armies and do not grant official leave. After all, Filip is clearly among the organization's rebels or invaders, and why would he have killed a colleague? <br /> <br /> That Gervais and other critics so obviously and wantonly misinterpret and miss such a key The obvious point of this film challenges the ability to see all aspects of Bergman's films. This is a wonderful and great movie and very high in the Berman canon, but it is disappointing to read how so few critics and viewers really understand their complex message, instead choosing the cheap, lazy and simple claim of their being merely anti-war and one rather simple film compared to its two sharper predecessors. And that's Shame's real shame in the long run.
