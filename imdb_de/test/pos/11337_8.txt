"In the Mood for Love", a teasing allegory of loneliness and longing. Here is a movie without sex or even kisses - and undoubtedly one of the sexiest and definitely the most thought provoking and psychologically romantic I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Tell the story of two people who happen to live in the same apartment and are a door away from each other. Unlike "Random Hearts," the film is about how two people come together through the affair of their two lovers. Only after receiving this message will they take the time to reflect on the consequences of one affair and the other's feelings of having just dissolved - and whether the two people are ready to fall in love again /> <br /> The great thing about the film is the way director Wong Kar-Wai shows lonely handling of each character. With Maggie Cheung's character, he will show her in a repeated montage: leaving work, going home, watching her neighbors play, going to the noodle shop, leaving the noodle shop and meeting her attractive equivalent age played by Tony becomes Leung. This is a clever, if not subtle and knowing technique to present loneliness. Because when you are alone, when you get into a loop. This movie worked for me because I can identify with that feeling.
