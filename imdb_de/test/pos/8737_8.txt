Walter Matthau is wonderful as a dr. Philharmonic dr. Julian Winston, whose frequent girlfriends Goldie provides a textbook for the dangers of lying. Goldie Hawn's touching kick Toni Simmons undoubtedly deserved to win her Oscar. Ingrid Bergman's work as a nurse with stiff strength is as touching as she comes slowly and nervously out of her shell. This is a great movie you can see in spring or anytime. It is very underrated. I never heard of it until I found it in the video store, and what a find!
