Ok so Paris Hilton sucks it (typically Malibu Barbie), but the rest of the actors are just great! I saw the movie last night and I totally stuck to the movie. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just an Ace actor. Hero man in total. The main girl, who is the sister of Nick (chad), is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different than filming these days. Most of them are psychopaths, possessions and ghosts, but here you have a topic about wax! The wax models in the house made me crazy, even though they looked so real. At the moment I still do not have the story with the twins, I just wait for the DVD and look at it again. Thumbs up to such a great movie! 11/10. Anyone who does not like it, please do not bother 2 criticize my opinion, because most everyone thinks it's cool. I also think that the scene in Paris, when she takes off her underwear, is completely uncomfortable. Why not just let a dog fuck with a cat? Then that's more entertaining. When the death scene hit Paris, I thought it was poor as she kept running, even though a knife was just kicking up her foot. Hmm, interesting. <br /> <br />! CHAD ALL WAY!
