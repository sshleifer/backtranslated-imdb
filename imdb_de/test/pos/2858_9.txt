I am not sure why I wanted to borrow from my mother for "Nurse Betty". I'm just thinking, because I had heard a bit about this movie. But I am glad that I did it. "Nurse Betty" is an original and intelligent movie that has humor and a dark side. <br /> <br /> This was one of Renee's first big ones before starring in Hollywood. I can see why, she is an incredible actress. The scene where she finally realizes what happened, and she's on the set of her favorite soap opera, you can see pain, confusion, fear and embarrassment on her face. Just to get you into the movie, she plays Betty. She is a shy and insecure woman who is related to her abusive husband. She is a waitress and falls in love with soap operas, especially one in which a handsome doctor, Dr. Ing. Dave Revell, lives. When she accidentally sees her husband's murder in a separate room, they notice two clients she just had, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. Then she just loses her mind and leaves the city after talking to the police. She says she's her former fianc√©, dr. Dave Revell, must find. She travels the country to California to see Dr. Find Revell and is looking for a job as a nurse to work with Dave. She has seen the show so many times, somehow she is just awesome to be a nurse if she saves a woman's brother. Although everyone tells her she is insane, she just looks at her as if they were the crazy ones. When she meets the actor who plays Dave Revell, George (his real name) thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. She just looks at him confused and thinks that he and she belong together. Renee was fantastic, she was so believable in losing her mind in the movie. She has come this far, and depending on whether you want to admit it or not, she is adorable and a great actress. Morgan Freeman plays one of the assassins, Charlie, the father of the two. He is so enchanted and enchanted by Betty and while he persecutes her all over the country he almost falls in love with Betty until he almost falls in love with her. He and his son Wesley must find Betty when they find out she was at the scene and could reveal her identity. When Charlie sees Betty and finally gets her, she has scars at first, but calms down and they know that they have a real connection. It was a beautifully played scene, in my opinion Morgan gave a stronger performance. He is just great. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly decent performance from Chris Rock, the son Wesley. He is so "weapon" that he has to do the work in a hurry and take care of the business. I loved his comedy performance in the end, where he and the gang he holds hostage are watching the soap opera together. Classic. "Nurse Betty" is a great movie I would recommend for a good laugh and in all a nice, honest little movie that I think anyone can enjoy. <br /> <br /> 9/10
