People talk about how awful the script was and how awful the animation was, but Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer are truly a Japanese anime-style anime game. If you look at the anime today, it is done in the same style and is very popular. I do not think this movie should ever be seen by adults. I do not think it was ever meant to be serious. The things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things that I love. Rainbow Brite is in my opinion one of the best cartoon characters ever created. She is smart. She is funny. She cares about the environment. She cares about her friends. This film can teach so much to young children. My little brothers even liked this movie. I have to say that this film taught me a lot as a kid. When it came out on DVD, I was the first one who bought it. It's a great kids movie. What is, if it is not perfect, nothing is really perfect if you look at it closely enough.
