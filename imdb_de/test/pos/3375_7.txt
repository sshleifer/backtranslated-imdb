I will not lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot, but not really. And if you've seen the iconic films of iconic director Richard Kelly "Donnie Darko" and "Southland Tales," you know it has to mean something. When I saw this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. An hour before the movie, about half of the audience had already left. In the end, only 15 people asked what they would think to hell. I could only understand about 40% of what I saw on screen, and even then it can only be called interpretation. So why did I give this movie generous seven stars? For one thing, we get spectacular performances (Marsden is great and Langella returns as a familiar, creepy character), and especially two, because it's totally original and Richard Kelly, undoubtedly one of the bravest directors alive, uses his creative visions to to tell a story that dares to be different. To be honest, this is the ONLY way - only through Kelly's unique style could this story be told as intended. <br /> <br /> If in the end you are not ready to seriously engage in a smart movie (and even then it can not mean anything), stay away from it. However, if you want to look at a deep, rich, complex and thought-provoking piece about spirituality, existentialism, and the predictability of human nature, read this. However, be prepared for lengthy discussions with your partner. <br /> <br /> * Note: If you have read this review by accident, I have taken the recommendation and actually seen the movie, and you still believe that you have wasted 2 hours of your life, I would like to share my views communicate the entire meaning and the plot of the film. That's why I liked it so much - it promotes discussion! As hard as it is, I try to summarize it by describing a rather depressing quote from Langella's character, explaining to an employee the meaning of the simple box: "Your house is a box where you live. You went to work a box on wheels When you come home from work, you are sitting in front of a box of moving pictures, you are watching until the mind and soul rot and the box that is your body is deteriorating when you finally come you are placed in the ultimate box ... to rest under earth and earth.
