I just saw it at SIFF and I absolutely loved it. There were parts that made me laugh so hard that I could not catch my breath. The script and direction of Glenn McQuaid are fantastic. I can not wait to see more of this talented young man. The performances make the movie. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are just as adorable as Graverobber Willy and his apprentice Arthur. Ron Perlman offers (as usual) a fantastic performance as a less sympathetic prison priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! As always, he balances out threat and humor perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is a style of horror comedy that has not really been seen in blood since Vincent Price's "Comedy of Terror," "The Raven," and "Theater." The movie is really scary in some places , then he will suddenly return to fun mode and totally off balance Some parts are both scary and funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> I can only watch three movies this year at SIFF, but even if the other two are terrible, "I Sell The Dead" was well worth the price for all three, and I'm looking for more movies from Larry Fessenden's Glass Eye Pix, giving the horror genre a much needed kick in the ass.
