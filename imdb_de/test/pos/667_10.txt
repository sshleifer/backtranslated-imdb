Whoever has labeled this criticism a "bad taste" is not all there yet ... it's so funny, awesome and awesome that you can watch it until your eyes are square! Not to mention the rest of the work he has done for the rest of the series ... everything is as good as Morris' standards. If you think it's "terrible," "abominable," or "sick," then there's only one thing that comes to my mind to say, "go to hell." Many Thanks. it had to be said! I think the way so many people complain was a complete joke. I would like to shout to all the people who actually did that, "Do not you have anything better to do with your time, are you trying to prove it?" Thank you for reading my heartfelt review on this topic ... Cheers
