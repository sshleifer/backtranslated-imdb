Well, every scene is presented so perfectly. I've never seen a movie that has meaning in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, I remembered seeing "Amilie". Amilie is also a similar movie with more fun and imagination. These films are both based on the same plotline. But both are perfectly perfect in their own way and able to create their own world. Red can provoke many thoughts about fate and Dejavus in humans. And I still think about it. <br /> <br /> The story is great and the end is a bit funny. I laughed in the final scene. Well, funny how these three films are linked together Red White and Blue. <br /> <br /> All in all a great work of art. A work of a master. <br /> <br /> 10/10
