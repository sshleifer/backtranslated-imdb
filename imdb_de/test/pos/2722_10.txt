From "36 Chowringhee Lane" to "15 Park Avenue", Aparna Sen has indeed come a long way. If the first goes down in history as a pure d√©butant sweep, the latter as a "mature" movie will definitely take a special place. Until you see 15 Park Avenue, you can not imagine being excited and moved at the same time. They are thrilled to see how resourceful and agile the director is when it comes to presenting situations that are challenging and the sensitivity that comes with the movie. It's not a movie where you just feel how difficult life is for schizophrenics, but you ask a much deeper question about the reality you see and believe. Sen has done a brilliant job in highlighting the highest fact of our existence, that we are all somehow trying to live in our own world where we believe we are running for miracle games called happiness, peace and contentment. In addition to depicting a deceiving spirit, Sen's magic has produced many small nuances of human relationships as they endure stress and tension. The fact that we sometimes lose all peace, collapse, making wrong decisions, feeling guilty, selfish, and so on, is taken by Sen with extreme courage. She showed the cruel dilemma that Shabana had to overcome throughout her life, having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a husband and children. And when she was always with her sister, always a strong personality, providing support, making judgments, and so forth, she unwittingly cut off some of the oxygen her sister needed to flower. Is not that a very strict truth that sometimes, in trying to do the best for someone, we strangle their assertiveness and in the end, hurt their self-esteem? Of course, Konkona's and Shabana's acting deserves laurels, as if the ingredients had not been so good, the dish could not have been so extraordinary. Once again, Aparna Sen has made a masterpiece of a film for those who long for some "food for thought". Bravo!
