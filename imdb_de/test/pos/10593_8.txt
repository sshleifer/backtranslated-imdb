I do not know what CKY's crew is all about, but everything they produce seems to be awesome in their simplicity and stupidity. Haggard is so incredibly stupid and funny that it's almost comedic. Sometimes it makes absolutely no sense, but who cares? <br /> <br /> It made me laugh my ass. A must for the CKY / Jackass lover!
