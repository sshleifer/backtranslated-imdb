I think that's one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best in a movie, and I've seen most of her films. I first saw this on TV when I was about fourteen, and I was so scared. I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it a lot. I know this movie probably would not frighten people today. This just shows that the public film and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years. I love films that show no graphic details. You let your imagination do the work for you. The cast in this movie was first class. Jess Walton, who played the sister in the story, was very good, although her role was rather small. She also starred in a terrific TV thriller that at the same time titled "Do not you look at me again with David Hartman?". I got the biggest kick from Eileen Heckart's performance as a housekeeper. Eileen was as good as a woman with a very bad constitution. George Maharis, who played the husband, was pretty effective. This story obviously had many so-called mistakes in the plot, but I still love the movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good thriller without violence. I rated the film seven.
