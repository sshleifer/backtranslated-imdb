I think this is the first time I have seen a Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle movie. I really liked him in his (title) role as a butcher boy. The way he moves is in my opinion very funny, for example how he handles his knife and how he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor. His facial expressions really fit the role he plays, for example, how he winks at the audience in the end. But you could add that this was probably not too difficult. I think he deserves a longer career. As you probably know, it was ruined by greedy journalists who made money by publishing false allegations that he was involved in a scandal. The plot is not very important. In the first half, Fatty and Alum are employees in a shop, competing with Almondine's affection. After a fierce food fight, Almondine is sent to a girls' school by her father, the shopkeeper. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both Fatty and Alum enter the school on the train and the fight for Almondine continues. (The names of some of the characters differ in the version I've seen.) It seems that for some reason they have replaced the original title cards with new ones.) <br /> <br /> There are many morons food fights and Pratfalls, though in my opinion they are good. And there are some gags I really liked, for example, how to make the dog run the pepper mill (or is it a coffee grinder?) Or the scene where Fatty puts on a coat, although obviously this is not necessary or if Miss Teachem is the head of the girls' school, Fatty beats up and he beats her back. Buster Keaton is also funny in this first movie; a good addition to the cast. In the first half he is a customer in the store, in the second half he supports Alum in his fight for Almondine. I really liked his acrobatics. For example, when Fatty pushes him from one room in the school to another, he does not show a simple fall, but lands on his hands and head and makes a little pirouette. Watch out for a food-fighting scene: Alum throws a flour sack at him, but misses and beats the shopkeeper instead. This makes Buster laugh, which must be a rarity, as he usually always shows a neutral expression (which - as you probably know - has given him the nickname 'The Great Stone Face'). (One more note: Al St. John, who plays Alum, was the nephew of Fatty Arbuckle and later became famous for the role of "Fuzzy," which he played in many westerns.) <br /> <br /> I Me Does not like this as much as I like it, like "One Week" and "The Balloonatic" (movies that Buster did later without "Fatty"). And it did not make me laugh often - but I had to smile a lot, so I gave it eight points.
