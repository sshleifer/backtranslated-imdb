For just a few movies with his life the late Great Chris Farley. Farley died in late 1997 and is mostly missing from fellow actor Tommy Boy, David Spade. From the lame police academy 4 Spade has done really well with his film career. Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we see him. On Saturday night, NIGHT LIVE featured Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Beverley Hills Ninja, Almost Heroes, Billy Madison and Dirty Work. I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career. Tommy Boy was my best in my case, and I would keep paying attention and laughing in the same place every time. Thank you, Chris Farley.
