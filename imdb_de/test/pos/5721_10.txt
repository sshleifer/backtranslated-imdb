John Leguizamo's One Man shows are hit or miss: Mambo Mouth showed his intense characterizations and great timing, but the material was average, Spic-o-Rama was also the first time, but this time the material was funny, followed by Freak his disappointing sex-o-holic. But his stuff in Freak shows his genius and when he's in the limelight, he's without a companion. <br /> <br /> Freaks semi-autobiographical view of a young man's journey has power and resonance. I do not think that he himself was the creator of. Mr. Leguizamo gives us the chance to see his soul and gives us the opportunity to project our own life on his own, and there is no greater gift a performer can give. The willingness to drop, suspend, and divide the wall is too awful for most actors - they use characters to hide behind the scenes - but JL goes full throttle and reluctantly rejects all allegations. Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor were our best cultural observers / comedians / actors because they spoke from their hearts of what they saw in society, and the truth provided humor. Combine this with the gift of a great actor to be mimicry and being in the moment (not to mention a sense of humanity), and you will see that John Leguizamo has the power to do the same. At least in Freak, he does. <br /> <br /> From birth to his first big break, and every moment of life changing, a spectator sees our host and other characters in their most private moments, while he experiences the pain. Hope and humor that comes to it. At the end of the evening, JL rings with a tired, muscular, tense body and has offered his crazy life to an audience. Spike Lee's fluid camera work captures the nuances of the actor to the last curvature of the lips and the slow blinking. Scenarios range from drinking with his machismo-driven father (when he was nine years old) to the A Chorus Line with his gay, deaf uncle; the vicious humiliation of his first girlfriend when he undresses naked and likes to have sex. A nightmarish first sexual encounter with a large German woman on the back of a Kentucky Fried Chicken follows an unsuccessful attempt to pick up a "drunken Catholic" at St.Patty's Day in a bar. At a serious showdown with his mother and dad, his true genius is revealed here: he plays a scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such dramatic / humorous intensity that they forget that they are only one person. There are no costume changes, bad wigs, light tricks or make-up. Only an actor who gives everything. It's just amazing. <br /> <br /> Other actors / comedians who are taking off right now are Eddie Izzard and Chris Rock, but they are not as immersive in themselves as John Leguizamo. That's not a criticism, not a long time ago. I love her work, but Freak is different. It moves in a malicious way. It's the best one-man show and nobody will be able to touch it for long.
