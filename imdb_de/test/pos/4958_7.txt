I'm sorry, but I just can not help it, I love seeing Iron Eagle. Do not get me wrong, I'm not saying that this is a great movie. No, I would rather say that this is an endlessly entertaining movie. For people who cut this film into pieces because it is not realistic, the sense is missing. Of course, the plan of Iron Eagle was ridiculous. But I think the target audience was kids, and I sure remember being cool when I was little. Now I find it amusing only as a guilty pleasure, somehow like Road House. This movie is part of the great pantheon of the 80s, children who focus on the stodgy adult power structure movie. You must contact D.A.R.Y.L, Real Genius, E.T. etc. remember. If you ask me, it's worth the DVD if you look at Doug and Knotcher's "Ride the Snake" at the beginning. The whole sequence was so stupid! But at the same time it was weird, weird, totally '80s, all the good stuff. The bottom line is Iron Eagle is a big guilty pleasure of the 80s. The hairstyles, the dancing, the music, the dialogue, everything is funny as hell. I have Iron Eagle on DVD and for me it was worth $ 9.99 on Best Buy. If you like laughing at outdated, unrealistic action movies, this one is a must. Oh yes, and I think his conspiracy was only slightly more stupid than the other fighter plane of 1986, Top Gun.
