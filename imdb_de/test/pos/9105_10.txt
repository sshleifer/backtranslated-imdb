I was lucky enough to get free passes for previewing the POD. Let me just say, from the previews, I was excited to see it! The movie has rocked absolutely! What I really liked was the fact that JB was in his element. With other films such as "School of Rock" he makes well-known pamby music for children and families, but this music is obviously everything for him. <br /> <br /> I took my brother and sister to see her, and we basically laughed all the time. There are some places I wonder what the hell they were thinking, because some things are a bit incoherent, but for the most part it was great. Most of the time it did not seem like a low budget movie, so that's a plus. <br /> <br /> What surprised me most was Dave Grohl as Satan. That's funny! You honestly would not know that he is the movie. <br /> <br /> I say, if you're a rock fan and focus on JB, KG and / or Tenacious D, watch the movie. Be prepared for a lot of drug references, a lot of four-letter words and some skull shredding!
