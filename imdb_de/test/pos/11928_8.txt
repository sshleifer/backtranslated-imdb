I have not seen this for years, but when I was about 6 years old I saw it on VHS for the first time and must have seen it at least ten times. Well, as I said, it's been a while, so I could screw up the story, but I remember some Colombian terrorists kidnapped the school, demanding that the terrorist's boss (the "Desire Master") is released from prison. Now I could check the action here on IMDb, but I'm pretty sure that's true. Anyway, a group of boys in school decides that they do not just want to sit around and wait to die, so they decide to fight back. I have always remembered this film. There are so many images that I have not forgotten, such as the death scene of Joey (I think so?) Or billy spitting in terrorists' sandwiches, or a kid (not knowing his name) faking an asthma attack. just a great movie. It may be movies like these that have given me my tolerance of violence against movies, because if I remember correctly, this movie is pretty graphic. The guys are fired by helicopters, the hand of a special unit is blown away by a grenade (I'm not sure, but I remember something like the end), and the bloodiest thing is that the leading terrorist gets shot in the head bloody detail. Great action, great humor, good acting, wonderful movie experience. I have to see that again after all these years!
