Nazarin of the acclaimed surrealist Bunuel is obviously an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of value. It's not a visual movie and I think he played better on stage. Bunuel leads us through this man, the Nazarene, who lives like Christ. a true trailer, i. in poverty and without concern for property and what the next day brings. Some may call it a parallel to the history of Christ, but every follower and practitioner of the Word, life, should in a sense be like Christ. But essentially, Bunuel also asks about the point of view of man's selfishness and the need to sin and how goodness can save us all. It is a brave statement that can revive the movie for some or commemorate it. To be honest, the Nazarene is also selfish because he gives without wanting or demanding. His selfishness is his folly, and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin, with the same face on each side. Many people represent the sides of a coin in this film, with both faces the same. But the film is no longer memorable when it's over and you could attack many of its ethical perforations and effusions within the film's own teachings. Not a first-class Bunuel, but a "surreal" dream sequence in which Bunuel goes, where the message of the film is framed and worth mentioning, because it shows the ability of the director Bunuel.
