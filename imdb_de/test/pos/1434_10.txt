Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) was just released from a six-month drug rehabilitation program and spent his time exchanging cards for illegal gambling card games. He has great hope that he will seek a new life as a big band drummer. However, as he returns to his old criminal Chicago neighborhood, the pressure of his surroundings, including his wheelchair-driven wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker), is rapidly increasing to return to the old "dealer" lifestyle that first came to pass started on the path of self-destruction, which is a heroin addict. <br /> <br /> It's very rare for a movie to have as many great character appearances as this one. Frank Sinatra is superb as a Frankie Machine and realistically shows the symptoms of a drug addict undergoing a withdrawal that is probably better than anyone else who had been made before him. Sinatra here seems to have a keen understanding and awareness of his character and expresses the constant struggle for control over his own life, which takes place forever in the heart of Frankie Machine's husband. Parker as his crippled wife Zosch wants to own Frankie forever, make him make good money, take care of her, and pay her ever-increasing medical bills. Above all, she seems frightened of what she sees as a threat to her control of him, such as the freedom that a drummer's life could offer, or anything that could change the status quo between them. <br /> <br /> Spectator Molly (Kim Novak), a girl who lives in the same building and apparently has genuine, genuine feelings for Frankie. He has no desire to control him, but only to help him does he prove to be the best that Frankie has for him in the world, if he can just stay long enough to wake up and realize it. However, Darren McGavin, a heroin drug peddler, Louie is always there waiting in his wings, knowing that he's just pressing the right buttons, just to say that a former addict can fall back on that old habit, one for Louie is profitable, but deadly to the addict. <br /> <br /> Also the environment seems to have a life of its own, constantly dark, gloomy, run-down and criminal, with nowhere enough positive things to look forward to in life, to a place where it's all too easy is to escape from a bottle or drugs, is a quick "solution" that really is not a solution, but only to keep one in the dark of the daylight and all the bright prospects of the world. It's a nice thing that when Frankie is on the right track, the shot always seems brighter than walking the wrong road. While some argue that it's a bit outdated, for me it's a sombre film that shows a realistic inner war within a man for control of his own destiny, which has very strong character benefits from all involved. THE MAN WITH THE GOLD ARM receives my highest possible recommendation.
