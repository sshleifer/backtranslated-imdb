OK, anatomy is not a reinvention of the horror movie genre, but it's still done well. Good actors (first potter and leader) and some nice ideas made me happy. Maybe I would not have been so positive if this was not a German movie, but who cares. It's good to see familiar faces in a good, exciting story, with some blood and some good jokes. They're all complaining about the synchronization: I did not (of course) see a dubbed version, but I think it's not easy for you to watch dubbed movies. We (Germans) are used to watching such films, so that's not a big problem. But try to look in German with subtitles. The actors are really good!
