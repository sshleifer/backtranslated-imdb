I am very grateful that the small university town Abingdon, Virginia, near Bristol, TN. and home of the famous Barter Theater, where Gregory Peck once performed, he managed to put together an art film festival and show it there. Abingdon is two hours and an hour away from where I live, but the journey was worth it in every way. UZAK / DISTANT is an amazing, brilliant, shattering, emotional, captivating film. As a Turkish-American, this film was not just a testimony to what life is like in Turkey; On a larger scale, however, it tells the world what it's like to be Turkish, whether you live in Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York or Omaha. It can take two hours, as opposed to five minutes, but this is actually our Bob Marley song. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie. It is very difficult to choose only a few. But for me, a narrative scene takes place in a Beyoglu (Downtown Istanbul) cinema. The title character, played by Mehmet Emin Toprak, who unfortunately died in a car crash shortly after the film's completion, follows a very attractive young woman down the stairs to the main hall of the cinema. She goes to "Vanilla Sky". As the image of Tom Cruise is reflected from a glass, we feel that Turkish men are fighting with Tom Cruise for their own women, although Tom Cruise is nowhere to be found in Beyoglu. The scenes filmed across the shores of the Bosphorus are also enlightening as they symbolize beauty, but desperate empty chasms that are a painful fact in Turkey's life. In this movie the Golf separates lovers and families. A simple, empty packet of Samsun cigarettes (Turkish brand) and a dying mouse jump off the screen, just as seagulls do in the 1982 movie "Yol" by Serif Goren-Yilmaz Guney. Many of Guney's films, including "Yol", "Suru Herd" (1978 - finished by Zeki Okten) and "Baba-The Father" (1971), have been described by many as the best Turkish films ever made. Without Guney's sometimes overburdened socio-political anger (especially in his last film, the 1983 prison drama "Duvar-The Wall"), "Distance" captures the essence of Turkish life in a remarkable way. This is a coronation for a director, who in my view can already be described as the Turkish equivalent to directors like Tarkovsky, Bresson and Ozu. I can not wait to see his other films!
