I love this kind of movies. Blood, revenge, a lot of action, very dark, cheesy and more. But this does not provide the genre you might expect. When I saw Kite Birds and Ichi the Killer before, I enjoyed watching them, but why not? Dead or Alive: Final is a decent anime and it's not hardcore and does not even expect nudity in this movie. At least add some action to entertain the audience. Even the drama was not so good. Well, I do not want to spoil the movie or the plot. But I had the feeling Dead & Alive: Final is a bit nerf. So without further action. I can not recommend this movie to anyone, but I recommend to people who love decent and well-conducted anime.
