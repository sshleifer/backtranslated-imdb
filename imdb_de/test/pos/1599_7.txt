I'm not sure where to start. In short, it was a disappointing movie. After I taught the story, I knew it would be hard to make a movie. The film has some interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach), but it does not represent the art debate that characterizes the novella. <br /> <br /> For one I expected an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen years old, but he is described as being perfectly ideal, innocent, while in the movie he stinks of sexuality and is curious. He is an accomplice to Aschenbach, he looks at him almost provocatively. In the book it is Aschenbach, who looks at the boy. As for Aschenbach, I took a closer look at the professor, who was in The Blue Angel (based on a story by Thomas Mann's brother Heinrich), as that forty-year-old barely-gray-haired man. To be fair, I think Dirk Bogarde did a good job, but either somebody else should have done it or he should have made it look older in the beginning. <br /> <br /> I know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story, but the film minimizes the talk of art and duality between the Apollonian and Dyonian inspirations, and instead focuses on Aschenbach's obsession with Tadzio not to it. I liked the fact that Mahler's music was used because it eventually inspired Mann to write his story. I am not sure if it was a particularly good step to make Aschenbach a musician. Or the creation of Alfred, which I do not remember in the book. <br /> <br /> And one thing that really came to me was the sound and how it did not fit the actor's lips. I was wondering if it was synced because I expected it to be in Italian. But then I remembered that every Italian movie I've seen has this problem. It just bothers me because these directors (Fellini is the other person I'm thinking of) are supposed to epitomize perfection in Italian cinema, and here their characters laugh without sound, then you hear a sound that does not suit their faces (I guess to the scenes where Aschenbach almost collapses and starts to laugh, this scene should / should have been the strongest, but instead was annoying).
