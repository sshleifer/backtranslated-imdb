I remember that I watched this series eagerly and was so disappointed in the end. Since then, over the years, I've been trying to figure out if I could get a copy of it either on video or on d.v.d, to no avail. However, I was delighted to find this website with details, just to be disappointed when buying again that the videos available can not be played on English recorders! This production was so wonderful that she was absolutely accurate with Nevil Shute's novel. He performed the action after the end of the war, Joe and Jean joined together - absolutely wonderful - and I wish I could see them again. It's an original show, there were no repeats on British TV.
