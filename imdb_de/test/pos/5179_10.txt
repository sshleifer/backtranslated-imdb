Watching Gary Busey in a G-rated movie was a first and a nice one. I do not know much about the director, but he obviously knows how to spend a few bucks and get the most out of them. Where did Jillian Clare come from? My kids love her! The only thing I remember about Christopher Atkins was Blue Lagoon. Disney has to see this movie and bring it to work. The woman thinks he is very cute. I liked what he did with his character. He seemed so real. What we liked best was the message that this movie sends out. Greed sucks and faith, love and family wins! This is the first low budget DVD we bought and contains so much stuff. The producers made this for children and the kids loved it. They liked the music and all the extras on the DVD. The director probably will not stick to family movies, but I hope he does - because he really knows how to make the most of children, animals, and stars like Gary Busey. The dog was great and seeing how Gary Busey behaved like a dog was even funnier. There was not much we did not like about this one. It's hard to find a family movie without that gross humor, and Quigley was a wonderful surprise.
