James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not only pretty and charismatic, but genuinely open and vulnerable. At the Tristan show some people were on their back because they were pouting and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing, but I do not think that's true. Blind Spot is proof of his enormous talent. In this movie he is completely different. It is a unique achievement. Bittersweet and very moving. The lines from his diary cut you like a knife. You feel a keen sense of observation behind his words. The sound is everything. He carries it through the plot and suspense, as well as the grim part of gallows humor. I also like the other two actors very much. The blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted, tough guy. Some of the criminals looked sketchy, but that's a small point. The movie is absolutely solid and Franco is cool everywhere.
