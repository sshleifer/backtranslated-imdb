This film is superbly adapted to the screen and very faithful to the timeline of Mary Webb. He is a true masterpiece. Apart from the exceptionally talented rising star, Janet Mcteer as the lead actor and one or two established actors, the film usually used little-known names. All the more convincing was the drama for it. The social and personal tension is almost tangible, and I felt that the performers reacted to each other's character as if they had done it in real life. I've seen a commentator ask if Janet McTeer really had a rabbit's lip, a testament to how good her characterization was. I saw it on TV when it was shown for the first time, it was recorded and later the band unfortunately got lost. But it stays clear like everything in my head. If you have any preference for social time, this is an absolute must.
