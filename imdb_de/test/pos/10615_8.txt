*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** It's easy to see why the script for this film won an Oscar. At least in the first half. My head turned from all the snappy lines that passed by. Noel Coward plays a New York based publisher ("Why Do not You Publish Books That You Like?" - "What? And Corrupt the Public?"), Which enchants and manipulates his many followers. Then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a bizarre start to the Flying Dutchman, in which Coward has to find someone who truly mourns him before his soul can rest in peace. Very pleasant, until it becomes bizarre. Seen at Cinefest in Syracuse in March 2003.
