This is a beautiful and charming epic fantasy with a lot of heart. I got lost in this cute movie and saw him at the Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. It's really romantic with a touching message. The artwork and effects are visually striking and the fact that the director is an amazing artist is so obvious. The pictures look like moving art. It also has a strong and talented cast of actors. What a wonderful surprise to see Joss Ackland, he's just a fairytale king. Sarah Douglas is great because the bad guy and Christine Taylor and Tom Schultz make a lovely romantic couple. The fact that the film was made on a ridiculously small budget for indie films just makes me go crazy. It may not be the smooth Hollywood stuff we're flooded with, but it's a really nice movie to borrow and enjoy on a rainy Saturday on the sofa. Do not forget the microwave popcorn. That's my advice. Just enjoy it.
