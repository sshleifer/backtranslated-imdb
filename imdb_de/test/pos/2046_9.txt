I think Shane Black is one of the greatest action scriptwriters ever! He gave us the great (at the time) deadly weapon and shot Mel Gibson to the Super Star. Then came the second best movie ever featuring Bruce Willis (The Last Boyscout). Stumbled a bit with The Last Action Hero, but broke out with this movie, The Long Kiss Goodnight. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of action movies, it all has ... action, comedy, thrills, and more action, comedy and thrills. Geena Davies is great, Samual L. Jackson is even bigger. Do not miss it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
