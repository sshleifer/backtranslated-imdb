For those who enjoyed the books and movies of Asterix, LOVE this movie! Yes, I admit that some of the books and movies are mixed, but the characters are brilliant and it's not just people who show their CGI left, right and center. I've seen it several times and laughed at my socks. <br /> <br /> Of course it contains the main heroes Asterix (Astérix), Obelix (Obélix) and Dogmatix (Idéfix), but this time I have someone to deal with afresh. <br /> <br /> With such a sense of humor, the Gauls will go on and on. Bless her.
