Who are the people who star in this thing? Never heard of them !! But that's one of the funniest comedies I've come across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for parody. The absurdity starts with Dr. Jeykl snorts his powder and turns into a sex-fiend. He is followed by a libido-driven nurse early in the movie in one of the movie's funniest scenes. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background. rather like the system in MASH. The last scene in which Hyde receives the award made me laugh for years. Oh ... and the "Busty Nurse" is Cassandra Peterson, who later became Elvira, Mistress of Darkness. <br /> <br /> If you like the classic Mel Brooks movies (Blazing Saddles, etc.), I suspect you would like them. <br /> <br /> Damn shame you can not understand DVD everywhere. <br /> <br /> It is now available on DVD !!!!! Good, that DVDs do not wear out from use !!!!!
