I'm so glad that Zac was in 'The Suite life of Zack and Cody' because that's my favorite show and he's my favorite actor. It's a really funny episode and a funny show !! I love everything about the show and the characters. All actors are great. Carry on, Zac, and I'm so happy that almost all of my favorite actors (including high school musical characters) are in this show. Zac Efron is so hot and I have a signed picture of him! It is not a photocopy, it came all the way from America to Australia and almost did not arrive in time for Christmas. I also got a High School Musical Mug with my name printed on it. (Scarlett 8)
