This episode introduces us to the formal uniforms worn by Captain Picard, Commander Riker and Lieutenant Tasha Yar. The plot of this episode is about two groups of separate alien delegates, the Anticans and the Selae, who try to capture and eat at every turn. The two sides really hate each other, and it's up to Riker and Tasha to keep them at bay and save them from annoyance. Meanwhile, a mysterious spatial anomaly goes around the ship injuring some of the crew members. But at the end of the episode, this spatial anomaly has a valuable member of the crowd. Will they be able to save him so that they may be able to continue their continued space exploration mission? <br /> <br /> Note: This episode marks the second appearance of Irish actor Colm Meaney on TNG after "Encounter at Farpoint". He portrays one of Tasha's "yellow shirts" security personnel.
