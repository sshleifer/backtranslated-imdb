This is one of nine shorts on the anime disk "The Animatrix". It's my favorite. The artwork is incredible. The black and white, slightly grainy texture perfectly captures the mood that is supposed to represent the segment. The story is tight and the end is true for the movie Noir. <br /> <br /> Overall I gave the Animatrix a "7", but this segment deserves a "10".
