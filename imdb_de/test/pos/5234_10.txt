I never thought that such an old movie would be as impressive as this 1930's Western turned out to be. The scenes of the pioneers traveling west with their wagons, encountering storms and mud, river crossings, Indian attacks, and every attempt and danger, are astonishing in their rough credibility. The movie was mostly filmed outdoors, and the movie feels really epic. The actors must have experienced the same conditions as the original pioneers, and the results are amazing. The cars, the clothes, every detail looks and feels right. The characters are simple but believable, with an uncomplicated story that travels to their destination like the waggon train. John Wayne is slender and youthful in one of his first roles, as the Boy Scout who runs the cars, and as an idealistic young commuter, he does a good job. He's dealing with a wonderfully scrupulous trio of villains, including Ian Keith as a slipping player, Charles Stevens as a Mexican buddy, and Tyrone Power, a senior, as a growing, bear-like trapper. The bearded, growling, larger than life portrayal of power is both funny and threatening. I keep picturing a bandana, a gold hoop, and black eye patches, with a parrot on my shoulder as he grunts and growls at various threats and insults. His character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship. He almost steals the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Tully Marshall is adorable as a smart old frontier worker who is Wayne's best friend. Lovely Marguerite Churchill makes a spirited heroine, whose initial meeting with Wayne is a jolly confusion, resulting in lengthy advertising consisting of insults and feigned indifference by her to maintain her perseverance. The results are pretty humorous and you're glad to see that they finally come together in the end. <br /> <br /> The scenery is incredible, the wagons cross real prairie and have to be shut down by cliffs. Indians, who are clearly the actual article and not white actors, are both friends and enemies and treated with dignity. Wayne's character tells an admiring group of young boys that the Indians are his friends, who taught him everything he knows about wilderness survival. The Big Trail is an uncomplicated narrative that's well-nourished by a talented cast and crew. It may seem naive to many modern-day viewers, but there is a quiet dignity that never makes it tacky. There is much deliberate humor, including a mad scavenger of a pioneer, who makes hiding sounds loud animal sounds every time the slick player Ian Keith tries to marry the beautiful heroine. His flowery speeches about the plantation he allegedly possesses are interrupted by very realistic imitations of howling cats and quacking ducks, causing the tempter to look around annoyingly at the invisible creatures. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended western fans and lovers of old movies in general. This is really a classic movie for eternity.
