The funniest show ever on TV, though humor is not for everyone. I know it would have been difficult to keep the show fresh if it had been running longer, but it is a pity that only six episodes were made. The gags fly fast from the opening credits to the end when Drebin and his boss Ed Hocken pretend to be in the freeze while the final credits roll, while the criminal (still on the move) sees everyone else motionless and tries to escape , In another episode, the building collapsed around them as Drebin and Squat stayed in freeze mode. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was comedic as Frank Drebin and the perfect match for this show? How he managed to keep a straight face through some of them is unclear to me. Since the jokes and low vision came so often and fast, you can see the episodes a second and third time and capture things you missed the first time. If you are like me, you can watch them over and over again and still laugh. Even the jokes that made no sense or seemed to have a reason for them, like the "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln" header in the opening announcement, somehow worked ?? Maybe that's why they were thrown in there for that very reason. <br /> <br /> Cleverly spoofing the old Quinn Martin detective / cop shows of the 70s, the police command returned from a commercial back screen that was immediately followed by "Yankees One" or another joke. In the opening credits, the title of the episode would appear on the screen, but the announcer would pronounce a completely different title. My favorite jokes and lines from this series are far too numerous to list, but Drebin asks a downed boxer who has previously fought: "Do you think you can beat the champ?" The boxer replies, "I can take him blindfolded!" Whereupon Drebin replies, "But what if he did not blindfold?" A minute later, referring to the boxer's small, grubby flat, Drebin tells him, "I'll help you get out of this channel." Next, Drebin appears through a manhole cover on the street! In another episode Drebin and Squatting question the thin alibi of a bomber. Drebin, who does not believe him, says, "Okay, let's say you went to the movies." After a short break, Drebin, Squatting and the suspect look at the camera and say together, "They've seen the movies." Moments later, when Drebin is forced to release the alleged bomber for lack of evidence, he storms off and yells angrily, "Tell the bomber to take off!" Next, you see a policeman giving the thumb signal to a World War II-style airplane on a runway right in front of the building! While there were many classic Drebin quotes, one thing was particularly memorable: "I'm sorry to bother Mrs. Twice, we would have come earlier, but her husband was not dead then." Another classic was: "I'm a locksmith and I'm a locksmith." As a father who is visibly shaken, Drebin asks, "What am I doing?" ?? Drebin answers in a classic deadpan manner: "Well, I understand you are in the textile business." As I said, the humor is not for everyone? Many people just will not "get it". During the short run of the show, I remember that the reaction was very mixed. Some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things while others thought it was stupid and stupid. For me, Police Squad is the funniest thing I've seen on TV even after more than 20 years. For younger viewers who like this kind of humor, but have never seen Police Squad because they were too young when the show was originally aired, I can only recommend. I found the six episodes even funnier than the subsequent "Naked Gun" movies.
