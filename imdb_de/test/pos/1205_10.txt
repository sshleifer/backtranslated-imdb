Now, more than ever, we need peace and love in this world! <br /> <br /> This movie really shows the wonderful music of the Broadway show and the fabulous choreography of the legendary Twila Tharp! I have seen it again after many years, and it still holds up well. <br /> <br /> Thank you, MGM / UA, for putting it on DVD! I love the option of seeing in widescreen. MGM rocks to do that on many of their DVD releases. <br /> <br /> Ya has to love Treat Williams as Berger and John Savage as Claude. You could not have selected better actors and actresses for this movie! Beverly D'Angelo is such a 'hot mom' in this movie - I forgot how hot! WOW! <br /> <br /> The understudy is absolutely great, <br /> <br /> with the late great Nell Carter, who does a singing cameo in a couple of scenes, as well as the crazy Charlotte Ray (Mrs. Garrett about 'Facts Of Life') <br /> <br /> The story will be a bit weak towards the end, but the anti-war sentiment of the late 60's continues and is still relevant today. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed (quite on-site) and so colorful and gracious that brings the spirit of 1968 back to the big screen. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when I was 15, and then it got moved, and it still keeps me going at 40. Some other reviews here say that they should have been made earlier - I do not think Hollywood was ready to shoot such a movie in the late '60s / early' 70s. <br /> <br /> The Vietnam War ended in 1975, and the whole thing was a bit too close to home, I think this story should be filmed beforehand (like 1969, 70, 71). <br /> < br /> Bravo to Director Milos Foreman! I love this movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It's nice to see him again, this time on DVD. It never looked better!
