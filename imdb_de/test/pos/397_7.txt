The Last Frontier was one of the darker of Anthony Mann's Westerns. His last cavalry (with the exception of a brief episode in Winchester '73) was The Last Frontier, though of course he focuses on outsiders and internal conflicts rather than having a Fordian camaraderie of common ideals. Not in his beloved highlands, but in the foothills and forests, this is a much more cynical view of the borderline life, in many ways its Apache Fort, without the legend must be preserved: This outpost consists of outsiders, failures, cowards and the one or another competent officer, ignored by his superiors and badly led by the Civil War, and everything the army has to offer. Victor Mature and James Whitmore are the free trappers who crawl civilization upon them when they are freed from a local tribe that is injured by the cavalry entering their territory. Instead of blaming the Indians for their losses, they decide that it is the army's fault to build the fort, and decided to seek compensation from them, and instead joined their Boy Scouts. Despite the best efforts of Guy Madison's amiable and competent acting commander to bring Mature into the nineteenth century and make him fit for the uniform, the arrival of Robert Preston's humiliated Colonel was eager to avenge himself on the tribe who had taken him out of his own expelled outpost? and the awkward bewilderment of Mature with the Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft, too much of an empty chalkboard here) to do much with the role of a woman who is tired of being rescued by men who believe they know What is best for you)? drive the matter soon in much darker area. It's not long before some of the soldiers are eager to kill each other, and both sides try to get their subordinates to do the deeds for them: no wonder that Mature drops the bluecoat he's disgusted for a long time and screamed. I would have died for it, but it is nothing but a dirty dirty blue rag! "The Stallone of his time, Mature, was one of those actors who could surprise you with the extraordinary performance here and there, when brought together with the right part and the right director." This is not one of his better days despite his most complex part, Perverted enough to be a simple man - well-meaning, but drunk, violent, uneducated, and with an inconspicuous, almost childlike zest for life - the part seems to be intended for Burt Lancaster, with some striking similarities to his character in The Kentuckian. He is determined to resurrect the career that he had devastated in a devastating suicide attempt by launching another pointless suicide campaign against the tribe, adding another humiliation to the list that left him out Viewed and dropped out of the head of the Promotion Board in his obsession In order to redeem his career, he moves away from any hope of moral salvation, driven by his sense of shame, his wife's sympathy, and the promotion of former comrades whom he considers his subordinates. He can not be saved, but there is still a recognizable person and not without integrity. he really admires Madison's courage to make a vain attempt to deny Preston's orders from her superiors? Although the movie is fatally distorted. <br /> <br /> Like its hero, the film is a bit rough on the edges (and has one of the most unreal and cheeky title songs of all Westerns), but that only does a bit. It's more interesting, and there are many of the typically elegant men's cameras that act on perspective, while the borderline setting is convincingly hard and primitive. Unfortunately, the shortcomings of early CinemaScope lenses on the Columbia DVD are very obvious, with the image often being dark (CinemaScope (2.55: 1 needed a lot of extra lighting and early scope movies showing a lot of trial and error) and grainy ,
