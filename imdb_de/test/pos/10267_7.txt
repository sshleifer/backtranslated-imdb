Just as with FOOTPRINTS (1975), by chance I became aware of this problem: it was mentioned in a review of THE LIBERTINE (1969), which I examined when the film appeared on Italian television in the late evening vein; Incidentally, I missed this screening of THE LIBERTINE (although I purchased it later on the same channel), but I managed to watch the film for a rental of the English-language R1 DVD during my stay in Hollywood at the end of 2005 / beginning of 2006. In Given the rave reviews for that, I was disappointed by THE LIBERTINE - too lighthearted in nature for a really serious topic (the sado-masochistic relationship between a young couple)! To be honest, I was often afraid that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN would go the same way, but was later redeemed amply by a nasty (though not exactly unpredictable) ending change. The film deals with free-thinking social attitudes and dazzling creative arts This time: An outstanding philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites a journalist (Dagmar Lassander) into his fashionable home for the weekend; however, it turns out that he is a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate (or even kill) them! Thus, in the first half of the narrative, the heroine experiences pain and humiliation in Leroy's hands (including the effort of a dummy in his own image!) ... until the tables are subtle, but not surprisingly, turned: They set you free not only from his control, but teaches him that man and woman can live together harmoniously - except that Lassander also pursues her personal agenda! <br /> <br /> The leads are perfectly staffed, and the film itself is often hilarious for those affected; In addition, it is characterized by a typically bubbly "Euro-Cult" points (from the always reliable Stelvio Cipriani) and the imaginative - even outstanding - look (the huge structure that shows the lower part of the female form, with a steel trap) favors Where his sexual organ should be, seems to go from Freud: Incidentally, this prop played a prominent role in still images, which I had previously seen by THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN ... but she is hard to find in the right movie!). Other bizarre accents include the absurd "Sexual Aberrations And The Stars" radio program and an idyllic setting in a castle belonging to Leroy's family, complete with a secret passage through the dressing room and a dwarfish servant. One of the highlights is Lassander's erotic dance so practically naked - an episode that actually leads the "humanization" of Leroy. Finally, the two characters have a "showdown" in the pool of the latter - amusing set to a spaghetti western theme. <br /> <br /> In the long run, despite its stylish appearance, the film seems inferior to Yasuzo Masumura's BLIND BEAST (1969) like, but much more extreme contemporary Japanese masterpiece. Finally, it is worth noting that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN was distributed in the US by the company Audubon Films by filmmaker Radley Metzger. he would even use his production designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his own CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To access the edition I was looking at: Apart from the usual drawbacks in the English-speaking section, the presentation was hampered by a rather blurry appearance and a short noise on the soundtrack. Incidentally, there seems to be some confusion about the running time of the film: its length on different sources ranges from 84 to 108 minutes - but I can only say that the copy I own ran for 87 minutes!
