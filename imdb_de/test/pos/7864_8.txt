This is one of the best collaborations of Siegel and Eastwood, which combines the conventions of Western and Gothic horror and is often directed like an art film. <br /> <br /> Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who, after being wounded during the Civil War, flees to an isolated seminary for young women in the South. Off the world, women project their romantic fantasies on him, and he reacts with callused male manipulation. But jealousy and resentment raise their heads and he finds himself in a world of brutal revenge. And the boy's revenge is brutal. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot by Bruce Surtees and careful "The Beguiled" is a haunting, elegant piece that seems to have influenced the annoying sexuality of Eastwood's "Play Misty for" I "and" Tightrope " /> <br /> The film is a gripping portrayal of a fierce battle between the sexes and exudes a dreamy mix of horror and sexuality, all characters are ambiguous and have both good and bad traits, and it's up to us to decide For whom we should choose Don Siegel left behind a good legacy of fine films, everything from "Invation of the Body Snatchers" to "Dirty Harry." Although his early black and white images have aged well, most color films appear grainy, dated, and poorly recorded His somber "realism" seems to have been fresh and kinetic 40 years ago, but when I look at him today, I simply do not believe he has passed the test of time t. <br /> <br /> "The Betuiled" is in a different league. Sophisticated, ambiguous and sharp shot, it is a shame that it is not well known. While advancing technology and technology has made the majority of Seal's tough, male action thrillers superfluous, "The Beguiled" still attracts audiences today due to its surreal atmosphere and unique theme. <br /> 8.5 / 10 - Better than the motto "Black Narcissus", which in my opinion is Siegel's best movie. Part Horror, Part Drama, Part Sexual Odyssey, "The Beguiled" is a surprisingly artful film (especially considering that Siegel calls his films "pointless"). Much of the film's artistic abilities are thanks to Clint Eastwood, who would endeavor to choose mature material from then on.
