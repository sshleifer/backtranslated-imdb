After reading some of the unpleasant remarks, I had to bring in my two cents. This show was NOT what this idiot thinks in Essex, the worst thing ever aired on television. I think most of today's TV is much worse (when will this stupid "reality fad" ever end?) And there's no current show I can see. Give me the stuff that I grew up with. I am a 1965 baby and am not ashamed to admit it. <br /> <br /> This show has been my absolute favorite for almost 30 years. I was in high school when it first aired, and I think it helped keep me in these miserable days. I was such an idiot at the time and "Fantasy Island" raised my imagination. At that time, I was an aspiring writer and offered incredible opportunities to practice the craft. What a wonderful premise! I will not say that it had no mistakes. Sometimes the scripts were pretty bad and some of the problems seemed trivial. but it could also be good and it was a great time to see it and still is. Well, I think it's unfair to call every single product of the 70's cheesy. There was a lot of great stuff back then, and that was one of the ranks. (By the way, most of the seasons were aired in the 80s !!) My favorite episodes came mostly from seasons 2, 3 and 4. <br /> <br /> To those who love Herv√© Villechaize for his strong French accent and small size Degrade: GROW AND LEARN SOMETHING! It's so easy to be fun when you are "normal" and "perfect". This man made the most of what he got in life, and if you do not like it, it's just hard. Have a bit of pity. He's been dead for 15 years and how easy it is to knock down someone who can not defend himself. It's just no shame anymore. <br /> <br /> I love this show. It looks outdated. I hate to tell you, but we had no sparkling special effects and Blu-ray discs. We were lucky enough to have VCRs. Live with it. Accept it for what it is and it's just fun. "Escapist TV" describes it perfectly, and that was it for me - an escape from my lazy real life. And it's still fun to watch.
