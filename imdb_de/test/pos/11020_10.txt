I like movies about quirky people. "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" is perhaps my absolute favorite, so you can imagine that I had a great time with this one. There is definitely no observing if you want to smile. This movie is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are downright frightening, even after multiple consideration (because such a thing can really happen). It will definitely keep you on the seat edge throughout the ride. And when you see the end, if you are not deeply disturbed, you should really look for a pulse. <br /> <br /> The acting was phenomenal. Marcy changes with her rather extreme case of Tourettes from quirky-cute to extremely frightening and sometimes seems so uncontrolled that she looks like the undead. Seth was great, too. The focus of the film is definitely not nearly as strong on him as on Marcy, although he happens to be the one who gets the most momentum as a thriving character. <br /> <br /> It's a classic love story with some unconventional twists, and next to "True Romance" is also my favorite love story. There are two bad reviews here, but one of the people who gave such a review had no clear facts and admitted that they had not seen the whole movie, while the other was looking for Hollywood thrill without the deep characters (and became perhaps a little rejected from the apparent flooding of the conspiracy, since the ultimate goal is to steal a black Bobbi head from a toy store). The point is, this movie is not meant for those who want to see something "normal" or "light hearted". This is as confused and indie as possible, and will not let you go until the heavy climax.
