I can see that the ratings for this movie are not that high for this movie, so I have to be in the minority to like this movie. Well, I'm right and everyone else is wrong (just a joke). I guess I like it because I'm a psychology teacher and the brooding character Ryan played really liked. Although he is really dangerous and VERY threatening, one can not hate him precisely because he is obviously mentally ill and is probably suffering from a kind of brain trauma. And wow, Ryan did a really good job of portraying this man! You really feel for Ida Lupino as he destroys her life. Why is the film classified as relatively low in such intense acting and threat? Well, probably because it's not really believable ... but boy, it's entertaining and creative. Try it and do not believe in the score of 6.4 - it's much better than that!
