Ex-reporter Jacob Asch (Eric Roberts) is hired by a friend (Raymond J. Barry) to find his ex-wife and son. Asch travels to Palm Springs and quickly searches for Ex Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) with someone he thinks he is the son of (a young Johnny Depp). However, it gets a little more complicated when Asch discovers the former white trash. Laine has definitely married in the shape of millionaire Simon Fleischer (Dan Hedaya) and her first son is nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> Director and author Matthew Chapman is in charge of BODY HEAT here, and this' 80s-era neo-noir is plenty to see thanks to a star cast and beautiful locations. D'Angelo was still looking good at the time, so she makes a good femme fatale and is not afraid to show skin. However, the puzzle is not very convincing in the end. In addition to Dennis Lipscomb, Emily Longstreth and Henry Gibson. Chapman shot several thrillers in the 1980s, but his "biggest" career was writing the script for the infamous COLOR OF NIGHT.
