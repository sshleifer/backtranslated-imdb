This movie is one of the best of 1986 with scary but intriguing performances by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were pretty bleak for many people, not just teenagers, but this streak really caught despair and desperation. Well steered with a great script (apparently based on a true story), I see no weaknesses in it. The opening shot was brilliant. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves was decent for a change and Miss Skye was right about the money. Hopper had three more great performances in the same year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II and Hoosiers). I can imagine that this is a cult, and I wonder what that picture would look like if it were re-released. Great stuff!
