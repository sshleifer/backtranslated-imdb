Victor Sjöström was quite a master in this film. He had played in it, directed and even written the screenplay! That's pretty amazing. Although few now know who Sjöström was, he may be known to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star of Bergman's most famous film, WILD STRAWBERRIES. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, he is very mixed bag. On the one hand, it has to be respected because it's a very good movie for 1921. The idea that the Grim Reaper sits down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is quite imaginative. In addition, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is quite convincing and technically a well-made movie. On the other hand, it's an amazingly old-fashioned and preaching movie - more like something expected to be shown in Sunday school, rather than in a theater of sincerity. Besides, some of the story elements just do not make sense. Instead of appearing as devoted or good, the dying worker of the Salvation Army appears like a sap - a very sad and confusing juice. Why is she "in love" with this man? Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> So, my recommendation is that, if you're madly in love with Silents (like me), watch them anyway. However, if you are not a quiet fan, this movie might not convince you that this feature film is brilliant because the story is so melodramatic and outdated.
