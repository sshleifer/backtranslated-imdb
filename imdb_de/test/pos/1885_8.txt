Ah, classic comedy. At the point where brains mingle, a two-minute scene in which Bruce Campbell sometimes beats himself reminds me of how simple films and ideas can get you and wrap you up in an entire movie. > Bruce Campbell has known for years what kind of films we want from him. We want to see strange movies like Bubba Ho Tep. We want to see cameo roles in Sam Raimi films and we want to see 'Man with the Screaming Brain'. Alone with the title you know that this completely stupid movie, like Army of Darkness, is limited only to stupider and fewer monsters. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is simple. Bruce sees a doctor. The doctor has a new idea. Bruce gets bad things on the way to the doctor. Coincidentally, it was the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saved him. Hilarity follows. <br /> <br /> With the addition of Ted Raimi as comic Russian and journeyman Stacy Keach as dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov is weird that this movie works. Completely funny. Never scary. <br /> <br /> If you like the stupid Bruce Campbell, you will like it. Why look at this if you did not like Bruce Campbell?
