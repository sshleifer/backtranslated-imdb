All in all, Big Bad John was a hilarious and touching movie. If you want romance, tragedy and humor, this movie has it. If you're a fan of the song (like me), you know pretty well how it ends. But if you do not want it or want to see it anyway, I strongly recommend this movie. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean are a funny couple with great chemistry. However, I would not recommend this movie to strict city dwellers. You have to understand where these people are supposed to come from, and only a handful of us are left. But a few people from the city could understand and appreciate what it is: a good, homey movie that makes you laugh, cry and inspire.
