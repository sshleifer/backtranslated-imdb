Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has a crazy life: his wife (Kate Mulgrew) stole his book and left him. He has a new romance with a girl named Beth (Kim Greist) and his screenwriting students are stranger than most. A student (Danny DeVito), however, is particularly strange. He lives with his evil momma (Anne Ramsey) and can not muster the courage to kill her. Then he goes to Larry and asks him for help to make his life from normal crazy to extra crazy! Stu Silver should have done more! The dialogue, the characters, the whole script is almost perfect! And Danny DeVito has shown me that he is more than a great actor: he is a great director! His children's movie Matilda is one of my favorite family films, and now this is one of my favorite comedies. <br /> <br /> It's a black comedy. All actors use their full potential, whether they are main characters (Billy Crystal) or just slightly smaller characters (Olivia Brown). ) than you like that! 8/10 stars.
