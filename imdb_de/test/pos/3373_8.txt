Forget Donnie Darko. I open it up, because it seems that a lot of the reviews I read about The Box are the simple but weak argument that there is no candle for Darko. It's not that I do not necessarily disagree, I just feel like this movie is a different kind of animal and deserves its own analysis. There are comparison points to be sure, but they are only marginal, considering that the key to the heart of every movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential. In The Box, the driving force behind the narrative is a moral dilemma. Believe me, when I say that I understand the inclination to compare the films of an innovative filmmaker by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to address each new film first as a self-contained entity and then my gaze to expand. <br /> <br /> The Box is one of those films where you have mixed feelings because it seems like a kind of identity crisis. It is not always sure what it wants to be. The twists are numerous, but easy to follow, if not predict. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz are playing a relatively credible pair of bridal couples in financial distress. A box with a "button unit" arrives at their front door and they are informed by a terribly burned man who says that pressing a button causes the death of a person they do not know, and they receive a million dollars. Among other things, The Box achieves this invisible fear that our actions have moral consequences somewhere out there. Before the button is pressed, it has an uncanny and seductive quality that is still scary. Once this is done, events are set in motion that cause the two leaders to question their own morals and deeply regret their fateful decision. <br /> <br /> The idea that the box is an experiment is interesting because it makes the film seem paradoxical to me. If there are external beings who develop an "altruism coefficient" based on data collected by couples who press the button and do not press, then we realize that the conspiracy is loosing, ultimately a forced altruism: Be selfless or the species is extinguished. I suspect couples do not know the consequences of their actions when faced with the decision, but they have no reason to believe that The Box can do anything. Why should they choose altruistically? Is altruism devalued by being only interested in having a problem in our own lives? <br /> <br /> The psychological hurdles in this movie are everywhere. Press the key or not, it is likely that someone is busy with you. Take the money or not, nobody gives away something for free. Finding the truth, the answers you find slow, reveal your end. <br /> <br /> I suggest that The Box is an ironic work because it offers the wrong choice of free will, while revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. You can only choose to be free at the expense of another. Is that freedom? No, it's just another box because you're trapped in the consequences of your own morality. There is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another box. That's why the outer characters in the movie are ultimately antagonists. They demand that we adhere to moral standards that deprive us of our freedom. We made it to Mars and we were burned for it and slaves in a sick game. <br /> <br /> The references to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point quite well. "You can only enter the last chamber freely or not freely." Sure, but no matter in what form we enter the chamber, it's still a chamber. <br /> <br /> Trevor Nemeth
