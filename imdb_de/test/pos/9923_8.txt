'Opera' (1987) <br /> <br /> Director: Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria) Screenplay: Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini (The Church, Sleepless, Demons) Photography: Ronnie Taylor (A Chorus Line, Sleepless) Music: Claudio Simonetti (Phenomenon, 'Goblin') <br /> <br /> Story: Betty (Cristina Marsillach) is the cast of Lady Macbeth in a very stylized staging of Verdi's Macbeth opera. Betty's heyday comes when the Diva star breaks her leg before the opening night when she's hit by a car running away in a tantrum. The famous curse of Macbeth makes a more sinister and calculating turn when the body number increases immediately. It seems Betty gets her first fan about a stalker who pinned her down and tied needles to her eyes, forcing her to see the cruel killers of people around her. Story: 3 of 5 <br /> <br /> Actors: Acting many Italian films can sometimes be difficult to judge. Sometimes English, Italian, French, German, Spanish can all be in the same movie as they usually speak their native language, which makes the synchronization rule of the thumb difficult to assess. I usually cut it a bit looser. Acting: 4 of 5 <br /> <br /> Director: Giallo Maestro Argento re-enters the genre pioneer helped. 'Opera' shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite mix of tension, suspense and beauty. Direction: 4 of 5 <br /> <br /> Visual: This must be one of Argento's best-looking films. 'Opera' was filmed by Taylor in a great way and offers a stunning and imaginative camera work that makes the movie run fast and hard and makes the eye catching come. The camera always seems to be in the notion of whether it is a wonderful shot of the camera going up a spiral staircase, or a sequence towards the end of the birds bird's eye view, orbiting the crowd in the opera house. Visual: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Audio: The frequent Argento collaborator Simonetti (through his various bands Goblin, Demonian and solo effort) complements the screen action with zeal, while his score ranges from the classic (Verdi) to to metal castings (with some help from Brian and Roger Eno and Bill Wyman) and gives the bloody crackle of the screen music. The sound design gives you everything you need, from knife bites to shots, screaming fire and masterfully remastering on the Anchor Bay Disc in glorious 6.1 for every crunch and caw. Audio: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Technical: Editing keeps the movie moving beautifully. In conjunction with the camera work, the editing aid keeps the surreal, dreamy images in the river. The exquisite opera house is a damn good location and perfect for staging the horror version of Macbeth. You can not end a review of an Argento movie without commenting on the killings. This time, Argento sends joyful characters with a brilliant, piercing sequence, Crow Eye Gouging and the movie highlight of a cannon shot through a keyhole in the eye and from the back of the head that sends Argentos ex-wife Daria Nicolodi back to the morgue. Priceless! Technically: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Wrap-up: A near-faultless Giallo who suffers from a somewhat unnecessary epilogue in Switzerland that delivers all the visual experiences Argento fans crave. <br /> <br /> Total: 4 out of 5
