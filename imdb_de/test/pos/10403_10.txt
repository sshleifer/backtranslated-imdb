I absolutely loved this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a "typical Asian horror" that would make you see a ghastly ghost (usually a woman) that scares people. For most of the movie you hardly see any ghosts, but the way this movie interests you in the storyline and the characters is awesome. This is not the movie for you if you are into horror (eg Saw, Hostel) or "surprise fear" where stuff is coming to you (Hollywood horror, slasher movies), but this movie has a creepy factor on the whole whole movie I loved. Noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror among the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap that is being released by Hollywood in today's society ?!). It's far superior to the Blair Witch Project because acting in Noroi is brilliant and you really feel like seeing something you should not see. <br /> <br /> Noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. Only a few films have made it into my Top 5 horror; and this movie holds a permanent place on my list.
