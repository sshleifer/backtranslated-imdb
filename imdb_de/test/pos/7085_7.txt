"One True Thing" puts Zellweger as a grown-up journalist in a family crisis that returns home to take care of her dying mother (Streep). The film shows how hard and painless the adult child deals with the adult image of his parents, as it slowly turns out that it is a little less than the ideal that she has come to know as a child. "OTT" is an excellent character study and production that has nothing to complain about and features three outstanding performances by three top actors as well as some mournful reflections on life and death.
