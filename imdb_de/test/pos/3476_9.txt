OK. You saw the movie and I saw the movie. True? If not, there are many action summaries and there is absolutely no reason to waste time trying to make weak attempts to create another one for me, the performances of the two young men and the young lady in the lead roles. Her emotional honesty was so convincing, if not more than any performance I've seen in recent months. I thought I was laughing, crying and flinching with them, and that says a lot because I'm often called a shaggy idiot and I think that's the Achilles heel of the picture. It's a story we've all seen many times before. We all know how it ends as soon as they introduce Rory. Although you may not know any exact mechanisms, you know that there will be a transforming friendship, a bittersweet romance, and a bad conclusion. Without the strong cast and direction, this movie would be nothing more than the sleepless killer that makes up eighty percent of the Hallmark Channel schedule.
