Some said this was a bauble-transfiguration film, but just before the original mix of dr. Hyde has not been developed a drug that can achieve THAT effect. If Viagra was the stage of mucus form, this white, bubbly powder is the evolutionary stem of Stephen Hawking (or at least the desperate branch of the Pharmacist Idiot). This reality show is about the sacred cows of medicine, as the Emperor was seen without clothes. Only a few of us want to question the health field. both because most of us would not live in our present age, if we had been born before the "modern medicine", and because our subconscious hopes that we will live on, if we believe in the helping professions. The geniuses who produced this film made jokes out of these Calcutta Bessys and gave us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine. The timing was just right and many could see the business side of the healing companies behind the curtain of Oz. A decade earlier, when George C. Scott was rushing through the movie The Hospital, my wife and I sat in the packed premiere in Oklahoma City. Just like with Jekyll & Hyde's remake, we almost could not fall out of our seat and laughed and howled uncontrollably for the duration. The hundreds of other spectators were deadly. They were shocked that doctors, nurses and hospital facilities were ridiculed. It was as if the Pope, Billy Graham and Gandhi were sitting in the Animal House, with beer-stained T-shirts and everyone competing to see who could spot the funniest God-knocking jokes between the excitements. If the hospital had been a slapstick comedy rather than a satire, they might have seen what they were shown. Unfortunately they were like Republicans at a screening of Michael Moore's 9/11. Perhaps smaller corrupt parachutes would have been awarded to the corrupt leading medical companies, health insurers would have had more difficulty denying medical care, and healthcare providers would have been previously demystified if George C. Scott had danced a tutu while delivering his terrible truths , But forget everything I just said. Watch the movie, be aware of being happy and happy and full of laughter like the best Saturday Night Live sketch of all time, and immerse the subconscious in the documentation of the underlying reality. Do not blame me if "Got to Got To Got To" becomes one of your sayings, or if "Hyde's Nothing to Hide" occupies that part of your brain that's now paralyzed by "Its a Small World After All." Or if you start calling the Mother of Sorrows of Pain and Suffering at Our Local Hospital instead of Our Lady of Eternal Building. Even Oklahomans changed their terrible favorite-wish-winner-winner with the request "Piss on him and leave him for dead" in "body in a pit, you in it ...". The stench of death ... it's gone! Chicken Sushi! Maria. MARIA. MARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
