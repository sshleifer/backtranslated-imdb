I agree with the posters that the characters were exceptionally strong and believable and all the actors were in their best shape. I found David Boreanaz particularly popular as he stretched himself into a role so unique that he once again proved his amazing gift for the comedy. The first part of the movie was light and funny, the blackmail part was a bit surrealistic but interesting - and from then on it went downhill. <br /> <br /> I found it frustrating that at least two of the three girls (Keira and Lisa) were out of the blackmailer and betrayal, showing no trace of their psyche. I know the movie changed the dark end of the play - and I'm not saying I missed the murder part. But I had to see that these two kind of joined in and I had to moan in frustration as the end ended. (That's why I only gave him a 9) <br /> <br /> But definitely an interesting movie.
