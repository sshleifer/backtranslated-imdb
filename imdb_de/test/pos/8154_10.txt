I saw this movie on LOGO TV today. I was absolutely thrilled with the powerful messages and plotlines of this film. I do not want to spoil it. I say that, I was referring to the inner struggle of Aaron and his upbringing. As a gay man growing up in a small town, I've been so well connected to the "big secret" and decisions that I've made. This movie made a HUGE impression on me and I intend to buy a copy of it for my personal library in the near future. I stopped the movie and called my friends to recommend it. It had this profound effect on me. To those who read this comment. SEE it. Try to have as little distraction as possible. Be open minded too. This is not a movie that can be viewed as a Disney movie or the movie of the week. Instead, take the time to observe the dialogue and actively LISTEN and read between the lines and get involved in the drawing. You can be in tears. Not since "Steel Magnolias" have I been moved to tears by a movie. He did just that. Many thanks to the cast, the author and the crew who produced an emotionally charged romantic film about homosexuality and religion. It was long overdue.
