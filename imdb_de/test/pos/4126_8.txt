It seemed to me as the final scene of the film froze to reveal the sparse details of Buddy Holly's death that there are still people living and vividly remembering this venue in Clearlake, Iowa. This must be a haunting memory that has become even more important through the lyrics of "American Pie," as it pays tribute to the death of music. The world lost a tremendous talent that day, life just before flowering, and one can only wonder what would have happened if the trio of musicians who perished that day had survived to an even greater extent Creating a musical heritage I saw the movie today about thirty years after its original theatrical release. For thirty years, I have some rethinking issues. I'd forgotten a lot of it while remembering some of the little things, like the cricket on the wall immortalized by the name of the band. Above all, I remember the music. It's hard to just sit there and not hit the beat of "Oh Boy" or "That's Be The Day", and you have to wonder where the threat to our morale could actually have come with these tunes. I am at least with Buddy on this point. How could they be jungle rhythms if he invented them? Funny how each decade brought its own threat to society - the Beatles, Motown, disco, and a host of other musical forms. We still hear and dance to the beat, so they were not that bad. <br /> <br /> There was another movie take-away I forgot. Here I learned to hit a phone on the table when the person on the other end did not see things my way. I have done this several times over the years, but meanwhile I forgot the source. Well, I should be fine for about thirty years now. <br /> <br /> You must surely credit Gary Busey with his appreciation for Buddy Holly. When he saw him today, you never imagined he was the slimmed-down seesaw with horn-rimmed glasses, but it was a tour-de-force characterization and performance that earned Busey an Oscar nod. Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are competent as Buddy's band members, though their characters leave much of the story behind. I have enjoyed the subtle way in which other musical legends, such as Sam Cooke and King Curtis, have been included in the picture without ever focusing on their presence. <br /> <br /> I'll always be a fan of the music of the fifties and sixties - they call them "oldies" now. I guess that makes me an oldie as well, but you can not replace the experience of growing up with the music history that is now coming to the big screen. Which only reinforces the idea that I can continue to enjoy the music until the day I die.
