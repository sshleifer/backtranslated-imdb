The 2005 edition of The Royal Rumble came live from the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California. The two top championships of WWE were defended. The Undertaker fought against Heidenreich in a casket match, Shawn Michaels took part in a grudge match against Edge set up last October. Rope Royal Rumble team up. Who would accept the prize this year? Chris Benoit? Edge? Eddie Guerrero? Edge? John Cena? Batista? Edge? Shawn Michaels? There was no shortage of candidates. <br /> <br /> It was Batista who won the main event, but not without controversy, or should I say a miserable finish. Batista and John Cena were the last two men in the ring. Batista should drop the young Smackdown! Star over the top rope, but everything went awry and both fell to the ground. The referees acted on their feet when we had an Arm Rise contest in 1994 similar to that of Bret Hart and Lex Luger. This brought the CEO to light. Vinnie Mac went down to the ring as best he could, but hurt himself heavily in the ring. It was unusual to see Vince McMahon sitting with his legs outstretching, challenging the two men to resume the game. Batista then did it, he should do it for the first time and throw Cena to the ground to secure his own future with a championship fight at WrestleMania 21. The sub-card for this year's Royal Rumble had a very solid line with many of WWE's biggest stars in games. Each brand had two big games. <br /> <br /> Raw opened the night with the match between Shawn Michaels and Edge. This was a good technical competition. Back and fourth all the way until Edge got the pinfall. This was a wise booking decision and kept Edge as contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. The second game of the night was the feud endgame between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The match was not a classic, but were there any classic Casket matches? It was entertaining. Especially if Snitsky intervened and then Kane jumped out of the box to a great pop. The Undertaker surprised no one when he scored the victory and Heidenreich and this mediocre feud struck the lid. <br /> <br /> The first of the two championship games of the night was John Bradshaw Layfield's defense of the WWE Championship Triple Threat Match against both Kurt Angle and the Big Show. This match was very good. Again not a classic, but still entertaining. JBL won the victory after Kurt Angle. His celebration, however, was short-lived when Teddy Long was informed by Backstage at No Way Out that he would defend the WWE championship in a Barbed Wire Steel match against Big Show. Not a nice way to spend a Sunday evening. <br /> <br /> And of course there is no show without a punch. Of course the reigning world heavyweight champion Triple Triple. His 2004 rematch of Unforgiven with Randy Orton was much better than at the original encounter. It's a shame because they just do not click in the ring well and that would be an excellent feud if they did. Orton played the concussion role very well and lost in the defeat to The Game. <br /> <br /> So the first big one of 2005 was a good one. It has achieved its goals. The feuds ended and new ones began. We were officially on our way to WrestleMania 21 now.
