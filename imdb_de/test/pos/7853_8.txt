I thought that Eastwood's most unusual role was in The Bridges of Madison County, but that was until I saw The Beguiled. He manages to do a very good job, and the rest of the cast does it too. The direction is inventive, since the film was shot in 1971 and there were no storylines that the director sometimes finds it difficult to cover up - we would talk about a great movie. Nevertheless, it remains powerful. <br /> <br /> 8
