I loved the movie Judas Kiss. Carla Gugino's performance was exceptional, probably her best career. Her facial expressions were unbelievably characteristic in many scenes and were best exploited by director Gutierrez. All actors and actresses were very good at their performances. Emma Thompsom was as always wonderful. Her acting skills far exceed what would be required for this character, and improve her in the film. <br /> <br /> Although the story is sometimes too complicated, it remains entertaining and aimed at the end. Really really good. A movie that should not be missed. A well woven and brilliant story. Quality of the film, excellent.
