Is that a good movie? No certainly not. But for Jolie lovers, it's a must. Her non-polished drama and semi-nude scene will thrill her fans for many years to come. The current rating (3.2) is too low. The movie may be missing a good plot, and it's not a great sf movie, but the acting is good enough (and as I said, Jolie's acting is nice and raw), the movie is shot very directly, with a lot of near-ups. The landscape is bizarre. And last but not least, van Damme was a great choice. Probably none of the Jolie lovers would like to see that she has sex with him. This movie has all the potential to become a cult movie.
