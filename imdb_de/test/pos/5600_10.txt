In the Book of Life, Martin Donovan Jesus, who arrives at JFK Airport on December 31st, sets out to initiate the new millennium by fighting with Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and deciding the fate of the world. There is also David Simonds (Kurt, the amateur accountant) as a compulsive, homeless player. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary alien and alien world flows artfully through. framed scenes and urban / industrial landscapes with dazzling light and shadow. As usual, he prematurely introduces seemingly random details and later returns them in witty and unexpected contexts - the humor is simple but dizzy and irrevocable. Hartley has an amazing ability to build on small and adorable moments of both worldly and unheard of. As usual, he creates a tone that is dull and world-weary, yet vulnerable, open and honest. It moves within a few minutes from seditious humor into a metaphysical and poetic language - the kind of writing that is so deadly and perfect that it is difficult to hold back tears, even though there are no obvious emotions. Another great and extremely entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The book of life is turned (with a digital camera?) with a blurry effect: a sense of the heavenly hand in hand with impending doom and hyperconsciousness of the present as fragile and fleeting in its final moments. All of Hartley's films have a way to prioritize the present, but this unique effect is compounded by the fact that the images on the screen suffocate in a manner that is shaken at first sight, but become more and more beautiful when you get involved. The last shot is spectacular. All of this may sound precious, but the movie is a comedy, and it makes fun of itself, though it makes fun of the concept of Armageddon, Judgment Day, and "urbanity." Although it is profoundly profound, moving and life-affirming, it is usually carefree and playful. The drama is impeccable in terms of the muted tone that Hartley has developed in his films (a tone that some people do not get and that makes them judge such behavior as hollow - the same people who have a negative reaction) to Peter Greenaway). There are certainly people who react to this film with cynicism and contempt - people who are deterred by Hartley's abrupt shifts and what they consider to be presumptuous or mannerist techniques - but anyone who is a Hartley fan will love this film ( If they get a chance to see it, that is). It's hard to say what it would look like on video.
