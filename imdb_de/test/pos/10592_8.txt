I loved the movie personally. I had it preordered for a month and saw it twice a day I received it by email and since then several times. Yes, the time can be a bit much, but the rest of the film compensates for that clearly. All amused, but the play was right for every part. The plot itself is just ... haggard! There is no other way to describe it. Who's going to make a movie about someone who gets shit? BAM, that's who. Genius. Just awesome. Two thumbs up. It would be an honor to work with him every day, at all times and with all things.
