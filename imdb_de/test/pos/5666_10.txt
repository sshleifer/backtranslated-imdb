<br /> <br /> Giorgino is a strange, dark, obsessed object. The casting is impressive, the plot is strong and reminded me of Edgar Poe's stories. Probably not a masterpiece, but it leaves us the memory of strong images, fine music, fear, sadness, confusion and a sentence that says everything: The wolves come. GIORGINO is pretty much forgotten now, and when it was released, nobody seemed to appreciate it. That's a shame. If you ever have a chance to see this, try it.
