Ever since they first came to Outer Banks and made the film (I've lived here all my life), I've been waiting for this movie to come out. I've waited and waited and waited more than a year and a half for this movie, and it was worth it for me. <br /> <br /> The film is different from the book, but in my eyes it is still beautiful work like the book. I cried in both, there were moments that tore me apart. I laughed and smiled the same way. It's a great movie with a great story. <br /> <br /> It's about never giving up, finding it, the one who will change you forever. The one who will shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new way of looking at life. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it's possible to meet someone and let him change your life forever did with Lane. I met the love of my life and was immediately fascinated that I never forgot him or how much I fell in love with him until I "met" him a year later. For me, I could deal with this movie with all my heart. I think when you hear and see the movie with your heart and hopes, you'll see what I'm talking about. It's never too late to find your true love, great job, Mrs. Lane and Mr. Gere!
