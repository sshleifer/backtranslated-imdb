The best thing about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again and you're still not satisfied. I have watched this movie at least ten times in the last 12 years and yet I laugh as if I were seeing it for the first time. I like good comics like Orgazmo, Cheech n Chong, Monty Python and many others, but this one in Hindi is one of my favorite movies. Some of them lately in Hindi are Golmaal, Munnabhai series and Herapheri series. So all I can say is that the Hind comedy is finally evolving. But Andaaz Apna Apna is quite different from the movies I've said above. It's what I call the Hindi-stoned comedy, and very few that were around 1994 in Hindi cinema.
