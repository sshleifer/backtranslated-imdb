One of Starevich's earliest films filmed in France may be his only political satire. The story of the frogs who sought a king reflects their title as a group of high-level crooks who feel that democracy is declining, so they demand a king of Jupiter to govern his country. When he sends down a tree stump, the frogs ask for another king and say that the stump is just "political wood". This time, Jupiter sends down a hungry stork whose frowning eyes engulf the inhabitants of the city. As the original "croaker" slips down the cranesbill, he speaks of his moral: "Let It Be Good Enough". In this film, there are some nice mass scenes of dozens of puppet frogs. Starewicz makes viewers believe that they are all moving at once, keeping the background moving and animating only about six frogs at a time. The somewhat feeble-minded dialogue and the lighting issues in some places worsen the quality of the retakes, but it is important to observe them because of its historical significance in Starewicz's life. His feelings towards the government immediately after his flight from Russia are likely to be reflected in this film. Also amazing is the technical power to animate so many characters simultaneously in a stop-motion movie.
