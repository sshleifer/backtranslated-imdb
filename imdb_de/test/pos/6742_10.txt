This is undoubtedly one of Neil Simon's best films. It's full of great characters and an unforgettable dialogue. Johnathan Silverman makes a great screen version of the young Eugene (he was played on stage by Matthew Broderick). This is the first of Simon's autobiographical trilogy, followed by the wonderful "Biloxi Blues," and ends with the television movie Broadway Bound. , If I had to say that the film has any shortcomings, it could be that the characters sometimes talk in an obvious dialogue, but that's fine, because it's a great dialogue. Rent this little gem, you will not regret it!
