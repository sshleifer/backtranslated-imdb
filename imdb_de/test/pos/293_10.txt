I would like to submit the following matter: <br /> <br /> During the bridge scene you see soldiers waddling in the river who want to be taken along and seek refuge. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and try to board with suitcases. Soldiers are neither exposed nor carry suitcases in a combat zone. They have packsacks, backpacks and footlockers, but no suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and not tenable. If you look closely, you will also see that the suitcase floats on the water. This is probably a very good indication that it is empty, otherwise it would sink.
