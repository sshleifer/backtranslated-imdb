This is only commented on because Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953) initially does not know how powerful a score is and how majestic these texts really are. If you read the lyrics to Alexander Nevsky op.78, there is nothing here. It is less than a witness to one of the most beautiful and moving scores of all musical literature. This film with its accompanying score has a special place in the world and this can be as true on the internet as anywhere The composer's own website, which is underpinned by his estate, adds extra care when this score is truly earned. It is so deep for me, how far it is from such boldness, that you want to be the one whom you called Big Novgorod This is a song about Alexander Nevsky. Yes, it happened on the river Neva - on the river Neva, in the wide waters. There we met our enemies to fight men - there were men of soldiers, the army of Swedes. Ah, how we fought, how we did them! In this fight, our blood was shed free for our great country, our original Russian land. Hey! Where the broad ax hovered like an open road, through its ranks was a path in which spears ran Sweden like feather grass growing on desert soil. We will never deliver a native Russian country. You will be put to death! Rise against the enemy, Russian land, rise, stand to arms, great Novgorod! Poor goes on) Get up, you Russian people, in battle, just in the fight to death, get up, their people free and courageous, defend our beautiful homeland! Home, For Russian soil, get up, people, Russian people! No enemy will live in our great native Russia. Stand by the arms, open yourself, mother of Russia! No enemy should march over Russian land, no foreign troops will invade Russia, they are unseen The roads to Russia. No enemy will destroy Russian fields (here, dear reader, we are asked to live forever with the following verses e) titled "The Field of the Dead" -I will walk across the snow-covered field, I will fly over the death-field. I will seek brave warriors, my fianc√©e, my intrepid youngsters. Here lies one of a fallen Wild Saber, there is one impaled by an arrow. From their wounds blood fell like rain on our native soil, on our Russian fields. He who has fallen in noble death in Russia, will be blessed by my kiss on his dead eyes, brave guy who has remained alive, I will be a true wife and a loving friend. I'm not married to a handsome man, the earthly charm and beauty fade fast and die. I am married to the man who is brave. You notice this, brave warriors! (ending with the entry of Nevsky in Pskov) In a big campaign Russia went to war. Russia has torn down the enemy troops To death! Celebrate and sing, mother of Russia! There are no enemies in our homeland. You will never see Russian cities and fields killing on Russia march! In our big Russia, in our homeland Russia, no enemy will live! Celebrate and sing, mother of Russia! All of Russia came to the celebration in triumph. Celebrate and enjoy, Russian motherland! Put some pressure from Stalin, if you like, well. This music was really endorsed by Stalin. For me, it's an unmistakable beauty in the way we love this world, and Nevsky tells of a hero whose attributes like God are for everyone's participation in this love. A really nice and stealthy telling of the story of Alexander Nevsky.
