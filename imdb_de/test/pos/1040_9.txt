Has anyone already found a way to buy copies of this series? I can see that many people have asked, but I can not say if one of them was successful. It's hard to believe that such a good show today can not be viewed by people, especially when it comes to real issues real people faced in our country during this exciting and exciting time. How can this be true and how can we change it? Apart from that, I agree with all the comments that other authors have made on this website about this series. This is an excellent story about events that everyone should know and know about today. Many of us have seen this series anyway when we were in college. Now we want to share it with our kids ... but we can not? If that is true, what would some good written materials be that would pass on the same information?
