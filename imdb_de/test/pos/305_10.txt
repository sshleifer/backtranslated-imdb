Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing social values ​​and beliefs and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offers such as "The Longest Day" and "The Green Berets," which are more like Disney fantasies. The "Apocalypse now!" The project, the production, and the resulting film, "Heart of Darkness," has been rebuilt into a psychological horror story of late 20th-century postmodernism diversity. The performers and crew who worked on it could probably relate to the frightening places that the human mind can reach. This is the fate of Joseph Conrad's original character Kurtz, who became a literary creature in 1901 and later was expelled from TS Eliot's "The Hollow Men" (1925) by Mistah Kurtz. Although it is not a straightforward narration of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience "Apocalypse Now!" stands as a masterpiece that pushed the potential of the film in the air. "Apocalypse" is not just about the "horrors" of war itself, like "Platoon" and "The Deer Hunter," but about the darker sentiments of human nature, manifest in the raw and humiliating confrontations of violent mass-scale conflicts disclosed. Apocalypse now! is not experienced so much as experienced. <br /> <br /> The main part of the film consists of the journey of a trained secret assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tour-de-force performance) aboard a US military. A boat carrying a nameless one River crosses into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia, where few Western visitors would ever step. His mission is to finish Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), an officer in the Special Forces Division of Career who was the darling of the US military until he was rejected in the deep, unexplored jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official secret report says the colonel has gone mad. However, something else happened with the events that is far more frightening than madness. Sheen's mission is to end the Colonel with the American public, but this is not wiser. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty episodic. The voyage along the river consists of several vignettes, while Sheen and his crew meet various self-contained "aspects" of the war on the ground floor. The American public of the 1970s probably never saw this kind of filmmaking, with the possible exception of "The Deer Hunter," which was released the previous year. The first and most notable is a helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance), a cross between General Robert E. Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves to play "Ride of the Valkyries" from Wagner's "The Ring" when he bombs helpless villages. His line "I love the smell of napalm in the morning" is one of those often quoted lines from the annals of the cinema. Other encounters are an amphitheater in which the private hired by Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies are entertained. <br /> <br /> Despite production disasters that did not bring this material into the can, the notable aspect of this film is its pace. The original version (not the later Redux version) does a good job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climate change confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. But the strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission. Some of Sheen and Brando's shots in certain locations are some of the most blatant and horrific images ever produced in the film. Not even Clive Barker, Wes Craven, or David Cronenberg have anything of Coppola's in terms of terrible imagery. In particular Kurtos Kurtz in one scene is so scary that most other horror movies seem tame by comparison, which is evoked by the realization that the horror does not come from the outside, but from the inside. <br /> <br /> Without giving too much Coppola's solution to the climax is one of the most innovative cinematic revelations. According to the documentary "Hearts of Darkness", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would merge into the melodrama and affect the atmosphere of the film's darker hues. He was not sure how he could do it until his wife encouraged the director to testify to ox sacrifice ceremonies as practiced by the aborigines Coppola worked with in scenes with Kurtz in "his" village. After the visit Coppola had its end and it is one of the most disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American filmmaking. Love it or hate it, no western viewer will be the same after viewing this scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for all tastes as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that is read on airplanes. It's not just the violence and senselessness of violence that is hard to grasp for most American viewers. It is the naked revelation of aspects of the human condition that seem so remote from American suburban life that it is difficult for the average moviegoer to handle, which is supposed to be. Coppola did not make a family portrait. However, if the viewer can understand his bigger point, much of Apocalypse Now! Pick up. If you're looking for a movie experience to reinforce pre-existing attitudes toward American sensibility and heroism, you'd better stick to John Wayne. But if you're ready to be taken in places you've never been to, the rhetoric "Apocalypse Now" will even take you beyond "the evils of war" into a world that you thought you still had you've never visited before, and you can tell the disturbing part of it.
