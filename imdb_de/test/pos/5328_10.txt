I looked at the external reviews (Ebert etc) for this movie and they were all pretty negative. However, after reading many of them, I noticed that they all made the same statement. Critics were upset that the film is about a pointless murder of an autistic child. That is certainly a worrying picture. Critics like Ebert want a traditional detective story that reveals why the murder happened and blames the guilty party. They want the blame thrown and solved. Well, this status quo theme is a kind of parody of the movie. The critics, like society, wanted a very quick solution to move on to their next tragic opera. Maybe there is no simple question to answer here? There is much more to what happened than to the surface. The film does not try to rationalize what happens, but understands the why. What appeals to me about these inhuman reviews is that they only deal with Spacey and Cheadle, both of whom were great (and generally are). But besides the two current icons of Hollywood there are other great achievements at work here. Gosling offers an incredible performance that only someone of extreme talent can really provide. Somehow, Gosling can sympathize with the murderer of an autistic child. I am sure that this irritates many. But when you look at the movie, you see what Leeland's motivation is, it's wrong, but it's not evil. Malone is another confused young character. Basically, killing the child in this movie is not the main theme of the movie. The main theme is life itself and how people handle it, the ups and downs, and how they sometimes try to help others deal with their lives (which does not work very well). There is a lot of good and bad in this world, and how we handle it has a direct bearing on how much good and bad will happen, and sometimes a confused attempt to do good leads to a whole host of bad ones. I think this is one of the most memorable movies in the past and has an end that is as touching as anything in recent film history. I am firmly convinced that people should see this movie open-minded.
