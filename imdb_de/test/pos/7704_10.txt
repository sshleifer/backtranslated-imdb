I watch this movie with horror in my heart because my mother was also a tough head like Michelle. I was wondering where Michelle is now. There were times when I had to find my mother in places I was afraid of, but more afraid to leave her there! To see how Michelle behaved like that, she asked me where she was sleeping all the time? I watched in the hope that it had never been so bad for my mother! and what I want to know is ... where did Matt and Tracy rip that ass ?! The worst scene for me was to see Tracy in an old naval dressing room !!!! They who never dress in front of you, and it looks like they all have aides besides Michelle !!!! How do you know this in 2008? can we get an update ??????????
