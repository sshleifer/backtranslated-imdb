I love this movie. It's the first movie Master P ever made. It is based on the story of his life. The budget is low, but it is very good. It shows how Master P grew up in projects in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Master P has not only started in this film, he was also author and director of Moon Jones. The DVD also has The No Limit ice cream party. This movie shows how Master P runs badly and how he had to deal with the things around him. It also has many of The No Limit Records in this movie. You should buy or borrow this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie you can watch if you like rap or are a fan of Master P. I will not spoil this movie for you. Get this movie as soon as you can and have a look at it. You will like it.
