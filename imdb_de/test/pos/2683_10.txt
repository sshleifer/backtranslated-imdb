This is, in short, the TV comedy series with the best cast of all time, and the most likable too. Each of them is a first comedy actor. I only know one TV series that was better (ie "Moonlighting"). that Willis was the main character, but only Willis, while the King of Queens has a handful of actors as good as you can enjoy - Kevin James, Leah Remini, Jerry Stiller, Patton Oswalt, Nicole Sullivan, Victor Williams, Gary Valentine and even the rest of them ?? I liked it spontaneously and constantly and promptly. Growing age did not affect the fun anyway. <br /> <br /> In a few words, the series is intelligent and original, miraculously spared from the current stupidity and garbage of television. It is politically incorrect and does not promote the minorities in the usual vile manner. <br /> <br /> The comic is very tasty and tasty. <br /> <br /> I mostly read a few IMDb writers, and sometimes they write about their favorite shows - although there are several writers, I have not seen the slightest mention of any of my favorite TV shows (- but it's true that the critics you like are not the ones he's in full agreement with, but those who at least have a common ground for disapproval, like WILD WILD WEST, MOONLIGHTING, QUEENS, FANTOMAS, the 80's TWILIGHT ZONE Years, Bradbury's TV show and SANDOKAN, most of which I saw when I was 13-14 years old, I wrote about a couple of them, terrible.
