I saw this movie at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002. This seemed to be one of the festival's less popular films, but it turned out to be all the more interesting. <br /> <br /> The story of An actor trying to cope with himself and his environment after withdrawing from drug addiction is based on factual facts. In addition, the people playing in the film are the real people who relive this experience, this time for the film, which is partly set up as a stage play. Not only are they all good actors, Jia Hongsheng's parents are also real-life actors, and the methods they use to emphasize their relationship with Jia are very effective. <br /> <br /> Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese action movies in the late eighties, starting in the nineties. Later you can see him in great movies like Frozen and Suzhou River. In between these two career paths, Jia becomes a drug addict and loses any urge to do anything or even do something productive, except for some futile attempts to become a guitar virtuoso. In this scenario, post-withdrawal behavior is more emphasized than drug horror , We really feel the pain and the struggle that Jia is in. At the same time, we hate him for the way he treats the people around him. <br /> <br /> The film pulls the viewer into a tiring pattern that Jia seems to be catching and has his parents and sister with him trying to take care of him. Because there are personal "interviews" with the characters, we feel as if we are getting to know Jia not only through oneself, but also through others. <br /> <br /> The film feels heavy, but scenes in which Jia passes away Celebrating and celebrating with friends makes the sound easier. The bitter humor at many events throughout the film. The music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while. This is a movie that many people can not easily relate to, but for those interested in the more serious and modern Chinese film, this is a strong recommendation.
