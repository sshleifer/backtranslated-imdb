Think of it as an extreme form of detention without trial. Without commenting on US foreign policy and on the side of US foreign policy, the Extraordinary Transfer process involves the transportation of persons suspected of terrorist activities to a foreign country, the opposite of extradition if you wish to a place where torture is not a crime but means inadmissible information. Instead of staining your bottom with blood from possibly innocent parties, do so abroad, where such tactics are accepted as interviewing techniques. Of course given the severity of the tactics and the attempts to break down a person Sometimes you would get what you want, if you have overcome the resistance, or get nothing, or, least of all, get a confession, just because the mind is broken so far, that the subject corresponds to what you say. It is an ugly process, and what is the best way to do it, if you are a human rights advocate and use the nod to use all the means necessary to protect more lives, in a time when the information of the people is at stake Key to the fight against terror are. This is in a country where the rights are probably questionable. Rendition is this year's Syriana, even though we have a number of political thriller contenders ahead of the New Year who will take over this crown, especially with Rendition, followed by the Robert Redford film Lions for Lambs Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep (again, though now across the fence) and The Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, though this is the case here, would probably turn out to be more action-oriented. Directed by Gavin Hood, who has taken on the role of the new Wolverine drama on Tsotsi, Rendition is a decent thriller with a top-notch cast - in a narrative that has proven quite popular lately - the split for lots of variety provides perspectives that are presented by an ensemble cast. <br /> <br /> Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a chemical engineer, is being overtaken on the way to returning home under the command of CIA Top Brass Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep). , In a detention center outside the United States, Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (oh so prophetically) begins his very first interrogation session, no doubt being pushed into a position for which he has not registered. Back at home, a very pregnant Reese Whitherspoon desperately looks for answers to her husband's disappearance and seeks the support of Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard) from ex-flame as he works for Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin). Throw in J.K. Sinmmons, a terrorist conspiracy and a burgeoning, forbidden love story between Fatima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas), is buzzing in a busy picture. <br /> <br /> Faced with Places of Occupation Regarding places, schedules and the like, Rendition was not at all confusing at all, and it dealt with a skilful handling of the material, never quick assessing and ideas and thoughts of both Could present pages of the equation. Each character has his own agenda, and the unveiling of this agenda requires enough to keep you from getting bored or confused. And best of all, they bend in a very different way to self-preservation in a variety of forms and ultimately in a variety of loose-and-lose situations. It also let you guess - he has or not, and has been playing with your mind all the time, whether Anwar deserves what he gets. It used a very clever melee that I could not see until it was too late (ie the credit), although it gave way to the usual stereotypes of terrorist fighters and without spending much time exploring their motivations. <br /> <br /> Maybe there was no need, as there are so many films already referring to this issue (Paradise Now, Day Night Day Night, even Syriana). While it turned out to be rather one-dimensional (a personal tragedy of tying bombs to become a suicide bomber), I felt that Rendition had the right not to find a sweet end, that this fight against negative, destructive ideology is nothing can be addressed in a two-hour movie, and I am glad that he has clearly mastered such fairytale implausibilities. <br /> <br /> What we have instead is a well-honed story that focuses on the subject of rendition and is likely to be able to stimulate discussion as soon as the lights go on, which camp you belong to - do Do you support the mediation of severe pain during interrogation? Yes or no? This is the fundamental question of our time. Yes or no? (OK, I'm ready for Lions for Lambs)!
