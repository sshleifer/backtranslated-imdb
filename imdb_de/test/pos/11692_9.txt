Beauty in Trouble (Kráska v nesnázích) is not a good title. All descriptions of this movie do not grasp what it really is? a fairy tale for adults. A poor girl is courted by a prince. The "girl" Marcela, played by the stunning Anna Geislerová, has a beauty of Isabelle Huppert with red hair, face and figure that are beguiling, sexual and infinitely fascinating. She has a wife, but they have good sex. The children listen to the play of love through walls. It is rough and passionate, as the gender of the working class is often portrayed in the film. But it is also clear to us that this is the thing that holds them together in an otherwise incompatible marriage. The husband, a professional car thief, is eventually arrested and jailed. We do not know how she got involved in this marriage, but she is not exactly high class herself. But she is beautiful, intelligent (we assume) and loves her beautiful and resilient children. She deserves more. And maybe she'll get the life she deserves - after all. (no spoiler!) She has to retire with her mother after her husband has been sent to jail. Mom has a vile second husband (read Ugly Stepfather). He is a real horror show. He is adjacent to a child who abuses the children. He is obsessed with cleanliness, but farting rudely at the table and demands of the children all the time manners and decency. He is really a social disabled person. Mom is like Marcellas husband after, at least he is lustful - horrible but cool. The ambivalent, confusing, layered characterizations make the movie so powerful and interesting. These characters have defects, some seemed driven by the class, others by innate character. These mistakes and details of the character are one minute charming and the next contemptuous. The audience must really negotiate a conflicting class, sexuality, ambition, commitment, and a woman's role as a mother and wife through the rapidly changing terrain of the story. The bottom line, as with many films such as the wonderful Icelandic film "Thicker Than Water (Blóðbönd)", the children can be the victims. What can be the best for the children in the end? Who are our salvation and our future? It is a subject that is used in films from Pan's Labyrinth to Children of Men. Foreign. Cinema is realized in complicated moral stories that life is confusing, brutal and unfair, and we as adults need to work together to achieve this. Give something valuable to the next generation: When we give in to our lower instinct, we can take ourselves and the world with us to lose. The extraordinary and complex and colorful characters in Kráska v nesnázích speak of the qualities of what makes a man what a woman does, what embodies hope, what is great - is it the economic status of the character of his character? The film is very human, as embodied in the last two shots, which has moved me incredibly and unexpectedly so subtly and intelligently that comparing it to an American movie seems unfair. Americans sometimes seem to lack the desire to remember that paradoxes in human nature do not provide fixed resolutions. But here, dangerously endangered in apparent fairy tales for adults, there are interesting moral issues. Do not be fooled by the simple story; This is a great movie.
