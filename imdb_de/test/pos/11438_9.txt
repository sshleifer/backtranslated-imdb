This movie is almost never seen today - the only reason I can enjoy it again and again is a slightly worn-out VHS copy that I made when the film was shown here in England in 1991. Ensemble cast makes it obvious Fun, and that is reflected in the viewer. A razor-sharp script helps those things, and once you've seen this, you want to watch it over and over again. Wayne Rogers is the "star" but everyone contributes to a great movie A great jazz soundtrack. There are emotional moments during the film, but never so buzzing sweet sentimentalism - these guys are on the journey of their lives, and they convey that excitement wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you can actually get to see it.
