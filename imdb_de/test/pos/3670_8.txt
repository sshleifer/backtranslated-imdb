Yes, sometimes overwhelmed "unconditional love" when it rebounds - no, when it rebounds - from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. It was not until I saw the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think that P. J. Hogan had attempted with this bizarre, unconventional film. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love that Grace (Kathy Bates) craves and describes later in the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is just that, without condition and without qualification. So again, I looked at "Unconditional Love" in that sense. I laughed a lot more than the first time, I became more involved with the characters, I began to understand that the story is sometimes absurd. The performances are often exaggerated, but not more than necessary to fit Hogan's weird and crazy vision, a vision that moved me to tears, longings and bursts of angry laughter. Yes, Hogan demands a lot from his audience. But I really learned to love his movie - unconditionally.
