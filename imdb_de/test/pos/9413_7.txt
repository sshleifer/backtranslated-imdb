Maverick director Seijun Suzuki was finally able to film his dream project "Princess Raccoon", and in a sense, it's fortunate that he did not try this in the 1960s. Special effects and computer graphics certainly made this type of production easier than the old film mat technology. <br /> <br /> A little familiarity with Japanese history and theater traditions will contribute to the enjoyment of this film. Familiarity with Shakespeare's "The Tempest" would help with Peter Greenaway's dense "Prospero's Books". These two films actually have a bit in common, though "Princess Raccoon" is much more colorful and easier for someone to see, without the background they fully appreciate well for the most part of the movie, it seems to that viewer that im the last third of the film runs out of energy. Most of the interesting sets have already been introduced, and the camera seems to stand back to experience more of a filmed stage experience. This is certainly a unique movie experience, and I recommend it to anyone interested in alternative forms of film performance. It is not really meant for children, although nothing that would upset them. If the last third were better, I would have given him nine stars.
