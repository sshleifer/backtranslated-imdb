Down Periscope is not a "great movie". But then there are very few flicks. So if you're looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom, this is a "great movie" without the capitals. No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoil this light comedy about a group of outsiders associated with an antique submarine. They will not fulfill their duties so that a general can get his extra star. You have to take over the entire US Navy with their nuclear submarines. But they are outsiders and this is a comedy, so you can guess the outcome. But you became for those underdogs and that makes it a very entertaining movie. Watch and enjoy ******** (eight stars)
