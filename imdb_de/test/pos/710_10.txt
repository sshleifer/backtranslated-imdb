I love watching the Jericho mile. I mean, watching Peter Strauss walk the mile is like watching the bolt sprinting at 100m. I think Peter Strauss is an excellent actor and should make another running film. It's lightning fast, has great energy and can run a mile in less than 4 minutes, and my friend is incredible. No man alive can run Murphy out of the rain. I mean, the guy runs 80 miles a week, nobody does that except him. I have seen the Jericho Mile a hundred times and will see it a hundred times more. Great movies are more viewed than films that are not. I thank the creators of this film for making sure they can do it for years. They are great people and I bless them all.
