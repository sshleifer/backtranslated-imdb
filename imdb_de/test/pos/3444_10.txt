When I saw this film or rather a series of films in my early teens, I irrevocably changed my idea of ​​the possibilities of human interaction and the range of possible experiences. This monumental exploration of individuals and their historical surroundings shows how physically and intensively every human existence is. People are portrayed as they are for themselves: their experiences from the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomena are detailed with utmost skill and perception. Edgar Reitz shows a fabulous appreciation of human motives and longings. <br /> <br /> If these phenomena face the immense time allowed by the duration of the work, one can not help but grasp the power and liveliness of happiness, defeat, lust, love, sadness, melancholy Every human being feels. As I watched these films, I saw my future experiences of how my life would inevitably twist and oscillate because of intentional and random events. I got a sense of the longevity of being and of what it meant to reflect past lives, memories and contexts. A masterpiece and a revelation. I just wish the BBC would see it again. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows where I can get a copy, they could contact me
