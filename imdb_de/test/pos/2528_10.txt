I am originally from Brazil ... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation done to this boy. They told his life story and he never got a "Centavo" (Brazilian cents) of this movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through this lifestyle in Brazil. Sorry ... but that's the world we live in. It's about making money, not saving lives. Question is: Where is Fernando today? Most likely ... dead We tend to want to live in this "Disney-filled fantasy life". When someone comes to the plate to help ... the higher power comes and says, "What do I get out of it? Where is my cut?" - I wish people's conscience would express themselves!
