It's one of the paradoxes of Basil Rathbone's anti-Nazi Sherlock Holmes (Voice of Terror, SH in Washington and these) movies, where the plots and shots are usually awful, but he's so good at them. Despite a bizarre, windswept haircut that makes him look younger, he breaks through every scene with so much bite and attack that you hardly notice how weak the actions are. Here he also has a great relationship with Lionel Atwill, who makes a wonderfully repulsive Professor Moriarty - a heavy cockroach with a lid and beautiful hints of sadism and depravity (it could not have been acting, children). At the peak, in a lab coat, to drain Rathbone's blood "drop by drop," he's just as weird as Seinfeld's archenemy Newman. The film itself is an ancient kiddie matinee prize, but benefits from director Roy William Neill, who focuses on staging and atmosphere. The UCLA restoration of the DVD also looks pretty sharp. Do not think about buying another edition that contains all the faded, choppy public domain prints.
