I think this movie was made as good as it could have been. With just 4 months and a budget of $ 52,000, I'm surprised it was not worse. If you are not interested in CG or special effects, this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Okay, the movie is not done so well (I'm sure it could have been, but you're trying to do better in just 4 months), but the story is good and the movie is pretty exciting. <br /> <br /> Do not trust me when I say that this movie is good, because I also think that 1933 King Kong is good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I did not watch the full movie either ... I might have rewound a few minutes here and there ...
