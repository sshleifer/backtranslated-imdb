I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the story and the character development. Fulci was a master at creating a terrifying atmosphere with imaginative camera work, lively cinematography, and a wonderfully explicit gore. <br /> <br /> However, this film is no exception compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2), City of the Living Dead, House at the Cemetery, etc.) The characters here are very well developed and the emphasis is shy before the supernatural. Rather, it's about the excitement created by a classic Who-Dunnit amidst the green hills of Italy. The scene is reminiscent of moments reminiscent of well-kept folklore, and is immediately surrounded by mud and blood-soaked terror surrounded by crumbling ruins. The blood in this film is not quite as widespread and seems restrained compared to the later films of Fulci. Splatter and Giallo fans will most likely be saturated with a few close-ups of wounds and the last 5 minutes of the movie. <Br /> <br /> Overall, a fantastic and mature movie by one of our great Italian horror directors.
