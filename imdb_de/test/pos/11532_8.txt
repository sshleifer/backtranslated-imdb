I have seen this movie three times and each time I appreciate it more. I think Jordana Brewster should have received an Emmy nomination for her genuine and natural performance. Many of us who were Phoebe's age and history at the time will understand how real she is. Life for most of us is neither gentle romantic nor cynical pessimistic. It's a blurry balance, and this movie captures that balance. It is also well built, with so many fine details. Like the movie or not, considering the exceptionally high scores of women under the age of 18, we know that this film contains some important facts about how young women see themselves in the world.
