HOOT is about these three teenage kids trying to rescue a few pit-like owls. For me, I think that they are right, what is right and what is wrong. In this movie, a kid named Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) moved from Montana to Florida. and as he gets on the bus, a tyrant named Dana Matherson begins to harass him the next day. Roy hits the tyrant and runs out of the bus to track the mysterious runaway boy. Roy finally meets the Running Boy, who is called Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley). Well, actually, he has his nickname, which his stepsister Beatrice (Brie Larson) has given him because he can catch mullets with his bare hands. In any case, Mullet Fingers and Roy join in, and they team up with Beatrice to stop the construction of a new pancake restaurant. Mullet Fingers is the one behind all the vandalism that happened there. Later he is bitten by one of the dogs guarding the construction site. They faced the muckle driving the bulldozer and everyone could see the owls. It turned out to be a great movie because it showed where children in life can make a difference by focusing on what's right and what's wrong. That's the best part of this movie. It teaches everyone a lot about the wildlife and how important it is.
