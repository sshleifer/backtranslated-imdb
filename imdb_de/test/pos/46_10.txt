I saw this movie on HBO almost every night. I think it could have been successful in the theater if the advertising that led to it was first-rate. I was very impressed by the actress who played Nanny. She is an outstanding actress. My favorite actor is of course Terrance Howard. He is a very understated actor and deserves much more recognition than he received. The Ebony magazine has written a nice article about him and given him some of his due characteristics. Lakawanna Blue taught me the stories my parents tell us. They came from a similar city "Philadelphia, PA," where they had their fun at the junction joints and so on. I also want to say that Mos Def is an incredible actor. He has found his calling. I've seen him in several movies in which he has played different roles, from the bat to the doctor and he has the stuff! Please put Lakawanna Blues on video for rent.
