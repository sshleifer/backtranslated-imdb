That's what Australian TV and Australian politics, people with humor need !!! Good for ABC for the support of these guys. The show revolves around a bunch of Aussie guys who know how to shit shit on politicians or other people in the limelight. The boys use Sydney as the main location to cause a sensation in public. Look out for Crazy Wharehouse Guy or Mr. Ten Questions. The guys performing these acts are the same people who introduced CNNN. If you enjoyed CNNNN and the Glasshouse, you will love this show. I'm still interested in knowing which stunts are real and which are purely acting because the guys do questionable actions ...
