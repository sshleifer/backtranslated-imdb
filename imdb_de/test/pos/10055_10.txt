I have to rate this movie with 10. I'm sorry, but I think it's classic comedy. then, if you rate it for other Madonna movies ... so what? Are you telling me that it was not her best movie? Did not Mira Sorvino win an Oscar for nearly the same performance ten years later? Please, this movie deserves much more recognition than it gets. I also like to see it as a sociological A + study of the lifestyle of the 80s. Do you remember when you were able to go shopping the same day from Sam Goody and Cartier? Do you remember when women wore proud bushy eyebrows? So it was not a "last emperor", it was still good. There are certain films that I would see every day. actually three, spice up my day and make me smile. If you say "Who is this girl?" then I would also recommend "Party Girl" and "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion".
