Reading some of the other reviews in this movie, I was reminded of both good and less good aspects. But all in all, I have to say that it's one of the better movies I've seen lately from a number of genres or countries. It has, in particular, avoided many of the typical traps of recent international cinema, such as being beautiful landscapes or being "hip", being "fun" or imitating American films like Pulp Fiction. The film is unique in many ways. First, it is a film about relationships in which sex does not matter (unusual, especially for foreign films). It is also a film about the relationship between two men (also unusual - no "buddy movie", no homosexual tension, no ego / phallic contest). It uses little dialogue, but communicates a tremendous amount. It's a simple story, but full of complex details that can be easily understood by anyone and whose relevance is universal. I did not find the movie dark or depressing (it would all look like watching Hollywood movies with endless Hollywood movies), but rather a true reflection of human emotion. In the scene where Mahmut realizes that his cousin has disappeared, one sees, for example, both his sense of relief and that the cousin has disappeared and regrets that he has pushed him away. Who has not felt such ambivalence - in the loss of a friend or lover or in another situation? It is rare for such human emotions to be portrayed in a non-stereotypical way in the film. In terms of culture, or this is a Turkish film, it seems to me that the very difficult balance between a "Turkish" film - in terms of realities that are more applicable to this place (the larger struggle to do it in a Turkish city compared to create a European, the greater contrast between land and city) and a universal, human history that did not necessarily have to be set in Turkey. In this day and age, when people all over the world consume and fetish culture, this film does not try to seduce us as "Turkish," nor as "harsh reality" or as "Turkey." Istanbul IS '. And yet the cultural elements are there. I think the comparison with "lost in translation" somebody made is pretty good. Everyone, at least in the US, raved about this movie. Personally, I found it mediocre at best. It has been formulated by someone as a vague story supposedly dealing with 'disorientation' happening to people who live or travel overseas. Even if the film was humorous, the characters and their motivations or crises were never clear (even for a "lighter" movie or comedy, this is necessary). And I looked at myself with a typical "Orientalist" story of the alienated Amerian overseas. Back to 'Distant'. I'm sorry about the idea that this is bad, too slow, or has no conspiracy, but the people who say that know nothing about filmmaking and maybe nothing about being human. You do not have to be a movie lover or a cultural connoisseur to appreciate this movie. This movie will spend two hours of your time well!
