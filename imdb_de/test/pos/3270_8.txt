Jimmy (Heath Ledger) gets a simple job from Pando (Bryan Brown), an underworld kingpin, to deliver money to a specific address, but when no one comes to the door, Jimmy decides to bathe on the beach, taking his time but he realizes his clothes are messed up on the sand and the 10 giants have disappeared. Jimmy calls Pando to tell him the problem, but he does not want to hear it. Pando and his boys are trying their best to find Jimmy, which means he is no longer Jimmy if they get his hands on him. Now Jimmy hides and organizes a bank robbery to get Pandos money back. Throughout the chaos, he also meets the innocent sweet Alex (Rose Byrne) and together they drive through Sydney's King Cross. <br /> <br /> "Two Hands" is simply a gripping pick-me-up movie that's lively, intoxicating and incredibly fresh. What you have here is pretty much an urban gangster movie with a weird backdrop and local violence. what, how do you ask so fresh? Well, because it leads us to the underworld, where Australian culture glitters with criminals, who wear straps (flip-flops) and jerseys, holding cars and a can of beer in their hands? and do not forget the Australian humor, dry and sarcastic. It can be said that it owes a lot to people like "Pulp Fiction", "Goodfellas" (one of my favorites) and "Lock, stock and two smoking barrels" for his inspiration, but for me it's still something of its own , The film has a real mix of carefree moments, but also a nasty impression with unexpected shocks and black humor that can actually be disturbing. They just do not know what's coming and it has a nice touch of biting irony (especially the end) and great timing with its humor. A scene in which a bank robbery takes place will kill you, I guarantee you. The plot of the plot is a story that soon becomes old (or over the uninhabited road), adding a love story and then completing the gangster element. Most of the negotiations were cleverly constructed and intertwined, perhaps they could have been dispensed with the supernatural element that Jimmy's dead brother included, but in the overall context the multiple conspiracy seems to be all clicking together. Intense, natural and crisp dialogue filled the incredibly colorful screenplay with fast-paced Aussie-Slang / Twang - I'm fair dinkum! <br /> <br /> What really made the movie was Bryan Brown's performance of Pando. He only gave his character such a disgustingly charismatic / unpleasant personality that when he was not on the screen, he still felt his presence. He gave his character two sides - one as a graver, but the other side is such a good guy. A young Rose Byrne shines with her nervous sweet / quirky character Alex. She looked radiant and added a bubbly personality. Then you have Heath Ledger, who fits like the naive Jimmy. Great side cast with Susie Porter, Tom Long, David Field, Steve Vidler and Steve Le Marquand. Such raw achievements are achieved and you get fascinating, funny and believable characters. The rocking soundtrack, which is bursting at the seams with Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd, creates a cool atmosphere. The filming on location in Sydney's King Cross helped him to show through his own life and to show the Australian way of life. Moving camera tricks capture the scenery of the city, especially the pervading nightlife. This was a movie where I was completely happy with what I got in the end. All in all, a fast-paced crime thriller that achieves what he intended to do ... a fun, clever and crazy rollercoaster ride full of thrills and excitement, Stick and Two smoking barrels "by director / writer Gregor Jordan in his debut feature Do not hesitate, try it.
