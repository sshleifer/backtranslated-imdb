I saw this movie on the Galway Film Fleadh when he won the best short film. I have to say that I found the direction fantastic and the performances of the leading actors very memorable. Both protagonists are definitely names to watch out for. <br /> <br /> The last shot over the cliff was intriguing and I would like to find myself there when I wait for the end of the world to happen. The kiss was definitely a great payout, with great enthusiasm !! <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the film was made in a film, and I heard that the DOP won a prize at the Tribeca Film Festival for his work on this film, and I have to say ... well deserves. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s. It brought some great memories and some scary memories.
