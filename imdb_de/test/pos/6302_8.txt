The first shot of the consequences of love makes this fascinating and absorbing film perfect. A Travellator slowly carries a lonely, fuzzy figure towards the camera and pulls a huge suitcase behind her. Like the main character of the movie, we know nothing about him and our original interpretation of his profession, the contents of the suitcase could be something wrong. <br /> <br /> The consequences of love are so movie. From the title you can expect a Bergmanesq dissection of a relationship. Instead, we have one main character, Titta, who lives life in emotional exile and apparently chooses to cut himself off from his fellow man. If the film can be classified in any way, I would call it a mystery because we are dealing with who Titta is and what he is all about. What we know from the beginning is that he is 50'ish, cool, composed and expensive. He lived the last eight years in a Swiss hotel, which looked punctual. He always paid his room fee on time, but rarely showed any interest in the staff or other guests. His only real companions are a couple he occasionally plays card games with. The couple used to own the hotel, but now they have lost everything and only have the room in which they live. Her love for money, antiques and each other was her ruin and Titta seems to identify with her plight. He once had everything, but now he lives as a virtual prisoner in the hotel. His brother, a long-haired surf teacher, occasionally comes to see him, but he sees his visits as an intervention rather than a pleasure. They talk about the person Titta considers his best friend, even though he has not seen him for 25 years. This long-lost friend is now a telephone engineer fixing the communication network that brings so many together. Titta's phone conversations with his wife and children soon end when they refuse to speak with him. Halfway through the movie, Titta makes an unusual move and starts to open herself to a young barmaid from the hotel. With his judgment clouded by emotions, he sets himself on a course of action that will finally seal his fate finally. <br /> <br /> The slow unfolding of Titta falls out of grace and is beautifully staged, shot and scored. The dull techno soundtrack does a lot to build up tension as more and more secrets are revealed. The last half hour becomes a learned thriller, while Titta slips off his mask and faces the consequences of his actions again. The ending, with a visual allusion to Felini, is dramatic and ambiguous, and lets the audience question his motives again. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bliss, 06.01.06
