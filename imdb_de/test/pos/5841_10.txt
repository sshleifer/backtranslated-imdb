I've never seen a show with so much history, mystery, suspense and exciting excitement. I barely watch TV today, but I own every season of this show and it's incredible. Each episode is very well played, written and plotted. At the end of the show, I felt that the stories were too far-fetched to be in jail, but the actors burned it off. Sopranos are tall compared to OZ. In fact, any show that's on a cable network can go HBO or just not hold a candle for OZ. I wish it would come back for another season. If it happened, they would probably kill every character in the show, but hey, we all have to go sometime. As for the characters, I would say that O'Reily and Alverez were my favorites. Both were tough together in one scene, but their individual stories were, in my opinion, the strongest of all except, of course, Beechers, but still ... the best show ever, best network ever, some of the best actors ever, PERIOD!
