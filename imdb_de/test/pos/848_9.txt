Gene Roddenberry has never let his fans down. His death ended the sci-fi heritage that can never be achieved. Earth: The last conflict was the proof! His pilot and the first 2 Seasons were well written and meticulously produced, but somewhere along the way the Roddenberry contact was lost. The lead loss, Kevin Kilner (William Boone), has definitely hurt the series since it was an integral part of his work. The story is about humanity being visited by the Taelons, an alien race that calls itself "the Companions." After three years, they have given Earth new technologies, helpful information about the Universe and much more. Many question their intentions here on earth. The main intercourse link between the races is Da'an (Leni Parker) and for many it is the most reliable Taelon. Questions arise: Why are you here? What are their goals, does Da'an know about alleged conspiracies against humans? There is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist Jonathan Doors (David Hemblen), who uses his millions to investigate the Taelons. At the end of the first season, things are going well. Da'an seems trustworthy. Boone helps Doors with his investigation while working with Da'an and the Taelons as liaison. In the middle of Season Two, things started to shake and the once grandiose and intriguing series rolled down, mainly because Roddenberry had died and the producers, of which his wife Majel Barrett-Roddenberry was a co-producer, did not have their turn were. Nevertheless, the first season remains fascinating and fun to watch.
