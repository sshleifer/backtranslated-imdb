Leos Carax has made three great films: Boys Meet Girls, Mauvais Sang, Les Amants du Pont Neuf. In fact, these films were not that great, but they have the power of youth, the beauty of the youthful wilderness. Carax was well aware of what cinema was in these three films, but he tried to make his own vision of art without thinking of everything he had seen, but to use it and melt into his time , Pola X is a completely different film because Carax Les Amants made du Pont Neuf with a monopoly of $ 20 million, a movie that destroyed everything on the go. After such a movie, you can not do another movie from the same point of view. So Leos Carax has to change, and he did it. The movie is not as beautiful as the first, it is more reasonable, no studio, no dreamed Paris anymore, Carax has finally entered reality. It's not clean anymore, it's not poetic characters. Carax has become a romantic in the German sense.
