Many animation lovers regard Wladyslaw Starewicz as the great, forgotten genius of a special branch of art, the puppet animation he almost single-handedly invented. , , and as if by chance, almost by accident. As a young man, Starewicz was more interested in entomology than in cinema, but his unsuccessful attempt to film the battles of two stag beetles led to an unexpected breakthrough in filmmaking, when he realized he could simulate movement by manipulating bug carcasses she photographed a frame one time. This discovery led to the production of Starewicz's astonishingly artistic short film "THE CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE", which he produced in Russia in 1912, at a time when film animations of all kinds were still in their infancy. <br /> <br /> The Political The turmoil of the Russian Revolution led Starewicz to move to Paris, where one of his first productions - by chance? - was a dark political satire called "Frogland" or "The Frogs who Wanted a King". There's a sort of black comedy in almost every Starewicz movie, but it's very dark here, it's more for adults who appreciate the satirical aspects than children who would most likely disturb the climax. (I'm middle-aged and found it rather annoying.) In fact, prints of the film intended for English-speaking viewers of the 1920s were provided with maps and word games to mitigate the sharp sting The Finale. <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in a wetland, the Frogland Commonwealth, where citizens are dissatisfied with their government and convened a special meeting to see what they can do to make things better. They decide to ask Jupiter for a king. The masses are impressively animated in this opening sequence - it could not have been easy to make so many frog puppets appear alive at the same time - while Jupiter is portrayed as a droll white-bearded guy in the clouds who looks like he would rather take a nap. When Jupiter sends them a tree-like god who looks at them aloof, the frogs decide that this is not an improvement, and demand another king. Jupiter sends her confused and sends them a stork. <br /> <br /> Delighted by this towering-looking new king towering above the towers, the frogs greet him with a delegation of formally dressed dignitaries. The mayor steps forward to hand over the key to the Commonwealth while the photo is being recorded by newsreel cameras. To everyone's horror, the stork promptly eats the mayor and then happily takes to the streets and indiscriminately swallows citizens. A title card reads dryly: "The news of the king's hunger is spreading throughout the kingdom." When the frightened frogs again ask Jupiter for help, he loses his patience and floods their church with lightning. The moral of our story, which a hapless frog was about to eat, is, "Let it be good enough." <br /> <br /> Considering the time in which this startling little film was filmed, and considering that It was made by a Russian emigrant at the height of the besieged country's civil war. It would be easy to see this as a parable of these events. Starewicz may have been aware of Russia's uproar when producing "Frogland," but whatever prompted his choice of material, the film is a cautionary tale of universal application. "Frogland" could be the Soviet Union, Italy, Germany, or Japan in the thirties, or any country from any era that loses its vigilance and is overwhelmed by tyranny. It's a fascinating film, a charming movie even in its macabre way, but its message is no joke.
