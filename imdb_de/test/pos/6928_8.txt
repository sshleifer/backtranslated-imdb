At first, I thought this movie would annoy me. It was like I've seen this movie before. The disillusioned hero, the father figure and the nine-year-old sister, older and wiser than her years (see Gregory's Girl), became the loud, weird jewel of a movie after 15 minutes. Dylan Moran (whom I thought would only annoy me) was excellent. Like Mr. Gambon and the crazy Scottish hitman. Lena Headey was extremely sexy. For half of the movie, I tried to remember where I had seen her before. The probation officer She has the greatest smile. However, the real hero of this film is obviously Mr. Caine. This man was supposed to do a lot more comedy. This stands alongside some of his best comedy roles (No Note, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels). It is a pleasure to see him in all his scenes, but especially in the end. <br /> <br /> Nobody can say what Michael can do. <br /> <br />
