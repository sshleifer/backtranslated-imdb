Separate lies have changed my life. Actually, the Q & A. SPOILERS has UNDER. Read only if you watch or have already seen trailers: <br /> <br /> The character of Emily Watson cheats on the character of Tom Wilkonson. My first reaction to Dog Puppy Emily was: "It's over, drop her." Bad Riddance. " For some reason he stayed there. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept their needs. Sometimes he had to go. But he stayed with her and let her live her life. But I wanted to see her anyway. Then Julian, the scriptwriter and director, talked about the movie. I'm glad he did, because, frankly, I'm also you and too immature to understand the point before he broke it for me. <br /> <br /> Tom's figure loved her, and no matter how much her aspirations for her needs contradict what he wants, he would always love her. The relationship and love they shared was suddenly not a lie just because she wanted to be with someone else. The fact that she wanted to be with someone else did not make her who she was. If you are over fifty, there is a great chance that you will not find the love of your life. So they can not be so dismissive as they used to be when you were younger. You have to try and get things working, because the alternative could be a lot worse. <br /> <br /> She needed what she needed and she could not help it. He had to learn to let her go if he wanted to be the full man he could be. He helped her in the pursuit of her lover, even if it hurt him. <br /> <br /> Another thing: Julian said the controller's strongest tool is blame. <br /> <br /> Once again: The strongest tool of a controller is to blame. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Tom freed her from her burden. He felt the need to let her know that he loved her, but not to get her back; He wanted to let her know that she did not have to feel guilty or think badly about the relationship just because it ended so horribly. <br /> <br /> It's not my way of reviewing a movie based on it The message, not the execution, especially if I understand this message better when told by the director, but I'm doing one here Exception, because I feel more mature than when I see the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie's performance was a nice British pace. Rupert was slimy and disgusting. Tom and Emily were their usually solid, real characters.
