Main actor: <br /> <br /> Vlastimil Brodský .... Frantisek Hána Stella Zázvorková .... Emílie Hánová Stanislav Zindulka .... Eda <br /> <br /> Director Vladimir Michalek tells this charming story of old Enchanting twists that make the characters appealing, truly universal. Frantisek Hana is retired and on a pension, his previous job unknown. He lives with his forty-four-year-old wife Emilie in a very nice apartment. His son Jara desires the spacious apartment as a problem solver, as he has to accommodate one of his ex-wives and some of their children. The son is not a malicious intriguer, just a man with too many former husbands and a blind eye for the facility his father has for the home (which he moved to after his son left home). <br /> <br /> Hana and his older, close friend Ed spend a lot more time doing little con jobs, not for money, but for the pleasure of attracting easily outrageous people like estate agents. A popular trick is that Hana plays the part of a retired Divo of the Metropolitan Opera in New York, who returns home and needs a sprawling mansion. Ed is his companion, as gullible estate agents fall into themselves and offer in the hope of a lucrative sale chauffeured limousines and fine French restaurant meals. Unless they engage in well-planned scams, the two engage in swift tricks such as ostensibly being railroad security agents to kiss the breathless and ticketless youth sneaking into the trains. Chaste kisses, that is: There is no Lech here. <br /> <br /> Hana's long-lived wife is obsessed with saving enough money to make sure that the couple individually and together enjoy a great funeral, an event that Frantisek's life love is in no hurry to experience. <br /> <br /> Disagreements over money and Frantisek's promiscuous divorce funds lead to a crisis whose solution is both real and likable. Michalek looks for the emotions of the beholder, but he does it openly, honestly and effectively. <br /> <br /> "Autumn Spring" is, of course, a subtitle created in an increasingly lively Czech cinema. Not much has been shown in the US, but its availability on DVD will hopefully bring the movie in question to a wider audience. Unfortunately, Brodsky has recently succumbed to cancer, so this movie is a tribute to a good actor who gives his character a passion for the pleasures of life that must reflect the actor's own values. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
