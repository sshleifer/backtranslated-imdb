If you think about it, it's almost unbelievable that a movie about the death penalty (one of the most controversial topics in the world) could be filmed, offending neither the nor the other side. It is a testimony to Tim Robbins' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity, traits that can also be seen in his acting roles ("Shawshank Redemption", Jacob's Ladder) "for" and "against" camps ... so subtle that you can not put it into words subtle until disappearance, yet after viewing the picture one has the feeling that a compromise is possible, that it can somehow be worked out, if only we look deeply enough ...
