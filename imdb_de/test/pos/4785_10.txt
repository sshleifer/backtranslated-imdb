Steamboat Willy was not the first cartoon with Mickey Mouse. The first movie with America's friend was "Plane Crazy." "Plane Crazy" was released on May 15, 1928 in Hollywood, California, in silent film format. "Steamboat Willy" was released on November 18, 1928 as a sound film (it was also released on July 29, 1928 as a silent film). So "Steamboat .." became the first SOUND movie by Mickey, but NOT the first movie for the little American mouse. While many game shows used the question, "What was Mickey Mouse's first appearance?" The real answer is "Plane Crazy" and not "Steamboat Willy". These appointments can be signed out on IMDb under "Release dates".
