Deep Water explores the pressures and ambitions of a common man in compelling documentation. The testimony and archive footage provide a fascinating insight into the late 1960s and a groundbreaking competition for the world sailboat. The personal conflicts of duty between family, self and prestige are shared in one of the most memorable and impressive films I have ever seen. I was not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was successful and clearly directed. The story is usually respectful to the participants, with heroes and villains implied and not recklessly exposed. Most of the interpretation remains open to the viewer so that the space can relate to the situations and characters in person. This movie is a bittersweet experience with a fun mix of thoughtful excitement, joy and drama.
