I saw this movie when it came out, and then a few years later. I see it now 20 years later and it is still a very good story. Does it break down "Lifetime Movie Network"? Yes, but unfortunately there was no life at that time, so it had to be aired somehow. <br /> <br /> The cast was excellent. The story was a bit shameful; Two women become close friends, and without one of the two friends he has an affair with the husband of the other friends. She is invited to a dinner party in the house, and so she discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend. She is horrified and tries to break the affair. Shortly thereafter, he is tragically killed in a car accident that is severe for both women. Of course, the woman happens to find out about this matter and wants Holly to come out of her life now, but her friendship can prevail because they need each other's great cast and perfomances. I really enjoyed it.
