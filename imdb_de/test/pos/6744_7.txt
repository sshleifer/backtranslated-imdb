In this Crackerjack noir thriller from Columbia, a combination of Panic In The Streets and The Naked City, Evelyn Keyes is unknowingly The Killer That Stalked New York. Evelyn, who smuggled stolen jewels from Cuba, also smuggled the smallpox. It is misdiagnosed by Doctor William Bishop, and when they find out what the hunt is about, it is the treasure trove for most of the film, as well as the smuggled jewels. It is not until the end of the movie that the health department and law enforcement agencies realize that they are looking for the same woman. <br /> <br /> Evelyn is also on a mission. Her husband Charles Korvin has left her apartment. The most unkind part of all was that he was fooling around with her sister while collecting the gems in Cuba and tightening up smallpox. When Lola Albright commits suicide as her sister during the entire affair, Evelyn is on a mission to pick up Korvin or die trying. And that is no idle threat given the situation. <br /> <br /> The film was mostly filmed in New York like The Naked City and its cast is liberally sprinkled with many well-known names and faces. Keep an eye out for good performances by Connie Gilchrist as Evelyne's disagreeable landlady, Jim Backus as a powerful club owner, and Art Smith as Korvin's fence. <br /> <br /> A real sleeper in the noir category when sent.
