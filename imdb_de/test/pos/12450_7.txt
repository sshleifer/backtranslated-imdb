I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years old (you count). I absolutely loved it. I was Tarzan for 2 weeks after I saw it (climbing furniture, jumping around and making monkey noises). It all began to fascinate Tarzan and monkeys, but strangely enough, a long-lasting love for Christopher Lambert (remember, I saw Highlander shortly after). In 1984 I watched the movie for the last time until about a month ago. It happened to be a cable when I got ready for bed at 3:30 in the morning. Although it was late and I was tired and had to be at work at 9:00 in the morning, I stopped to watch this movie as a child loved. <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I realized that it was not so great from a movie, and even stranger, that Andie MacDowell's voice was being dubbed by someone else. Ian Holme was, of course, solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits were still going strong, but most of all, it surprised how good Lambert was as Tarzan. He was great! The depth he could capture in so few lines, his original body language, and above all, his ability to bring that character through his extremely large ark, were simply amazing. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I'm a Lambert fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. He was really pretty good in this movie and it's a shame he never had a chance to portray a character with such depth. <br /> <br /> So, to make a short story way too long, I was a bit disappointed that the movie was not so good, but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I regret it not to have to stay up until 6:00 am.
