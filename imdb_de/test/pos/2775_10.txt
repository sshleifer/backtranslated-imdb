Susie Q is an original and is not like this other bad Disney movie. *** Spoiler *** A boy named Zach moves to a new city and has difficulty in school. He is a good basketball. A girl in her fifties died with her boyfriend when her car was overturned by a bridge. Susie (Amy Jo Johnson) of the Power Rangers - pink Ranger - helps Zach as a ghost to take a necklace that he needs to explain to his sister about her mind, and finally Susie comes back to the bridge that she died then she gets into it her friend's ghostly car and they float high. later, when he misses her, he finds a girl who looks exactly like her. (do you believe in reincarnation?) Susie Q is a good movie that you can see from time to time, but they hardly give, because Disney has to fill everything with dumb movies, and I give him a <br /> <br /> 7 / 10
