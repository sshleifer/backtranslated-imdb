Outstanding story with supper spectacle of all performers. The warmth and insight of whom Joad represents moved from the screen into the heart of this viewer. The frustration and tenacity of Mother Madalyn in her quest to do His work until her last breath was also carried out by Barbara Hershey. The intertwining of the personalities of Joad and Mother Madalyn grew throughout the story with a breathtaking crescendo in the final scene.
