This TV series is about a stupid and unconventional English gentleman who goes through all kinds of funny incidents. I remember seeing Mr. Bean with my family in 1990 when I was a kid. My family laughed so much at every episode, and the content of it is still in our daily conversations twenty years later. Among the memorable scenes still in my mind is Mr. Bean trying to leave his parking lot, turn off the lights, count sheep, and put him in the pool. We bought all Mr Bean videos on VHS, no matter how expensive they were. It was worth it because we saw it again and again! It is so rare to see a very funny TV series that is suitable for all ages.
