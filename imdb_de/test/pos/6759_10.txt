Http://www.archive.org/details/The_Mascot_Complete <br /> <br /> One of the biggest animated shorts ever made. Starewicz is infinitely inventive and his techniques are still amazing after 70 years. We may have computer-generated techniques now, but everything he had in 1934 was a fantasy that needed no "no" to answer. Whatever he wanted to see on the screen, he created. <br /> <br /> And he really wanted to see bizarre stuff - every conceivable piece of scrap is put into service: old shoes, chicken bones, utensils, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats ... seems like there's nothing which is not forbidden. <br /> <br /> A really scary, even disturbing movie that should be seen by anyone who has a temporary interest in animation. This movie has to be seen to be believed!
