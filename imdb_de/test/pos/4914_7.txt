An outstanding performance by Vittorio Mezzogiorno and a masterful by Jean-Hugues Anglade adorn this strange story of lust, longing and alienation in France. The work of the two leading actors is impressive - subtle, intense and passionate. Unfortunately, the script is purposely sharp and dirty, and the overall effect leaves one a depressed mind. Those who appreciate good acting will be able to experience the courageous work of the leads on this often difficult film journey of Gallic life. <br /> <br />
