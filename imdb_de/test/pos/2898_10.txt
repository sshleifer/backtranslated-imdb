How are these guys going? They are each about 50 years old and behave as if they were only 30 years old. They play 3 hours of music at each concert and hardly break a sweat. This DVD is her first concert in Rio, Brazil. Although people do not speak English, they try to remember the words of the most famous Rush songs and try to sing a foreign language with their best friends at the concert. From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of Radio, this Concert DVD will keep you in the chair and will not keep you from the classics that you heard as a kid. This is their 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). I went to their Scranton PA concert and that was just as good, even though they did not play freewill in PA, so I was upset. <br /> <br /> They have freewill, they have The Trees, they have YYZ, The Pass, Driven, Dreamline, Red Sector A, Spotlight, Roll the Bones, 2112 and more. 10 out of 10 because nothing else is comparable. If you never go to a Rush concert then at least buy this DVD.
