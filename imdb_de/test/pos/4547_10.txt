The most important plus for this film is the combination of Chris Farley and David Spade. This was the first movie in which this comedy duo presented his Laurel-and-Hardy-like humor. Farley's obvious physical comedy ability is perfectly complemented by Spade's sarcastic attitude in every situation in which she finds herself. <br /> <br /> This movie stands out from other comedy films. Tommy Boy stands by Blues Brothers as a comedic work whose individual scenes and bits are taken from the storyline rather than serving to break the plot and give the film a disjointed feeling, as is the case with many other comedy films , Thanks to the excellent director of Sagal, every scene is tense and lets the story told or play. It's thanks in the same way that Farley and Spade are so funny. The acting of Dennehy, Lowe, Ackroyd and many others (see the gas station operator 35 km from Davenport) strengthens the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has to be viewed several times, because the film contains many fine nuaces that can be overshadowed by Farley / Spade. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is very well done and is the funniest movie I have ever seen.
