I saw the movie yesterday and for me it was a stunning combination of films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The best of the best. It was never boring and always in motion, every hour there is another character who harasses him (trying to kill). You never know what's next. In a word TERRIFIC !!!
