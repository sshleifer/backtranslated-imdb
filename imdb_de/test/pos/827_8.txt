I thought this was the most interesting movie JCVD ​​has done in a long time. I loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this movie. IMHO, JCDV can really have something to do. A little more lightheartedness, some obvious homage to other films, mixed with great fights ... I would like to see more of this style of filmmaking from him. One of the other posters said the bar scene was a desperado rip-off. I immediately saw the connection of R. Rodriguez, but thought it was very smart and wanted me to watch the movie again to look for more subtle hints from other films. JCVD rocks !! <br /> <br /> Other things after reading other comments: <br /> <br /> No music in the dungeon fight? At first, I did not like it at first, but then I found it interesting because it made me feel a bit unbalanced by giving us something we did not expect. It looks more realistic. <br /> <br /> I always laugh when directors like 2-year-olds cry, that their movie was "stolen" from the studio. Directors are paid to get a job done. The studio is the boss and they want the product they want. Few directors have an absolute final cut. In this case, JCVD ​​is THE talent and the only reason anyone looks at this movie. I'm sure he got a movie he was happy with. I have a relative who works in a post office and knew a little bit of history. PRESUMABLY, the director worked on and delivered his film clip. Everyone who saw it said it was a disaster ... then JCVD ​​and the studio reworked the movie. This stuff happens all the time. He also saw the last cut (which he supposedly did not have) and his "petite genius" ego was badly hurt because they hated his beloved cut. If this director were smart, he would have had to look at this because it would have been his best.
