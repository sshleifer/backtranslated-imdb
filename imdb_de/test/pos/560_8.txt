This is an extraordinary movie. As a drama in the courtroom, it is imperative that as a charge against the American justice system, it is scary. For Brenton Butler, the consequences of this system can be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws in the legal process. It's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but about who better behaves in court. In fact, the consequences of this case go beyond the possibility that an innocent man may be found guilty or a guilty man may be released. Every citizen has a right to justice, whether perpetrator or victim. But did you understand? The film is good, unobtrusive and one of the best documentary films I've seen in the courtroom.
