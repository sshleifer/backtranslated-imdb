The opening scene of this movie is pretty incredible. I've seen a number of science-fiction movies with great special effects, but my roommate and I looked at each other after the opening sequence and he just said, "mind overloading." The plot of the movie is pretty simple, but the nice thing about this sci-fi movie is that the audience can find out most of the technologies for themselves instead of wasting time to make it "subtle". The creatures in this movie are also very interesting. Up to two thirds of the way you do not really see them well. Overall a very entertaining movie.
