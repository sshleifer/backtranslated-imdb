This two-character movie takes you closer to these two characters, the interrogator and the prisoner, as most films lead you to any character, no matter how well he is made. <br /> <br /> The Sheer Confusion, Terror and Fear The pain Madeleine Stowe's character experiences is deeply disturbing, as is Alan Rickman's sadistic and charming interrogator. This film is all too possible and builds to a shocking climax that leaves the overall effect of the movie you sit in silence at the end. It will haunt you for a long time.
