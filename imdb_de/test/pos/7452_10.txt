I do not have much to say as this is a great end to the story. Most people have said that there is not enough plot and it's just a feast for the eyes. But think about it, everything was explained in FFVII. You can not add plot to such a big story anymore, that would ruin it. They did the best they could, and I think that should be understood as A Final FMV ... the last fight. <br /> <br /> Graphics - 10/10, Absolutely Amazing <br /> <br /> Story 8.5 / 10 - do not think they could do much more. And the stuff they could get in there was smart enough, I thought. <br /> <br /> Characters 9/10 - Well, most of them were already declared during the game, but could not put everything in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10, since I'm a Metal fan, I loved the fighting music .. and the piano just goes right in. It's a great ST and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Tilt / Replay 10/10 - Every time pleasant. <br /> <br /> Overall - 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) <br /> <br /> I personally think that's what was needed, a fight to end it all. The plot was already completed on the spot. The action was as necessary as people complained. I loved every second of this movie. It was a pleasure to visit the world of FFVII only one last time. <br /> <br /> Just remember. Most of the movies that were made from one game were directed by directors, for whom I think this is pretty great. A team of game directors. I do not think I saw a better game for the movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Square, I think you did it right!
