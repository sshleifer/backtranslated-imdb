I have to say that some of the other reviews of this movie I've read have very little understanding or the original TV series from which he's from. Dads army was a sitcom and therefore had humor and must have imposed a smile on the stressful situation. However, the series contained many serious messages, such as the episode "Branded" about bigotry and ignorance that belonged to conscientious objectors. The film was true to the series and resembled an extended episode. So I'm afraid the critic who claimed that Columbia has improved the humor is wrong, and let's face it, the BBC sitcoms of that time beat everything that came from America. Comments on propaganda were also far away. The Homeguard were people who were considered unsuitable for use at the front and still wanted to serve. They were very brave men who knew that they were sentenced to death as soon as they registered, when Hitler announced that anyone who did this would be executed if Britain invaded. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to set the record, because it is always good to actually speak and comment on what has been seen, rather than enlighten you when you come along.
