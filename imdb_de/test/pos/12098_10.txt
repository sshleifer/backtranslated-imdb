I thank Mr. Hacke for the films. My German is not good. Excuse me. <br /> <br /> First of all, I did not know how diversified the sound of Istanbul is, even though I live in Turkey. Faith Akin and Alexander Hacke have chosen a different approach to Turkish music Istanbul and Istanbul Music from a foreign point of view, had given the true meaning of the music itself. <br /> <br /> In this film I found out how different our (Turkish) culture is, how interesting our interpreters are. and how much respect do they deserve. Unfortunately, no one has been able to provide this type of documentation.
