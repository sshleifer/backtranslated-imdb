After not being in the air for some time, Columbo returned with some new TV puzzles that were not as good as the original series, but better than the shows made in the late '90s. <br /> "Murder can be dangerous to your health ", the then used (and I think now, if you think about it) the real crime as the situation for a murder. The murder is committed by George Hamilton (a nice casting), a very successful, egotistical true Krimishow presenter. His chain-smoking Nemesis, who lost the job to him, played by Peter Haskell, tries to blackmail Hamilton when he discovers a porno video that Hamilton did in his salad time with a minor actress. Hamilton uses Haskell's cigarettes to poison the deathblow and give himself an alibi. Columbo is brought in to find out what happened. You know the rest. Very entertaining.
