This was a fantastic movie with flight scenes that were incredibly realistic! I have seen it several times and it has received my attention every time. I myself am a big fan of the Air Force and watch every movie I can take a look at an F-16 flying. If you like Top Gun then I guarantee that you will love this movie as well. Apart from a few mild cursive words, this is a great movie for the whole family. It has a great storyline and does not have a boring moment throughout the movie. Every second is full of action and keeps you on the edge of your seat to see what happens next. So again I recommend this movie !!!
