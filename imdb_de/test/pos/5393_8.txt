Looking back on the "old-fashioned" Westerns of the 30's and 40's (like DODGE CITY), DALLAS has a number of things to offer: Gary Cooper's coolest technicolor photography by Ernest Haller (GONE WITH THE WIND) and a pulsing Max Steiner (KING KONG, GWTW, DODGE CITY, etc.). In addition, there is a masquerade, a false identity, a fake death, and more hair-breathing than a republican series. As always, Cooper defines what it means to be a man under pressure. Forget the 50s Western Western ... this is pure entertainment!
