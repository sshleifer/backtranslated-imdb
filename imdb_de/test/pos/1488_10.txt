Mr. Bean has shaped the face of British television comedy. He has proven that you do not need bad words or jokes, a huge budget, a lot of intelligence or any intelligence to do something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters you just can not forget. Some of these episodes sewn me together - yes, they are not realistic at all and they're all pretty stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the obstacles Bean has broken on the path to greatness. Rowan Atkinson and Co. It always manages to create interesting new ideas - and fun new gags - to remember when Mr. Bean drove his green mini while sitting on a sofa on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that never fades - the movie was not as good as this one, but Bean has brought a new, new sense of humor to the world, and children and adults will be surprised at the immense fun factor. "Extras" and "Little Britain" can be damned - this is British comedy in its best and most original form. These antics never get old! 10/10
