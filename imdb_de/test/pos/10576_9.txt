I'm usually disappointed with what the media are filming "lesbian" these days: murderous bisexuals; psychotic murderous lesbians; Women who experiment with other women but end up with men in the end; ridiculously good-looking women who only get each other to turn men on, etc. <br /> <br /> Fortunately FINGERSMITH stands on a very high pedestal above this trash. It's a believable love story played by every actor MARVELOUS, except for the few supporting actors. Apart from a very engaging central conflict, the romance between the heroines, thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins, is well developed and credible. <br /> <br /> I've also seen TIPPING THE VELVET, but FINGERSMITH is far superior to the first. Both in character / conflict development and in the quality of acting. <br /> <br /> FINGERSMITH is both satisfying and pleasing to watch and offers lesbians everywhere a great follow-up.
