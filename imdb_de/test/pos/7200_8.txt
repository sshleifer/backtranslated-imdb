After reading this, the $ 47 million (FRF 327,000,000) budget on its release in 2002 was the most expensive French movie of all time. However, Astérix et Obélix contre César (1999) had a budget of $ 48 million (FRF 274,620,000), which has probably made him the most expensive French film of all time, colorful with everything I've ever seen. I loved the scenarios, the clothes (especially Cleopatra's) and the atmosphere of the movie! It is so happy and happy! I found the jokes smart and hilarious and I have to watch this movie in my favorite comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> The cast is also excellent, with Monica Bellucci (who is very beautiful as Cleopatra) Gérard Depardieu, (Great Obelix! Christian Clavier, Jamel Debbouze (This is my first time in '' Amélie Poulain Among other things! :) <br /> <br /> I also recommend this movie to people who do not know Asterix and Obelix Comics. You will have a lot of fun! :) <br /> <br /> aka "Asterix e Obelix: Missão cleópatra" - Brazil
