Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best movie of the year. It was a perfect and absolute pleasure to see her. I was riveted The entire audience at the Sunset Five was thrilled when the movie ended, nobody moved, spoke nothing. I think this movie is a perfect example of the power the drama has. Especially as it is an example of the quality of the drama / work of this younger generation. <br /> <br /> There were moments in your film, many, like at least seven, when I was hit by so much beauty and emotional beauty that in fact I could not breathe for a while. And for a catharsis junkie like me, it's about the best censorship I could wish for. It is the result of a powerful, masterful narration and direction. Like heavy stuff, like Burtolucci and those guys. <br /> <br /> Each element of the film fits tightly together. There were no missteps at all. The cast was incredible. I've been a big fan of Emiles and Ryan for a long time, and I thought they'd never been better. I was / am / will be constantly surprised by this movie. And I promise that I will make every person I know see it. It should be seen. It should win prizes.
