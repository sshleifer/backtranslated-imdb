To solve a challenging problem, you must first ask the right questions. Without this information, even the largest information library is useless. This movie does just that - where other movies guide your thinking on a storyboard, this movie will express your emotions and your understanding of justice and what's allowed. These questions will pull you through and question your assumptions as the characters evolve. This movie is important. It is relevant and a must for anyone who is aware of current affairs. The fact that it is very entertaining and includes a number of movie stars only improves the performance. My tip: look at it with a serious amount or better yourself, much like you read an editorial from your favorite news magazine. In this case, there is a difference: the answers will be your own.
