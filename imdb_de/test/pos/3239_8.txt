I can not comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I liked it. If there is a god, the soundtrack will be released, Ilona Sekacz's work is truly permanent. Twenty years later I am still touched by the haunting themes of this production and return regularly. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds the entry of Catherine Moreland into society. Slightly awkward and obsessed with an unhealthy interest in gothic stories (early pulp fiction?), Catherine arrives in Bath accompanied by Mrs. Allen, where she meets Henry Tilney. She is invited to visit the Tilneys in Northanger Abbey, the seat of the formidable (and somewhat financially challenged) General Tilney, who has the unfortunate misconception that wealth is on her feet. Finance, strife is inevitable. Along with Catherine's vivid imagination, she leads to fear for her safety. Their final departure is clouded by accusations and counterfeits of deception and compassion. <br /> <br /> But the attraction between Catherine and Henry is in these processes. He returns to make a happy ending. This last scene is particularly impressive given the random music of Ilona Sekacz. <br /> <br /> It can be a "bad" staging from a purist point of view, gaudy costumes and shaky performances that do not stand, but for me, 88 minutes of bliss.
