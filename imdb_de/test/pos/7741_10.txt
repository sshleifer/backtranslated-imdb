I love this movie and all aspects of it, as a comedy and as a drama. The drama is enormous and is played by an all-star actor who plays the high society of New York perfectly. The scenery is incredible, totally breathtaking. I also love the story: A successful New York-based architect experiencing a mid-life crisis leaves his deceitful wife and runs to a Greek island to hide with his daughter deciding on him. I love my love for this movie just do not express enough. "Show me the magic".
