Who can ask for more? I suppose taking my 2 and 4 year old kids was a risk. But it's worth it. They were thrilled with credit to credit, and their parents stood beside them. <br /> <br /> I used to take the mixed-results kids to movies: too scary, too boring, too demanding, anyway. However, with this movie I was glad to see a smart movie with humor, style and passion for the screen. Any movie whose production lasts five (!) Years, good or bad, deserves respect for the courage and patience required to make a film like this. <br /> <br /> O.K. I rave a bit. Why should not I get upset? Today's view of the film list reminded me only of the poor quality of the films being expelled. Regardless, W & G is a well-made film. Maybe the originality was not the most inspired, yet well-told and in a good mood. <br /> <br /> Too much humor for adults? Too many sexual references? Could be. Although my kids did not quite understand them. Too young. Well, in my case, I did not really notice. <br /> <br /> Well, of course I liked it.
