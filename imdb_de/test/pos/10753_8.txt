This movie surprised me. For years I have avoided many soundscapes of Harold Lloyd (as well as those of Keaton) because they generally have the deserved reputation of being lousy compared to the silent movies because the basic formula has been lost. When I saw this movie, I was pleasantly surprised when I really liked it. Once I had agreed, it really was not a "Harold Lloyd" movie (though he starred in it). This is because it does not match the style of his earlier films, but it is very original and Lloyd is not bad when it comes to playing a completely different character. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the formula of the old movies is almost completely missing here. Lloyd does not do the old familiar stunts, the romance is very different than in his early screen romances, and the plot is just weird! Instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time since his childhood. Although he looks like an American (aside from his white suit and a researcher's helmet), he thinks and behaves very much like someone who is Chinese. In many ways he is very naive about America and acts like an innocent among wolves. Early on he meets a man who turns out to be the party leader on the spot. This boss ALWAYS produces a loss candidate for the mayor race - because he is bought by the corrupt mayor and paid to produce a "candidate" candidate who has NO CHANCE of winning. Well, old Geezer, who is traditionally running for office, has just died and decides to lead the naive Lloyd - he has no victory! Well, the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins !!! This and Lloyd's decision to clean up the city greatly disturbs the old political machinery and they stop at nothing to destroy the honest Lloyd. Just when it appears that Lloyd has been jailed for alleged corruption charges, he creates a system that is 100% impossible and extremely illegal to obtain confessions signed by crooks. Nevertheless, it is incredibly funny and a great ending. So, my advice is in the end, just expose and enjoy the unbelief. <br /> <br /> One important note: This movie is definitely NOT politically correct. The word "chink" is used repeatedly. I found it offensive, but considering the times, I ignored it the way you should. However, if you are someone who CAN NOT and likes to be angry, I suggest you never watch movies - because you will be insulted again and again.
