I sit around and go through movie lists and do not really see everything I want to see. My appetite always says, "Something like radio news." This is what I want. Something smart and funny, with ideas for adults, great acting and writing and a directing style that does not draw attention. This might be Hurt's best performance (is that, or THE BIG CHILL, in my opinion): Hurt is eccentric, but he's smart and plays a dumb person without being sure - wink - the audience knows - wink - - Hey, I'm not stupid ... well, that's good if you play right there. Hunter is perfect and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And he can read and sing at the same time!) Great, great work. <br /> <br />
