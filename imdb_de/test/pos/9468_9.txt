I saw this movie in a special show. At first I thought the movie was like a typical Amanda Bynes movie, but I was wrong. The film is based on the Shakespeare's book "The Twelth Night". This film tells the story of a girl who lives to play football. Well, if the girls' team gets cut, she has to make a big effort to join the dude team in another school to take revenge on her selfish gang of guys at her old school. On her way she gets caught up in a long web of love, lies and deception. This movie is Mean Girls this year. I think it shows some great new actor skills, and there are some big stars defiantly shown in this movie.
