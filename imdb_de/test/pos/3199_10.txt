I saw this short for the first time when I bought a random DVD of short films some time ago. this is the only short DVD on the DVD that I liked, but I do not like it easy, I love it ... if you spend time with me you will see it. it's beautiful, simple and passionate, no bells, no whistles - it could have been made with a skewer (but do not get me wrong, the animation is elegant and enlightening - this person has clearly spent a lot of time with cats - but it is so it's just black and white) and then there's the writing and the music ... it's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> I eat chocolate, drink wine and watch it over and over ... <br /> <br /> Nothing else matters, I'm waiting for Pedro Serrazina to come up with something different.
