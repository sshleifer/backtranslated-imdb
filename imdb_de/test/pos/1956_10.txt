I really have no complaints about this movie except the disturbing scenes with the body. I fell for it when I switched the television one night. The acting was really great, I did not expect it to be better than it seemed! I thought that Keanu's acting (which since 1986 is the SAME, which is a very good thing, hehe), was really * great * and Crispin played his character perfectly! This movie is a hidden gem! It's a fresh awakening of reality for the '80s compared to the other teenage movies made by the GÃ¶rpack (though I also like these Moives very much). All in all, I give a thumbs up!
