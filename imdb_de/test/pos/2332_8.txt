Performers: Kelsey Grammar, Rob Schneider, Lauren Holly, Rip Torn This movie is a classic family favorite. At least for most of my family members. One of us rolls our eyes at the mention of this movie and thinks, "What a stupid movie." I am not that person though. I still find this movie very amusing. I saw it again last night with someone who had never seen it, and I laughed the same way I did the first time. It is still very funny for me. <br /> <br /> Marine Captain Tom Dodge (Grammar) is a bit of a black sheep in the Navy. He's the guy who plays golf while he's on a submarine and pokes a ball on a golf course as they drive past him. He's the guy who's going to get drunk, faint, wake up with a hangover and a tattoo on his dongle. He's not the type everyone wants to command a submarine. <br /> <br /> But Dodge is at the bottom of the line. He has submitted applications to regain control of his own submarine several times, and if he does not get a submarine this time, he goes to a desk job, which means it's the life of the Navy. The Admiralty decides to give him his own boat, but they do not give him a new nuclear submarine. They give him a diesel submarine, an ancient relic from World War II. His mission is to tidy them up and take them for a war game on the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> Dodge is obviously a bit frustrated when he got such a shitty boat when he worked so hard Up to the point where he is, he goes to Admiral Winslow (Torn) and talks about it. Winslow explains the purpose of the war game. Diesel submarines are still sold in the real world to countries like Iran, Iraq and Libya, to name but a few. Winslow wants to know what would happen if a renegade captain in a diesel submarine came to the US and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases. Would you do it? Dodge and most admiralities do not believe that, but Winslow wants to know for sure why he invented this war game. Dodge's mission is to bring the Stingray out to sea, then evade the US Navy and blow up the US Navy bases. In simulated battles, of course. <br /> <br /> So that's about as deep as the plot. This is not an action-driven movie. It's a stupid movie that's just a big gag. It makes fun of itself and it is not expected that you take it seriously. If you are looking for a good, silent laugh on a Friday night, then I would urge you to give it a try. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: 3 out of 4 (worth a look)
