I loved Complete Savages! Why did you cancel it anyway? They should have done a second season and so on ... god! They always cancel the good shows ... and leave the boring stuff behind. Nothing is interesting on TV since Complete Savages is gone. This show was a great idea. A single firefighter father with five crazy sons and a lazy dog ​​... Each of them has its own madness in this house. TJ is always the kid ... always the smaller ... Kyle rocks! He breaks everything he touches! He is always in custody, he always does the wrong thing ... But still he is so funny about all the things he does. Sam is the smart one. He is always shy and stupid when it comes to girls ... Finally he ends up with Angela. Chris is the athlete who does not have much to do with school, study and stuff. He is always funny. And finally ... Jack! The rock of the show. The oldest of them all, the macho guy, the rock star ... But still as crazy as everyone else. Nick is ... helpless with these guys. Oh! And I almost forgot! Uncle Jimmy ... He's the man! He is like a 30 year old boy. He's like the same stupid things the boys are doing. I've always wondered how he became a fireman ... And the dog is the image of the whole Savage family. The thing is ... this show had everything to become something really big. It had everything, man! But of course ... they canceled it ...
