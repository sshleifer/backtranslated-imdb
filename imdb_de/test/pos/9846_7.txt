The big James Cagney, who is number one in big letters, appears in the second third of the movie and probably has less time than Dudley Digges, who plays the potentate of the eee-vill reform school. But when Jimmy arrives as deputy commissar of something or something to reform reform school, he cuts the air with his hands, jumps on the bales and spits out the daring Warners First National dialogue with all the usual customs. and expects, panache. The psychology in this crunchy antiquity, one of Warner's many efforts to claim his place as a "socially conscious" studio, is not profound: Digges is bad just because the script requires it, and there's the weird notion that it's teenagers acts delinquents become swell children, if they are given only a little autonomy. But it's done in that free, fast style that the studio specializes in, and it never gets boring. Frankie Darro, who has been in all sorts of trouble on screen as Warner's favorite Rotten Street Kid for a short time, is an ideal JD - a handsome, charismatic toughie with a pug nose and a hateful look that could wither steel. No child actor can handle it today.
