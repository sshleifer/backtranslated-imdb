Sam Firstenberg's "Ninja 3: The Domination" mixes martial arts with "The Exorcist" like horror. The horror elements that are thrown on the screen are just ridiculous, but the movie works like a mindless action / martial arts movie and exciting, and the movie never gets boring. So forget silly dialogues, lame drama and annoying soundtrack beer and try it out! We recommend!
