One year after 'Love Thy Neighbor' his I.T.V. The debut was followed by the route taken by 'On The Buses' and 'Steptoe & Son', finishing on a big screen in a picture by Hammer Films. It begins with a rousing patriotic speech that praises the virtues of England's green and pleasant country, and then shows Eddie and Bill walking down a street arguing furiously. This leads to a strange sequence of white and black neighbors who put their homes in danger to each other. At least the original melody is retained (even if not sung by Stuart Gillies). The local newspaper "The Gazette" holds a contest to find the best neighbors Winners land on a cruise in the Mediterranean. Barbie suggests that Joan enter. The thing is, can Bill and Eddie stay friends long enough to win? That's the main part of the plot. The film is episodic by and large. One piece is taken directly from the first season, namely Bill and Eddie, who go to the club pretending they are "union business". In fact, they will see a stripper (do not hit two girls). In another part of the film, Bill broke with other black factory workers (he was the only one in the series) who broke a strike that Eddie had helped with various tricks (including smuggling in beer barrels). While another (apparently inspired by Powell and Driver 'For The Love Of Ada') sees Eddie's chatty mother (the great Patricia Hayes) befriend Bill's father (Charles Hyatt). <br /> <br /> The climax of Episode 1 Season 1 appears in an expanded form. Bill once again puts on paint and a towel to scare Eddie, but his friends join him, and they dance around a drum containing a bare booth so they can pretend to cook and eat. Eddie then has to go home naked (surprisingly, there is less nudity here than in episode 2 season 2). <br /> <br /> The movie ends with the Reynolds and the Booths 'Love winning your neighbors contest and the cruise together, but there is an unexpected twist in which the sex-addicted brother of Cyril Cyril (James Beck -' Private Walker of 'Dad's Army'), who works as a steward, plays a role. <br /> This is the typical sitcom-in-movie of the 70s, with all the mistakes normally found in such movies. The laughs are scattered and the interest disappears after about half an hour. The cast will feature familiar faces such as Melvyn Hayes (cast as 'Terry', a character from episode 2, season 1, played by Leslie Meadows), Bill Fraser (factory director), Anna Dawson, and Andria Lawrence (who appears in all British comedy The director John Robins was also responsible for the movie "Man About The House". <br /> <br /> Funny moment - while Eddie is in a quiet Part of the factory is asleep, Bill paints his face black The first thing he learns is when the manager's secretary screams in horror The tables have been turned!
