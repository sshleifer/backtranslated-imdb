A gentle and ingenious film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality ... and to be honest, the narrative is a bit meager and light as a drama ... but I feel the simple miracle and the joy of the scenes that make up the movie First impression of a film New art in a foreign and skeptical society have a charisma and naturalness that captures the centuries-old romance between cinema and audience better than any other film in years. Immens likable performance of Jared Harriss (who seems to have inherited all the charisma of his father ... hopefully without the poor Richards penchant for hell training and twilight) ... and the charming, unconventional cuteness of Costar Yu Xia makes him a real heart warmth. Radiant shooting photography (including radiantly beautiful scenes on the Great Wall) and sensitive direction by Ann Hu give the film extra effect. In short a must for anyone who has always been enchanted by a flickering shadow ... and conjures in the dark.
