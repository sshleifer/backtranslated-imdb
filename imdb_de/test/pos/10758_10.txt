Went to the premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC and I absolutely loved the movie !!! I'm Diane's # 1 biggest fan and of course there was a great performance as always !! I have seen every one of her films and have to say that this is one of my new favorites. Diane was funny and moving and just took my breath away. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly humorous, but also serious. Anton Yelchin is just a wonderful young actor and has shown an amazing performance. All in all, I can recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a great movie. 10 thumbs up !!! I would definitely see it again and again. This is the best movie of the year so far !!!
