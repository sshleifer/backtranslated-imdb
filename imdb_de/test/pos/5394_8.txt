I will not tell anyone what happened in the end, but it did not fit the movie. The rest of the Imaginary Heroes, however, represented a realistic family that went through realistic topics such as death, drugs, relationships, and high school. I could have sworn that they were my own family, not a joke. Emile Hirsch was absolutely credible that a teenager was struggling with his brother's suicide, and Sigourney Weaver plays a mother trying to keep the remains of her (somewhat) dysfunctional family together. <br /> <br /> Although this family is extremely exempt from their problems, everyone can relate to what they are going through, be it a degree, meeting expectations, or a parent.
