In 1242 Russia was occupied by two sides: the Mongolian and the European side, the German Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. The city of Novgorod is the last free city in Russia. In order to organize the defense of Novgorod and the countries of Russia, the people call Prince Aleksandr Nevsky, who defeated the Swedes in an earlier battle. His successful strategy defeats the Germans after a great battle on a frozen lake. This film was made in 1938 due to the threat of German to Russia in a period before the Second World War. The idea was to make propaganda pro-Russia. It is, however, an overwhelming, wonderful and impressive powerful masterpiece. It is amazing the fighting scene on the frozen lake. The current generation is very used to special effects like the Lord of the Rings trilogy and may not understand how fantastic this black and white fight is. If the viewer can forget the ideology and consider it as art, in the end he will be amazed with such a masterpiece. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky
