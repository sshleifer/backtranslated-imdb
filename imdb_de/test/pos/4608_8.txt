Universal Studios. The name evokes so many memories of beautiful matte pictures for the horror fan ... uh ... landscapes, mist-shrouded landscapes, full moon, howling wolves, taverns and torches with mobs. However, looking back on these films, it is quite strange how little the era that produced the true classics was. The '30s had their masterpieces, but these were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are now mostly of historical interest. The '40s produced more mindlessly fun matinee films than high art, and most fans agree that the classic era of gothic horror movies ended in' House of Dracula 'in 1945, playing around with the comedies of Abbott & Costello and being official So dead in the '50s and the advent of the nuclear age. <br /> <br /> So it's weird that maybe one of Universal's best goths was made in the' 50s! That alone makes the film a curiosity, as costume dramas were EVERYWHERE. It may not be comparable to the classics like James Whale and The Wolfman, but damn it damn it all the fun elements of these films to a delicious treat! Get ready for nothing but pure entertainment! Since various social customs had changed, the film also eats violence that would not have been allowed in earlier times; There is no blood, but we see characters being shot and stabbed directly, and even a burning torch in the face! <br /> <br /> The movie is not really a horror movie, but it has the atmosphere, the look and the atmosphere. It starts in the middle of the night with howling winds (and wolves) as two men seal the graves of two seemingly dead young lovers, BUT WAIT! One of them is not dead, but he can not move! He is trapped, but speaks silently in his head and can not communicate! What is his story? How To Start A Horror Movie .... <br /> <br /> The English businessman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene, who does one of his best performances) sets off under the pseudonym Richard Beckett to investigate the disappearance of two of his friends who disappeared in the castle of the one-eyed Austrian Count of Bruno (did Sacha Baron Cohen see that?). It seems that Von Bruno was portrayed as the god of the natives in Africa many years ago to steal ivory. He was exposed by Burton's men and the natives disfigured him. Now he is greedy for revenge. <br /> <br /> The film contains all the clichés, a ride to Jonathan Harker-Art's castle, an Inn full of villagers, death traps and a powerful servant (Lon Chaney Jr.). The torture scenes are really exciting, including a slab in the floor that activates a dungeon door (which later becomes a genius escape scene), a hunting expedition with an imported panther (!!! ??) and even an alligator pit! And then there's the Romeo & Juliet style fake-death style that leads to the movie's prologue .... <br /> <br /> The plot is a cliché and the worldview is black and white. But it's still incredibly entertaining when director Nathan Juran brings each scene to the atmosphere and looks fresh and new. There are also several action holes. Why is Ronald trying to leave the castle so early? And he never solves the mystery of what happened to his friends, even if it's obvious, but he does not know when he gives up, and he seemed to be so sure in the old days. Funny. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great. Although he is a rude upper-classist, Richard Greene makes Burton one of the most likable protagonists I've ever seen in a horror movie. Rita Corday is excellently suited as a "peasant wife" of the Count, which becomes Burton's love interest. She might have the stereotypical "fall in love with all the gazes" of all the movie heroes of that time, but her portrayal of a long-lived woman in a loveless marriage to a sadistic monster is very compelling, she also shows a suspicion and a joke that few film heroes of that era make do. She even sees a forced attempt by Burton to pacify her (and to paw her collar, though it's easy to analyze it has an important clue, as a rape attempt, yet in her paranoia she never seems to be angry, the audience sympathizes with her Although he does not manage to be really foreign and beyond Bruno (he's after all a villain in a horror movie), Stephen McNally, as a sadistic nobleman, does a truly vile performance, when he reveals his burnt eye and laughs, it's real Lon Chaney Jr. is also great as his mute stooge Gargon. <br /> <br /> But the best performance is undeniable from Boris Karloff as mysterious doctor Dr. Meissen, he has little time on screen but steals each one The scene he is in. It's a performance that's both creepy and sad, mysterious, and ultimately heroic, as he blows evil as he does Asking one of Bruno's henchmen to leech, he spies on our hero and speaks in that famous 'You know, I'm not good' voice that only Karloff could do. You're wondering if he's a hero or a rogue, always sneaking around. And though he acts as the chief agent of our hero's escape, he still displays human weaknesses such as greed and fear for his own life. Even cold-blooded poisoning of a man in favor of Burton before Burton even agrees. His plan to help our hero and heroine puts them directly into the hands of Von Bruno. He arranges an amazingly sad death for her, which had to inspire similar scenes in Corman's Poe series. He does not have much time on screen, but this is easily one of Boris best achievements. <br /> <br /> Even though the ending may seem abrupt and anti-climatic to some, half the fun is over and there is a lot of excitement to be ripped off. Lean back and experience the days when heroes were heroes and rogues were villains. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a fleeting fun.
