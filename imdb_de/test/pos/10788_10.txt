Of course, Talk Radio is not the best known of Stone's movies, but do not let that put you off. This movie is ripe for discoveries. I oppose anyone who should not be enthusiastic about it. In addition to the best performance of Eric Bogosian's 80's cinema, this remains the most beautiful moment of Stone for me (along with JFK). Stone does not seem to comment much on this and has not made any directors' comments on DVD like all of his other films. Stone does not have to be ashamed, most directors would kill to get a shot in a movie like this one. <br /> <br /> The claustrophobia of the studio is intense and the views of Champlain are still very important arguments for today. The "Legalize All Drugs" language is powerful and you may agree with it. In my opinion, the film is about freedom of speech and sometimes people do not like to hear things they disagree with. The Talks and Conversations with The listeners are very captivating, even disturbing, a shiver ran down my spine when a crazy man called Champlain, who says he has to rape again because the city drives him crazy, and he is totally shocking Of course Champlain does not make fun of him by making him ridiculous. Champlain (or should I say Bogosian) is fearless in film and performance, totally fascinating, a shame that @ Bogosian's other big role was the villain in Under Siege 2 (dear God !!). A scene where @ did not ring properly Barry's boss Dan (Alec Baldwin) makes him calm down. Barry does not seem to be the kind of person who keeps his mouth shut and does what he said, it seemed a little thoughtful and clich√©d. The scenes outside the studio are criticized because they are too formal, it is true because Stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and show the viewer the beginnings of Champlains, but it does not quite work. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant cinematic movie with extreme close-ups, deep focus and super-fast cuts, a fantastic 360 set used for the last stunning monologue. Must see cinema, it rarely does, because it was ignored by time, but now receives attention again, which earns it so abundantly. A classic th @ should be studied by generations of film students. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for the inventive use of "Bad To The Bone" before T2, a brilliant minor cast, including John C. Mcginley (Dr. Cox of Scrubs) as a shabby stu, Leslie Hope (24 ) as Champlain's girlfriend, John Pankow and Alec Baldwin as suits and Micheal Wincott, who plays three roles (a very underrated actor), the tension between the listeners and Champlain, which is very heartbreaking, and of course kudos to the stars Bogosian and Stone is such a fantastic piece of cinema. Enjoy!
