I first saw this movie on television in 1959 when I was eight years old. At the time I did not know anything about Western, but I recognized Ben Johnson from the movie "Mighty Joe Young". What attracted me to "Wagon Master" was the great songs sung by the "Sons of the Pioneers". Merian C. Cooper, who produced the film, was the first to commission original music to tune the mood of a particular scene, creating the film's modern soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to set the mood for his classic King Kong creation. Steiner later won an Oscar for the theme "Gone with the Wind". Cooper was also the producer of "Mighty Joe Young". If you remember, music was important to the great monkey, who would only respond to the sound of Stephan Foster's "Beautiful Dreamer." In 1947, Cooper collaborated with John Ford, the director, "Wagon Master." Of all Ford's famous Westerns, this is my favorite showing his brother Francis and grumpy Janes Arness.
