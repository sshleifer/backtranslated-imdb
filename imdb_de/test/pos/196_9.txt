The consequences of the Second World War almost led to the death of Soviet cinema. Film production nearly came to a standstill in the early 1950s (only nine feature films were released in 1951), and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored and censored by the government. After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, the filmmakers' images were given greater artistic freedom, although many continued to refute the heroic, optimistic and propagandistic attitude to warfare prevalent in recent years. The director Mikhail Kalatozov and the writer Viktor Rozov only became brave enough in 1957 to emphasize the Soviet masterpiece "Letyat zhuravli / The Cranes Flying", one of the finest depictions of the first war seen from every country or period. The film was not only praised for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union, but soon followed by an international recognition, and Kalatozov's film was honored at the Cannes Film Festival in 1958 with the Palm d'Or. <br /> <br /> 'The Cranes are Flying' is both an invigorating visual feast and a bold, humanist portrayal of the war. In contrast to many Soviet war films of that time, he was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional war hero and more concerned with the futility, brutality, and indeed the inevitability of conflict. Too often, love as a cinematic concept is idealized as an idea that somehow conquers all and endures endless hardship, yet the reality is far less romantic. In the film, two lovers, Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), who were separated by the advent of World War II (widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945), undertake to marry after the war but the tragedy denies the couple their desire. Veronika, driven to treachery by the endless agony and uncertainty of waiting, agrees to marry Boris' cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin), a handsome but unworthy youth. The film may end with the proud victory of the Soviets and a patriotic flag-waving parade, but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young protagonist soullessly wandering through the celebrating crowds. > <br /> The most notable feature of "The Cranes Are Flying" is perhaps Sergei Urusevsky's inspired and dynamic hand-held cinematography, which captures the chaos and confusion of the war realistic and dizzying, not necessarily in the rifle throats and screams of dying comrades ( in fact, only one of the sequences of the film Boris follows on the eastern front), but from the perspective of the family and friends left behind. In a particularly impressive, often quoted attitude, the camera follows Veronika as she searches desperately for Boris, in a crowd of departing recruits and their families. The handheld camera gently follows the girl off the bus, bumping into the crowd beside her - capturing snapshots of loved ones saying goodbye to her sons and husbands - before she unexpectedly stretches across the crowd as Veronika struggles in the dust of a passing squadron disappears from tanks of the army, a breathtaking movement that gives the dramatic episode of scope and urgency. Urusevsky gained his experience as a military cameraman during the war and obviously fell in love with the possibilities of storytelling hand-held photography: "The camera," he once said, can express what the actor can not portray: his inner sensations. The cameraman has to act with the actors. "
