Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is a French gangster movie that does not look for a style. That's why it has style. Because the film is so playful and so factual, it gets more and more involved. And because Abel Davos is played by Lino Ventura, we're ultimately emotionally invested in this silent, tough killer who loves his wife and kids. He has an encounter with customs agents on the shores near Nice that neither he nor we expect, and who proves to be just as ready to shoot a cop or a traitor with as little emotion as to strip off a little lint. We first meet Davos in Italy with his wife and the two little boys, one of 9 and 4 years old. <br /> <br /> "This man was Abel Davos, who was sentenced to death in his absence," it says. "On the run, he had watched his resources shrinking for years, even as his anxiety set him on fire, and with the Italian police closed every day, France was his best bet again, perhaps forgotten." <br /> <br /> Davos was a top gangster in Paris, taking care of his friends. That was a few years ago. A robbery to give him money to return to France goes very wrong. Now he hides with his two children. He calls his friends in Paris to help him. He and his children have to come from Nice to Paris, but the police chase him and have built roadblocks. For the two best friends of Davos, the time has passed and they have moved on. You do not want to endanger yourself, and for what? Commitment can lead to caution. So they hired a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo), to pick up Davos and the children in an ambulance, then drive to Davos, who is hard-wired, and the hidden children to Paris. We are on a journey that increasingly limits Davos' potential, where he has to find ways to look after his children, where he realizes that there are no friendships, where betrayal seems likely and where possibly his only friend left is Eric Stark. <br /> <br /> This cynical movie works so well because it does its job without worrying about it. There are no trench coats with raised collars, no play with the gangster code melodrama that many French directors loved. Classe tous Risques gives us Abel Davos, a man who was once someone who now slides to no one and who reacts with violence and resignation. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura dominates the movie, but when he mates with Jean-Paul Belmondo, a strange chemistry happens. Ventura as Davos is grim and worried about the care of his sons. He is humiliated by his situation. He is a tough guy who sees himself killing someone when needed, just as part of his business. Belmondo is the young thief, who is initially sent out as a expendable driver and is finally a friend he can count on, stopping the movie from going another drive through the elevator. Belmondo was 27 and looks younger. His unlikely star power as the lead actor - broken nose, broken jaw - seems straight from the screen. He turns Erik into Ventura when they share a scene. And Belmondo's scenes with Liliane (Sandra Milo), the young woman who becomes his girlfriend, radiate charm and good-natured sexiness. The end is a bittersweet fate and without a stylistic attitude in sight. We hear Davos say, "Abel is gone, there is nothing left." It is worthwhile to look at Classe tous Risques to find out what he means. <br /> <br /> There are many good French gangster films. I would place this here with Touchez Pas au Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur. To see one of Lino Ventura's best ideas, check out Army of Shadows.
