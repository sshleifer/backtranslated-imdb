Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour - she's one of the dancing girls in Danny McGuire's club, which according to Danny (Gene Kelly) is the very special and everyone who meets her. Take, for example, Vanity Magazine magnate John Coudair (Otto Kruger): Charmed by Rusty's resemblance to her grandmother Maribelle (also played by flashbacks in Hayworth), whom he wooed when he fell in love with her and tries He was repairing what he thought was going wrong between him and Maribelle. He does not think Danny could give Rusty luck or anything she should be entitled to - he even makes Danny believe he believes it. When Rusty becomes famous as Vanity's Cover Girl, Danny drives her into the waiting arms of Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman). So what happens when Danny returns to town with his buddy Genius (Phil Silvers) in tow and then discovers that Rusty is marrying Wheaton? <br /> <br /> As a musical COVER GIRL benefits from the beautiful score and written songs of Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, including the Oscar nominees "Long Ago and Far Away" (possibly one of the most beautiful ballads ever written Maribelle's number "Sure Thing" ("Poor John" is not a collaboration between Kern / Gershwin and "Test me to the test.") The dance is, of course, top notch since Gene Kelly It shows in the simplest of dances, such as his dance with Hayworth on "Put Me To The Test" or the joyously exhilarating "Make Way For Tomorrow" number (performed by the trio Danny, Rusty and Genius) ... referring to the reaction of Gene to the police officer in the song number in SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN, Kelly scored a technological and artistic coup, especially with the "alter ego" dance Successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (Jerry the Mouse or the 16-minute ballet), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity that Kelly has brought to modern film music: to use the film medium to dances that could not be presented on a stage, and Kelly, who existed years before CGI, insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly suit him in talent and style - himself. The number is barely five minutes long, but she (and Kelly's genius) is still breathtaking even after sixty years. That's why I've seen COVER GIRL, and if nothing else, this dance is really worth it. <br /> <br /> It can be said that COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth have made a lot of money - not that you did not deserve it. Experience the scene when Rusty reaches Broadway - the big screen that shows all the cover girls gives way to a surprisingly large stage designed for Rusty's performance. In fact, Hayworth is one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls shown in the film, and she dances with a style and grace almost worthy of Kelly. (Very few of Kelly's co-stars have this honor.) In some scenes she is funny, for example in her drunken scene when John and Wheaton get her from Joe. <br /> <br /> For some reason, however, their power still lacks the spark of greatness that would help COVER GIRL overcome its general curse of mediocrity. This curse is only lifted when Gene Kelly is on screen (dancing or no), or when Eve Arden, as John's boring secretary 'Stonewall', passes by with another comment or wise observation. As the movie ends up with Hayworth, neither Kelly nor Arden can save him as a whole. That does not mean that the movie is bad - it is not. It's enjoyable, with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to watch. But it's just not a classic. Dancing is classic, so watch out for COVER GIRL and you will not regret it.
