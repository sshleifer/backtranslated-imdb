Undoubtedly, Tom Fontana's memorable "Oz" is one of the largest television series ever produced. Brilliantly written, acted and staged, in every art form (film, television, literature, music) it is as close as possible to perfection. In its extreme brutality it haunts a prison world with different characters ranging from compassionate to appalling. It's a show that no matter how brutal it gets, you can not lose your eyes. The combination of professionally trained theater actors with film and television actors makes diverse and original performances possible. <br /> <br /> And although the show is widely praised and has a loyal fan base, you can not feel it during the TV run because of other HBO dramas like "The Sopranos," "Sex and The City" and "Six Feet Under" has been undervalued. And although all these shows are good and have cross-border masterpieces to their right, many people forget that "Oz" was HBO's first entry into a one-hour television series. It was a brave, risky first entry and so HBO beat a grand slam with it. That's as good as it gets.
