On a whim, following a recent trip to NYC, I queued this movie and I could not believe I had never heard of it before! It has all the prerequisites for a cult classic, starting with the characters. These are archetypal roles that we know from every aspect of daily life, but were so differentiated and fully realized by the actors (the performances of Peter Stormare and Bai Ling were particularly strong). Their interactions are poignant and down to earth, while at the same time they are filled with a subtle, quirky sense of humor that is (unfortunately) all too rare in American films. Writer / director Ramin Niami has done a wonderful job of putting these scenes together into a fun and moving portrait of a city of the past. Highly recommended!
