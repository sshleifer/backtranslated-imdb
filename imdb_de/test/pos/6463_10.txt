I cry at many movies. Call me sentimental. Call me a spectator who always likes to see a happy ending. This movie, although it has a sad ending, was great! Among all the actors I'd like to have lunch with, Sidney Poitier. His acting, along with John Cassavetes and Jack Warden (of 12 Angry Men Fame), is outstanding. His character, who befriends a man on the run (Cassavetes) and helps him in every possible way, is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is another of those forgotten noirs that were made at the end of the noiric era. It's well done, has a great cast, extremely talented acting and great cinematography. It is a film that is always worthwhile. I highly recommend this! This is just another really great movie by Mr. Poitier and should be sold on DVD. Although I cried, a big compliment to such a great art!
