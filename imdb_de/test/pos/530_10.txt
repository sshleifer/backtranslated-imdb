I just saw this movie tonight. I thought it would be good because I really like Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon is also a great actor, but it was a lot better than I could have imagined. They come from the movie and feel great. The drama was excellent, which has been difficult lately. Natalie Portman is for great things, and I'm a NYU student. I think it's great that she's going to school and not just an actress. Anyway, back to the topic, the movie keeps you going all the way and I definitely think everyone should see it. I would give more details, but I do not want to reveal the movie.
