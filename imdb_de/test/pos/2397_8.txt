I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe achieved in terms of its overall impact on me. I say that because I know this independent film has a limited budget / resource, but it still looks convincing and well done. <br /> <br /> Enjoyable from beginning to end, with several relatively unknown actors, whom I can not help but believe, will make a big noise in the industry in the future. Eddie Monroe has not failed to dance my interest and emotional level. It's a well-scripted story with a surprising ending, though I'm trying to keep my balance. <br /> <br /> Many of the cast names listed for this movie are names you should look out for in the future. Somebody told me that Paul Regina passed away recently, and if that's true, it's a real tragedy, because his stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkable. Kudos to Fred Carpenter, who has really won a winner with this one!
