After many, many years, I saw this beautiful love story again and thought about how, half a century later, I would react to a movie that made so many girls cry and sigh at the time when I was just a male teenager, to understand attempted behavior of women in a small town in Brazil. This time, however, I noticed something quite different in the film, namely the persistence with which Dr. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) To the journalist Mark Elliott (William Holden) he illustrates his particular ethical condition as Eurasier. In fact, she always emphasizes this point in her relationship, repeating that she is ready to accept her love for him and to continue her in an "occidental manner", provided she does not thereby betray her Chinese side. It seems to the onlooker that Suyin is eager to establish a very subtle match between these two unstable and opposite aspects of their culture, for they will immediately find themselves in open conflict in their minds as they engage in their attempts to control them Show minimum of failure. <br /> <br /> Suyin's attitudes always leave poor Elliott? a determined, courageous and extremely practical man? anxious and amazed, without knowing how much importance she should give to her words. For him, whose love for her is simple and simple, the situation is very clear: if we love each other, let us make a couple and start living together immediately. "Not so fast," she seems to be verbally and nonverbally answering him all the time. In fact, Suyin's Chinese share would never allow her such pragmatism. And while she continues to reinforce this much sought-after balance between these two worlds inside, she often signals to him that even a very peculiar feature of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind, namely the constant "raids" on the real world through invisible beings from a spiritual or non-physical world. Because Suyin always draws Elliott's attention to how dangerous life is, not because of an objective and concrete threat (such as the maintenance of English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion), but because of the threat to many cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical ones Beings over the poor, anxious and vulnerable people. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems that a number of Chinese deities are constantly on guard to make people's lives totally miserable. Therefore, mothers have to dress their precious male babies in girls' clothes so they will not be taken away by jealous gods. Everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away to avoid seeing the moon. Farmers are advised to shout aloud, "The rice is bad, the rice is bad!" to protect their crops from being stolen by deities; At a funeral, it is recommended that the family of the dead be isolated from other people by curtains so that the gods do not take advantage of their grief and fragility. In other words, Suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence, as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malignant and sadistic gods is always going to negatively influence the most banal deeds in daily life. <br /> <br /> Since the story takes place in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that China was actually almost a semi-feudal society at that time, while the country Elliott came from was not yet dominated by bitter capitalism in 1973 launched by the US after the first oil shock and took over the entire world. So at least in one aspect, both sides of Suyin's Eurasian personality were even more innocent than they are today. <br /> <br /> There has always been a lot of history. As far as China is concerned, the most important fact is that after several phases of a communist regime in the last two decades, the country finally reached the condition of a very aggressive economy, which is much more referred to as state capitalism. And what happened to that ancient spirituality that so fascinated Suyin in Hong Kong in 1949 and how she impressed such a passionate Elliott under the tree on the hill beyond the hospital? It's gone, completely gone! In short, if this story took place today, Elliott would not find it necessary to go to China to suggest Suyin in the presence of the Third Uncle and her entire family. In fact, both men in their huge pragmatism would be incomparably closer and would talk as usual!
