"Rockstar" is on his way to none of the "stairs to the sky" category as one of the best rock movies of all time, but he occasionally lets you "jump" because of his high energy. The theme of the film is a fan of a die-hard rock group that actually becomes the singer of his favorite band. The story is based on the true story of the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think that this film is filled with a funny script and an intellectual direction, then you have something else. What "shook me all night", however, was the good acting of Jennifer Aniston as a devoted friend of the rock star. I could not say the same thing about the rockstar himself; Mark Wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star. I enjoyed the retrospective journey of the 80s that the movie introduces. It reminded me of my teenage years when everything smelled like teenage spirit. I think the movie is worth a visit, but if you have a better time, make sure you bring some "girls, girls, girls". *** Average
