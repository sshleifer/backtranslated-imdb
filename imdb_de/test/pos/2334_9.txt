I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought the videotape years ago and see it at least once or twice a year. <br /> <br /> Grammer has a weird mind that really makes this movie a success. His formula is certainly not original, but still very funny. I am very surprised that it was not higher in the ratings. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite comedies of all time. It's just a funny little streak that makes you feel good. And sometimes that's all that a movie should be.
