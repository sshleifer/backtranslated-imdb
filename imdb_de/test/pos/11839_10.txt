A grumpy old baronet, happily unmarried, decides to send his three adult illegitimate children and give them a home in his mansion. To his surprise he associates himself with his uninhibited American daughter. Can he find satisfaction in his new role as THE BACHELOR PATHER? <br /> <br /> This 1931 film, in which it shows a robust performance, marked the arrival of the older Sir C. Aubrey Smith at MGM, who very soon appeared to be one of Hollywood's most valuable character actors. With his big hooked noses and beetle brows, Sir Aubrey looked just like the Duke or General or Statesman he played so often. The acknowledged leader of the British community in Hollywood, Sir Aubrey, would also work for the Criquet game in Southern California. Until his death in 1948 he was in high demand in studios all over the city. <br /> <br /> The movie star is Marion Davies. Now remembered as the media mogul mistress William Randolph Hearst and the chatelaine of Hearst Castle, the fabulous West Coast residency, she was indeed a very talented and pretty comedian. For a few years, Hearst tried to make her the queen of MGM (with her own production company and a huge bungalow dressing room), but the studio already had several other queens - Dressler, Garbo, Shearer, Crawford - and he finally pulled them together at Warner Bros. Here Miss Davies has a chance to have fun and clowns and their scenes with Sir Aubrey are entertaining. <br /> <br /> Her love interest is played by Ralph Forbes, a handsome young British actor who just started finding good movies (THE TRAIL OF ?? 98) while the silent days are over. He had all the qualities for a great fame, but unfortunately it should not be. Prominent would come to Ray Milland and make one of his first appearances here. Halliwell Hobbes and Doris Lloyd also seem to benefit.
