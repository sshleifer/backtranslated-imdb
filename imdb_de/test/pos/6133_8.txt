I happened to come across this movie. I was traveling a few years ago and this movie was late at night on a cable channel in the hotel. Not much else, and I thought I would watch it for about 20 to 30 minutes until I decided to go to bed. Needless to say, I stopped and looked at the entire movie. The plot was very interesting and lets you ask if there was not one SS who did that or at least thought of it. I was looking for this movie. I even sent an e-mail to the production company, but they were not sure if they would ever appear on DVD, but said there was always hope. If someone finds this movie, put a note where you found it because I'm sure I'll get a copy one day.
