I'm not a big musical fan, but this is one of the few that I really love. Unlike many other musicals like "The Sound of Music" none of the songs are free material. Each song is a social commentary, an ingenuity about war, sexuality, re-election, spirituality and freedom. Especially amazing songs are Easy To Be Hard, Age Of Aquarius, Hair, Flesh Failures / 3-5-0-0, Walking In Space and Hare Krishna. Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can not wait to see it live one day!
