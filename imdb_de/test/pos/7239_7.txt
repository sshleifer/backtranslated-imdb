A very bizarre illustration of the tragic love story of William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The Que family and the Capulet family have a long-standing hatred for each other, which often leads to violence. Hatred has something to do with a movie company and the fact that everyone is pretty crazy. In the midst of this madness are Tromeo and Juliet, the most famous "Star Cross" lovers of literature who at first glance blend into each other and problems arise when they realize whose family the other belongs to. The film follows the basic story of the original play remarkably well and key scenes even use the original or almost original lines. But the infamous Troma Bizarreness pervades the film from start to finish. That's what makes a movie that's definitely not for everyone, but it's still resourceful. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a particularly funny death scene. 7/10 <br /> <br /> There are many differently edited and rated versions. Each contains violence, obscenities, drug use and sex, all with a large dose of bizarre.
