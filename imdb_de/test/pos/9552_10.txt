This movie is my favorite comedy of all time, and I have seen many comedies. First, I should not have a script for this movie. Only a storyboard. The dialogue is almost completely written by the actors. What makes this movie absolutely The cast is one of the best comedy ensembles you'll ever see. The story is about the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia and some of the participants in them. Parker Posey shines and is absolutely great! of laughter comes from the absolute pathos of the characters. ***** / *****
