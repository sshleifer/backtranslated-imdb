This mostly routine, fact-based TV drama is enhanced by Cole's good performance. This is the story of a well-trained military man who is not satisfied with his wife and children, fakes his death, and runs away with the other woman. In order to support them in the usual way, he robs banks. Predictable, but not a bad clock.
