I give 8 out of 10 points because it's a cult classic. It is also directed by legendary Sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan, who also plays the role of Jarvis in the film. When listening to the last blog radio show called AARF (Robert Morgan is a co-host), he says that it has become a cult classic and works well on film conventions. Therefore, it is planned to make a sequel to this movie. I think he said two of the original stars signed and he hopes to have a few more. Robert is a good man and I hope he is doing well. He has devoted more than 50 years of tireless work as a Sassquatch researcher (who is also one of my interests) and author. Check out his Paranormal show and maybe look for Blood Stalkers II in the near future.
