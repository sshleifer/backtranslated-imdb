Beautifully filmed, a bit uneven, "Nobody" is a good evening entertainment. The plot is simple enough - three yuppies collide with a group of strangers in a bar and it turns out that it's a lot more than they expected. The drama is decent and there are a few unexpected twists. Watch out for the absolutely incredible (like the 10-round revolver and the 25-round semi-automatic pistol).
