I say where and when you saw this show, because I think if Fox Talk Show gives a chance, Spike will top Conan in a couple of years, because like Conan, he's hilarious and seems to be grateful to his to have one's own show which adds to the sense of humor. <br /> <br /> The funniest parts Spike has ever had are The Idiot Paparatzi and Comedy For Stoners, and if you do not get high and get CFS, what does that say about you? <br /> <br /> In summary, this show is 25 minutes funnier than SNL in an hour. Let's hope that Talk Show gets the attention it deserves, like an extra half hour, more money and a band.
