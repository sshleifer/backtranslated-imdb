Yes, this movie has many gay characters. It also has characters, characters who are not sure of their sexuality, people who are looking for a truth about their existence. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie about sexual orientation. It's about loneliness and the difficulty people often experience when they connect. Cinematically, Denys Arcand skilfully balances the various dimensions of relationships and contrasting, ever-changing relationships. The serial killer element is slightly less successful (it feels more like a way to sum up different plot points and, unlike the rest of the movie, is thematically cumbersome). <br /> <br /> Thomas Gibson centers and establishes the film. It's a quiet idea, but behind the pretty, arrogant exterior, he's slowly revealing a frightened soul that's afraid of showing or accepting love from the people around it. The side cast is strong, especially Mia Kirshner as Gibson's girlfriend, a dom-for-hire with forward-looking forces. Her role is more a metaphor than a literal imagination - strangely innocent and corrupt at the same time - she represents the light and darkness of the sexual consciousness of the characters. <br /> <br /> The film is involved and often surprises in its character development. The effect is somewhat like Robert Altman's staging a David Mamet script - dialogue does not shy away from a few scathing observations, except for a few constructed moments in the beginning. In our search for love and a traditional "relationship," we often ignore the love that already exists around us - in our friends, the family, those who can see us as we are. Arcand and writer Brad Fraser make some cunning observations about how people try to escape and deny their loneliness and how this denial comes back in so many unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> This movie is a rewarding experience. It can not be that bigots who can not overcome the sexual orientation of some characters see the greater transcendental message of hope and salvation. Loneliness is a universal experience. A movie like this, which dares to explore the dark side of our lives with a wise and attentive eye, deserves applause and an open-minded approach.
