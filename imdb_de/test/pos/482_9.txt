There are times when I believe that The Mikado is the best Sullivan & Gilbert opera, but that's just until I do not listen to Iolanthe. Anyway, The Mikado is probably the most filmed Savoy opera. Nobody says Hammerstein and Rodgers or Hart and Rodgers or Boito and Verdi or What-His-Face and Strauss They do not even hear the names of librettists for Offenbach, Soup or Balfe Gilbert was just the bigger name (and the bigger ego) at the time, so his name was put first and it's time to put silly practices to rest. <br /> <br /> Anyway, The Mikado is a S & G operetta conspiracy that includes some of Sullivan's most catchy numbers combined with some of Gilbert's cleverest lyrics, an interesting book and a lively dialogue, a wonderful dose of madness. <br /> This special production , which was shot in 1990 in a live performance, leaves her imagination in the direction of simplicity: It is located in a British seaside resort towards the end of the Art Nouveau era and throws the japonerie of the original completely The result is costly and in a bland blend of whites, grays and blacks emphasized by occasional reds (and less frequent use of yellows and greens). It takes some getting used to, but it is really fancy. Of course, if the choir tells you that they are gentlemen of Japan, you would be right to say, "Oh, Phew, Bah!" (Have I just said that?) It is very gratifying that this beautiful production is now on DVD. One limitation, however, is that the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity, so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and somewhat blurred. The tendency to overlay images is unfortunately annoying. Why do people who make a really fancy production want to screw it up with artistic-fartsy stuff like this? But it's the performance that counts the most. We can skip the overture, because Sullivan did perform one, but never wrote one. (It may be that he may not have written for any of the Savoyas, but the Mikado Overture does not even come from Sullivan's lifetime, and was made top-notch and super-funny by watching the techniques used in the other techniques. <br /> <br / > The Ko-Ko here is the esteemed Eric Idle who deserves it.There is a tradition of bringing a big name to the role.That was a US television production years ago, in the co-co of Groucho Marx with mixed results Idle's performance is wonderfully bizarre ... he does "out of a county jail" with a tennis racket, his "I have a small list" is said to be a microphone - of course there are the usual updated lyrics that much funnier than the usual run of such things, and its lore is positively hysterical, it goes on and on everywhere. <br /> <br /> In this operetta, having a good katisha is important ; It's just not fun if you do not yell with style. This Mikado has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer, almost a name like Idle in her own way. She roars with the best of them in a wonderful rich alto voice ... wonderful, especially for a soprano. And her costume ... !!! (Not to mention her recital with Franz Liszt, apparently accompanying.) Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone. I'm struggling to get around is a little un-nanki-pooish chubby brevity - but the voice is undeniably a solid, rich addition to the vocal range. While "A Wand'ring Minstrel" has a nice touch, the chorus reacts disincliningly to the mention of "his Nancy on the knee" - remember that the Mikado has flirting. Anyway, Bottone is a good singing actor, and if Nanki-Poo can not bribe with his appearance, it's his performance. Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are appropriately pretty and stupid. She and Bottone make beautiful duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his personality as an engraver and does it very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is wonderful as a stuffed shirt made of water ... a role that later died in American sitcoms (you know: haughty butlers who are forced to take care of brutal kids - stuff like that ). The Mikado (Richard Angas) is damned wonderful, with a commanding voice in complete departure from his ridiculous lyrics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend that you receive this as your only Mikado. Also get a good traditional production so you can see what Gilbert intended (more or less) in terms of staging. That being said, I'll take a look twice this time while looking at each traditional piece. On the whole, this is a terrific offer, a vocal and visual enjoyment with delicious over-acting. It's a DVD to the treasure, with dervish-like maids, tap dances and all the rest. Look for the pages with signs.
