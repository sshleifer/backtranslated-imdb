I saw this movie last night and thought it was decent. It has moments, I think, you would say. Some of the scenes with the special units were cool and some of the shoot shots were very authentic. I will not include this movie in my DVD collection, but he's fair enough to hire him. I think nothing has taken the movie to another level compared to other genres. The action is good, the acting is decent, the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion, and the story is pretty interesting. 7 out of 10
