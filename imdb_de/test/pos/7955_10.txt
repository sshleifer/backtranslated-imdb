This movie would have shamed the typical Hollywood tearjacks. The emotions shown are very pleasantly muted and unobtrusive. The plot is a clich√© enough with a lead role in a deadly disease (this is not a spoiler and was established early in the movie), and yet you will feel the tremendous flow of love between the two leaders. At first I assumed that this "restriction of emotions" is somewhat analogous to the typical "eastern values", but later decided against it. <br /> <br /> This film is so unremarkable that it compares to movies like "Cinema" Paradiso, "CP would have obviously felt manipulative in comparison, so it's definitely not for everyone. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I have a strong feeling that Hollywood love movies (or love movies all around, to be exact) have glorified romance or passion, calling it "love." I'm sure we all have our own definitions and I would not say that these qualities are mutually exclusive, but I dare say that the film lets you ask if there is an extra dimension you loved with you. <br /> <br / > It's very obvious that I like this movie very much, given that the movie looks so simple, it's paradoxically one of the more "cinematic" movies I've seen lately.
