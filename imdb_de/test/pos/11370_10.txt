I saw this mini series when I was in high school. I remember that it was absolutely brilliant and captivating. At the time, I did not know any of the British actors in the series, but since then I've heard that some of today's stars have appeared in it, including Sean Connery (the original James Bond among many others), Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth in "Shakespeare"). ) In Love "among many other roles) and Eilene Atkins (probably best known for" Upstairs / Downstairs ", but also outstanding in many acting roles.) Like the other commentator, I would like to see it again, I'm sure the production stays timeless and I hope it's been or will be released on VHS or DVD, so if you can see it, do not miss it.
