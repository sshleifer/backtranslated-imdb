A fascinating documentary of life about a husband and wife and their marriage told through their son's eyes. We all like to believe that our parents lived a happy life, that their marriages were full of fulfillment, love and happy memories. Unfortunately, many of us know that this is not the case of their own families and their parents. This wonderful little documentary is told through the camera lens and the emotional perspective of the son of a family that has just witnessed the death of their mother. The son, who is a documentary filmmaker, filmed his older family for many years because he says "posterity". Three months after his mother's death, his father marries his longtime secretary. The suddenness of this event numbs the family and forces the son to become familiar with the past lives of his mother and father. What he reveals is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two ordinary people who, like so many of their generation, got married early for wrong reasons and got stuck in a family life where they realized they just had to "do". A woman who sometimes found herself bitterly lonely and unloved and a husband who buries himself in his work. You and intellectuals in the heart, he is a much simpler person who seems to find most of his joys in the quiet solitude of work. They are obviously wrong for each other, that's clear. But they hold it, for what? Well, that's part of the mystery, they sometimes show affection, if not love. You will not find any really shocking revelations here, except for the unfaithfulness on both sides, which makes a good part of this being a gem. You really feel that these could be your own parents if the circumstances were different, and indeed question the lives of your own parents.
