During the Second World War, there were a myriad of Hollywood-made films, and after seeing many of them, they seemed similar. However, OVER 21 is unique in many ways as it shows a side of the war that you will not see in other films - which is well worth seeing, even if you have seen many other films! <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the male lead, but the movie's main character is Irene Dunne - who looks amazing for a 47-year-old lady (yes, I checked) - she was really as old as she was did the movie). In over 21, the couples play man and woman. He joins the military, much to the dismay of his father (Charles Coburn) and the owner of the newspaper in which Knox is employed, and most of the film plays when he is in an officer's candidate school. The film shows little of Knox at school, but instead focuses on Dunne as she lives in nearby Spartan flats for spouses. During this time, she keeps (as the British say) a "stiff upper lip" and makes the best of it - though she is not really a housewife, but a famous professional writer. Occasionally, she gets very brief visits from her hated husband, but most of the time she spends housekeeping and keeps the interfering Coburn in check. Eventually, she decides to stop annoying Coburn from talking incessantly (he ALWAYS complains that his paper will not survive without his son) pretending to be Knox. <br /> Although there's nothing earth-shattering in this movie, It is a very interesting section of life. In addition, the spectacle is very good all around. It is interesting that this film is a fictionalized reworking of the experienced ones by Ruth Gordon (a famous screenwriter) and her husband, Garson Kanin (also a famous screenwriter and director). When Kanin joined the military during World War II, Gordon soon wrote and played a play in the play that became the movie. By the way, I noticed that some of the reviewers really liked the speech at the end of the movie and were inspired by it. It was very good, but it was also very sad, because all this hope for a better world after the war was short-lived.
