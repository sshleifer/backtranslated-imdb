After finally getting the DVD of this 1997 HBO movie, it's time to see it. When I finished, the old adage echoed, "Those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it." For the first time four years after the first Twin Towers bombing (and four years before the events of September 11), Path To Paradise shows the series of encounters, mistakes, and official decisions that led to the Twin Towers' first bombing and the lessons we learned from them they should have learned. <br /> <br /> Path to Paradise offers a nice cast of credible actors. Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden cited the occupation as FBI agents John Anticev and Nancy Floyd, who are exposed not only to the threats of terrorism but also to the lack of official interest of their superiors and their NYPD counterpart Lou Napoli (Paul Guilfoyle) , Art Malik, Andreas Katsulas, Shaun Toub, and Tony Gillan are among those planning and executing the attack, all of whom play their roles not as potential clich√©s but as real living people, making the movie even better. Particularly noteworthy is Ned Eisenberg as Emad Salem, the man who, if it had not been skeptical FBI officials, could have potentially informed about the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is also well produced. Although it was made for cable, this film does not feel like a low-budget movie with its production values, especially in Sets and New York City. The fascinating cinematography of the film temporarily gives the film an almost documentary style. Combining all of these elements with the script contributes to giving the film a sense of reality, making the events all the more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about the movie is the script. The events of the film are true (apart from some dramatic licenses that are always necessary) and are, in retrospect, even more shocking than they were when the film was first shown twelve years ago. The film shows a group of men smuggling a bomb into the World Trade Center. Due to the lack of Arabic translators, they did not do so, government agencies did not provide information, the FBI ignored the evidence from a source, and the police were unable to find clues. Worse than the investigators' inability to connect points is the fact that many of these things not only allowed the 9.11 attacks, but in some cases (such as the lack of translators) continue today. Even more disturbing is the end that has really happened and looks too prophetic today. Path to Paradise is a movie that should be seen today. Not only is the film well-made and produced, it also teaches us a lesson we should have learned earlier. The lesson of the movie? That those who can not learn from the past are doomed to fail. If you can find this movie, look at it and learn about it.
