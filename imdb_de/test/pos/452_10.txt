"The Journey" is a very good movie. This film, produced in Vienna in the spring of 1958 and published in 1959, was quite popular in its early years. Despite the political issues that influenced the film's success (because the story takes place during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), "The Journey" is a very good movie, but not known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD because most people who have seen it so far want to have it at home. One of the most important features of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, their intense relationship. All their scenes together are very important, but also show the strong feelings, the great passion and the love between the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another feature is the script, which is very well written. It was even published as a novel by video-player George Tabori. The film retains its tension from beginning to end. At first, we did not know whether Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary, as the Communist Major discovers that Diana's friend Paul Kedes is Hungarian and he can not leave the country. The Major falls deeply in love with Diana and that's the real reason he does not want to let her go. But after hugging her and giving her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on the screen, and kissing him as well, he lets her go. And the end of the movie is one of the most dramatic films ever made - Major and Diana say goodbye! he dies. Yul Brynner is very, very good looking and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful, charming, refined, just like an English lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of the biggest couples of Golden Hollywood. A true moviegoer should see this movie. "The Journey" has everything a good movie should have - a great, compelling story, interesting characters, a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is in my opinion most suitable). Finally, I want to send a message to Warner Bros. Studios or to those who are restoring and releasing classic movies: Please publish "The Journey" on DVD as soon as possible.
