I saw this movie for the first time in the cinema two years ago, and I fell in love with this dark story in which two brooding teenage sisters coped with their father and stepmom at home in their large country home. Her relationship with her stepmother is tense to say the least, with the stepmother increasingly seeming to become unstable in her struggles with the younger girls. Although the film has oriental ghost effects and horror effects, it gives the story a strange and disturbing aspect, which at first glance is not clear, but all the more fascinating. <br /> <br /> The direction is unbelievably good, and the acting is stunning, with the stepmother in particular swinging incredibly well from one mood style to another in the film. The big house adds eeriness and in the movie there are enough points where you jump off your seat. This film clearly shows me why Korean cinema is possibly the best original in the world right now. There is no such thing in the Western world. Unfortunately, I can say that this will be influential for filmmakers around the world over the next decade. <br /> <br /> a real joy and fear ...
