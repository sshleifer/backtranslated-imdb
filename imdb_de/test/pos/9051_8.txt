This 60-minute film shows how much fun filmmaking can be. It's great fun as it's an uncompromising attack on the Star Trek genre. In "Hick Trek - The Moovie" is a group of good guys on the mission to stop a group of breakaway cats to destroy the entire Redneck Federation with the power of the RSS cattle and it's cowbeam? She may have nine lives, but he has ten bullets! This cult classic (previously only seen on scifi conventions) is a party favorite. Many funny moments!
