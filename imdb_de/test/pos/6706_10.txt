Based on the book "Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson. This is (in my humble opinion) one of the best pieces of sci-fi horror of the eighties. The effects of ILM continue at today's standards. The actors are mostly British, and since they are British, this film seems to offer a greater depth of realism. The film was spanned by the critics and unfortunately did not perform well at the box office on both sides of the Atlantic. Tobe Hooper gave the promotion, which was conducted before its publication, the main reason for the low revenue. But for whatever reason, it does not detract from the fact that this is a great movie with a great cast and a good plot. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed.
