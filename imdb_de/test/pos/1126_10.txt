... I can not believe that I was immediately thrilled with this show after seeing the first scene where I was deep inside. Anyway, at first the guys are hot, Cappy, Evan, Calvin, Fischer, Cappy, Heath, Cappy and so on. <br /> <br /> Second, the girls are cute, sexy. smart and are not afraid to be called bitches. I like it. What does not make them greedy and greedy at the same time, but only realistic. <br /> <br /> Third, the relationships are so great, especially Casey and Cappy. Lately, every show is turning away from its original path, and people are ending up with someone who has not even been in season one. Cappy and Casey's relationship is true love, a kind that continues. They loved each other over the years and it did not end when a guest star appeared. <br /> <br /> In today's world, it may be unbelievable that two people love each other for a long time, but it happens. And people define themselves at the university, so I knew exactly who I wanted to be with at the university. Just like Casey and Cappy. <br /> <br /> I hope there will be many more seasons of this show and I hope we can see the relationship between CASEY and CAPPY, that they will get together, for Thanksgiving
