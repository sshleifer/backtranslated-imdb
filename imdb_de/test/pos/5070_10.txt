Extraordinary rendition is a frightening practice that has surprisingly been allowed under Clinton and allows the US government to arrest anyone suspected to be terrorists against the United States for any reason. This is particularly sensitive after 9/11 because practitioners will always criticize the opposition by depriving the US of the vital power it needs to effectively fight terrorism. Fanatical supporters will call the opposition itself terrorists. <br /> <br /> But like a new film that gave the death penalty, The Life of David Gale, a similar degree of humanity, Rendition shows a story of the abuse of extraordinary renditions, or at least the ease with which it deals it can be exploited and misused. The story is about Anwar El-Abrahimi, an Egypt-born American chemical engineer who was confiscated from a lecture in Egypt on his way back to America. The cause is that he called a known terrorist. There is never any evidence (or required) that Anwar made the calls, that his phone was never stolen. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Anwar's extremely pregnant wife, Isabella, is back in the States, desperate to find her husband, who has boarded a plane to Chicago, but apparently never got off. The flimsy explanation that he was never there disappears when she finds out that he made a purchase with his credit card during the flight. <br /> <br /> Lately, I've been studying modern Chinese history, especially the astonishingly selfish and brutal dictatorship that Mao Tse-tung founded, and it's more than scary to find the similarities between extraordinary rendition and Repetition to See Some of Mao's brutal Mao tactics, including his public executions (which people had to watch) and the widespread use of torture, which was specifically used to extract "confessions". <br /> <br /> It is quite disturbing to note that Mao has done exactly these things to create an environment of fear to achieve obedience to the Chinese people. To say that the Bush administration has created no environment of fear and will continue to milk, because anything worth it would be na√Øve in the extreme. Although no extraordinary renditions were made under Bush, it is clear that they do more harm than good. <br /> <br /> The film is supplemented by Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works for the CIA behind a desk and has little experience in the field until his boss is murdered and suddenly watches over the torture by a man who he quickly casts doubt, he has something to reveal. The daughter of Fatima (Freeman's boss) also plays a key role, as does a senator played by Peter Sarsgaard, who may play the most satisfying role in the film. Meryl Streep is also suitable as a cool senator with a dogmatic support of the necessity and practice of reproduction. <br /> <br /> As a political thriller, the film is remarkably well done and moves. But the scariest thing is that this is all real. The purpose of the film is to get people to really think about the things that were made in America's name, especially when they claim they are being done to prevent these things. Condemning terror to prevent terror will neither win sympathy nor force confessions through brutal torture, which is the simplest form of criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are gradually moving in that direction and doing these things more than less. The frightening question is what will be the event that will take place sometime in the future, to persuade us to stop and look for the other way, towards civilization and peace, or will we just continue on a military dictatorship until we finally come there?
