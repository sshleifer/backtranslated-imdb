This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! The director has done a wonderful job showing the contrasts between the social strata, a situation that is very relevant in France today. All characters are adorable, especially Juliette and her family. The development of the romance is not quite realistic, but at least plausible and miraculously shows how much people will change for love. I found that a heartwarming Cinderella story - but one in which Cinderella is a strong woman in and of herself. I laughed the whole movie and was totally excited. I can recommend Romuald et Juliette to anyone who likes unique characters, comedies and non-traditional romance.
