Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) turns up at the New York shipyards looking for a job but with a hidden past. He gets one, on the condition that he gives the grumpy crew chief Jack Warden a kick. There he befriends black man Sydney Poitier, who leads to an unpleasant moral dilemma for a man who, as we learn, usually depends on his problems. The film looks like Oscar The winner On The Waterfront feels like On The Waterfront and plays especially like the 1954 production of Kazan. However, his race motive is groundbreaking for the time. The black poitier and the white cassavetes are treated as equal in every respect. You could even call it the first of the black and white "buddy" pictures that would later dominate so many action movies. <br /> <br /> It helps that the two leads play so well against each other. Nonetheless, the movie's central flaw does not reveal why crew chief Poitier's first and foremost friendship with the sombre Cassavetes. He really does everything to make friends with the newcomer. But why he would overcome the racial barriers is never really suggested. One possible explanation is that Poitier wants to use Cassavetes in his rivalry with the other crew chief Warden as a farmer, but then really likes the guy. There is some indication in some suspicious reactions from Cassavetes, but moreover, the relationship seems to be unmotivated. <br /> <br /> If there was only one phase in the movie, I could not recognize it. Everything is done in crazy places in New York, without the usual film extras. In this sense, it's an anti-Hollywood production that has even been humbled into the nightclub scene, which itself looks like a real after-hours crowd. I suppose sociologists would call this rather raw piece of life "a look at the working poor." <br /> <br /> Despite all the virtues that many have, the film remains a favorite of the Brando Kazan movie. Here, a fine, unknown actress Kathleen Maguire gets the role of the redeeming friend, Warden the role of the corrupt chief of staff, while Cassavetes like Brando has to suffer bloody blows before he can regain his moral standing and do the right thing. Despite the inferred nature, the grainy city drama has enough of the original power to earn a look.
