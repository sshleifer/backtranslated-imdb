This is one of the greatest movies ever made. Brilliant play by George C. Scott and Diane Riggs. This movie is both disturbing and extremely deep. Do not be fooled that this is just a comedy. It's a brilliant satire about the medical profession. It is not a nice picture. Healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons who spend all their time making money outside the hospital. And yet you really believe that this is a hospital. The manufacturers were very keen to include real medical terminology and real medical cases. This movie really shows how difficult it is to run a hospital, and how bad it was in 1971. I loved this movie. P.S. - I noticed that the incompetent Wheeler dealer surgeon in LA Law played the head of the law firm. The young doctor played in Lou Grant. I also noticed that the registration sister has since appeared in Becker and other shows.
