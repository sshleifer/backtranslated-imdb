I absolutely love this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it in the video library. I saw that Kathy Bates was there, so I thought it was worth something, you know? I saw it the first time, just shaking my head. , , huh Then it was the last scene and I was in pain because I had smiled so hard. I clicked on "Play movie" and looked at the whole thing again. It's without a doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I see it, the more I love it. It is absurd and crazy and sweet and sweet. Kathy Bates is impeccable, but the rest of the cast is also fabulous. What are these strange characters? The dwarf is just too funny for words. And Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow are hysterical. It's just a fun, fabulous movie. I get the urge to see it again. If you see it for the first time, please keep it until the end. It is worth it!
