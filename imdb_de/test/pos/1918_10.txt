Well done documentary about a sailing race, sanity and the loss of both. <br /> <br /> I remember reading Francis Chichester's report when I was in high school when I saw this movie. What an adventure that was. <br /> <br /> deep water tells an equally fascinating story. <br /> <br /> It takes a special person and an excellent sailor to make an uninterrupted journey around the world ... alone. <br /> <br /> This film demonstrates this very well. <br /> <br /> I love to sail and my brother drives J-30s. <br /> <br /> but I could not do that.
