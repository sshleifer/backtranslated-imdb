A very great movie. <br /> <br /> A great love story. A lot of sword fighting. Huge fight scenes. Heroes and villains. True story. <br /> <br /> Few in the West are familiar with Chinese history. Chin Zchaundi founded China. The country is actually named after him. Some are familiar with the recently excavated Terracotta Army. This is a historical epic about how he ended the period of competing states and united China. He founded a dynasty that lasted only 14 years, but it was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty, which has since permanently defined Chinese civilization. Chin (or the King of Zheng, as he was known before the founding of the Reich) was about the same time as Scipio, Hannibal, and Fabius in the west. The parallel Roman world dominance (West and East Worlds) was achieved without a single personality like Chin. It would not be another century before the West produced Caesar - the next comparable Western figure. Chin is shown to be very sympathetic, but he becomes a ruthless despot in the course of the movie. The story records only the ruthless despot part, but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development in the course of this long film. The famous story of the assassin's meeting is as true as any 2,000-year-old anecdote can be. Gong Li is lovely. It is the emotional core of the story. All this makes great movies.
