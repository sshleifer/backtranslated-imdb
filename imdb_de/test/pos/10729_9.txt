Usually, there are films from the field of "domestic drama" and for a good reason: who wants to deliberately look for entertainment when it comes to what they or their close associates are dealing with in real life? Divorce harms an incredible percentage of American families of all classes, and custody matches are ugly and necessary parts of it. This is not escapism - the most important reason why an average person moves to movies - that is a sad reality. <br /> <br /> Normally, divorce or custody is just part of a larger story and influences the way we understand it or relate to its characters. "Kramer vs. Kramer" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why it is so disturbing. This is a challenge for both the film and the audience: Transform something so real into something that can grab our attention, and then do not make us malicious when the mirror is in front of our faces. Robert Benton, author and director, certainly achieves both in an impressive way by adapting this novel by Avery Corman. <br /> <br /> The story is, as one would expect, rather simple: The great advertising man Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) Comes home to his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep), who takes him and her 7-year-old son Billy ( Justin Henry) leaves. Then Ted has to learn quickly to be an active father in the boys' lives, and as soon as he does, Joanna pulls a custody suit with him. <br /> <br /> In order to do an Oscar-winning drama about something so generic and something especially dialog-intensive, you first need a tremendous amount of acting talent. You will not be much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is in his best position in this role: his first Oscar victory after three other notable nominations. He creates a thorough character, one whose selfish and spirited manner changes significantly as he learns to be a better father and the only carer. Streep wins her first Oscar only in the second major role of her career as a woman who does not have much time on screen but has to communicate both inner torments in her decision to leave as well as a new sense of identity when she returns to custody take over. Streep does it effortlessly. The boy, Justin Henry, who was the youngest nominee in the competitive category at his age, plays the embodiment of all seven-year-olds exceptionally well. Benton's writing and directing adopts these achievements at the level where we see more deeply in the problems of this family than we rethink our own and, therefore, our thoughts on the love and education of a family. Benton's earlier noteworthy credits ("Bonnie & Clyde" and "Superman") did not indicate a strong command of the family drama, but the man can write flat. Numerous scenes give us strong images that show us much more than the typical family scenarios that portray them. The first morning Joanna is gone and Ted Makes's Billy French Toast is a classic showing all the talent in this film in a scene that occurs every morning in America's kitchens. <br /> <br /> You will rarely look at a story as easy as "Kramer vs. Kramer" is. There are no surprises at the end or twists that make us desperately stick to the screen. The film must then rely on its talents, and they are all confident and provide a new understanding of such a familiar subject.
