** SPOILERS AHEAD ** <br /> <br /> It's really unfortunate that such a well-produced movie turns out to be such a disappointment. I thought that was full of (stupid) clichés and <br /> <br /> that it was basically too hard. <br /> <br /> To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend your <br /> <br /> time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and monkey songs <br /> <br / > to do? To the (married) girls: How many of you suddenly went from beating to nymphs overnight - but not with your husband? To the French: Would you really ask if someone is "à la fac" if you know that he does not speak French? Would not you <br /> <br /> use a more general word like "université"? <br /> <br /> I lived in France for a while and I know and understand Europe (and I love it), but my (German) roommate and I found the whole hotel quite offensive , It looked like a European Parliament-funded film, and it was basically too hard. There were all the differences that it tried to tie (not a bad thing in <br /> itself), but the result is at best unpleasant, but in fact ridiculous - too < br /> <br /> many clashes that would not really happen. Then the end of the <br /> <br /> movie - the last 10 minutes - ruined the rest. Why does not Xavier talk to the Erasmus students he meets in Paris? Why is he just leaving? Why is he just running away from his job, is that <br /> <br /> "freedom"? And in the end, should the new Europe rest on a group of people who smoke and fog all day long? Is that what it <br /> <br /> consists of? <br /> <br /> Also, the show was pretty awful. I can not believe Judith's role and acting. Why was she made to look like Emanuelle Béart? At first, I thought Xavier was okay, but in hindsight, I think he was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> And that's all too bad, because technically (opening speech, <br /> <br /> scenes in which he asks which papers he needs), it was really good (except for Sound cut around the British siblings), and the <br /> <br /> soundtrack was great too. So the shape was good, but the content was pretty awful.
