I was stunned by this movie. I rented / rediscovered Antonioni's films, and this film showed me the climax and the fruits of his 50 years of directing. What an eye for attitude, color and detail! I have never seen such visual beauty and poetry before. I had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears. Yes, beauty moves me, as if it had moved Keats to write Ode on a Greek urn. This film is intended for the mature, emotional and intellectual audience. Those hoping for physical exercise and soap opera will be disappointed. I will have to see this movie several times before I can truly appreciate and judge it. This film should be viewed by all filmmakers and directors. Maybe a really great movie commissioned by Kurosawa's Dreams.
