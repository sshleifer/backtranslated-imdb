I agree with "johnlewis," who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film. While I think the tempo of this film can be improved, I think the complexity of character relationships is intriguing. <br /> <br /> Examples: <br /> <br /> Pierre is going to marry his cousin, even though his love for her seems to be very cousin? <br /> <br /> Pierre and his stepmother have a pretty ... inquisitive relationship. <br /> <br /> Pierre, Lucie and Thibault seem to have a love triangle, and the actual points to the triangle are not very sure ... <br /> <br /> Lucie's brother is a bit of a eunuch or is he it? <br /> <br /> And Isabelle, who is she really? <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it was worth my time. An interesting movie that makes me read Melville.
