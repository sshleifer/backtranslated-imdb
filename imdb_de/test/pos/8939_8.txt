It's been a long time since such an original, pretty funny black comedy appeared. If "Eating Raoul" is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and immediately find "Company Betty". The theme that death is funny has been tried before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in the "Mortuary Academy"). While this movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy, Undertaking Betty is much calmer, with a better cast. Who could imagine that the company could be a fertile ground for an original, uplifting and sincere comedy? I was surprised and you will be too. I highly recommend seeing "Undertaking Betty" - MERK
