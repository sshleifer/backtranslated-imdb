This movie has a bad start. An incredibly stupid monologue is immediately followed by a brilliant, truly amazing crash of a spaceship. Then it goes downhill again, when you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost all of them fit too well into the role of the monster food. Damn, half of them do not even speak English and prevent the audience from getting to know the characters. You feel like you're seeing "Deep Blue Sea" and "Silence of the Lambs" without the good parts. And unfortunately, the whole thing tries everything to have crashed in daylight scenes "on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter". Vin Diesel is a great actor - but he is not Anthony Hopkins. There is at least one very good scene with an unexpected survivor - but otherwise you could have just turned off the first thirty minutes or so ... <br /> <br /> But then things take a turn. I can not pinpoint the moment, but the movie will be much better soon. It also feels less hacked - the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative, and Vin Diesel gets less annoying and soon he's a show stealer. By the time the first monsters appear, the movie is actually quite enjoyable. When night falls, it's great. Exciting, frightening and exciting. And even the character development of most of the main characters is well done. If you can just sit through the poor pieces at the beginning, you will expect great entertainment. <br /> <br /> In addition, the visuals are a feast for the eyes, and I honestly admit: I love the color and tone of this film. <br /> <br /> 7/10 (could only have been 9/10 if only ....)
