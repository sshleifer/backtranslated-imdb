I really like Traci Lords very much. She may not be the best actress in the world, but she's pretty good at it. She plays the stupid, conservative reporter to a 'T'. It's a great little thriller that makes you guess for a while. Jeff Fahey is also good at Traci. I think Traci could be a top actress on a decent break. It is certainly no worse than some of the leading ladies of today.
