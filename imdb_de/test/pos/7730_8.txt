I really liked this movie - not so much for the story (which was okay, but a bit slow in places), but much more for the incredible scenery of Greece and the Greek islands! Susan Sarandon is hugely involved as a carefree love interest from John Cassavetes - a man on the sidelines. But the landscape! Oh oh oh!
