The sequel is exactly what you expect. And it's good enough that anyone who wanted to see this should be happy. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that will win an Academy Award. But it takes what made the Jackass TV show and the original movie a success and makes it a little bit higher. It's funnier, more brutal and more disgusting than the original. And I enjoyed every minute. <br /> <br /> The original had a few notorious stunts, and there's at least one stunt to remember this movie. They will wince, twitch, look away and laugh very, very hard. <br /> <br /> In any case, you probably do not need to read this review or others to know if you like this movie, unless you've never heard of Jackass.
