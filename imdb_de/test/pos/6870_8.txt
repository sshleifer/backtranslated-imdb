It's a shame that house calls are not better known. Is it perhaps because the romantic leads are middle-aged rather than worn-out and shy with guns, not over-the-top teen stars? Could be. If you are over 35 you will probably get this comedy. If you are over 45, you will really get this comedy. If you are 25 years old, wait until you are older to see it. <br /> <br /> The unfamiliar pairing of Matthau and Jackson works precisely because it is so unlikely. There is a wonderful series of Matthau's that summarizes what happens between the two: "I like old women because you do not have to explain who Ronald Coleman is." (If that's not the exact line, it's near ...) <br /> <br /> The premise of a below-average hospital operated by incompetents is true. Art Carney's depiction of a senile chief surgeon is absolutely brilliant. It is impossible not to laugh loudly at his delivery. Subplots, if you can call them that, are also fun, as between Matthau and Jackson's youthful son. Everything hits the right tone. <br /> <br /> Okay, so Matthau has to wear women's clothing, which is a bit over the top and a light mark. But still - it's Walter Matthau on the train! It's funny!
