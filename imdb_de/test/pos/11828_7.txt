I do not think this cartoon was as bad as some say. Of course, at the time of publication, I was only five years old. But I found it very entertaining at the time and would still like to see it today if I had the opportunity. Batman and Robin, voiced by Adam West and Burt Ward, were a nice touch and gave me a sense of familiarity as I also saw repeats of the 1960s "Batman" campy live show during that time. There were also some new twists introduced in this cartoon that I forgot everything, such as Bat-Mite. Looking back, I'm sure he was probably as annoying as many think, but he barely bothered me at the time. The best I can remember sounded like a mix of Dumb Donald and Orko. Gee, I wonder why? :) Anyway, look at it and decide yourself. You might be surprised.
