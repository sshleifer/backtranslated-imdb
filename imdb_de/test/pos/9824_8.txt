I do not know how I would feel if I lived in the USA. I'd look at some previews, commercials, I'd know Sidney Pollack was the director, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas were the main characters. I would watch this movie as soon as possible without reading bad reviews. Would I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> I read a lot of reviews that say how bad this movie was: This is boring, long film without passions and it's not interesting. Harrison is made of wood and cold. The sub lots should be cut. Too serious, especially for Harrison Ford. I'm interested in the subject and I like Harrison Ford in the movies, which are not actions. I also like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas. After reading the reviews on the IMDB website, I was asked in February in the Hungarian film magazines what the movie was. Nevertheless, there are films, directors, stars that I want to see despite all the reviews. <br /> <br /> I can understand people who think this movie is boring and cold and have no passion, but I feel different. It's true that I liked Sliding Doors, The Forbidden Woman (this is a French movie, I do not know what the title is in English or French). Fundamental to these films is the development of a love. <br /> <br /> I think Random Heart is a beautiful and interesting movie in its own way. <br /> <br /> It may be true that the Sublots-the congressional election and police investigation of a corrupt cop-are not well written, are not elaborated in detail, but add something to the main character of the woman and man's work , He will be suspicious and have almost lost his best friend (and then the wife). The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: the death of our wife / husband and cheating. One is the woman: this is a tragedy, but life goes on. She does not want to mourn forever. What she wants to know - what the lover of her husband - the wife of the policeman - thought about her, she will never learn. She has to behave like that. The elections have come, and anything about his husband can become a scandal. She wants her daughter not to be disappointed by her father. The man is a policeman. He suffers from the fact that he has lived in lies. He wants to know, maybe every man in this situation would want to know when his wife started cheating on him. How long did she have a lover? He needs the help of the woman, but she does not want to, but the guy is stubborn and steadfast. The woman does not like him because he always enters her life and can not forget her. Their relationship is tense at the beginning, then slowly develops a kind of silent sympathy, which favors an alliance against the outside world, the tragedy. (I said it anyway, they loved each other in bed) But the policeman can not stop the investigation, can not stop and can not allow the woman near him, but he starts the "love" and the woman wants their relationship continues. But that does not work. The woman recognizes it. The end is a bit sad, but logical and nice at the same time. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Peter Coyote again - I like the face of this man - Sidney Pollack. I hardly knew Bonnie Hunt, but she was good. <br /> <br /> I think Harrison Ford did a good job. His earrings are unusual, but in the beginning I finally believed that the woman, despite his temperament, liked to be in his company. It was a pity he did not have fun. But Ford has a good sense of humor. A reviewer noted (in Hungary): "Ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drops and we wait for his presence and want him to laugh at us and make an ironic message, but Dr. Jones does not smile at us." But he smiles in the end and it is sooo good. I agree with the rest. I really like him in this role. He's good at being a bit rough, cool, but somewhere in his soul, a smart policeman. The character of Kristin Scott Thomas is a woman who is determined, self-confident, but she is closed an ivory tower and she keeps away from her feelings. But she is a really woman who is undecided and finds support with the policeman. The two cool, restrained people find each other. <br /> <br /> Maybe the script is not good. It is full of ordinary, banal punishments, but there are some humorous phrases of woman and movement, especially of the man. It's a good movie, but not for everyone, not for the big crowd. I saw the women under 18 and men over 45 liked this movie better. Maybe Sidney Pollack made this movie for his age group that does not go to the multiplex. In any case, I advise people who like energetic actions with action scenes that miss this movie like only Ford's action movies.
