Bergman is a great comedy director and author. This fact can be seen in "Lesson I kärlek", where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep but very emotional scenes. This film paves the way for Bergman's later comedies "Sommarnattens leende" and "Kvinnodröm", all starring Gunnar Björnstrand and Eva Dahlbeck. This is a great movie to help you get started on your Bergman experience by presenting the emotional problems of young and old in an acute way. The cinematography of Martin Bodin is amazing, for example in the picnic scene. In short, the film is a perfect example of a successful comedy with a clarity of depth that surpasses even some of Bergman's own comedies.
