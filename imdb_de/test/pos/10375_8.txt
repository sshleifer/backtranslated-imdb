David Suchet is the perverted detective Hercule Poirot by Agatha Christie in "After the Funeral", which was produced in 2005. Anyone who heard David Suchet speak with his British accent knows what a shock it is because his Poirot accent is so perfect and organic in character. Seek is the Poirot of Agatha Christie's books, and although I confess a love to Peter Ustinov in his role, his portrayal does not have so much to do with what Christie has written. In this episode Poirot is asked by a lawyer friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. On the way on the train, the lawyer tells the events after death - a strange man unravels the expected heir and the announcement of the man's sister that he was murdered. When Poirot meets the family, he discovers adultery, many secrets, another will and a murder. <br /> <br /> The story is rich with rich production values ​​and a wonderful, detailed account of the period. The show is great, especially by Monica Dolan, who plays Miss Gilchrist. Poirot is here without Hastings, his beautiful office or Miss Lemon, but he is still effective. <br /> <br /> I was privileged to see David Suchet on "Broadway" in "Amadeus". Breathtaking. What an actor - when he plays Poirot, I only see IS Poirot.
