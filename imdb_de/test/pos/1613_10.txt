The greatest epoch of cinema began in the postwar period of Europe with the neo-realist movement of Italy. For the next two or three decades, France's New Wavers caught everyone's attention, and there was always Bergman on his lonely Scandinavian island making bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti brought the art form geographically into a circle with his wondrous work * Death in Venice *, which could also be called * The Death of European Cinema *. After the sixties, the great European filmmakers, who, with a few exceptions, were generally exhausted and passed on the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese & Co.), were diminished. This film absolutely feels like a great summary, not only for Visconti's particular obsessions, but for the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal of films. And rest assured, you will not find a stricter Taskmaster than the Visconti revealed here. He does not play in the crowd, people: either you come after him and follow him or you are left behind. The pace is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. There are few "incidents", but in a storm-and-space cosmos everyone seems symbolic. <br /> <br /> We'll probably never be in such a sophisticated society as far as the movies are concerned: one of the great writers of the century who inspired the story (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest directors (Visconti), one Gustav Mahler's 5th Symphony In order to use Mahler's ability to inspire romanticism even in the most cynical chest, Visconti turns the main character Aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original work Role as a writer and even turns Bogarde into LOOK like Mahler (geeky mustache, shaggy hair, duck-like gait). Incidentally, Bogarde delivers what is probably an actor's best performance in the history of the film: it's a largely silent performance, and the actor has to provide a wealth of meanings with a gesture or a glance - a trick difficult to do without being invaded by Chaplin or just like an animated corpse. <br /> <br /> Cinema just does not get better. I'll ignore the complaints of those Ritalin addicts out there who say it's too slow, but even the more legitimate criticism of Aschenbach's setbacks with his antagonistic friend is wrong. The flashbacks fit seamlessly into the thematic concerns of the film (ie, what is the better way to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), And the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serves to prevent the drowsiness among the audience , (Of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway.) An uninterrupted Mahler stream and the beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture. but this movie is really about something. And what matters most is suffering: especially the romantic (capital R). As a suffering romantic, Visconti knew what he was talking about. <br /> <br /> [SPOILER. , , I guess] If not otherwise, see * Death in Venice * for his daring opening speeches. , , and for his unforgettable ending, when Bogarde's jet-black hair dripped from his sweaty, dying head to his chalk-white face. In the distance, the young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the sea, pointing to the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence summarizes with agonizing economy everything that the movie is all about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the end of a life against the beginning of another life and the cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. * Death in Venice * is a wondrous work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD Tip: Like the concurrently released Visconti masterpiece * The Damned *, I recommend you to turn on English subtitles while watching this movie. It's supposed to be in English, but the sound of the DVD is muddy and a lot of Italian is spoken during the movie anyway.] <br /> <br />
