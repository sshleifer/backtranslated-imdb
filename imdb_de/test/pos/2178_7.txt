This movie was certainly not very demanding. No, the humor was actually quite stupid now that I think about it. But even when I think about it, I laughed - proof that decent comedy is not very deep. <br /> <br /> Fatty Arbuckle is the definitive star of this short film too. He is the butcher in an old grocery store. There was a lot of stupid stuff in the store, and I think I laughed the most about the coffee grinder sequence - you have to see it for yourself. Anyway, Fatty's girlfriend is forced to go to a girls' school and because he can not stand, he gets dressed and infiltrates the school. Arbuckle is an ugly woman! For stupid and uncomplicated fun you will see this movie. It will not change your life and is a very small picture, but it is also fun.
