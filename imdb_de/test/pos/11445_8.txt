Kevin Tenny's "Night of the Demons" is an entertaining horror movie that reminds me a bit of "The Evil Dead". On Hallowen Night, a group of teenagers are having a party at Hull House, an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of town. Under Angela's guidance, they perform a seance-like ceremony and inadvertently awaken the evil spirits who inhabit the place. The uncharged evil force owns the teenagers and turns them into bloodthirsty demons movie.It's scary, bloody and pretty atmospheric. The characters are well developed and Steve Johnson's Gore is pretty good. There is a cruel spit, a tongue is bitten off, fingers are pushed into the eye sockets and so on. The scene where Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) pushes a tube of lipstick through her nipple is a scream. Give this a look. Followed by two sequels.
