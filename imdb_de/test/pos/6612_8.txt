I saw this movie at the Lowlands Festival (August 23, 24, 25) after a friend of mine said it was a very cool film about the history of skating. I did not know what to expect from this movie. Was it recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do some cool tricks or was a skating documentary? <br /> <br /> So I went in after waiting about an hour, with some expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a nice work about the beginning of skateboarding. It started with the Zephyr team, which was a fine group of surfers. This takes place in a not so nice area where you can live. At some point, the waves are not so good for surfing anymore. So try something different. Skateboarding was a fact. <br /> <br /> If you were part of the Zephyr team at the time, you were one of the cool boys / girls. Because many people saw an escape from the place where they lived in the Zephyr team. So now they are trying all the new tricks on a skateboard. <br /> <br /> Skateboarding became popular again in no time at all. There were a few competitions and a national competition. The Zephyr team participated in several competitions and also in the national competition. But what they did on skateboards was incredible. But the jury did not know how to judge it. So they put the entire skateboard world on their heads. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the rest of the film / documentation, but you have to see it with your own eyes. Because then you can feel the atmosphere of this film. This movie got a lot of style for me, so I rewarded it with an 8. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Gijs and the rest of Holland. See you.
