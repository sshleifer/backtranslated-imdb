The only way to truly understand and relate to the characters in this film is to experience the situations themselves. For many people, this film is almost seemingly biographical, a kind of snapshot of a weekend in our lives. (I did about 85 percent of the stuff in this movie and saw the other 15 percent, usually all on the same weekend). For me and others it is nice that this film can only draw on a few images From people we remember and nights where there are blemishes and blurs, this film is our generation "Studio 54", one piece that we can add to our junk books that you can look back and smile on. I'm glad these days are over, but it's great to watch this movie and say, "I remember when ...". Thank you, Justin, for making this bogus biography of a weekend in my life.
