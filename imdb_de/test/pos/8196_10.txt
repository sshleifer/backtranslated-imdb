After watching the movie a few times, I found so many subtle touches and emotions in the dialogue. Jing Ke, the assassin, has become one of the most popular movie characters of all time. This fine Chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economics of words and movements than any American actor who is today large-format. Qin, the emperor, is brilliant in making the audience believe the kindness in his heart just to unleash the cruelest deeds on the people around him. The promises he makes with unbelievable passion and shakes with a bad fist. Like in almost every movie I've ever seen, Gong Li is just fantastic. Your screen dominance is so graceful and emotionally charged. <br /> <br /> If you could not know, I loved this movie. <br /> <br />
