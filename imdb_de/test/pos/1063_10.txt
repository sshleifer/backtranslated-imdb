It's fun and fast, because a lie leads to another and to an inevitable, surprising conclusion. The tension separates this holiday strip from all others. One wonders how the pieces will fit both during the film and in the future. The character actors laid the foundation stone and talked to us. Sinkewicz (Frank Jenks) shows us what manipulations are possible ... and ultimately, what manipulations can cost! Uncle Felix (SZ Sakall) questions each person for us while trying to protect "Lishka" (Barbara Stanwyck), and this helps us decide who we will eventually root for. If we could ever achieve a perfect world, imperfect humans would probably have to go through a series of events like this one. A blatant weakness is that the fake baby cries after allegedly swallowing Uncle Felix's watch. I've heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store. <br /> <br /> Take a look and you will really feel like somewhere!
