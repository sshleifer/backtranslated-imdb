What can one say about a short, small film filled with secondary actors and not "stars", with absolutely no bad performances, not with a poorly delivered dialogue line and with the cold violence on the one hand, balanced by the warm "heart" becomes the protagonist in the story? <br /> <br /> It's a jewel, a diamond, a precious little jewel of a Western reminiscent of the spirit and legend of the American West. A West that is not populated by great heroes like Hickock or Cody or Masterson or Earp, but by the spread of everyday men and women, farmers and ranch hands, merchants and miners and loggers, whores and bartenders of the day, some are watching for the Wealth, some for peace and quiet, some for religious freedom. <br /> <br /> It may be a very spiritual story, though no particular religion is promoted, for even the non-Mormon cowboys portrayed by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. act in a friendly and noble manner regardless of their religious affiliation and belief, and strives to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train encounters the stranded medical shows. In a biblical way, such as David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines, they are the guardian angels sent into the train of wagons. You finally have to go head to head with the evil incarnated Clegg clan and compare them to the snake in the Garden of Eden, and regret what they need to do afterwards. It is a sweet folkloric Western story that meets every goal John Ford is aiming for. <br /> <br /> Today I have a western Santa Claus whose red outfit is covered in a denim drover coat whose red stocking cap is replaced by a brown Stetson carrying a bag of gifts and a pulley. To my Santa Claus, I added a Winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a Colt revolver to put in his waistband. When people in the office ask why my Santa Claus needs to carry guns, I simply answer, "Snakes!" Is the spirit of Christmas time one in which everyone should get what they deserve? <br /> <br /> Fifty-five years later, especially after 911, the philosophies and attributes that demonstrate the characters and story of this film are as relevant today as they were then.
