After watching Talk Show's series premiere with Spike Feresten, I thought there were really good shows after 12 next to SNL, and I was sad too that it only took 30 minutes. Thanks to his excellent writing skills, this series has overcome a lack of money and helping hands. Electronic Lincoln was hilarious and I really believe this will be a good dark horse talk show. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased with the way he handled it and gave Andy Richtor some good lines to work with. As you suspected, it was a bit shaky, but it was very good for this type of window. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are not someone who has weeds or even if you have something more important to do than to see this great piece and enjoy it.
