An extremely good movie story of gay, bitter former teen stars who are now waiting for tables. The sexual ambiguities are explored here realistically and with an actual human face. This and throw a serial killer in the distance, and you have LOVE AND HUMAN REMAIN. A well-portrayed drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. The script is fluent and believable. The performances are well above average and the twists in the story are sharp. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not everyone's ideal idea of ​​a movie worthy of your time. Highly recommended.
