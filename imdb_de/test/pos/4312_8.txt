It's a good watch when you have time - do business with three friends who get into an unnecessary bar fight and get into serious trouble. They find themselves against a few shadowy people and can not handle it. Very, very disturbing depiction of Japan, the arbitrariness of modern life ... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboiler. Of course, I do not know Japanese. <br /> <br /> The only other Japanese movies I have seen were Kurosawa, which is different and far higher than this modern genre. So can not really compare. Otherwise, it's better to compare to most Hollywood blockbusters for story plot and build. <br /> <br /> taptieg24
