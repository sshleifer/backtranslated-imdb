I loved this movie, and I never knew it was that old. It came on the day I was born and now I am 19 years old. I still love this movie especially, especially songs like "My Mother" and "Boys" and "Girls of Rock N 'Roll" and I remember when I was 5 years old and my sister was 6 years old and my cousin (boy) was 6 years old, and we pretended to be the characters in the movie where I was Eloner and Janette, and my sister was Britany and My cousin was Alvin Simon and Theodore. and I miss her.The movie reminds me of the good times, as my cousin is old and me and my sister, we will not forget the chipmunk of the chipmunk movie I still remember the songs and the words well, though I remember I have not seen this movie for 12 years, but now I'm starting to love it again ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS AND CHIPETTES <3 <3 <3 <3
