If you think this movie is full of action and captivates you from the beginning, do not look at it. But if you like those kind of meditative films that stay in your mind for a while, until you learn the details, you'll love it. Do not get me wrong, there is something to do, and there are things that do not happen in the usual way. <br /> <br /> Basically, the storyline is in a post-apocalyptic world in which everyone struggles to survive in his or her own way. In this fight they lost the ability to speak ... I do not want to write anymore so as not to spoil the movie for you, but trust me if you love SF writers like Lem or Capec or even some of Orson Scott Card this movie.
