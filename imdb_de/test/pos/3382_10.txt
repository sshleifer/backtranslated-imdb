This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has all tragedy and happiness, love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy. <br /> <br /> The greatest casting I've ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were first-rate in this film. <br /> <br /> If you see part 1, you want to see everything. Some of my friends saw a part of the movie at home and bought the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a Civil War fanatic, but this movie has interested my grandchildren in history. Any movie that can make children learn history is great. I have books I, II & III and when the girls come up from Florida every year, they want to see North and South.
