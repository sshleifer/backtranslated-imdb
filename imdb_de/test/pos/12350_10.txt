One Dark Night has a typical teen horror movie with a twist. The ultra-brooding music and the atmosphere of gothic and claustrophobic contribute significantly to this little film. Meg Tilly is excellent as "Julie" and leads us through the maze of the mausoleum, which gives a feeling of foreboding and loneliness. The other teenagers are just as effective in their roles as Melissa Newman, the film's ultimate heroine. The special effects are excellent, albeit outdated. This film is heavily overlooked, but that may be good, so it has never been destroyed by endless sequels. There's a big, dark magic in this movie. Once you are tapped, you really get it and you have fun. The double DVD is available although the original negative could not be found to restore the movie. Maybe one day it will be localized. I think, in a sense, the carbon stains in some parts of the film help, giving it an old schoolability and in the end to be unexpected, when suddenly many effects occur. <br /> <br /> The second disc has a rough cut / alternate version with a temp score version of the movie that tells more about the fall of two girls, very poe-ish ("The Cask of Amontillado" comes to a close) new kind to mind!) Also great ending tension in the dark crypt opening. I was not sure if it had hit the mainstream crowd, but it definitely worked for me and was extremely scary. There is also a documentary that is interesting because it contains information about what was going on at the time with the actors, the crew, the director and the author. Open material, then current logos, discussions about scenes and scenes, rehearsals. Very unique, that stuff exists for a little movie back then.
