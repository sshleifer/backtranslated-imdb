This early film by the future Goreme master Lucio Fulci is a very good supplement to the Giallo subgenre. In rural Italy, it plays a serial killer of children. Add a set of characters known to fans of Giallo Cinema to the mix? a lunatic, a newspaper reporter, an ineffective police, a sexy siren, a priest, a dumb girl, a mentally retarded loner, etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early '70s. <br /> <br /> Uncommon For a Giallo, the victims in this case are little boys, which is different from the more typical women in the danger area. The fact that children are the target of the madman only serves to make things a little more uncomfortable. Fulci bumps the envelope a bit and heads off into a gorgeous, outrageous UnPC scene where a boy is exposed to the inappropriately paid attention of a sexy naked young woman (Barbara Bouchet) to whom he delivers a drink. She shows up openly and actively invites the youngster to beat her; Finally, he asks him if he wants to go to bed with her. Although she clearly plays with him, it is still an unusual scene. Admittedly, there are one or two unintentionally funny dialogues, but it is beautifully photographed and Barbara Bouchet exudes a high degree of self-confident sex appeal. An outstanding scene. Even if you feel a bit wrong when you see it! <br /> <br /> Together with Barbara Bouchet, Florinda Bolkan's other outstanding achievement comes from a madman who is accused of murdering the children. She is not directly responsible, but it remains up to the viewer to decide whether or not his black magic could have triggered the subsequent murder rush. Regardless, she is chased by a lynch mob and a chain whip, while a car radio radiates rock music. This scene is very strong and unpleasant. His wickedness points to the path that Fulcis's career would take later. Despite the visceral impact of the above-mentioned murder, it may come as a bit of a surprise that the other killings are either bloodless or off-screen. The only other death scene comparable to the lynch mob is the downfall of the killer at the end of the film, though this sequence is somehow stupid. The plot is confused and flooded with red pegs, though personally I found the killer's identity somewhat predictable. However, this weakness is less problematic on subsequent visits. Like most Gialli, Do not Torture A Duckling is great to see again. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is well done with impressive camerawork, solid acting and effective music by Riz Ortolani. Especially good is a recurrent unaccompanied female vocals that sound like they came from a distant hill. Obviously, Fulci made cruel horror movies, but here he shows talent for a more restrained material. It's still wild stuff and is highly recommended to fans of Giallo Cinema.
