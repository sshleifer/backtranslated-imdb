THE SEA INSIDE (2004) **** Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Joan Dalmau, Alberto Jim√©nez, Tamar Novas, Francesc Garrido, Jose Maria Pou, Alberto Amarilla, Nicolas Fernandez Luna: Alejandro Amenabar ) <br /> <br /> An inspirational story of a living death; Bardem is great <br /> <br /> The real life story of the Spanish four-epidemic legend Ramon Sampedro and his request to fulfill his desire for euthanasia through the right to die can not be considered as a possible source of inspiration, but this film is accurate that. <br /> <br /> Sampedro (excellently played by Bardem) was a virile, energetic young man when he functioned on his limbs after a tragic diving accident (who was shocked in a flashback with a visceral jerk of the senses) Lost for nearly thirty years in bed paralyzed, while his loving family took care of all his needs. Although his motor skills were almost zero, his mind was very active and proved to be very skilled as an inventor, poet, author and artist who kept him busy until he could no longer bear the thought of living longer in his stunted condition. <br /> <br /> Enter the beautiful lawyer Julia (the ethereal Rueda, who is a great match with Bardem, as if she were a soul mate). He is instructed to see through Sampedro's last wish to end his life, and in turn becomes an adjutant's camp when he begins to open up, as never before. Not much time has passed and Julia begins to investigate the past of her indictment, discovering many letters hidden by his family. When confronted by Julia Ramon, he initially hesitates to discuss anything with her, but he agrees that this can help his case and turn the project into a book that's in the process. a memoir / biography in the form of poetry and prose in the free style. <br /> <br /> The film is a heartbreaking story of the human mind and how love triumphs in heartbreak over many forms, including Ramon's unusual love for a completely alien person named Rosa (Duenas) alone One parent sees him One day he sees him on television, inspiring her to cycle to his remote farmhouse in Spain, to meet him and possibly change his mind about the end of his life. Filmmaker Amenabar, who co-wrote Gil the Co with Mateo An intriguing screenplay infuses fantasy into the mix as Ramon imagines him magically leaving his bed and flying through rural landscapes to the later sea where he lived many years ago suffered the cruel turn of fate that has held him captive for three decades. The film is not an absolute downer with a clever joke and occasionally a humorous tone that does not diminish the effect of the story's final storyline. Kudos to the remarkable make-up job of James and Jo Allen, who use the vibrant Bardem as an aging man to earn an Acadamy Award. <br /> <br /> Bardem and Rueda deserve Oscar nominations as two people who have so much in common and although Rueda's Julia is married to a loving, in love husband, a couple is so matched that it's impossible for you were never together at the beginning. This is just one of the atrocities that is true, but not the movie as a whole; It is a must and one of the best of the year.
