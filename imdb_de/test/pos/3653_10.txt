A love work. Every frame is perfect for you and grabs you. Then sheer emotion and storytelling lead through a dream that stays with you long after the movie is over. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are part of the emotional driving of the characters. I saw this movie at 2 festivals and got standing ovations on every show. The remarkable storytelling goes beyond nationality and language and I felt part of the drama that took place before me. The casting is as perfect as it gets. Vijay Raaz, Camille and Benoit each hold their own. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates good cinema. I can not wait to release this movie commercially.
