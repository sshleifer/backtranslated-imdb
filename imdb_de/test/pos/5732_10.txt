My local PBS station WHY Philadelphia recently showed "The Elegant Universe". After three hours of banging my brain, I learned about wormholes, quantum mechanics and parallel realities, as well as alternative universes. The last hour of the show dealt with "String Theory" Physics, a semi-new branch of physics that not only makes possible but also makes possible many ideas of science fiction. With the "string theory" it sounds like wormholes, alternative realities and alternative schedules are possible and it could only be a matter of time before we get the knowledge to use them new information for someone who is familiar with the topic , I found the show very interesting and informative. It was very understandable for anyone who is getting familiar with this topic.
