Ponyo is a beautiful animated film with dark undertones. It contains a childish story of longing and love with ecological implications, but it is not preaching. Hayao Miyazaki has combined Andersen's Little Mermaid with the myths of Japan and his typical steam punk flights, and the result is very rewarding. There are some terrifying moments of storms and floods by the sea, but they are exciting and not terrible. <br /> <br /> If you've always wanted to walk along the shore with the waves, ride a jellyfish as a lift Turn yourself completely or make a friend for life. Ponyo is a fable for you.
