Now and then you stumble upon a movie that surprises you, and this one is one of them. On the surprise scale, this would be considered a shared hot tub with Jessica Alba, while a band consisting of Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Phil Lynott, and Keith Moon plays their music for the night. The reason this movie will surprise you is that, for the scant budget (Â£ 8,000), it made something very smooth by a group of colleagues who just wanted to try it out and easily looks 100 times more budget. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple: A mercenary crew carrying a dangerous prisoner through space is attacked and forced to overthrow land on a nearby, desolate planet. After some checks, the planet not only does not exist for star charts, but they are not alone, it seems, and something very unfriendly begins to choose one after the other. It sounds like very standard alien sci-fi mixing elements. Predator and Pitch Black, but all that makes them feel fresh and original. <br /> <br /> Filming in this location is fantastic if you make the most of Balmeddie Beach in Aberdeen and you feel like you really are a foreign world. The seemingly never-ending sand dunes and the sophisticated lighting effects give a very dark feeling. They really believe that the crew is stranded on a strange world. The action sequences are also outstanding, the opening attack on the freighter shows what special effects can be achieved on a budget, and the firefights and the breathtaking final show the ingenuity of the film. <br /> <br /> As far as the mercenary team is concerned, the cast is different. For a low budget independent film, the casting was done here through local media and it seems that they have selected some potential stars for the future. Local bodybuilder Mike Mitchell, though not a natural actor, joins his role as Arnie Esq leader of the mercenaries. From the rest of the cast, there are two outstanding achievements: Patrick Wright as Deputy McNeal and Scott Ironside as the rough and ready engineer Vince. Both have some of the best lines in the film and Scott brings a bit of humor to the movie with his performance. Patrick offers a well-rounded performance as cool ice on top. <br /> <br /> Director Mark Stirton can be very proud of what he has achieved and shows that Scottish cinema does not have to be all "Kilts and Ceilidhs" "Slums and Drugs" Scottish films can be fresh, imaginative and above all fun do. This film is Scottish (with a northeast flair) at its core and praises the actors and directors for keeping the accents intact, adding to the charm of the piece. Although the budget constraints occasionally show (the only mistake I could find) that is to be expected. This movie, its characters and crew deserve all the success they get, and more. I wish Mark and his crew every success and their careers is a career you can keep a close eye on. <br /> <br /> Rating - 9/10 The first Scottish science fiction is brave, fresh and imaginatively triumphant. <br /> <br /> Film reviews, news and opinions like no other as well as the Kick Ass biweekly podcasts. <br /> <br /> www.fightrunner.co.uk <br /> <br /> contact@fightrunner.co.uk
