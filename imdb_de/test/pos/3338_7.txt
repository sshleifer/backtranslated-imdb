George Sanders, who plays the saint for the last time, does a good job with a good script - with the usual good RKO cast. It's also a Non-Charteris story, full of murders and good, clean fun. <br /> <br /> Thread 1: In New York, Templar police inspector in New York is surrounded by a corruption scandal and disappointed - ST comes from London to try to fix things. Nice and easy so far - but is there really more than $ 90,000 in the world? Thread 2: Another story about a woman who took revenge on the man who murdered her brother. Wendy Barrie does well to push some evil men and make the saint fall in love with them. Including a villain who was under their direct protection and in Fernack's basement - there is a scary attitude of him (dead and staring) and she in a car when they take him to where they have taken him. Paul Guilfoyle as Pearly Gates must have been homosexual - witnessing the dressing gown in the beginning and ST's later seductive comment that he thought of keeping him as a pet - and so did "Palm Springs"! Fernack was played by Jonathan Hale as usual, but this time with such deflated deflation that he really needed a good shot from Templer to cheer him up. The Hays office also made sure you got the picture right, all the threads are tied up with no kinky bits. It's worth watching all those who like it, but if the version of Val Kilmer is your benchmark, then do not bother.
