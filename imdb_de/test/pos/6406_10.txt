Key West was too short "date TV" for my family. I'd drop by Red Lobster and pick up a party tray for the night it was in. The irony of the situation was that I was working for a Fox Affiliate at the time and everyone on the station was angry that they were not renewing the show. Everyone in this cast was excellent. Fisher Stevens ... perfect. Who should not identify with an "everyman" who dreams of being a writer in Key West? Jennifer Tilly has always been remarkable (and she is one of the best players in a Texas Hold'em player). You can still find the pilot episode on YouTube. I wish they would post the hurricane one. This episode alone should have won Emmy and the rest of the cast.
