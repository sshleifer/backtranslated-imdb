Anyone who has watched the trailer for this movie would be forgiven for making this movie a thoroughly comical comedy. In fact, it's a light-hearted, if not overly funny game that revolves around a few road workers. <br /> <br /> There are many mistakes in the movie. The script and plot are faint and the love aspect of the story is strangely boring. Nevertheless, it is very pleasant, especially thanks to the two main roles Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller. These two good actors, especially Carlyle, are always good to see and there is good chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Director Jake Scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers Ridley and Tony have given us films like Alien, Blade Runner, True Romance and recently GI Jane and enemy of the state. His debut is focused on energy and enthusiasm, which keeps the movie going, although the results may not have worked so well without the strong cast that he put together. It's fun to go through an hour and a half, then you could get a lot worse make as Plunkett and Macleane. On the other hand, if you have a subtle, historically correct and thought-provoking feeling, go somewhere else. 10.7.
