I'm amazed that, of all the reviews I've looked at, no one has noticed one of the main points of this movie, or at least how I've seen it. It seems to be a great homosexual fantasy, camp wear, a transfigured naked Ferdinand, a certain sexual tension between Ariel and Prospero, and as a final climax, a group of men in tight sailor suits dance the hornpipe. Once you get used to it, this approach offers you all kinds of fantastic scenes and pictures. The sight of an innocent Ariel being pulled towards a disgusting naked Sycorax to perform "her earthy and hideous orders" is one of the darkest I've ever seen in a Shakespearean movie. However, at the end of the film I was tired of the style and the last hornpipe dance was just too much for me. Overall, it's an interesting interpretation of the piece.
