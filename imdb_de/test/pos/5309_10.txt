This confuses me about critics and their opinions. I usually assume what critics say about a movie, usually before I see a movie. <br /> <br /> But I saw this movie without knowing it. mainly because of the cast. Kevin Spacey and Don Cheadle are two of the most acclaimed and in my opinion best actor. And Ryan Gosling is also on a fast escalating journey. His reality and humanity, which he radiates in most of his portrayals, really makes the audience believe in the character and what happens to him. He is really my favorite actor of my generation. I have always found jena malone pretty sweet since donnie darko, and if she decides to continue to play similar roles, I can not complain. <br /> This movie really moved me. I believed it. The acting was first class. as you would expect. the actual movie left the audience with the ultimate goal of a good movie; Reflection and reflection following the final guy roll. I think I have to look at it again to decipher how this movie was critically abused. I know that their ratings must be taken with a pinch of salt. At least I know it now.
