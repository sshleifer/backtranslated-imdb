I'm not a fan of Sean Penn, but unlike my German colleague, whose review appears here, I think he was perfectly cast as a neurotic, drunken figure in this movie. He has perfected every nuance and reminded me of several acquaintances who had a similar taste in the "leisure chemistry". I saw this movie 10 to 15 years ago, and this is the only part of the film that has been etched into my mind indelibly. I do not say it often, but in this case I will: Bravo, Sean Penn! As far as history is concerned, this is a fact, and it is a tragedy that people sell the secrets of their land to their enemy at the time. Again, Penn has shown what you can do if you disagree with the administration. Use the liberties you have paid with blood; Do not break the law.
