After his earlier film "Videodrome", which bears some resemblance to this film, director David Cronenberg ventures once again into the world of virtual reality, in which truth and fiction merge. It's Virtual Reality that has been taken to a whole new level. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a very original film that is well directed, but above all very well written. The film offers a fascinating and thought-out concept, which is brilliantly realized by director David Cronenberg. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a movie that constantly fools you. Just when you thought you had found something, another surprise awaits you around the corner. Things are never what you think, especially when the line between truth and fiction is explored. You never really know what the reality is and what the game world is, to the end. It makes the characters and events unpredictable and gives the movie a great ending that will make you even more thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> The film has a perfect kind of gameplay storytelling, mostly with its character appearances and their enigmatic events. You must first perform a specific step or task before you can continue in the world and find out what they are meant for in the game. The film knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism. without ever surpassing both. Storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible, although the film is not always easy to follow due to events, dialogues and unusual environments. <br /> <br /> But the movie is not just funny. I was actually surprised to see that "Videodrome" has a higher rating here. I thought it was a much more inaccessible and "funny" movie. The movie is still entertaining and has a good pace. It never allows the film to settle in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this movie perfect for people who usually do not see this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The film looks good, with subtle-looking special effects a great visual look that also brings the movie with a certain "gaming" feeling. <br /> <br /> The film is well-filled, with Jude Law in a role that you do not see very often, a shy, insecure person. It shows once again how versatile Law is as an actor and that he is far more than just a pretty Hollywood face. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also a great female lead. In big productions she has never played so many big parts, but with this movie she shows why she was still considered a great movie star anyway. The film also includes some other well-known actors in much smaller roles, such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe. <br /> <br /> A very original movie worth seeing, especially if you've seen "Videodrome" before <br /> <br /> 8/10
