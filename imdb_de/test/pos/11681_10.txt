The series of decay is amazing and the director PS can not earn enough to make these films. I'm a bit surprised that not many people have seen this or the other two, but it's worth exploring if you want to see the image of the punk in the transformative years between the late seventies and early eighties. The film opens with a breathtaking collection of clips played over Band X music. Many interviews with bands and punkers that provide insightful perspectives on what survival was like on the lower rung of the mainstream rock ladder. No internet, crappy jobs and all hostilities collide in this genre. For new kids who have never heard of these bands or are starting a band by themselves, this movie is a true rock lesson. All the band's performances (and there are many) are fantastic, especially FEAR, which amaze me time and time again. This and the second installment are amazing time capsules that provide those who care about a rare glimpse into the lives of these crazy people. It's true punk, as in the interview with Darby Crash's girlfriend, when they remembered a painter who had mysteriously / suddenly died in front of their house and it took a week to find out they were taking pictures next to the man and all, including The EMT's had a giggle, and in real-life the interviewer asks the friend, whether she is sad or upset, that this guy died while painting her house, the answer, "No, I hate painters." How about Black Flag, who rents her apartment / rehearsal room for $ 16 a month! My chin almost fell off at that moment as I rented a ten-in-ten cupboard to practice 400. Between Watching and Deadwood I Feel Like I Was Born In The Wrong Time The Old Way The people and bands involved in the movie paved the way for today's tougher music and they have it on their own Fashion done. Brilliant movie, ten stars, see part 2, also part 3, but I do not know what to say.
