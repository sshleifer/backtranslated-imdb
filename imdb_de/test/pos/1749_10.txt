People who know me say that I have a weakness for animated films. <br /> <br /> To be fair, these people have HALFES law and David Fleischer. <br /> <br /> You might think to yourself, "If it's so great, why did not I hear about it?" Fair question. This movie was released in the same week as the Pearl Harbor attacks. The inevitable bad timing made the film relatively dark. However, things are looking up, as it was finally released on DVD under the title "BUGVILLE". <br /> <br /> It's weird that the movie went through all that because it reflects the story itself. Although some people claim that the film is trying to send an environmental message (ugh), I personally believe that the main idea of ​​the film is perseverance through adversity and hard times (after all, the country had just pulled out of depression). , <br /> <br /> Our grasshopper hero Hoppity desperately wants to help his threatened community. Problem: Every time he tries it, either through the malady of others or through bad luck, he fails miserably ... and slowly begins to work out the contempt of the people he's trying to save. Although he does his best to maintain a positive attitude, he occasionally breaks down. Only through the encouragement and support of his friends can he get back on his feet and fight the good fight. Just a healthy reminder that when everything is said and done, no one is really self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> "Okay," you say. "It has a good message (actually two), does it really do that exceptionally well?" <br /> <br /> My Answer: Partially. <br /> <br /> It's not just the embassy that makes this film so special. It is the characterization. This is one of those movies where you can only see the personality of each actor in his animation. You almost do not even need the spoken lines. A good way to summarize everything is "energetic" or "living". Many films have used the selling point "loveable characters". Whenever I hear this line, I always think about this movie. <br /> <br /> The bad guys: Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito. Many films have "lovable" bad guys, but I do not think you'll find them as entertaining or adorable as these guys. Forget this 3 Stooges cartoon from the 60s. Swat and Smack are what comes closest to an animated version of Moe and Curly (but unfortunately not Larry) you'll ever find. Practically all funniest moments somehow include this gruesome couple. Yes, they are damn no-goodniks, but you are still interested in them. That's the power you only see from a really talented writer, director and crew. <br /> <br /> The film contains two short jokes about racial stereotypes (Native Americans and Chinese). I do not think they should be vicious. But they are still there. They did not bother me, but it would be unfair of me not to warn someone who might be disturbed by them. <br /> <br /> So if you share my weakness (and I think you do), try it here.
