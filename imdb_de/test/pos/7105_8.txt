The last of the episodes, except Abbott and Costello, hit Frankenstein, which was more or less a parody. This time counter Dracula (John Carridine) is at the center of finding a cure for his vampirism from a friendly Doc (Onslow Stevens) Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr) also appears in search of a cure. The good doctor has managed to cure Larry's werewolfism, but Dracula deceives the doctor and ends up defiling his blood, and makes the good doctor an insane lunatic (Glenn Strange) lying on a table, waiting for his current fix so he can mess things up. This was a kind of short film, about 70 minutes and some changes, but the action is here and the big actors are there too. Lionel atwill appears as a police inspector, here are some trifles, Lionel atwill appeared in Frankenstein's son, Frankenstein's spirit, Frankenstein meets the Wolfman and Frankenstein's house. and then this one If there was another one in the series, they would have included the creature from the Black Lagoon in the lineup. I give Dracula 8 out of 10.
