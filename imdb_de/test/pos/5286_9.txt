My husband pulled me to this movie because I was not interested in seeing an anime cartoon. I was absolutely thrilled with the simple story and the amazing animation. In a digital world where effects are generated by the computer, it was refreshing to see beautiful, imaginative, hand-drawn animations. The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a living fantasy land mixed with minimal reality. I have not seen any animation like this since I was a kid, and it's wonderful to see it endure and succeed. <br /> <br /> The actors delivering the voices in the English version were fantastic. The length of the film was PERFECT, especially for children who become curious in movies. All in all a wonderful experience that is very expensive to us these days.
