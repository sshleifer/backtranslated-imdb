But pretty old today. Otto Preminger made this film without the required registration certificate. It was enormously brave and risky as he could have lost his investment and his future. <br /> <br /> The film does not match the wonderful book and unfortunately has become Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra (and I have never been a fan of Frankie Machine before, is amazing in his performance, forgetting that Frank is up there, the realism he has to play in the role of a drug addict seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak, eternally great and talented, does not disappoint The role of devout outsider, always there for Frankie Supporting roles, especially a young, handsome and talented Darrin Mc Gavin Eleanor Parker plays Frankie Woman, is hopelessly incompetent, she swings from irritating to melodramatic and is way too over the top, an unforgettable feat. <br /> <br /> The stages are cheap, as if a strong gust of wind were blowing all over at times cheap in its cheap cheapness. <br /> <br /> The music was irritating, sometimes tapping, as if every nuance of the script (example: as Louie Frankie's fix from a drawer fetches) at a high decibel level must be underlined. 7 out of 10. Sinatra really deserves his Oscar nomination. Worth seeing.
