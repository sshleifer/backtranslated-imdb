I saw this movie in video form for the first time. Even on a television screen, the views were impressive. Seen on the big screen in its full splendor, it must have blown away the people. <br /> <br /> As one or two other comments have highlighted, the story of the early pioneers and how they could handle the problems of the terrain, etc. on the road to Oregon is as authentic as any movie can be. It turns out, then, that it is completely unnecessary to deal with the truth - something that today's filmmakers should pay attention to - reality is enough. The plot is based on the struggle of humans against the elements and hostilities natives. Subplots are few and simple. But the basic plot is enough. Elsewhere, I discussed Paramount's rivals on the big road, Fighting Caravans. Despite a more demanding plot and better actor, Fighting Caravans miss the stunning scenes. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail should be mandatory.
