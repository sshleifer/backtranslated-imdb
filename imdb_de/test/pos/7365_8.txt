Got this movie as a $ 5 deal from a local video store, and it was a very pleasant surprise. It's a collection of four interconnected stories built around four children who have just had a car accident and are waiting for someone to pick them up. They tell each other these stories to kill time, and occasionally frighten them with flashing lights and funny sounds that all come together to make an O. Henry-like ending that made me happy. A real find. Blood (and lots of it), breasts and beasts complete the whole thing pretty well ... Jacinda Barrett is worth the price alone. This is a goalkeeper - Jim Bob says, check it out. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, "Pumpkinhead" was also one of five options, and IMDB recommends this to anyone who likes "Campfire Tales." I'll look it up as soon as I have the opportunity to sit down and watch. Joyeux Samhain!
