I can recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be entertained. The direction, the acting and the story is brilliant. Definitely up with movies like Scarface and the Godfather. This movie makes your heart beat faster Casting was awesome. I would definitely borrow this movie. Damian Chapa deserves an Oscar for his acting and for the way he portrayed the life of a gangster -making.I loved it and I give it 10 stars. In one sentence, the only way to describe it is to make a film without flaws. Take a look at this movie and you'll see what I mean. 2 thumbs up !!!!!!!
