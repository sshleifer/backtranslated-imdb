In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of the animation with the release of the very first episode of their "Silly Symphonies" series "The Skeleton Dance." Iwerks and Disney have worked together since the early 20s in the animated series "Laugh-O-Gram" by Disney. Their friendship, however, suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer from a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks further developed his style and technique (and developed the character of Flip the Frog). While his work maintained the same high quality, it was not very popular and in 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. <br /> <br /> "Skeleton Frolics" from 1937 is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic "The Skeleton Dance", the film that gave it fame and fortune. Like this short film, he plays in a deserted cemetery where at midnight the creatures of the night come to life and start playing. The dead rise from their coffins, ready for the upcoming show, when a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begins to play a happy tune. It is not easy to be a bone-only musician because some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts. However, the band manages to show a good show and another group of skeletons starts to dance. Some of them face the same problems the orchestra was struggling with: It's hard to dance with loose body parts. Everything ends at dawn, and when the sun is about to rise, the skeletons race to their graves. <br /> <br /> Under the direction and animation of Ub Iwerks, "Skeleton Frolics" follows the set of "The Skeleton Dance" years ago, but with one key difference: I filmed the whole movie in Technicolor. The bright tonalities allowed Iwerks to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney, making depth and dynamics even better than before "The Skeleton Dance", although this is not necessarily a better movie, for starters, the movie is virtually identical to the one he did with Disney, the only difference being the music (more on that later) and the It looks beautiful, no doubt, but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal. <br /> <br /> However, it's not the unoriginality of the concept that is really hurt the movie (eventually Iwerks performs it) a wonderful path), but the fact that the musical melody Joe DeNat has created for the film is rather uninteresting and the charming elegance and quirky fun that Carl W. Stalling for "The Skeleton Dance" is missing. In other words, while DeNat's tune is effective and appropriate to the theme, it's easy to forget it quickly, while Stalling's song has a unique personality that makes it memorable. Since this is a musical film, this is of great importance, and the mediocrity of the music impairs the flawless animation of Iwerk. I personally think with better musical accompaniment "Skeleton Frolics" would be as fondly remembered as "The Skeleton Dance", though it's not so groundbreaking as it's still a fun movie. <br /> <br /> It's nice Unfortunately, most of the work that Iwerks did after leaving Disney is forgotten due to his poor performance, however, it has to be said that he lacked quality when Iwerks gained the popularity of Disney or Butcher (Disney's main antagonist) lacked the films of these companies. It was probably just bad luck that the man who had failed Disney's mouse for the first time fell victim to Disney. Despite its inadequacies, "Skeleton Frolics" is a very funny and visually stunning movie that, while not the most original and freshest movie (you just have to think of "The Skeleton Dance" while watching the movie), it reminds us but definitely because Iwerk's skeletons are still here to follow us and inspire us. <br /> <br /> 8/10
