I loved this show. I was waiting for it to come out on DVD. Does anyone know how to get the show on DVD? I contacted Lifetime TV and a few others and nothing. Please let me know if there is a way to release this series on DVD. I would be in the first place to buy it. I was really excited about this show. I do not understand how many other TV programs are available on DVD, but not Any Day Now. I am sure that there are many of us who would like to have this series on DVD or even on VHS. I thought about contacting the production company. Has anyone else tried to contact someone for this information?
