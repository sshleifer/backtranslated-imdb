God bless Joe D'Amato ... I love Italian horror, cheese (film), sci-fi, etc. This train was admittedly a bit harder to see, but another funny BAD movie. <br /> <br /> I like how people put up a negative review with "I usually like bad movies, but ...". No, but that was a bad movie FOR people who love bad movies. It's one of my best bad movies. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keefe was a Conan of a poor man, but oh what a joke. Who can not enjoy a primitive atomic bomb, a hang glider and a cheesy rubber monster? It's okay to hate this movie if you only like Hollywood tricks like "Titanic" or "Pretty Woman", but if you really think you really love bad movies, look at this. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that can be rented for a beer or if you have a few buddies and are looking for a little pointless pleasure. <br /> <br /> My rating 8/10.
