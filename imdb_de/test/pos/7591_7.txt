Canthony is right that this little bit is just an excuse to hear a very young Judy Garland (fourteen years!) Sing with a slightly older (one year old) Deanna Durbin. But I do not have to agree with everything he or she has said, including the duration - which is only about ten minutes and not twenty (a single reeler). <br /> <br /> The song is obviously not her best; But it is pleasant and definitely worth the ten minutes to watch Turner. The duet with Durbin is pretty interesting: two conflicting styles that are still pretty well intermeshed. <br /> <br /> The short is just one way, but it's not nearly as bad as the other reviewer said. Honestly, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Dafydd from Hugh
