I saw this movie as a younger child for the first time. My sister had told me about it and I thought it was more of a children's movie. However, it remains an incredible movie. It's true that the theme behind the movie is a ruff, but it's also true that this movie will never stop touching your heart. <br /> <br /> I was only 6 years old when I saw it for the first time and yesterday, 7 years later, I saw it again. For the first time in a long time. Even after I knew how it ended, I knew that I had seen it a billion times that I cried like a tiny little baby. When I saw it a few years ago, I finally got the idea and the seriousness of the movie. So I stopped it for a while. But yesterday I did not change the channel, I saw it. In the end, I was amazed at how much it still made me laugh, cry, think, and above all Mericals. I did not believe for a long time and this movie got me out of my shell and opened my heart. This movie did not just influence. I was also very impressed by the actors. Especially Bobby. If you want to see this movie for the first time, I suggest you to see it alone. With handkerchiefs. And be ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent side and the side that still has hope. This film touched my soul when I was only 6 years old, and even in this time of trying to figure out who I am, this film helped me to both understand what I do not want and still want to be in life.
