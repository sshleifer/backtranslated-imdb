Anyone who correctly identifies the opening images as God who kills himself without reading the end credits, certainly deserves a free ticket to a rest house in Transylvania. I would imagine that this is a favorite movie in the "Twin Peaks" Dark Lodge movie night, if there is time. I thought a better title could have been, "How much fun can you have with someone who is almost dead in the forest with Neolithic technology?" The answer seems to be pretty much. So, despite the stupid "God Kill," the arrogance (an apt phrase from an earlier letter), the clearer "Alistair Crowley - Hi, I'm the beast, do it!" as the Christian cosmology (I can not believe that another observer had the stubbornness to see the Judeo-Christian Bible in it) ... despite all this ... this is a daring, important work that most people should not see , I was both impressed and come out that it was ever done.
