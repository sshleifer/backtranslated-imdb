I love this program. It is really unique. I had the impression that there would be more seasons. In anticipation of Series 2, I recently purchased Series 1 to revisit them to update them when Part 2 starts. After seeing it, I was excited and demanding more, so I came to the site to see the schedule for the sequel. I am really disappointed that there are no plans for a second series, as I was looking forward to seeing more of this story. I think they really dropped the ball. There was a lot of storyline to build on, and many unanswered questions. I am very unhappy now and I hope that you will reconsider your decision and record the story where it left off.
