We have a character called Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She is nice, friendly, smiles often, but in a strange way is brutally honest. Evie also has a secret. Her idiotic sister recited original poetry, which inspires the community to write her sister. Unfortunately, it is Evie's poetry. While her mother is happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in Evie, Evie is just trying to figure out what she really wants to do. <br /> <br /> What you should be aware of when watching this movie is who Evie really is. For such a brutally honest person, who does not mind telling Ivy League guys she does not respect them, it would seem strange that she could make a lie. For someone who is so happy and happy she is quite emotionless on certain issues. These are not character weaknesses, they are action development, and they mean much more than they seem at first glance. <br /> <br /> Mostly this is a melodrama: A character is lying, the characters of the other characters drive them through drama, as relationships are endangered. But as far as writing is concerned, it is very fresh and courageous. Acting helps writing very well (maybe the idiot-minded sister could have been better played), and it's a real pleasure to see her. <br /> <br /> The direction and the cinematography are not so good. They are acceptable and Evie's world is woven in color and light, which gives some very nice pictures, but not very consistent. It's not so much a low output error, but within that value is real storytelling and a real concern for the characters. It's not a perfect movie, but certainly a fun one. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
