Choose your destiny: The terrible types of the fourth form, who play practical jokes with axes, or the ... um ... well-developed sixth-form girls, who some time ago found cigarettes, gin, sex, and as easily discovered men in be led astray. The problem is that one sentence comes with the other. They are all in St. Trinian's, the remarkably relaxed English girls' school run by Principal Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). Miss Fritton likes to emphasize: "In other schools, girls are sent unprepared into a merciless world, but if our girls leave here, the merciless world must be prepared." Miss Fritton sounds like a mix of Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt and definitely has Sim's funny and deadpan comic genes. <br /> <br /> In The Belles of St. Trinian's, a sly, chaotic comedy by the team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, St. Trinian's is, as usual, on the verge of financial disaster. The salvation may be imminent, however, when a wealthy sheikh sends his daughter to fourth grade and receives a proper english education. The sheikh is also a horse owner and one of his prize racers, arab boy, is being trained for a race near the school. It's only a matter of time before the girls of the fourth grade form a racing and rely on Arab Boy. Fritton adds the remaining funds to the pool. (Much of the fourth-grade money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, then bottle it down and drop it on Flash Harry (George Cole), a Cockney fixer, for distribution.) "It has something .. "Not me, I know exactly what," says Miss Fritton about collecting the stuff, "but send a few bottles to my room.") However, Fritton has a brother, Clarence Fritton (of some) Coincidence of the casting is also Alastair Sim), a bookmaker who not only packs a horse on another horse, but also has a daughter. And he has brought the precocious Arabella into sixth form to keep him up to date. Soon the sixth form has kidnapped Arab Boy, the fourth form has recaptured the horse, Flash Harry has teamed up with Miss Fritton, the sixth girls are determined that Arab Boy will leave the second floor of St. Trinian, Clarence and not in Homburg-clad gang has arrived, parents are riding up to their parents' day and the Ministry of Education has arrived in the person of a very good inspector. In St. Trinian's the war breaks out. It's hard to say what's more dangerous, the African spears or the flour bombs. <br /> <br /> Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton shows a tour de force performance. Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a handsome bosom who likes long dresses with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with lots of feathers. She takes everything with her, even a fourth banging on something in chemistry lessons and hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. "Oh darling, I told Bessie to be careful with this nitroglycerin!" She firmly believes that St. Trinian's is "a gay arkadia of happy girls". Sim was one of the great eccentric actors in the UK. Apart from the chaos of all the little (and not so small) girls doing horrible things, he brings a lot of joy to the movie.
