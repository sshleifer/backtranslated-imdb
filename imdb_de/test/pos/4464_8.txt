TUNE TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulci's earlier (and frankly, in terms of storyline, better ...) films - and although he is not the typical "bloodbath" Fulci is known for, this is still a unique and enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds a small town that is home to a series of child murders. Among the colorful characters involved in the investigation - either as suspects or as "investigators" (or in some cases both), are the city police, a small reporter, a handsome and rich drug addict. a young priest and his mother, an old man practicing witchcraft and his female charge, a mentally handicapped citizen and a deaf / dumb little girl. All these people are interwoven in the plot to create some twists and turns until the real killer is revealed to Gore Film. Although it contains elements of both, it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with darker themes and a few scenes of violence (though nothing is as strong as in later works by Fulci). This is a well-written movie with many twists that advised me to finish. Recommended for fans of fanatics and murder mysteries, or for anyone who wants to watch Fulcis non-splattering films - but do not despair. DO NOT TORTURE still has more to offer than a fair share of violence and sleaze. Some may be deterred by the subject of child murder, and a female protagonist has a strange habit of attacking very young boys, which is also a kind of confusion - but if that kind of material does not bother you, then definitely take a look. 8.5 / 10
