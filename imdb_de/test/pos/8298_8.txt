I also mean it seriously, I do not get me wrong, if you have no inclination for this kind of Z-grade, cracking creature (why should you watch is my first thought?), Then it's a rating of about 3 to 4 of 10 tops, but for me it is a special nonsense that leads me back to a great time in my childhood. You know the kind, the memories you never leave. Under the cloak, Doug McClure and Peter Cushing are eagerly submerging themselves to fight a variety of creatures and subhuman species. And guys! Now we are all grown up and can admire the wonder of Caroline Munro and her huge cleavage the most. No wonder my older brother really wanted to take me to the cinema to see this one! <br /> <br /> Yes, the effects are bad, men in suits, strings, the parrot monsters ringing around and rubber frogs like dingies are very amusing. And yes, Cushing and a surprisingly chubby McClure seem like they're really mesmerized by the evil meyhas in the "core" of our movie. But it does not matter, crazy and clunky and in glorious colors. At The Earth's Core is a recollection of a special time before the ILM when kids like me wound around the block to see such joyous nonsense. 8.10
