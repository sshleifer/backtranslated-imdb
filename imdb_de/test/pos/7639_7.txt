I gave these films a 7 out of 10 points. I think the general dislike of this movie is because people do not really understand the conspiracy. If you think about the plot, this movie really makes sense, it never gives you a damning explanation. It's true that the special effects are below average and the budget seems low, but I think the originality of the conspiracy holds you back. People say that the vampire genre is exaggerated and clich√©d Not your usual vampire strip. It's a dream / reality story with a vampire / eternal life spit. I loved it. The only thing that kept me from rating it higher was the lack of special effects and that personally I do not like movies that most people have accents. But as I said, if you really get the plot, this is not a bad movie.
