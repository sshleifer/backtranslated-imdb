Short summary of the book: Boy, Billy Tepper, about 12 years old, is the school's biggest troublemaker, and if he's kicked out of another school, he's sent to a boarding school. His upscale boys' school in Switzerland (or somewhere else) is taken over by Arab terrorists, which is why I'm not really sure. Billy has no friends and likes to use his laptop to hack into his school's database. With the help of two teachers he thwarted the terrorists' plans and saved the entire school. The book was not bad, but soooooo clich√©d. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie; They turned Arab terrorists into Cuban terrorists and made Billy about 17 and the leader of his group of friends. They like to get into trouble, but normal teenage things. This movie was believable. Maybe not realistic, but the characters are real. You can watch Billy, Joey and the rest of the boys and see real children who behave the way they did (or at least want to). <br /> <br /> Great action scenes. Things are not going as planned on both sides. To topple the terrorists was messy and good people were injured. I will not say who, but it's heartbreaking (I know, I use that word very often). Sean Astin is excellent. As a teenager, he usually played the stupid best friend. This movie proved again that he could play the leading man, the kid, or whatever. The only performance that might have surpassed him was Wil Wheaton's, who played the only son of a mafia man from New Jersey. He hated his father and everything he stood for. (Far from Wesley Crusher) Usually I see this genre of film for emotional reasons to have fun. but no toy soldiers. The plot flows, the dialogue is usually credible. I can not imagine a single moment yelling at the TV "Oh, that would not happen like that" A great movie that should be in every collection.
