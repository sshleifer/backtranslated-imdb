I have to tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of Rose McGowan. I think that this part definitely worked ... actually pretty good. The movie was also very good. Some parts of this movie are really good. <br /> <br /> The movie also has great action. The puzzle is pretty hard to understand and Rose [McGowan] plays "Oscar-worthy" towards the end of the movie, but I do not want to reveal anything. Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow are also great in the movie, along with several other stars. <br /> <br /> If you like mysteries, action movies or just a rose, I think you want this movie.
