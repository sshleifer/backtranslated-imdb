"Death Wish 3" returns Charles Bronson as the one-time vigilante Paul Kersey, who is now retired. Yeah right. Before Long Kersey is back on his old path, taking over a rundown part of the city (New York, by the way). This time it's war, so Kersy pulls out the big guns (literally) for this case. I came up with a movie. This movie is actually a lot of fun, especially for a few liners, and of course the villains are dying or being badly hurt creatively, which is always a good thing. The violence is not so personally one, it's obviously on a much larger scale, as if you were bombarding the victims remotely instead of fighting one-to-one. This movie has a lighter tone than the first movie 2, which makes filming easier, it's more escapism than anything else. Sometimes cheesy and pseudo-inspiring, but tube scenes fall flat. They should have left the original "Death Wish" alone without sequels, but since they did not, they should have stopped here. 8.10
