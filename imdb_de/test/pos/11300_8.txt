I heard about this movie a long time ago and found it on ebay for five dollars. I did not expect much, but I was surprised. It's a story about a boy in love and a girl in love trying to escape a bad king who wants the girl to be alone and plays in a huge castle. It reminds me of ICO for PS2, since some shots gave you a feeling of dizziness. This movie is crazy! It is hard to believe that such an original animated feature was made in 1952. Also, the king was probably one of the scariest characters I've seen in a long time, with a female gait, weird eyes (usually crossed) and a soft butt spooky voice. The only problem I had with the movie was that the boy and the girl had no personality and few lines, except that they demanded Lord. wonderbird (a big, talking green bird) to rescue her. The animation was fantastic in most areas, but some scenes lacked some cells that sucked. It's unbelievably original with flying police and huge 'Mechs and sometimes even laughing out loud. It is a pity that this title is so obscure because it is really a good movie. Take a look at it.
