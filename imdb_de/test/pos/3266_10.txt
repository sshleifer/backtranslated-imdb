A refreshing black comedy featuring some of Australia's finest. In the same way that Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels conquered the funny side of London gangsters, Two Hands ripped the underworld of Sydney. It would not be so funny if it were not so close to the bone. <br /> <br /> An Australian classic. If Australia could pull more rabbits like this hat, there could be a movie industry worth keeping an eye on.
