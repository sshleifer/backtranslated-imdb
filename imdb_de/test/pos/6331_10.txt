This is not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word, but it's more rewarding than any movie that's full of laugh but no content. I do not think Bergman's films can easily be classified in narrow genres, even the lightest ones are quite complex. Despite its light touch, this film raises a number of problems related to marriage and its inadequacies, and what happens when the flames begin to die. But the atmosphere of the film is extraordinary, you almost wish it did not end. I must admit that the fifties miner had carried me along, having learned most of his later groundbreaking efforts. Before Nykvist, Sydow, Ulman, etc., the master produced some of the richest, warmest and most touching films I have ever seen. Although it is a long time, I have only seen this kind of love for people in their complexity in Fellini's films of the same time. An hour of love and a smile of a summer night are well worth seeing for Bergman fans to get a complete picture of the man's abilities and those who love the cinema with their hearts. Rest in peace!
