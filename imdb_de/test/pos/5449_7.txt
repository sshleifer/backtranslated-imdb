I remember that this movie got a lot of flak from critics when it was new. Letterman and Leno themselves had objections. Letterman called it (paraphrased) the biggest waste of film he had ever seen, and Leno disagreed with the simple depiction of his person. But Letterman had John Michael Higgins as a guest on his show, so it seemed he was not taking anything personally. A DVD reissue with opinions and similar statements from those involved might be interesting, though I suspect that the days when the evening talk show wars have captured the nation are gone and will not come back soon for Leno's imitation, but it did also not shopping. You never raised yourself above the caricature, and I never simply accepted it as an actor. By comparison, Paul Sorvino as Kissinger in Oliver Stone's "Nixon" comes to mind as an impersonator, who may have seemed ridiculous in the first moments, but seemed plausible at least after the first moments of amusement. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the show for me was Treat Williams as Michael Ovitz. Williams' speech to Letterman was not as good as Alec Baldwin's entrance (and quick exit) as Blake in Glengerry Glen Ross. They could have done more with Johnny's role in all of this. I know he was largely uninterested in the events featured in this film, and most viewers will be familiar with his reputation, so Johnny Carson needs no introduction. But more about the reasons why Dave and Jay and all comedians are so revered that Johnny has given this film the substance that he lacks as a gossip. <br /> <br /> I think I should read the book ... <br /> <Rich Little imitates Johnny Carson not much more than Rich Little imitates Johnny Carson. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you something after seeing this movie and seeing either the Letterman or the Leno show. All I want to do is break up my Johnny Carson DVDs and the to see real thing.
