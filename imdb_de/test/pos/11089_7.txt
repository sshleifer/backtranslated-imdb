Director John Schlesinger's tense and wild film tells the true story of Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee, two young men who sold government secrets of the United States to the Soviet Union in the early 1970s. Timothy Hutton plays Christopher Boyce very competently. He is a young man who is very disillusioned with the devious activities of the CIA in Allied Australia. Sean Penn, who under the drug use of Andrew Daulton Lee, is outstanding. <br /> <br /> The competent and professional management of Schlesinger and some good acting make "The Falcon and the Snowman" a spy thriller that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> Tuesday, February 4, 1992 - Video
