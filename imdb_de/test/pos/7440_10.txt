Hey, I think this movie was great and it had great graphics. I was glad they used Final Fantasy 7. I think the game was the best I've ever played. This is a great movie and I loved it You should use Final Fantasy 7 or Final Fantasy 10 again. Both are very good by: Tyler Sheena I hope you can email me if you have any further information, if there are other people who read this. It's animated, but it looks pretty realistic. It has great fighting scenes that I did not see as fast as if I was fighting in a movie for a long time. The game Final Fantasy 7 is really great too, not good graphics, but it's really fun and challenging
