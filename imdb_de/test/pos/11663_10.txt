it was very sensitive very deep. It's my darling if you can not see a movie deeper than this incredible movie. Susan Sarandon made her role as a mature mental actress and she recognized her role. She deserves the award. She convinced me with a nun. The music was very impressive and sensitive. I really liked this deep masterpiece.
