This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! How anyone can tap this movie confuses my imagination! Especially the performances of Gooding and Harris were just spectacular, especially Gooding. That is the only way I can describe the spectacle: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play and dismantle such a figure. then you see Gooding and his performance was magical. As far as the plot is concerned, since it is based on a true person, it goes where the characters' lives go. For all action freaks it may be a bit slow, but then it's not an action movie. I definitely give this movie a 10th. He deserves nothing less!
