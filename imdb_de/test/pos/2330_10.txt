LCDR Tom Dodge, although he is known as the Renegade and Outsider among submariners (* Note: Maverick does not mean "Tom Cruise." Maverick means "nonconformist.") Actually a secret service agent for the Vice Admiral of his submarine Fleet. The Vice Admiral is worried about our old friends, the Russians, who ran yard sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Libya, North Korea or Iraq would love to grab this baby and fling a nuclear warhead at Norfolk Harbor or Mayport, Florida. And that was 6-7 years before September 11th. <br /> <br /> The Admiral tasked Dodge to take command of a World War II motel bum submarine and to perform an exercise against the surface fleet and the USS ORLANDO, a spike, to quickly line up the attack submarine Dodge takes command and conjures up the bad news bears in no time. Um, I mean his lovely group of weird submarines in warriors. Although he has his penis "welcome aboard" tattooed, he is a competent and fair commander. He chooses no favorites and delegates authority in a responsible manner. The US Navy could not have come up with a finer recruitment propaganda than this beautifully crafted jewel that was underestimated by the creator of the Police Academy.
