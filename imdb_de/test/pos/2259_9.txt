I saw the last night and chose an "8". Since then, I've grown and I would give him a "9". <br /> <br /> The film has (at first) a seemingly slightly separated fa√ßade between the first and the second half. The first half is a comedy, and there is little reference to the torn truths of epochs, lives, wars, and religious intolerance that will be seen in the second half. While it may be a bit confusing at first because it's a slightly unfamiliar narrative sequence, it works while thinking. <br /> <br /> The show was good (Hultz in the role of interpreter Alex was especially great). <br /> <br /> I've scanned most of the other "user comments" and see that some who read the book are happy with the movie, while there are some who do not. Both feelings are of course valid. <br /> <br /> For me, a retired family therapist and one-world believer, the film was relevant on two different levels. <br /> <br /> The first, as a story, strongly reminded him of the frequency with which polarizations are made - with demons and an attempt to destroy those who have a moral value system other than our own. <br /> <br /> The second thing was that in the first one, EVERY of us also had something in common with ALL of our families - that each one of us had to return to our roots to understand ourselves better. <br /> TS Eliot excellently expressed this in his fourth "Four Quartets" when he said, "We will not stop exploring. // And the end of all our explorations // will arrive where we are have started for the first time. " <br /> <br /> Jonathan makes a fulfilling journey that each of us would find fantastically enlightening - to explore and discover our roots; What did these people go through then, who were they - really! - before, when and in the first years before and after our birth? <br/> <br/> So the movie gives us the impression of a comedy, then it shifts to a lesson in history and human flaws, but through everything that subconsciously brings us news about each of them us. We would all be well rewarded if we went back and understood the place from which we started.
