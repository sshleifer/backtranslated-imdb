Hayao Miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated film that addresses the usual sweetness to charm your socks. I thought the trailer contained his song, which was softly hypnotic, and I did not have to wait for an invitation to make sure I got my ticket to the preview of the movie, which will open here next week. <br /> <br /> For fans of Studio Ghibli movies, you probably know what you're looking for, because Miyazaki has another winner in his filmography who will win new fans. At least I'm embarrassed that so far I have only seen My Neighbor Totoro (eyes on the pile of Ghibli DVDs) and I love it all, but I think this would serve as a last impulse not to miss further. It would probably be animated films that I would like. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (voiced by Nara Yuria) is a magical goldfish eager to seek life beyond the ocean, with her constant forays into a bubble to the surface of the water for a glimpse. Nonetheless, these aspirations do not speak for their humanoid father Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who hates some hatred of the human race for pollution and also briefly touches a subplot to protect the environment / revenge of Mother Nature. One day, Ponyo gets stranded in an accident and is picked up by five-year-old boy Sosuke (Doi Hiroki), who lives with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko) in a house on the said cliff, while Papa Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mainly out to sea. because he is a sailor. And you can expect some moments of relapse on The Little Mermaid or Splash for kids. More to say would be to spoil the fun. <br /> <br /> The artwork here is still amazing, even though it's in 2D fame because you know every cell is laboriously edited. There are so many things happening in the same frame at the same time that you probably see each other again and again, just to see them all. This is definitely better than any 3D or CG animated production every day, since its beauty stems from its simplicity, not just from the artwork department, but also from history, though complaints were received that the Hans Christian Andersen Classic had taken a leaf. While there are ways to make this film extremely dark, it suggested only certain dark themes, but opted for a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both children and adults. <br /> <br /> about the love between the family members of Koichi, Lisa and Sosuke and especially between mother and son. What's more, it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish he baptized Ponyo, and I'm telling you that Ponyo himself has enough cuteness to beat Bolt, WallE and Eve. The characterization here is top notch and it's hard not to fall in love with ponyo, in whatever form, especially if she's such a playful creature that does not hide her feelings - if she gets upset with you, she'll either turn away or you can expect a jet stream from her mouth to be spewed into your face! <br /> <br /> Ponyo on the cliff by the sea is an absolute must for my top movies of this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I'm sure I'm going to the Ghibli Museum to bask in the magical world that Hayao Miyazaki brought us. Highly recommended movie, so do not miss it on the big screen!
