After reading some of these reviews, it's obvious that some missed the point. What's great about this movie (here's the point), the unbelievable thing about this movie, the amazing thing about this movie is that there's no proselytizing. There is no sermon. There is no sermon. There is no sermon. Life goes on. It's a masterpiece to make an audience think of its collective self. These are just children who do what children do - without awareness. We all went to school with such children. We are stunned by fiction / movie / tv / new-based reality / invention. <br /> <br /> Fecks (Dennis Hopper, the great) girlfriend alone and his relationship with her is well worth the price to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> There have been few films before or since to do justice to the intelligence of this film. AMEN. <br /> <br />
