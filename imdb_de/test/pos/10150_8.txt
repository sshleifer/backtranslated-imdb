Less a thriller than a colorful adventure with exciting elements. The man who knew too much should not really be compared to Hitchcock masterpieces like VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW or PSYCHO. It's more fun to play such funny drums as TO THIE and NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Filmed largely on location in Morocco and London, the film tells the story of a couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose holidays are interrupted when they are innocently plundered by an assassination - and if their little son is kidnapped, assure her Silence. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day are very effective in their roles as All-American couples, and the characters get an unusual twist: Stewart, a midwestern physician, is open-minded, but has a touch of the "ugly American abroad" about his personality; Day, who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired after her marriage, is suspicious. These qualities of personality and background play very well in the story. <br /> <br /> THE MAN WHO KNOWN TOO MUCH contains a number of famous scenes; Both the scene in which Stewart Drogentag told them before the kidnapping and the very complex Albert Hall sequence with seemingly hundreds of cuts are very powerful. Less often noticed, though I find it equally satisfying, if less satisfying, the more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock combines tension and perverse humor than when Stewart discovers something in a taxidermist shop and whips up "Que Sera." Sera "(written for this film) in a very inappropriate manner at a cocktail party at the Embassy. <br /> <br /> Although THE MAN WHO KNOWS TOO MUCH lacks the depth and impact of Hitchcock's larger work, he still remains entertaining film One that compares very well with all of its work, it's Hitchcock-light, but recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
