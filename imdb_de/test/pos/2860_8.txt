Sister Betty is really an interesting movie. I guess we all know someone who is so confident that the characters in a soap opera are real, that you can not explain them by any means, that they are just actors and not real people. <br /> <br /> Sister Betty is not a nurse at all. In real life she is an ordinary housewife working in a diner. To escape her terrible husband and the problems in her miserable life, she has become a very dedicated fan of a soap opera. After witnessing her husband being murdered, she is shocked and loses all influence on reality. She believes that she is in love with one of the characters in the soap opera, a doctor, and decides that she will visit him and start a family with him. The hitmen, however, think that she knows too much and pursues her to kill her. <br /> <br /> As I said before, the theme is quite noticeable (if you omit the professional hitmen and the murder) and the movie was funny. The story was well done and the actors did a good job. It had everything I always wanted to see when I saw a comedy. I give a 7.5 / 10.
