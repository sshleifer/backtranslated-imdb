"Thriller" is brilliant. It's a long video, but still awesome. The song itself is excellent ... add Michael JAckson dancing and you have a golden phenomenon. Of all the videos I've ever seen, this is the best. If you have not seen the video yet, I urge you to ... <br /> <br /> The special effects are amazing for the time ... everything from the Wearwolf transformation to the idea that these scary zombies are slow Get out of the water Your graves are great ... scary awesome. Vicent Price has known its segment of bone-trending lines ... simply as "rap." Ola Ray is good as Michael's girl and Michael JAckson herself ... the dancing and singing (though not during the video itself) is second to none ... <br /> 10/10.
