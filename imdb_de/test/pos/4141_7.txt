I turned 13 when Elvis hit the big time in 1956 with his first RCA hit. A year later, Buddy Holly came to compete with the king. In addition to his unique vocal style and song writing skills, one of Buddy's most important talents is often downplayed. Buddy was also an experienced lead guitarist, developing a unique rockabilly style on his Fender Strat. Gary Busey tries to capture this aspect of Buddy's Persona. There were other contemporary master guitar rockers of the same caliber, such as Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran, but Buddy's talent is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, Busey is the driving force behind the success of The Buddy Holly Story. Not only does the script play with the facts from Buddy's life, it even casts several anachronisms for Buddy's two years of popularity, essentially 1957-1959. One that comes to my mind is the scene where Buddy and Maria see a 3D movie. Buddy is not thrilled with all that and tells Maria that it will never last. It's just a fad. In reality, no 3D movies were in circulation at the time. The heyday for 3D was in the early fifties. By 1955, the fad had already faded. Another example where only a little research would have been enough to make the story more credible. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's hard to sort out what really happened from urban legends around Buddy's career. The story of how the crickets got their name may or may not be apocryphal, but it certainly did not take place as it is portrayed in the film. Another problem of the film is the portrayal of Buddy's parents. Buddy's parents certainly supported his musical career. "Maybe Baby" is credited to Buddy's mother, and she's been writing the song. <br /> <br /> It's good that Buddy's biggest hits were used in the movie, but I miss hearing one of my favorites. "I am looking for someone whom I can love." I am proud that Buddy's music was reissued as a result of this film for a new generation. His legacy is one of the best from the beginning of rock 'n' roll. Rave on, Buddy, keep raving.
