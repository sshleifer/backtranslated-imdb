Realistic masterpiece. Thirty years later, the pictures may look a bit old, but actually, it's just the "fist-on-the-face" effect of the movie. I've never seen a movie like this in my life. The first time I saw it, I did not know if it was a fiction ... And it did not look like it ... This movie is a masterpiece that every single one of the world needs to see. It is the best sociocritical film of all time. The ultimate movie that shows that the system has failed. And the system has not changed much in thirty years. I think this movie should be seen as a lesson piece.
