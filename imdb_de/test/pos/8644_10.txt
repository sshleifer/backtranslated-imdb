Hitchcock would be proud of this movie. Even if nothing happens, it's exciting. Director David Lynch uses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there, but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to prevent him from dulling but not enough to make sense. I'm still trying to figure it out and probably will need to see it again to catch things I've missed and maybe help me understand better. It is a very detailed plot that comes together very slowly. So you have to be patient and take care. Avoid your bathroom trip before getting started. Yet the plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the character development, and the filming techniques. <br /> <br /> The double roles of leading actress Naomi Watts show her enormous talent. That is, when I could avert my eyes from her co-star. What a theatrical couple. <br /> <br /> Lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles, the length / timing of cuts when editing and jumping between scenes. Combined with an intelligent use of music and sounds, this all helps to create tension in our mind, undoubtedly a major goal of the director. Well, he kept me on the edge of the seat and even let me talk to the actors to be careful and not be so na√Øve. You know, the kind of stuff you want to give your kids for the movie.
