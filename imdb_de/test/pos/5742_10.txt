GRanny is the best movie ever Ganny is the best movie I've ever seen. The plot was like nothing that was ever seen or done before these people are truly blessed with a talent, not a joke I love this movie. I have to buy it, but I can not find it anywhere. It's a dream for me to meet the actors and try to hire a grandma. I rented GRANNY in the Broadway video and kept it a week longer than I should and asked if I could buy it from them, they said no, a big disappointment and an even bigger one the week after I returned it. I wanted to rent it again, but I wanted to know that the Broadway video was out of business. If anyone has the movie or knows where to buy it, please write to iloverot@aol.com
