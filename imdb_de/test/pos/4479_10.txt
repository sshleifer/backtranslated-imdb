I remember reading the original Balzac story in college French. <br /> <br /> I remember Ken Nordine from WGN-TV in Chicago when he read her as one of his late-night shows. <br /> <br /> I've always loved the music story, but I never think they could or would make a movie out of it. To my surprise, they did and did VERY well. <br /> <br /> Few Balzac stories are suitable for dramatization, which is unfortunate, and - a comradely lover, I'm a lot of Hollywood sex. This is as close to the perfect transformation as it would be possible. <br /> <br /> The theater of the mind is always better than what the eye can see, but it's as close as I think, it can come to let go of the fantasy. Read Read the reality of seeing.
