I was very amused to read some of the bad reviews in this movie. First, many have said that they took their 4-year-old daughters and granddaughters to see it, and they did not enjoy it. First of all, I do not think this is a kiddie movie, at least not a movie for very young kids, not at least 4. It has a very subtle sense of humor, but it's not meant to be fast talking like Tom and Jerry or anything like that. Many people have also complained that things are going very slowly ... I think these people are all used to putting 'quantity' above 'quality'. Although I have a small quality problem with this film, that is, the film was not as detailed as the short films, but I still think he did quite well for a full feature film. And how can people complain about the jokes? The jokes were reasonable, timely and well thought out, never insulting or "in your face". Wallace is extremely smart, yet careful, and Grommit is the most adorable, smart, and cute character that could be. This was a beautiful movie and the theme was very appropriate ... for adults, that is ... especially with the increase in obesity and metabolic diseases in the world, there's nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits ... and this was done in a very tasteful way, in that ... while people are dealing with the aspect of vegetables, it does not necessarily mean that they are healthier or eat more of it ... in fact it has the legend of the hare actually met. And for those who complained about religious jokes, I say ... came! are you sure? Many villages revolve around the local church, and legends / premonitions etc. are normal issues, no harm. This movie was absolutely amazing, but some people had negative comments on it and I find that absolutely absurd !!!
