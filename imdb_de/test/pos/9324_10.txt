For those too young to remember, or too old to be part of the "hype", the Michael Jackson fad was in the early to mid-eighties on a fever - like the hype surrounding the Titanic, only that this was not the case subside. Every song, every video, every word spoken by Michael was important. Nothing similar had been seen since the heyday of the Beatles. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this video for the first time in a roller-skating rink. Everyone stopped skating. There was no question if you were a Michael Jackson fan or not. You were. Everyone crowded around the screen and watched the video. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the longest music videos ever made, and definitely the best. It's constantly # 2 on the MTV Top 100 videos of the year. (# 1 is always the taste of the month and somehow all that # 1 of all time is past # 2 to make way for the new # 1.) Lot and thriller became a phenomenon in and of itself , <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, you need to watch the video. not just the excerpts of MTV or VH1. If necessary, look for Making of Thriller in a video library. Hey ... your parents probably got you to watch Beatles and Woodstock footage because "it was important" ... well, that's important, too.
