Pictures control this movie. Although the characters are interesting, they eventually take a back seat. The first scene I remember is a framed black and white shot of the ocean, which then opens to full screen and color. The bubbling of the water gives way to a small coffin that breaks the surface. The theme of the film is that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the living. Water as ultimate awareness, as a tool of God, is used to force people to organize their "houses" (Judgment Day). The dead must be held accountable and taken to a better place. Whatever remains unresolved or unresolved will be washed away. There is no clinging to the past, a buried reminder of what was. <br /> <br /> This movie was compared with O, Brother Where Art Thou, and the threat of water and its use as a cleaner similar to this movie. What's different in this film is that the coming of the water is recognizable, and so again the focus is on what needs to be done with the here and now. I agree with the scenes to remember a David Lynch work. Take, for example, the dinner segment with the atmospheric and androgynous waitress. You get the same surreal feeling of attitude and strange character as with the reverse transmitter in the Fire Starter scene. The difference is that Lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of a disturbed character, while this film uses seemingly surreal elements to produce a moral message. Men in black suits can not have what they want - they have to be patient and accept what's available.
