An amazing movie, I just saw him and I want to see him again. I had never heard of Derek Jarman before I saw this movie, but now I can not wait to see his others. The film takes a whole new perspective on Shakespeare's The Tempest. I'm sure he appreciated it because Jarman used the themes of the play like love, magic, darkness and atmospheric tension. OK, OK, maybe there was a bit of nudity in the movie, which I did not really expect, but it did not offend me, it just surprised me and made the movie more unpredictable. A spoiler (for those with a nervous disposition: Fast forward the flashback scene with Sycorax & Caliban and Ariel as their slave, its pretty graphics.) When you start to find the Shakespeare performances of Kenneth Branagh limp and monotonous, you must do so Fantastic and surreal, it will blow you away, but only if you let it, be open-minded - and then let this movie work, it's a spell for you.
