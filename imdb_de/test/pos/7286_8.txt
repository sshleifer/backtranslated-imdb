It has become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore, thought this movie would be a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Had better production values, but what kept me going was the tension and the twists. I had real reservations before seeing this movie (because of the cover). I was afraid that it would be too bloody and bloody. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Although there are many scary parts, there is also a lot of suspense and drama. <br /> <br /> The acting in Dead Line was better than what you wanted to expect from a micro-budget horror movie. The characters were believable. <br /> <br /> The movie is really exciting and scary in a few moments, so you can crash until the end of the credits is not very good for example) 8/10.
