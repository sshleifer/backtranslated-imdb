This is one of the few films of this kind that I have reviewed and enjoyed. While Clint Eastwood is his usual self, the whole story works well, even in the borders of Washington DC. <br /> <br /> The topic: An assassin persecutes the president and there is only one person who can save him. <br /> <br /> It can not be easy to make a movie that audiences enjoy today in this arena. This movie is successful on several levels. Eastwood is his overpriced hero who wants to save the president since the Kennedy era. He is doing well in this role, as well as his role, Reneee Russo (an FBI agent). Overall well thought out and exciting with additional stars for Malkovich. 10.9.
