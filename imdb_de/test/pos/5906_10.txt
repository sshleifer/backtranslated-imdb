In a genre of its own, this film has a limited audience and a tight appeal, coupled with a subtle undertone that permeates the entire production. Yet it is a remarkable piece of cinema that is as timeless as a rare piece of art. Mon Oncle Antoine captures a time that is rarely seen in Quebec films. Their strength lies in the depth of the characters and the wealth of settings. Duplessis' Québec, parochial and feudal, is a brilliant background that could only be achieved by a purely la Québecois. <br /> <br /> It would be far too easy to resort to clichés, stereotypes and clichés in order to achieve purposeful short-sighted statements in this story. However, the director chose to skip the forced imagery, instead focusing on the essence of rural Québec life at the time. This makes this film extraordinary in its authenticity, while in its presentation it is not presumptuous. If only more contemporary cinematic aspirations did the same thing, the watching audience could not be forced to choose between the overburdened Hollywood pablum, which is considered a "must see" view. Mon Oncle Antoine is - in every sense of the word - unforgettable. It will leave a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived or visited Quebec. A classic. **************************************** <br/> < br /> Follow-up: May 10, 2008 <br /> <br /> After reviewing some of the comments, it's worth noting that Mon oncle Antoine is NOT - and probably does not serve, as a standard Hollywood / American Cinema to serve mass market sales. An upcoming story, yes, but far more than simple recollections of the youth in Quebec (1940). Spectators who are looking for pure entertainment at the expense of the complex development of the characters, are very disappointed. Take a look at action / adventure / romance / comedy to enjoy yourself. See how Mon oncle Antoine gets involved in a rarely seen but absolutely remarkable society that has been overlooked and ignored for far too long. The Grapes of Wrath are hardly a thriller But the story and the characters make this American classic a lasting film. Mon oncle Antoine belongs to the same genre.
