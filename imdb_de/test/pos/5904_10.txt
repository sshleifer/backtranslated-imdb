Mon Oncle Antoine observes the rugged face of a homespun community from different angles, slowly taking time as it should, until we come up with shattered (but banal) hopes and expectations, swirling dreams, and a heart-stopping revelation about the terrible mystery of mortality , <br /> <br /> Aimless pans and zooms across the snow-covered hillside console the mind and hypnotize the viewer. This restless camera work is shown in a marginal figure that is equally the drifter. He quits his job at the Coal Mine and has his family cut wood, then returns and returns to the dead humanity of his boy dead. <br /> <br /> An old woman cheats on her husband and a boy. Old things are getting new and new things are dying. Everywhere, the snow-white is as wondrous as the history of cinema.
