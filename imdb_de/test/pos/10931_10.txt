I have just read what I think is an analysis of this film by a lyric Irishman. Nice to read. <br /> <br /> A brief analysis of this film, however, is that it is an intertwining of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice. <br /> <br /> Envy, greed, pride, sloth, anger, etc., and justice in the forms Retributive, Expelling, Blind and Divine. <br /> <br /> I was able to show three examples each, one for each of the three protagonists. However, it is much more fun to write them down for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Do not miss him.
