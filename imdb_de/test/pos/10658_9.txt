On June 14, 1905, during the Russian Revolution of that year, sailors aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. Frustrated by the second-rate treatment and especially by the maggot-infested meat they must eat, the ship's crew, led by the inspiring Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), decides that the time is ripe for revolution. And so begins the sweeping classic of Russian propaganda by Sergei M. Eisenstein: "Bronenoset's Potyomkin / The Battleship Potemkin". <br /> <br /> The film itself is full of bright examples of stunning visual imagery: the glasses of a fallen ship's captain dangling gently on the side rope over which he had been thrown; The body of a deceased mutineer lies peacefully on the shore, the shield on his chest reads: "KILLED FOR A BOWL SOUP"; Close-ups of the clenched fists of the hundreds of spectators who are fed up with the tsarist regime; a headstrong stroller ride down the Odessa stairs while desperate onlookers watch with bated breath (this scene was "borrowed" by Brian De Palma for a particularly exciting scene in "The Untouchables"); The barrels of numerous cannons are ominously aligned with the far superior battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> However, is the film itself best analyzed? not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes? but as a single movie and indeed every scene is very memorable. Although the film is divided into five rather different chapters, it flows wonderfully forward. at no point do we lose interest, and we never doubt on which side we should be sympathetic. The film is often referred to as "propaganda," and that's exactly what it is, but it does not have to have a negative connotation. "The Battleship Potemkin" was produced by Eisenstein for a specific purpose and fulfills this perfectly in every way. The film "Potemkin", planned by the Soviet Central Committee, which coincides with the celebrations of the unsuccessful 1905 revolution in the 20th century, was a popular film in his homeland symbolizing the revival of Russian art after the revolution. It is therefore somewhat unfortunate that Eisenstein's film did not perform well at the Russian box office. Allan Dwan's "Robin Hood" movie from 1922 had beaten him in his opening week and had only been in operation for four weeks. Fortunately, "The Battleship Potemkin" has had a more admirable effect overseas, despite the prohibition banned in various countries on several occasions. <br /> <br /> The film also proved to be a successful tool for Eisenstein to test his theories of "montage". Through fast cuts and remote recordings of the multitude of extras, the audience must not sympathize with individual characters, but with the revolutionary population in general. However, Eisenstein breaks this process in a scene in which Vakulinchuk flees the ship's officer trying to kill him and, of course, during the famous sequence of Odessa Steps, while our hearts beat with horror at the life of the unfortunate child in the tumbling stroller. The accompanying soundtrack to the version I played, which for the most part contained the orchestral works of Dmitri Shostakovich, did a wonderful job of enhancing the emotional impact of such scenes. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest movies of the silent movie era, 'The Battleship Potemkin' is a triumph of phenomenal film production and a significant piece of film history. The extremely exaggerated events of the film (among others there was never a violent massacre of the Odessa steps) have been so completely engraved in the memory that we are often unsure about the true story behind the events depicted. This is a great achievement.
