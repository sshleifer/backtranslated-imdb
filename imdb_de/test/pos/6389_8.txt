The Psychopath (1973) A journey into the past. I saw this movie on an old black and white movie many years ago. In a children's show, Mr. Rabbey equips the brutal abuse that parents impose on his childhood friends. Mr. Rabbey (who looks like he's always about to lose him) breaks and decides to go hunting. Take care of bad parents because Mr. Rabbey is on the hunt! What happens next is priceless. However, trying to find this movie will be quite a job. <br /> <br /> What makes this film noteworthy is the fact that Joe "Maniac" Spinell has made a short promo role for a movie based on this film. In his unfinished film, he plays Mr. Robbie, a television movie. Clown (looks like a pudgy out of the shape of a cunning Edward James Olmos) who avenges the child molestation of his young fans by persecuting their parents. Unfortunately, Mr. Spinell could never find the means to complete the project. The movie should be called Maniac II: "Mister Robbie". Rabbey or Robbie's similarities are too close for comfort. Quite violent for a P.G. Movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
