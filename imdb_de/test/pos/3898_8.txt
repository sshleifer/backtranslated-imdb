"A Slight Case of Murder" is an excellent television movie that is definitely worth the rental price. William H. Macy is a great movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress and then has to try to hide the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite carefree and funny, with many memorable lines ("Acting is tougher than I thought - you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology." Next week, these two will answer Movie Noir questions: What do these people do during the day, and why is it always raining?) The film has a great side cast, including Macy's real wife, Felcity Huffman, James Cromwell, and Adam Arkin must see for Macy fans!
