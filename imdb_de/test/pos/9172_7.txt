The "Date Doctor" concept is the only thing that keeps this movie from an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre, but I found it pleasant enough to get my opinion about it, so I have it much more liked as if there had been only a mediocre conspiracy without many twists. Will Smith does a great job, as always, as Hitch, the man who spends his life counseling men how and how not to win women over ... since his failed attempt to keep his college friend. There's a lot of laughter as he tries to woo his up-and-coming patient, the overweight, cranky asthmatic Albert Brennman (Kevin James), to successfully woo his beautiful colleague Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta). When he decides to free a woman he meets in a turkey bar that simply does not seem to want her to want him, he is attracted to Sara (Eva Mendes) - it seems to be big deal for him So, I think, since college he has never practiced his own rules on himself. Unfortunately, Sara is a gossip columnist who is interested in "The Date Doctor" and has caught a seemingly dorky guy like Albert along with Allegra - especially after Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) has broken the heart of her best friend (Julie Ann Emery) indicates that the doctor saw him abhor when she did not realize he was refusing to see him. Nevertheless, there are difficulties, and Hitch stops and wonders what he should do with his own relationship. However, he is not much help to Albert if he tries to figure out what he can do in his relationship. The acting is good, there is a lot of humor and some other nice points with meaning. Hitch's character is funny and wise, sometimes it's both at the same time. The misconception that the woman is being insulted with something the man did not really do (why do they always show that?) Is common and irritating - I think it would not have been the first time I did not make it to the fifth Time was I have seen IT - but the rest was completely new. I just wish this movie was longer - I remember seeing 3/5 of it while he was on a restaurant TV - but I agree anyway. It is definitely worth the money to pay for its brevity.
