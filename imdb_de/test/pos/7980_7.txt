With "Batman Returns" Tim Burton succumbed to an important priority in American cinema: to give the blockbuster a sequel. Three years after the most successful film of the year, "Batman" (1989), the hero of Gotham City comes back to the delight of many viewers. Batman Returns, like its predecessor, had tremendous commercial success. Tim Burton had Batman come back again, believing that his opponent's victory against Joker did little to improve Gotham City's image. In fact, there is still violence and corruption, and here is the second word of Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito) embodied. These two rogues, who want to take control of Gotham City, will make life difficult for Batman. His task will be more difficult with the appearance of Catwoman. <br /> <br /> Tim Burton has still done a lot of work on the scenery and it seems he has tried to correct the mistakes of the first movie. It means that the director has made room to fight sequences that are better mastered than the first Batman. He did not neglect the psychology of his main characters. When Burton focused on the psychology of Bruce Wayne / Batman in the 1989 film, it was the penguin who obviously interested him. The director tried to make him a very ambiguous character. On the one hand, he is full of evil intentions (previously quoted), on the other hand, he is looking for his past and would like to be regarded as a real man. <br /> <br /> "Batman Returns" also appears crazier than its predecessor, especially in the cast. I think of Mich√®le Pfeiffer, who as Catwoman offers a daring and powerful performance. At the time I write this review, I also remember that there's a new version of Catwoman in the cinema right now. Given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), It is certain that her performer Halle Berry will have to fall into insignificance next to Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this film is one of the best installments of 1992 and allows to develop Tim Burton's special style. We also find his taste for the foreign and the Gothic. You can skip these for Batman's other adjustments for the screen. "Batman Forever" (1995) and "Batman and Robin" (1997) are not good. I've heard that Christopher Nolan made the beginning of the Batman story and was due to release it next year. Is it fitting with Tim Burton's works?
