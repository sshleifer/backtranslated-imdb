I remember going home from school almost every day to see the KTLA-5 monster movies, but I've never come home faster than this movie was planned. Somehow, the idea of ​​being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend tempted me in a very unique way. Sure, I pretended to be Spiderman, Batman, and other superheroes, but I really wanted to be Johnny Sakko. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for 30 years and can still remember it well. Who can forget how Giant Robot shot missiles from his fingers? Or how about the way Ghuillotene throws his nails to make explosions! Gosh, I can even whistle the theme music that plays in the end, which is so tragic that I remember crying myself several times to sleep! <br /> <br /> Just another movie has the magic This movie is in my head and that's the Wizard of Oz. But I've seen this movie many times since I was a kid. Of course, the Wizard of Oz is a true classic, while Voyage Into Space has nothing to do with a low budget. These two films should not even be mentioned in the same sentence, but for a little boy it is not the high production values ​​or the continuity that conquer your heart, its flying monkeys and giant robots! <br /> <br /> P.S. My cousin made a very accurate impression of Giant Robot (he called it "Giant Robutt"). If you remember, Giant Robot had a special way to fire his rockets, and my cousin was cold. I had him repeat the routine endlessly for my personal pleasure.
