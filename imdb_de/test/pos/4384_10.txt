"O Brother, Where Art Thou" is a hilarious retelling of Homer's "Odyssey", which plays in the Mississippi of the 1930s and is characterized by the pompous peculiarity that is the trademark of the Coen Brothers. Three unfortunate convicts escape in this delightful movie to find a treasure - and more than part of their adventure. George Clooney is in a fine, uninspired manner as a talkative, amiable leader of the trio; But the real kudos go to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as his stupid but loveable cohorts, who, according to Clooney's character, were called the "Soggy Bottom Boys" after being baptized by completely immersing them in a river. The three have set a record for money under this homespun nom-de-plume and unintentionally become sensations of true rockstar status. The film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as musical. And here are some incredible filmmaking talents: the scene at the KKK Rally is a real idiot, and it resembles the scene where Dorothy's friends save her from the witch's lock in "The Wizard of Oz", that she almost makes up for cinematic plagiarism , And what an amazing plagiarism it is! Without betraying the end, I have to say that the climax of the film is one of the most breathtaking sequences that have been filmed lately (comparable to the spectacular finale of 'Magnolia', one of my favorites). "O Brother" is a must, a perfect 10!
