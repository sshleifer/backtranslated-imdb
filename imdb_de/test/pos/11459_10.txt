I have to say. This is easily one of my favorite movies shown on Halloween. The Halloween party, the terrible acting, the guy dressed and extra by Miami Vice. GREATLY GREAT !!! <br /> <br /> ********************* SPOILERS ********************** ******** <br /> <br /> I have a big place in my heart for random 80s horror movies, and this one reached out and tugged at my heart. I always miss this strip at Blockbuster and always laughed over the lid of the box. Now every weekend I would take a random movie that I had never seen before ... it was Angela's turn on a weekend. She seemed to mock me for months. So I took it home, put it in and spent most of the film under the blanket. <br /> <br /> For me it was scary and disgusting. And not just acting! Some of the things they did for this movie were amazing. I can honestly say that the best thing for me was to watch Suzanne (played by another Iowan) putting a lipstick through her nipple. It was random and I loved it. Seeing the creepy Angela FLOAT through the corridors and hearing her scary demon voice was enough to make me wake up ALL NIGHT LONG! <br /> <br /> It's not one of the smartest or best-played horror movies. But the cheese from the 80s has all the elements you need. Creepy Goth Kid, Virgo, Slut, Nude Girl, Scary House, Bad Acting, oh, and have I mentioned Naked Girls? All the elements were there and were put together to become one of my favorite movies. Kudos to the filmmakers.
