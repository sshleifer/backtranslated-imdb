This is a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really did not understand the guests. I knew they were not serious, but if they really were them was unclear because ... I think I'm just so stupid. I do not know if these are spoilers, but the guests are not really like in Ali g or anything that is played by a man or so I believe. I love the serious look he has made. It's like the program that ran on a Sunday morning and I forget the name LOL. I also like the suit and the mustache he made. It's pretty hot. He is insensitive, which is one of the funniest qualities. I also like the way he has parts of the program. It looks more authentic.
