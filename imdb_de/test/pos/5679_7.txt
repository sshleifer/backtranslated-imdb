Like most, I thought 'another crocodile movie'. So far we have had Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 months. What can you do, is this new? Both films were about action and violence, here about fear and tension. <br /> <br /> The performances are not Oscar worthy if nothing is going on, but in distress or fear these people suffer so much it is like torture. There are holes in the plot, and maybe Krocs are not really behaving like others have pointed out, but the fear is so effective that you can say you'll enjoy this movie. You will feel as uncomfortable as the Passion of Christ.
