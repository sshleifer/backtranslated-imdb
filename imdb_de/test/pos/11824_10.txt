For unknown reasons, this beautiful masterpiece was not deservedly deserved and greatly underrated by many American film critics. Therefore, it is easy to understand that I found many problems when I found this movie. I finally saw it and it was so beautiful, sincere and moving that for the first time in my life, I saw a movie five times a week after receiving the tape. The story focuses on the friendship between the two young boys Erik and Dexter, who are eleven and twelve years old and very different from each other, but they become the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendship has been shown in the cure, which is as sincere and natural as ever. There are so many beautiful, heartfelt and moving scenes (especially on the river) that hit the heart and leave no one indifferent. The film is also full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism (especially strong with Erik's shoe), which also greatly enhances the visual impression of such a beautiful work. The story written by Robert Kuhn is well written and unlike the overwhelming majority of modern Hollywood products, virtually every scene, every sentence and every sentence in the movie is significant and brings something important in terms of characters and relationships between them. Peter Horton, who I do not know had much experience in film directing, showed his great skills and talents in this area. Cinematography is also excellent with perfectly selected locations for the movie, but the most important thing is perfect acting, which makes The Cure one of the best films ever. Both Brad Renfro and Erik and Joseph Mazello as Dexter created a wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and great chemistry between two main characters. Only one of these films (I have not seen most of her other works) is enough to call her one of the best actors of her generation. Annabelle Sciorra also performs excellently as Dexter's mom. It is terribly sad that such talented actors have not received much recognition, while many overrated stars enjoy tremendous publicity and high salaries. After all, it would be unfair not to mention that the awesome soundtrack of David Grusin and the great Mark Cohn song (one of the best songs I've ever heard in the movies) are My Great Escape. Everything I can say about The Cure is a simple word. Great. In every way, this film is a beautiful, heartfelt and inspirational work of all the people involved in this masterpiece. I have to do credit to all the people who put their heart and soul into the film, and Universal Pictures, who have found a way to make such a beautiful film among numerous formula-like commercial projects. But such films are so rarely released in theaters that the studios themselves often do not realize what gems they have created that they can not offer an appropriate marketing campaign. The only small downside of The Cure for me is the short length (only 97 minutes). <br /> <br /> I do not want to write about the movie anymore because it's just impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words. So if you have the opportunity to see The Cure, you can rent or buy it would not be disappointing. 10 of 10. Sorry for my bad English.
