I liked it better than House Party 2 & 3. The cast was hilarious and cool at the same time. Chris Stokes, the director of the film, has a very humorous cameo as a car repairman. Look for his mother, the main character, John John's grandmother, plays. And at the end of the movie you can hear her rapping the title song "Down to the Last Minute". She is very funny and also a really good actress. The young actors who play the main role in this (the main trio) and are in fact part of the IMx music group have done an excellent job. Prior to this film, I did not pay much attention to this R & B group. Now I'm a fan. Alone the music number in the house party scene is worth the movie. I was positively surprised. I loved it.
