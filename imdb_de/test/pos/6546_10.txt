This is one of my favorite movies, if not in cars, forget it !! This movie shows one of the Aussie's biggest muscle cars, the XYGTHO. Yes, acting is not the best - it was never done to win an Oscar. The auto-action lets you come back more and more. There's a cool collection of '70s muscle cars and an awesome '57 Chev - with a really cool cat driving it! There is also a really cool song sung by Terry Serio, the lead actor. Acting is pretty funny if you take it easy, but the tire Smokin and Drag Racing is the main focus in this movie. Big, fast cars with a lot of steel (NO PLASTIC CARS) and some cool road grinds. I only recommend it to people who love cars, not someone looking for a great show.
