The first in a new style of films for lamas - no tattoos, motorcycles or karate. I miss her for one. But that's a serious movie. He plays an FBI profiler who has lived with the bad guys in his head for so long that he does not trust anyone, not even himself. Gary Busey is either a great actor or someone I see in broad daylight in a crowded street do not want to meet. Kristen Cloke pursues lamas just as stubbornly as the serial killer. There is one surprise after another as the story unfolds, of which no less is the end. It never seems to come - there is always another layer in the story. Clokes and lamas start as the good guys, they turn into the bad guys and somehow end up with the heroes. But it definitely worth the rental price. For maximum enjoyment, throw a candy bar, a bag of popcorn and a soft drink. You go to the movies!
