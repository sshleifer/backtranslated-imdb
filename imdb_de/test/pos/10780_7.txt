Talk Radio sees a man who accidentally stumbles through life, in fact the American Dream, from which standard of swamp and everyday job he stands in a shop; Moderator of a local radio program before syndicating the same job nationwide later. It's a role he takes out of his own aggression and natural behaviors, a foamy approach to freedom of speech when he attacks almost anyone and everything, even those who often ask him to agree or compliment him. His role as a man who rules everything good, evil, right, wrong, political, religious, moral and immoral is something people seemingly take in a form. that of "it is entertaining and worth it", but also on a level of rejection and antagonism? Two things that have come out of things that seem to be encouraged in the Western world. This is opposite a man when he comes to the top of his game through the American Dream and expresses himself in the freedom of speech when people accept a man but do everything he says. </ P> </ br> Talk Radio begins assembling tall, towering buildings in a business district in Dallas, Texas. The skyscrapers are shot from an angle and a tower over the viewer, as well as everything else in the immediate vicinity, while this voice of a man tears through the images, extracting statements and information about objects, as these monolithic buildings dominate the screen. They are the physical representation of capitalism, while the voice of what we learn as a radio DJ is the oral representation of the free West; personal speech and opinions on everything and everything. Stone will end his film in the same way he started it, though the film is anything but a circular journey as the characters make monumental changes both in terms of what they experience and in terms of to go through their living. Rather, the images of the buildings act as anchors, around which the study is observed. The ideologies and ideas of a way of life exist; People sign it, but it does them more harm than good; Before restoring that this proud way of life still exists and persists to play the people exhibited in the movie until someone or something drastically changes things. <br /> <br /> The DJ is Barry Champlain, a man with a radio broadcast on a local Texan broadcaster who deals with almost everything. Champlain's somewhat careless attitude towards a rather explosive content is noted when he flies from a call with a bigoted man who recently visited a Holocaust museum to a young drug addict whose girlfriend was allegedly overdosed, and both on the rant and on the mocking of a pizza shop. For us, the content is pretty shocking. For these people everything seems to be as usual, putting in the minds of us, the newcomers of all, some serious seeds of doubt and fright. <br /> <br /> What Barry's show is about, nobody seems to really establish itself: everything and nothing. In fact, the time is spent in the form of jingles or dialogues that the shows immediately before and after Champlain's show refer to specific topics. Gardening for example. They are hosted by calm-talking and methodical people who are sure not constantly jumping from one accidental or extreme to another to increase the stakes. One wonders what Barry's jingle is, the kind that plays around noon during someone else's show: "Later, Barry Champlain's show comes with the village idiots and psychotic drug users!" In fact, the introductory part of his show is a matter-of-fact tone, a clamor of the audience, accompanied by a loud rock track. Barry's success comes into play in the national syndication proposal. It came from confrontation and a relationship based on the contempt he has for his listeners and that they have for him. Encouraging material and increasing engagements should call into question the extent to which they believe they can do so, and whether it really pays to go down the road for entertainment. When the show reaches this broadcasting stage, Barry seems to be in his missionary life for the first time, as a supposed serial rapist calls in and usually leaves everyone a bit stunned. At this point, the camera pauses on Barry and, with the depth of field, covers the same towering, towering buildings that began the movie he was standing in front of the window just behind Barry. They stay big and proud. More specifically, from the ideologies they've been built on, and the promotion of freedom of expression in the broadening of Barry's show across the country, when a man climbs the ladder of his trade, he suddenly collides with the content offered. Everything reaches a point too far and that with freedom should have at least a sense of clarity and not just a mere pleasure. Oliver Stone made Talk Radio in the midst of a fascinating and explosive element. He had a period of filmmaking in the late eighties. During this time he produced in a short time a number of really well-received films; I started with one of my favorite war movies in Platoon, then continued the pretty brilliant Wall Street and ended up with the 1991 JFK. You could even say that this run continued with Natural Born Killers until the mid-nineties. Talk Radio is like its main character in the sense that it is loud, booming, crass and confrontational. It is not anti-capitalism, as much as it seeks to draw a line between what is perceived as entertainment and what goes too far for reasons of popularity and wealth. Talk Radio is certainly a movie that will be remembered.
