Based on a true story by Gerrit Wolfaardt, this film is one of the best films I have seen in South Africa on race relations. A very good history lesson about the unrest in South Africa in the 80s. I've put it on the scale of American History X, as it shows how a young man can be seduced by Aryan teaching and how the "certain" parts of the Christian church have taught false doctrine about the race to be wrong justify. <br /> <br /> It is a strong message of forgiveness and salvation that is a rarity in films today. The violence has done well to show the severity of Gerrit's crimes and the magnitude of his transformation. A word about Jan Ellis, who played Gerrit Wolfaardt. He carries you through the darkness of Gerrit's beginnings to his enlightened transformation. He went as an actor to dark places and is worthy of his performance. Another outstanding achievement was that of Mpho Lovinga, who plays Moses Moremi, a victim of Gerrit's crime. He could pull on some painful spots that really touched you when you saw his performance. Very good movie to show the teenagers.
