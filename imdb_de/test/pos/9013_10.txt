Original movie lovers can really love this show if they just stop complaining. <br /> <br /> The new school of the Emperor brings up some old jokes from the movie, such as: B. Pull the lever to Yzma's lab and Kuzco take a break. Episode. But since it's a children's show, it's just classic and in the right places. Although the style is a lot simpler, the animations and characters keep their personality very well and it actually surprised me. Eartha Kitt is an excellent spokesperson for Yzma, and J.P Manoux does a wonderful job for Kuzco's voice instead of David Spade, who starred in the movie Kuzco. Great plots, fun moments and Kuzco's amazing looks make this show worth seeing. (Just stop complaining about everything!)
