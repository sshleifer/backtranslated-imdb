It's true that this is not a realistic story, but romantic comedy is not a genre I'm looking for realism for. What matters is that the characters are personable and sexy as needed. Shalom is beautiful and relaxed, and Jake Weber looks in a way. They have enough chemistry to make the story credible in the area that counts, the sexual appeal. I would like to see both in another movie. And yes, the clown is also pretty cute.
