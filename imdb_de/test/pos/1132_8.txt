I'm not a big TV person ... but when I saw the first Greek episode, I could not wait until next week! I do not miss the show for NOTHING! <br /> <br /> THANKS GOD for DVR! LOL I'm in love with Cappie ... he's acting like a bad boy, but he's so cute ... Everyone has their own character, so we have pretty much all kinds of people. You could still throw in a Hispanic and a chubby person. <br /> <br /> I did not go to school in the US, so I never liked the idea of ​​community houses and the like, so when my husband told me about the show, which I ignored until he asked me to see her and since I noticed nothing better, I agreed. I laughed so hard the first night that I just had to keep watching. <br /> <br /> So ... I'm with the other people who voted for this show to go on! I hope for a second, third and who knows how many more episodes! It's a really good show, very funny and entertaining!
