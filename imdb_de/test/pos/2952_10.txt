For those who still prefer films that focus on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must. <br /> <br /> By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers a terrain that is inaccessible to most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic without resorting to exaggeration or sensationalism. In fact, the film is initially deceptively inconspicuous. <br /> <br /> In addition to providing an exploratory look at a family - and therefore every family - Block has also documented a very specific time in recent history. I do not know if this was intentional, but due to archival content is unavoidable. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
