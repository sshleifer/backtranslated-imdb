This is the best movie Christopher Guest has ever created with his talented ensemble cast. Previously they had done the excellent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and after BEST IN SHOW the very pleasant A MIGHTY WIND. As for the latest version of FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, the less said, the better. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a documentary about dog shows and especially several competitors. They follow these few selected dogs from the preparatory shows to the big night, where one of the best is shown in the fictitious "Mayflower Kennel Club". However, none of these people is a true dog show enthusiast, but talented improvisational actors who parody many of the common types of people you meet in the world of dog shows. It's amazing that the characters they parody, even if the characters are rather down, are very true. When I had some dog show experience decades ago, this is a very modest group of people! My favorites among the dog owners were the incredibly pressurized and tense yuppie pair that exuded rage and volatility. I also loved the open-gay couple, as it was terribly fun and smart. However, the best performance probably came not from one of the couples, but from Fred Willard, who was the dumbest and least talented announcer in the world. His comments were equally crazy and have often betrayed him as an incredibly stupid person - as he could become the announcer for such a prestigious show, one can only guess. The other participants were also quite funny - the high-priced professional poodle guide and his wealthy owner, the country boy and his dog, and Winkie's "parents" who could barely scrape together to make it into the show The improvised style of filmmaking makes it all wonderful, and it tells a very funny and compelling story - a story that is NOT just for dog owners. Extraordinary acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade. Clever and consistently funny. <br /> <br /> By the way, try to find this on DVD as the extras are actually worth watching. I was a bit painful to look at, but I especially saw Harlan Pepper and his beach ball collection!
