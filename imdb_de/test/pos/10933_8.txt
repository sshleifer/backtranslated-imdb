8 points for what was probably more than it was then. Indians probably stole more than killed. Who really knows? A slower, odd pursuit means it has a pace and is ... interesting and unique. Fortunately no further thoughtless launch. I thought that would be shit at first, and I was packed ... good luck ... good job! I was hoping nobody would split this movie. As the entire film unfolds, there are many unique twists that are impossible to determine what's next. The characters are human and have either honor or not ... passion or not ... forgiveness or not. Wounds on the white horse, the Indian in love, shines even the damned desert. All good.
