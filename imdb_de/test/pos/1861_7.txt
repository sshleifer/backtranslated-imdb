The real husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly play the main role in Creation and tell of Charles Darwin's life before the publication of "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, a notorious worldview that affects evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research led to a huge gap, a schism between the faithful of his time and the scientists. It was said at the time that he was going to make war against God and even "killed God." <br /> <br /> The film is about Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his most devout and loving wife. An enlightening scene at the beginning, as she leads the dining table in prayer and does not tell Charles, "Amen" predicts what will follow and the stark differences between the two. She is convinced that he will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to her family by rejecting God. Darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife, her faith, and his even stronger sense of reason. There are wonderful moments in which he observes animals, cuts through their behavior and the sequences that make up their lives, and explains phenomena of selection to his children, the first-born Annie, with a very pathological curiosity. We see him interacting with England's first orangutan, Jenny, as a child plays with it, decrypting every look and action. <br /> <br /> Annie, the eldest child, dies later and Charles is followed by her death because he was closest to her. In my opinion, this part was too long, bizarre and boring. I did not like the trippy scenes in which he seems to lose his mind and is persecuted by the mind of his daughter, who roars and scolds. Although Charles thinks his wife blames him for their deadly illness, she says poetically, "The truth is, if I knew then what I know now, I would marry you tomorrow." Their bond is solid and indestructible despite enormous differences in faith. <br /> <br /> When Charles finishes his manuscript, he gives his wife the final copy and tells her she can burn it if she does not agree. She finishes reading in the evening and finally gives him a package, the book is ready to be sent to the publisher. In the end, reason and perhaps love triumph as he makes an accomplice out of his most constant adversary. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating that Darwin received a full Christian funeral at Westminster Abbey. Breakthrough ideas were, of course, considered controversial, but even then they were recognized as important knowledge for the further development of mankind. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely heavily dependent on Darwin's family life, his joys and his problems. I liked this aspect, but Fabio said it would be like watching a documentary, I quote: "Hitler's Passion for Ping-Pong". In a sense, this is true, and I can not resist his desire to learn more about Charles Darwin's theories in this film than we did. Nevertheless, it remains a well-executed and flawlessly timed drama. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 Fabio's: 7 Total score: 14
