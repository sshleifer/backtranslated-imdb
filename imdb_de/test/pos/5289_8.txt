For readers who have already seen a film by Miyazaki: He is still in great shape and has made another worthwhile experience. Okay, you do not have to read now. <br /> <br /> I think most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture, so I should say that Ponyo is not so much a family movie. Chance to remember the feeling of being a little kid to be: to discover the world as you wanted to see it, to set your own rules and to be enthusiastic about doing something for the first time for yourself. Ponyo deviates from many problems that all ages have to contend with. It's never condescending, all characters have good, real hearts and credible problems. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are perhaps two of the most credible kids I've ever seen. They are not simple, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic and get to know the ways of the world. They are so easy to love, but even easier to identify. Many films consider children from the outside as the adult looking into a world that only a child can enter. Ponyo brings everyone back to this world. Ponyo is the first time to learn and choose what matters most to you, which makes the movie so special. It's worth remembering to feel it again.
