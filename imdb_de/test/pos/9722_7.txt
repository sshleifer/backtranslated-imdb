Despite their descent, the most interesting things in this series are not the animatronics or puppetry, which, though charming, are little more than side shows, at least in the story I've seen, A STORY SHORT. In fact, though I have to admit, the main pleasure of the program lies in the oldest art of storytelling. John Hurt, in the Rowley Birch QC mode, grotesque, medieval make-up, tells a storytelling story, sitting by the fire accompanied by a cynical dog. One winter's day, starved and poor, he sees a vicious fellow thrown out of the royal kitchen by the evil cook. The storyteller tempts him to give them an excellent soup. Enraged, the cook asks the king for permission to cook the villain, but the monarch offers him, by the storyteller's delight, a reprieve - for 100 nights he has to tell the king a new story: if he does not, he will handed over to the cook. <br /> <br /> The story may be old, but it is told with great zeal. Anthony Minghella's script is (as befits a playwright) excellently dramatic, humorous and with some disturbing worries about the fun, such as fears of the self or the culturally self-generating power of storytelling coupled with the continuation of ideological power. For a program aimed at children, it is excitingly self-reflective (with little nonsense that film is the new oral culture); Despite the Americanized style, the medieval bustle, the grotesqueness and the arbitrary horror, as well as the magic and power of man are appealing.
