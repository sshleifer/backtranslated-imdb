I've always loved old movies, but this is one of my top ten favorites ... it has all the charm, the distinctiveness of 1940 and the good old-fashioned romance. Barbara Stanwick plays an independent, single woman writing cookery for her own life for a famous magazine ... on condition that she is a married housewife. Even the president of the magazine is in this delusion. Enter a handsome GI (played by the talented Dennis Morgan), who has just been rescued by a raft with his buddy. His simple wish is to live in the homey Inn she so eloquently writes about and relax with her famous home-cooked food. She desperately needs to find a way to save her job and her reputation ... What's more, her fianc√© is in a hurry to tie the knot, which does not help. The humor is great and the chemistry between the main characters is fun. Throwing the character actor nicknamed "Cuddles" (which fits this name) will make it even more adorable. This has become an absolute must-have movie I paint with a cup of cocoa in every season. A wonderful, enjoyable movie that you can enjoy at Christmas or anytime!
