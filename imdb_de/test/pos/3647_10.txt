In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from harvesting garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a particular canary - and grandma, his owner. Oh oh! Again, Tweety and Granny pose many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester is also seasick a few times. And when the red cat's nose goes to the place on the ship for the second time, which has something to heal his discomfort, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerine. Now Sylvester can make a fire! I stop here and say that this is another excellent cartoon starring Friz Freling with the beloved cat-and-bird duo. Tweety's S.O.S is highly recommended.
