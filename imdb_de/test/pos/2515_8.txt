In 1937, Darryl Zanuck, who recently moved out of Warner Brothers' production department, attempted to bring his newly-founded 20th Century Fox company, with its old bosses from Warners and MGM's Glittering Palace, on par. "This Is My Affair" was an attempt to exploit the current success of historic turn-of-the-century films ("San Francisco" "In Old Chicago"), and in retrospect it was quite successful. The plot is fascinating. A troublemaker, but a heroic naval officer (Robert Taylor) receives a secret order from President McKinley to uncover a ring of bank robbers paralyzing the American financial system. He finds the gang but falls in love with her female mascot (Barbara Stanwyck) and has to choose between love and duty. <br /> <br /> Not everything about this vintage movie works well, but overall it's a good deal of studio film making. The conspiracy gimmick would be borrowed by Kurt Vonnegut for "Mother Night" (the lead role in the book's film was brilliantly played by Nick Nolte) and seems to be quite credible, at least in the studio's confidence. As a fan of old movies, I'm always thrilled when I stumble on someone I've never met and "This is my affair" was no exception.
