I just watched it on DVD three times - once the "normal" way, once with the scenes in sequential order (in this mess of a film noir, the beginning, the middle and the end of the story intertwined) and once with the commentary the director. Pretty impressive. A bare-bones story told with more flair, energy, and substance than most of the high-budget, over-budget features released today. <br /> <br /> I think this is an even better movie than the following memento that turned me into Nolan. I can not wait to see what he does in his next movie, Insomnia, with a bigger budget (and bigger box office stars).
