A funny comedy by the best director, Oz Scott. The list of the eighties TV icons will continue to appear. Milano (who is the boss), Yothers (family ties), Stone (Mr. Belvedere), Robinson (night court), Jackee (227), D'abo (Wonder Years), Walston (Mr. Hand !!!). It is one of the funniest films of all time. Great lines, meaningless subplots, cheesy, bad behavior. It's a group of high school kids who have to pass the driver control. Mac of Night Court needs her to pass her final exam or he gets fired. Great performance from Brian Bloom as the funny guy Riko Conner, but nothing compared to B.D. Wongs Kiki (pronounced kee-chee). A great movie for all ages, it's so bad.
