I'm from Texas and live near Plano, where the actual deaths took place. I may be a bit biased to say that "Wasted" is a movie you just can not get out of your mind. <br /> <br /> Steel, Phoenix and Paul play their characters very realistically. They really believe that they are everyday high school students who happen to be heroin addicts. The drug content is also handled very graphically - although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose, and every time the characters move lower, the heart is broken. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. Once you see it, it stays with you!
