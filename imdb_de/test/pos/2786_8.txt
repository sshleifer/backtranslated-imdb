Surprising, witty, funny and totally captivating, the film takes on a little-known reality: that of the student who participates in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great as the story begins, of course it has a few lulls in the middle section, and the story sometimes deviates from the main character, but the viewer does not care - the movie is young, fresh and easy-hearted, though I do disagree with the idea that when you do Erasmus and come back, you are no longer part of this universe. But that's just me. The film is deep and at the same time very light. Cool and recommended.
