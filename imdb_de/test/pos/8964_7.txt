A great movie, a very worthy 7/10. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was in good health: the drinking congressman who saved Afghanistan from the communist oppressors! Based on a true story, we learn how the West throws money and weapons at a problem and expects it to go away. Well, it went away, if only temporarily. Look who we (the British, among others) are now fighting against the same people that the US gave arms, education and money in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This movie has always provoked political thoughts to people who see it, but it's a very beautiful story. As soon as the main goal is achieved, ie the communists are freed from Afghanistan, it becomes clear how quickly the plight of the people will be forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie was good, it was a deserved 7/10. It narrated the history of the Communist invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent US covert operation in detail and was well dramatized. Although it is a good movie, I will recommend it to people, but some people will not enjoy it. Especially a serious movie about good (US) v evil (Russia) is not your thing!
