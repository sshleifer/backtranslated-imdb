Meester Sharky, you look so ... normal. You would never get a table in this chic cocktail restaurant / bistro. On the other hand, I eat wine and pate every day. You like my fur coat with all the fine trimming? My huge golden rings of gold? Or maybe you like that blonde, as you say? Bombshells, all of them qualified in aerobics and naked petanques, decorating my long chestnut-brown velvety sofa like so many soft-boiled larks on a plate of fried goose liver pate and figs. You like? You can not have it! They are all mine. <br /> <br /> You will never uh like me. Domino was the best, except for Maman. They do not understand the art of lovemaking. Just look at your inferior mustache. It's almost funny for me not to think of that ridiculous edge in your stupid face as you sniff around Domino's love mound, like the piggy looking for truffles in the forest, the forest swaying and swaying in the hot winds of desire! You're losing Sharky again. <br /> <br /> If I fall in love with the women, they know, Sharky, I know. You learn, you learn, until you become a teacher. Not nano-math, the art of love. Domino was the seedling I watered. I have poured her so many times. Sharky everywhere. Her fragrant petals, her proud stalk everywhere. She will wither under her ridiculous hose, as if the souffl√© were taken out of the oven five minutes early. <br /> <br /> I have to go now, Sharky, you're boring me with your shameful behavior. They'll rinse the urinal like the stinking thing. <br /> <br /> Good chance!
