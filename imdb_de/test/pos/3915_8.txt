I saw this movie on the opening night and I liked it. I would probably have enjoyed it more if I had not sat with my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately I have not seen it yet) and talked through the whole thing. He said again and again that the movie was shit and that he was stupid. The thing is, he did not understand that the creators made fun of the horror genre with the movie. In every horror movie always a certain figure is shown. If they were not in the movie, you may not like it so much. The hallmarks are: <br /> <br /> "The main character": Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) "The friend of the main character": Wade (Jared Padalecki) "Sibling of the main character / (soon to be) reforming Jerk": Nick Chad Michael Murray) "The annoying Sluttish character": Paige (Paris Hilton) "Characters who just look pretty": Dalton (Jon Abrahams) & Blake (Robert Ri'chard) <br /> <With these characters it does easily predictable who will die and who will live. Of course you know who I typed with what I just typed. The movie could be predictable (in fact I had a pretty good idea who would only die by watching the trailer), but it was still fun. It may seem stupid (why is there sometimes a sugar mill in the middle of a deserted campsite that was not there at first?), But it is very easy to spot. The Comedy and the Gore were the perfect crowd for the faint-hearted, it gets bloody, do not get me wrong (less than "Final Destination 2"), but it works very well. As hot as the fire went up, the set went up Temperature could still burn the "wax".
