I grew up in New York and this show was shown at four years old. I had a half day of kindergarten and this was on WPIX Channel 11 in the afternoon. I loved the music and the stories and remember how I hummed them playing in the house. <br /> <br /> I've just watched part of an episode on YouTube and for a moment I could remember what it felt like to see these shows small. Of course, I stopped watching when I was in first grade because it was still on at school (then no VCRs or DVRs). I grew up and did not know that the show was still running until I was in 11th grade! <br /> <br /> I also had no idea that there were DVDs and wished my nieces and nephews were young enough to enjoy this show, but now they are all over the population or I would be all Buy DVD sets. That was so much better than many of today's children's shows.
