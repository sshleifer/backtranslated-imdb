This is a beautifully filmed film that questions the future of all indigenous peoples, especially the nomadic tribesmen. The film focuses on the saltmars of Tibet and moves at a pace that is unpleasant for some Western audiences. For some people, life is still at the same pace as it has been for thousands of years. This film follows a group of tribesmen on their annual two-month quest for salt. Their tribe lives its life in the traditional way (slowly by modern standards) and always takes into account the many gods. This is a remarkable film that will preserve a piece of what unfortunately can become history. Worth the time Do not be in a hurry when you see it.
