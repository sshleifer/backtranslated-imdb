Walking With Dinoasaurs is a new and exciting program in which the living dinosaurs are presented with amazing visual graphics. The information presented here is amazing. The moods in the series are changing to get your attention, eg. For example, dramatic music when fighting breaks out. Here is clear evidence of a cracking documentary! My biggest thanks to the authors, directors and producers and not to mention the other participants. If you stumble upon this video in stores, you should not just buy it for the graphics, but also for the extreme efforts and productive work the series has to offer. 10/10
