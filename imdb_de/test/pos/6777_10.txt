Many Americans are lazy and this has even been shown on DVD. Many of us do not like taking the time to read one and a half hours (or more) subtitles, so we decide not to see many foreign films. A movie that's absolutely worth your time, no matter how trivial a task you'd like to read for subtitles, is "The Green Butchers." It's by far the best foreign movie I've ever seen and also surpasses many American films I've seen lately. It's a complex situation, told in a remarkably simple and funny dialogue. The character depth derived in this movie is amazing. The way that Svend and Eigel (I'm sorry if they're misspelled) nourish each other's contrasting personalities is downright spectacular! The actors were well staffed and I sincerely hope that a sequel is considered ... it takes very little of Bjorne and her face ... just give me Svend and Eigel on a sort of trip with minor characters and more amazing dialogues! To the author of this beautiful script I say: write more! The story itself is pretty distorted, but you'll root for evil anyway ... without remorse. Please have a look at this movie!
