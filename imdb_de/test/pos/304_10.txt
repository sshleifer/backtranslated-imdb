Even in the entire movie theater dealing with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacob's Ladder, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver), you feel that we do not even know half of what happened. Even if you think about the horror, it feels inhuman. And a progress - or withdrawal? - The inhumanity it requires is an integral part of Apocalypse Now, Coppola's biggest and one of the most important films ever made. Locker is based on Joseph Conrad's classic "Heart of Darkness" (1902) of 1902, which records the loss of reason and the distortion of morality associated with the distance from civilization - a surface of beastly nature that is, so to speak, a "lord of Flying "is the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam. The story is about Willard, a general commissioned after his first service in Vietnam for a special mission to Cambodia. Willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in Saigon and is psychologically unable to return home. Nicky echoes in The Deer Hunter. So he is addressed: His mission is to assassinate a renegade Green Beret who has isolated himself in a remote outpost on the Nung River and has reportedly gone completely mad - worshiped by the natives like a god and killed indiscriminately. The name of this man is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (the best is Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). While Willard is traveling upriver with some soldiers on a soldier's boat, his witness of horror and madness-and the overwhelming futility of everything-leads to an uncanny sympathy and identification with Kurtz, even before they meet. At the time, Kurtz's methods are not really as wrong or as they should be, and they certainly do not seem too unusual or inappropriate. Apocalypse - a place beyond morality, the outpost at the end of the world. The loss of civilization, the loss of judgment, the self. Kurtz's soliloquy about a cruelty he has experienced as Green Beret and his later revelation are one of the most daunting and widely held speeches in cinematic history. The film is about the trauma, the human mind and its break point - here it is very similar to the Deer Hunter and just as well. However, Apocalypse takes the limits of what we can endure to a global level - Coppola's extensive footage from the damp, murky jungles of Cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopters amidst exploding woods and an orange sky - a peculiarly fitting Doors soundtrack beyond cool scenes on the river and an air raid on a village in which Wagner was blown up by loudspeakers (a scene that has gone down as one of the coolest, darkest, most humorous, and most senseless war scenes of all time) - all this adds to the sense of apocalypse - the end the world - and not somewhere in the future, but at the Apocalypse Now and forever. The stag hunter is much closer and more personal, you can even see it in the title, showing the overall effect that a trauma has on the individual's psyche, the collapse of the human soul and its ability to either surrender or surrender completely to the forces of darkness limp. That's why both movies are equivalent - they're two parts of it. In "Heart of Darkness" Kurtz is shown as a conflict between morality (civilization) and his inner cruelty. In the Apocalypse Now, Kurtz has left all conflicts behind. He is beyond good and evil. He has let go of morality, as a drowning man releases a saving hand in the moments before his death. Kurtz actually only waits for death and quotes T. S. Eliot in his temple, lost in the jungle. His last words and the words that were repeated at the end of the film are: "The horror ... the horror." It refers to the infinite emptiness of existence, the human psyche, and the pitch-black void in its own mind where atrocities are reborn. It's impossible to say in words what experience you get from watching this movie - in short, the experience Willard has on his journey. The outpost's final section, which is almost like his brother's scene in The Deer Hunter, is one of the deepest, quietest and most seductive things I've ever seen.
