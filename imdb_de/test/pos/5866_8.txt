There is only one racist joke in these Daffy Duck shorts. When Daffy Black Beauty rides, it's a black woman. I can partly understand why this joke was picked up because at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist, and even it was not illegal to discriminate against black people. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, "A Coy Decoy" is basically an entertaining, interesting short form in which Daffy meets characters in books and does things in books. I really liked this short time (despite the other reviewers here). The way Daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is a little disconcerting and at the same time very amusing. Porky is a beautiful installment of the episode, though it was not essential for him to be there. The wolf is an example of how people have been thinking about wolves these days, bloodthirsty, terrible animals that have never really been (unless they are very hungry). I also liked the style of the animation - and the theme of the episode. <br /> <br /> For people who are totally interested in Daffy Duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist humor in cartoons, enjoy "A Coy Decoy"! <br /> <br /> Available on YouTube.
