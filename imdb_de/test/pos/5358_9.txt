Wallace and Gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever made. The excellent mix of visual humor and claymation make "A Grand Day Out", "The Wrong Trousers" and "A Close Shave" the best animated films ever shown on television. Nick Park won several Oscars and countless other awards and became a popular man in the United States of America, but his influence on the United States was not great. After the third Wallace and Gromit short, there was all this speculation about a full-length Wallace and Gromit movie, but nothing had happened in years. In 2000, instead of Wallace and Gromit, we received another brilliant Claymation movie from Chicken, the Chicken Run, which was almost nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Maybe it was the success of this film that finally led Park to finally work on a project by Wallace and Gromit. 5 years later (this type of film takes a long time, you know) and a lot of anticipation. Wallace and Gromit finally appear on the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailer and marketing campaigns, this film provides so many opportunities. This movie will be a joy for both children and parents. Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit are one of the few films that are perfect for children and adults. This rather difficult technique is a technique that only Pixar has perfected, and DreamWorks has been in great trouble lately. Despite the DreamWorks logo tapped on the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff at Aardman Animations. Wallace and Gromit are the first companies to protect the harvest of the city's inhabitants from rabbit destruction. who seem to have been running wild and in large numbers lately. Their business has earned them a lot of respect from the others in the city, because a giant vegetable competition was fast approaching and the harvest had to be protected. Complications occur when Wallace tries to manipulate the rabbits so that they do not like vegetables, and then unleashes a great eating machine on the premises. It's up to Wallace and Gromit to find the giant beast and prevent it from eating through gardens and the approval of city dwellers. Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, who also caught the eye of a snob named Victor. Simple action yes, but there is more than you can see, you have to prepare yourself for some funny surprises, similar to the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons. <br /> <br /> In animation films with little dialogue, it's the animation that has to determine the tempo and mood of the movie. Although it only takes five years to produce just 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. There is a tremendous amount of detail that requires more than one consideration to truly be perceived. Even more incredible than the detailed and almost flawless animation is the truly incredible visual humor that is put into the film. Whether it's a creatively placed recording or regular labels in the funniest position or the oh-so-adorable bunnies that are constantly shown in the movie, most of Curse of the Were-Rabbit comes exclusively from the movie itself and catch all references before it's too late. Just imagine the movie Madagascar, except funnier much less pop culture references and better animation. <br /> <br /> Casting was great, even if it was not so important in a movie with little dialogue. Peter Sallis also does a wonderful job as Wallace, though there was not an outstanding quote in this film that could be used at any time (The Wrong Trousers: "It's the wrong pants, Gromit, and they went wrong!"). Ralph Fiennes does a great job, as the main villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy female star in the cult hit "Fight Club") give Wallace's love her lovely voice. Although the last chase in The Wrong Trousers failed, there were many action scenes in Curse of the Ware Rabbit, including a fantastically executed chase scene between Gromit and Victor Bad Dog. Finally, the rabbits actually steal the show in a few moments. Whether it's her cute facial expressions, her funny moves, or her howling, the bunnies in the movie even take the main stars with her. The funniest bunny in the movie is the "damned" bunny himself. By the end of the movie, he'd made the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Although not as catchy as "The Wrong Trousers," this movie is as good and entertaining as Chicken Run, unlike almost every movie that will be released this year It does not shoot at all and it only takes 85 minutes, but it contains so much joy and fun that everyone can see it and ask for more, there is very little wrong with the film, it was a pure pleasure to see this movie is a complete one Contrast to the decent, but vulgar, uncut, raw films that made a surprising amount of money at the beginning of the year (40-year-old maiden, Wedding Crashers and Sin City) and for families and those who want to feel harmless entertainment; Good thing, highly recommended, this is the best animated movie released this year and one of the best we've seen in this decade Wallace and Gromit: The Were Rabbit's Curse: completely harmless he fun from second 1 to second 5,100.
