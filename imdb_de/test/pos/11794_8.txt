People watch films for different reasons. This film did not have the big budget, there are no special effects, no chases and no explosions. Actually, the reality does not have much of it. At least not in my life. <br /> <br /> This is a very real movie about very real people. None of them are perfect in every way, but together they are put into a situation in which they learn to discover and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology because I am neither an expert nor exploit the full extent of my own brain. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie for the characters. It's brimming with a whole cast of wonderful, quirky people. <br /> <br /> Within the first three minutes Kiefer Sutherland plays the life of Detective Michael Hayden outstandingly and he constantly develops the character throughout the movie. Excellent acting, very credible. <br /> <br /> Henry Czerny could not have been better, and the relationship between his "Harvey" and Kiefer's "Mickey" reinforces the opposites of their characters. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the moody landlady "Mrs. Ramsay", I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends !!! <br /> <br /> There is one more host of these wonderful characters, but the place is limited here, so watch the movie enjoy it.
