This movie used to be on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember that I liked it. However, I did not have a good taste at the time (not to say I'm doing that now), so I can not vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10, but it had good music, so I gave it an extra point. Yes, it is worth seeing. I know that some fans of this film wonder what a particular song is - the one that appears when it is in a car accident. The song is "Play a Love Song" by the Jaguars and it is VERY hard to find and get. In fact, this movie is also. I can not find it anywhere online or on DVD or VHS. I would like to see it again, so I can guess if it is indeed a good movie. Well.
