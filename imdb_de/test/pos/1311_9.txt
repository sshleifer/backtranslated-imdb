I originally saw this on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic movie that impressed me. However, I have recently seen it on Irish television and there was an additional story by Roy Scheider ("We need a bigger boat!"). This ruined the movie for me. His booming monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if anything, the film takes brilliance. I wonder at the new DVD version that there would be no roy (for legal reasons?) That would deter people from buying. Well, believe me, the movie is much better for that! <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> Damian
