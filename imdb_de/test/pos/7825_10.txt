It's typical of people who complain about something when they do not mind ... So it's about a gay man falling into a woman. First of all ... This is a true story, so you can not say it's not believable. Second, it was written by a gay man, so the whole thing is just stupid against gays. I personally think that this was the best love story I have ever seen. And I'm very gay. I think that shows that real love is not just about looks and sex. And it has nothing against someone who is gay, hetero or different than many other shows. Maybe in Europe, we think that most of the TV here is a bit deeper and makes you think more than American television. Besides, we are not afraid to show certain things. <br /> <br /> you want something funny with one of the best englands (Lesley Sharp) and you want a decent believable love story without too much juice, this is for you. I know that I love it
