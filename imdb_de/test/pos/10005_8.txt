Maybe I read in too much, but I wonder how much hand Hongsheng had in developing the film. I mean, when telling a story that the main character is acting as himself, I'd think he'd be a heavy hand in writing, documenting, etc., and that would make her a bit biased. <br /> <br /> But. His family and friends may also have worked on the current details of Hongsheng's life. I think the best view would have been from the perspective of Hongsheng's family and friends. They saw his transformation and were not so messed up with drugs that they remember everything. <br /> <br /> As for Hongsheng, he appeared as a martyr because of his consequences from the Jesus Christ pose, who sacrificed his life (in the figurative sense, of course, he is obviously alive as he himself cast) to ensure the happiness of his family. Huh? <br /> <br /> The viewer sees him at his lowest point, maintaining a superiority complex. He lies on the lawn, which has come down from (during?) A high, with his father, he is looking at life and has visions of dragons at his window. He celebrates his freedom on a bike while he extends his arms and his head tilts forward. <br /> <br /> It's fabulous that he no longer has any drugs, but he's not a hero. He went from a high point of his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while he took drugs to come back somewhere in the middle. This same device is used in Ted Demme's "Blow", where the audience empathizes with the main character, who is shown as a flawed hero. <br /> <br /> "Quitting" ("Zuotian"), however, is a film that is especially recommended for its haunting soundtrack, outstanding acting and landscapes. But the best part is the feeling you get when what we call the House of Jia Hongsheng is actually a stage set for a play. The viewer feels as if Hongsheng's life is just a game told in many difficult parts.
