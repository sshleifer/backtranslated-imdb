These movies just do not get the credit they deserve. This is my 2nd all-time favorite movie (Stand By Me as 1st) The reason I saw this movie was because Wil Wheaton was there and he's my favorite person around the world this movie and also Sean Astin. I just saw it last night and it just surprised me. Everything in the movie is very extraordinary. The script, the drama, the script. I was 80% on the edge of my seat, and if my mother had not been in the room, I would have kept it perfectly every time Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) had died. I did not see that coming !! Ever !! I was really surprised when I heard that it was not really popular in the 90s. I was born a few years after it came out so of course I did not go to the cinemas, but I would have known if I had been alive. If one of my friends saw this, they would be like "um, okay?" But that's just why they are not cool enough to appreciate such work. If you have not seen this movie or want to see what the bomb is, you should watch this movie.
