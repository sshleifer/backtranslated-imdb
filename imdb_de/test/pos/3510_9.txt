I first saw this movie around 1990 as a kid, and it scared the Jesus. I loved it so much and wanted to get it in my hands. <br /> <br /> In 2002 I remembered that there was this movie, but I had no idea what its name was, so I went to the IM to read the section "Worth Knowing" and explained what that was about Movie went, and tried to determine the name of the film. At some point somebody told me on IMDb that I researched the movie and tried to buy it. At some point I got it on DVD, and I now keep this movie as one of my most valuable horror films. I really love it, and I think everyone watching it will be very scared in the forest next time. 10.9.
