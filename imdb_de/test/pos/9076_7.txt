This is definitely a good movie, unlike other people say. Peline and I have both seen the movie three times and the end is cheesy, but that's part of the package ... experimenting with death is the same as trying to challenge it. For those who want to watch a classic Kevin Bacon movie, please read it. take care of yourself from Istanbul. We write 10 lines if you really want us 2, but we think it's a waste of time. The rest of this review should not be taken seriously, as we only wrote it to fulfill the 10-line request (which is crazy), but we are friendly people and will therefore adapt to the rules set for us. So people do not look at this movie because we wrote 10 lines, but because it's good. and by the way we wrote 12 lines !!
