Yeah, it's not a great cinematic accomplishment, but Toy Soldiers is a fun and entertaining movie. The young cast does a great job with dramatic and comedic aspects of the story, and I especially liked Shawn Phelan as Derek / "Yogurt". I've seen this piece a lot over the years and I'll probably see more of it. Do not think too much and you will love it - have fun!
