So it's not a laureate, so what? Ever wanted to see a movie that was just stupid? "The Villain" and this could bring the list to the top. My husband says, "Jekyll and Hyde Together Again" is one of those movies that, if you "have been there and done that," think this parody of the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole movie is just fun. Nothing is sacred. Hospitals, Plastic Surgery, Howard Hughes ... There are ongoing gags to watch out for. To say that the film does not follow the book would be true, but then many really good movies take liberties with the published word. I recommend this movie to all the old "stoners" among us. We may be smarter now, but we will recognize and laugh about many of the people we (ourselves?) Knew about earlier.
