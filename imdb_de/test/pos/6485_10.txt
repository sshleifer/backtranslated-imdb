"... the beat is too strong ... we are now deaf mutant - like her", Rex Voorhas Ormine <br /> <br /> I am surprised that this film was beaten uniformly. Let me first discuss the virtues of "The Beat" and why you need to see this movie NOW. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this film is cheesy and "bad" in the traditional sense: the story is absurd, the poetry is stupid and the acting is inconsistent. <br /> <br /> But these are the CHARMS of the movie - all of these ingredients are the recipe for one of the 80's most UNWIRED CHEEZY FILMS. <br /> <br /> If the mention of "deaf mutants" does not arouse your interest, then perhaps this will be the case: What name is "Rex Voorhas Ormine"? It's such an unusual name (for North American audiences) that I said to myself, "even the names of the characters in this damned movie are damn stupid." <br /> <br /> Well, "The Beat" is so hilarious that the "meaning" and "symbolism" behind "Rex Voorhas Ormine" are not too subtle from Bart Waxman (the misguided guide you hate to hate) is disclosed. I will not spoil the revelation behind Rex's name, but please do not get upset, OK? <br /> <br /> All in all, the action is inconsistent (John Savage - who plays the "worried teacher", Mr. Ellsworth is pretty good, as is the guy who plays Bart Waxman, but the rest of the cast is That is, acting does NOT affect the film, so why? In every actor's performance there is a SINCERITY that makes the characters they play sexy. "Although the ideas are shitty, you still have the impression that the actors really try to do their best and as a result, the actors' sincerity succeeds when their acting fails (which is common). <br /> <br /> The homage to "beat poetry" in this film is bad, bad, But that's a good, good, good thing when it comes to entertainment, would you actually enjoy "better quality" or "decent" poetry - especially in a movie like this? <br /> <br /> People, that would be boring ( think of the droll they read to us in high school-sanitized to avoid "youthful corruption", politically conservative and without any critical analysis, etc.) Even if you do not like poetry or "arty" films (with all the "intellectual" attitudes that imply this) you most certainly can (and should) appreciate LUDICROUS POESRY in a WANNABE ART FILM !!!! How could you not enjoy the following? <br /> <br /> "Remember the roar of the dinosaur A woman is badly Scottish on the floor, oh the woman is so sad she washes her hands and then the door is waiting today, yes - today ! "<br /> <br /> Yes, that's an example of some of the remarkable poems that are generously sprinkled in" The Beat. " But what about the story, you ask? <br /> <br /> Well, the story is absurd. But that's the beauty of this movie. Apart from a few clich√©s, stereotypes and predictable plot points, there are enough unique elements in the plot / story to keep things interesting. Who is Rex? Where is he from? What the hell is he talking about? Dove mutants? Illiterate angels? Do Billy and Kate really understand what Rex says? Should the audience understand Rex and his poetry? (I've seen the movie several times and still have not figured it out.) <br /> <br /> Will bad poetry and high school talent shows really END GANG VIOLENCE? <br /> <br /> I guarantee that you have never seen anything like "The Beat" - a perfect combination of brilliantly poor poetry, mediocre but sincere acting and a "mythopoetic conquering gang violence" that EACH DURING EVERYTHING FILM EVER MADE MAL. <br /> <br /> Bonus for fans of classic NYC hardcore: The Cro-Mags are making a rare movie debut as "Iron Skulls" and it's a shame they play multiple songs. I wish they contained more concert material, but maybe this is an "extra" on the DVD "Collector's Edition" that I fantasize about. <br /> <br />
