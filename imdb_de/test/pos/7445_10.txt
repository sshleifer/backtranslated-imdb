Did not you play the game? Do not bother. This is for the Final Fantasy VII fans who beat the game, and no one else will appreciate this rare gem of a movie. Do you want to see and love it? Buy the game, hit it and have a look. When did you last see a great movie based on a video game? Well, that's it. <br /> <br /> The story takes place two years after the game and there are no short summaries to refresh your memory (though I doubt many would forget it) and it goes into one hour forty-one Minutes of adventure. <br /> <br /> All your favorite characters, Cait Sith, are also here. The voice output is excellent in the Japanese version, every character is perfectly cast. Cloud sounds tough and brutal, Tifa sounds nice and strong ... Aeris is also perfect, it sounds exactly as I imagined. Cait Sith sounds less sweet than I imagined, but it worked very well. <br /> <br /> The character models are spectacular, great textures and lighting. The environments are breathtaking and the battles are so choreographed that the matrix turns red. The amazing camera work occurs, for example, in the chases where your eyes only scream with satisfaction and your lungs breathe heavily without approval. <br /> <br /> The music is typical of Uematsu quality, which means first-class quality. The well-known saying of Advent Children's, which fits well with the visual aspects, is redesigned with familiar sounds. There is even an inside joke for the fans that includes music, and you will definitely make you smile. <br /> <br /> I did not watch it with subtitles because I'm half Japanese, so I can not say that the subtitles are good. In Japanese, however, the dialogue is very good and every word sounds as if it came from real creatures, not just actors. Impressive. I'll watch it again with subtitles one day to see the differences since I played both the Japanese and American releases of Final Fantasy VII. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Final Fantasy VII, buy this movie the day it comes out or pre-orders it. If you have not played the game yet, but would like to see this movie very bad, do not waste time: buy the game, hit it and come back for this DVD. I'm not telling you not to look at it, but to play the game. This makes the experience much better and does not leave you scratching in the dust. <br /> <br /> Come back, old friends - it's time to go on an adventure with your brave comrades!
