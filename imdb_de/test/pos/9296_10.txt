There are many factors to comedy to work: <br /> <br /> 1. Do not be afraid to take risks. 2. If somebody or anything deserves to enjoy it, keep it up and keep it going, <br /> <br /> ... but most of all: <br /> <br /> 3. BE FUN! <br /> <br /> "The pursuit of war for everything" succeeds in all three of these things. In fact, the show proved so popular and so funny that months after the first episode a first season DVD was released. I picked it up within days of publication and laughed on the floor with so many tears in my eyes. It's good, good! about the show - look at it, buy it, podcast it, whatever will make you see the world's best show in the world !!!!! <br />
