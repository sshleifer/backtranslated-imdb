Movie watchers often say that great movies have to have 3 memorable <br /> <br /> scenes to be truly great. Broadcast messages do not have three, but twice as many. This movie was written very well by James Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been better. I love this movie for many reasons. It's great because it makes you laugh and makes you cry. Albert Brooks has several <br /> <br /> great lines and many memorable scenes: # 1 (laughs) "I can sing and read, I sing while I read" with Midnight Train to <br /> <br / Georgia plays in the background. # 2 (laughs) The <br /> <br /> William Hurt character is told that "you really blew the Nookie down," <br /> <br /> after watching Hurt's rape report. # 3 (crying) When Aaron (A. Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and she can not end up with Hurt's character because he represents <br /> <br /> all about journalism, the Jayne considered negligible. Finally, # 4 (laughs), who can forget the scene where Aaron <br /> <br /> anchored the weekend news ... hilarious. This film should have won an Oscar! It has everything I love in <br /> <br /> films, great acting, smart script and even a cameo by Jack Nicholson!
