I also came to IMDB to comment on this movie, but so that I can sing his praise. I had never heard of this movie (it's so awfully packed it's easy to see why it could be passed over), but a good friend suggested it to me and I'm so glad he did. It's a gem of a movie. The actors are great (especially Kathy Bates and Meredith Eaton) and look like they're really having fun. Sure it was a bit over the top sometimes, but I can not remember the last time I laughed so hard or so many times for two hours. If you like to laugh, then you owe this movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
