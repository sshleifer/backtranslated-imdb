Ah, Batman Returns, is it possible that a sequel is almost as good as the original? It came pretty close with Batman Returns! We have great actors and a great plot with the Dark Knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton as Batman back and he is still great. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly staged. As much as I love and such an incredible actress Annette Benning is, she could not have been Catwoman, she does not really look that way. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as a penguin? He was just great and terrifying! <br /> <br /> Batman returns with a more affectionate community of Gotham City, celebrating Christmas with Max Shrek, played by a spooky Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who maltreats his beautiful secretary, Selina, who happens to hear too much in his office, causing him to push her out the window in the hope that she will die and never reveal the information that she knows the penguin and tries to love him Gotham If she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is willing to work with her cats on it! But there is another active villain, The Penguin, who is looking for his parents who have left him. Now he is looking for the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman prevent the two supervillains from doing their ugly deeds and prevent the mayor from destroying the city? <br /> <br /> You have to see! Batman Returns is as good as the original Batman, though the first classic is the true classic. And come on, I mean, we have Michelle in leather! Your classic moment to meet Batman and The Penguin "Meow" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines and sets! You will have a great time! Trust me! <br /> <br /> 9/10
