His music, especially what we hear here, is very slow. At about the time of Bach's death, composers had sought ways to slow down and slow down music: a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote plays that are as slow as possible for music. Of course you can cheat by writing a 4/4 march and then specifying a tempo of, for example, semiquaver = 1, but this tempo would not be the right tempo. Wagner and Mahler have written music that ALWAYS plays at a snail's pace. Given that slowness does not sound too slow, "snail's pace" is the wrong term. A critic wrote about a famous Wagner conductor: "He does not beat time, he beats eternity." As far as I know, this was a compliment. <br /> <br /> I have the feeling that the directors worked in the early 70's to make films as slow as possible: There is "Death in Venice" and "Solyaris". "I prefer the former One "Solyaris" goes over the line or a line and becomes sleepless, "Death in Venice" packs from beginning to end.There is not much happening, but everything happens in the right order, at the right pace, with photography you can lose yourself <br /> <br /> Another way of cheating on music is to write something that does not work I do not have any tempo at all - such music sounds slow, but it's actually just unmusical, like many movies are Feeling slow because they lack rhythm and form "Death in Venice" is not one of them - beautiful in every way, it will remind you of the timelessness and lack of context of quality - you do not need theoretical knowledge to respond to the mastery of Visconti like the incompetence of a lesser director. It's a great job.
