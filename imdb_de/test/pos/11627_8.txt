I have to drill Barney's head every day. Well, I think there must be reasons. Firstly, I am convinced that our children are not fools, they are just children, but they know (my one and a half year old son "chooses" what to see), which is nice or disgusting. Did you see the news? Do you think your children MUST know reality as it is? Maybe, maybe not; We (the adults) are responsible for what we want for our children and what we should teach them. A movie of drug dealers? News about massacres in the Middle East? Of course the children need to know that there is a real life, but ... they are children. give them some mercy. What do you want for her? If you want children to train weapons or find the best way to kill a neighbor, continue and challenge them with Lethal Weapon, Kill Bill or any manga anime. I want illusions for my son (do not get me wrong, I'm not saying that Barney and Friends is the best, in fact the show has many flaws, I read other comments and agree with most); Maybe happiness consists of dreams or illusions. At least I want to teach him to BE WITHOUT FEAR, BUT CAREFULLY that he learns to think and believe that everything is not serial killer or kidnapper, which is a reason for growth. At least he can be a little bit happy with his own dreams. So, parents, do not underestimate your children. You know what you want.
