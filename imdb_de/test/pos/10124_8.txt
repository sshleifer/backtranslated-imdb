Inspired by True Events, Radio is one of the best-played dramas I've ever seen. It's definitely one of the best movies of 2003. <br /> <br /> Radio stars Ed Harris, who nevertheless earned an Oscar in this film, as football coach Harold Jones. Coach Jones has taught football all his life and loves the game. However, Coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter, played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day Radio, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance since Men of Honor, is carried by the football field while the coach's team is training for the game. Some members of the team then tie the radio together and throw it into a building. Then they hit the building and eventually Coach Jones suspects something is wrong. He comes over and helps the frightened radio, and from this point on, Coach Jones and Radio share a special connection. The radio becomes the highlight of any football match and accepts participation in football matches and school events. He also becomes Coach Jones' main interest in life over football, which was prioritized first in front of his family and before the radio. <br /> <br /> The film deals with all sorts of problems of life, including the priorities of life, accepting people who they are, even if they are different, death and family relationships. The film touches on all these topics and more and is extremely well done, and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this movie. What I liked best about the radio was how real it felt. The performances were like seeing something live in front of your eyes. Radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. Some parts were pretty funny, while other parts were very serious and sad. <br /> <br /> Finally, I believe that the radio was very overlooked by critics who received only average ratings. You must have heads up there, because it's amazing how this movie can only get 2 star ratings and something like School of Rock can have 3 or 4 stars, it does not make sense to me. The performances, as I have mentioned before, are first class and Oscar worthy. In my opinion, both Ed Harris, who in my opinion is underestimated as an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr. should both receive a nomination for this film. Radio is one of my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big Hollywood movies. My final rating for Radio is 9/10.
