"Water" (2005), the final installment of Toronto-based Indian film director Deepa Mehta, is the elemental trilogy completed almost ten years after the release of the first controversial element "Fire" (1996) with a somewhat less controversial sequel. "1947: Earth "(1998). Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film "At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch" (1975), but it was her Canadian feature film about the lives of the Indians living in Canada who brought back their fame in the East with their birthright "Sam & Me" (1991). The "Camilla" award (1994) became internationally known with Bridget Fonda and the actress, who in 1990, at the age of 80, won an Oscar in the category "Best Actress". She paves the way for medium-aged actresses to hope for her portrayal of a stubborn old Jewish woman in 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989), the late Jessica Tandy. <br /> <br /> 'Camilla' dealt with a friendship between two women from two other areas of human life, a May / December friendship. 'Camilla' was Tandy's last picture; In the same year she died. <br /> <br /> International fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial "Fire" that spread under the false patriotic consciousness of Indian extremists. Mehta, who had already explored the friendship between two women in 'Camilla', went a step further to present a more intimate relationship between two lonely, neglected women. Modern India, the suburbs of the capital New Delhi, shows two brothers and their wives. The elder brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), who has joined a strange Hindu sect, leads a celibate life that remains faithful to his guru's genderless existence. The younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) has an extramarital relationship with a Chinese woman (Alice Poon). Thus, both the wives, Shabana Azmi, who play the wife of the older brother, and Nandita Das, the younger woman, are neglected in their own way. One had to lead a celibate life because of her husband's eccentricities, and the other, whose only interaction with her husband is sex, and nothing else. They live in a world of in-laws and are the only outsiders in the family who can not trust anyone else. Both women fall into each other's arms. That's the topic of lesbianism. If there was a man's shoulder from the outside, you would most likely have had a chance to fall into the arms of a man, but if you can not trust anyone else, it's obvious they need to support each other. It does not necessarily mean that all neglected women would end up adopting lesbianism; there was just that in relation to the two women in this context. All in all, the film is excellent and goes far deeper than just two women rolling in bed. The main focus is not on lesbianism in the film, but the plight of modern, neglected Indian wives. Even in the capital, the two female characters happen to have a sexual relationship. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Deepa Mehta's second part was the element of Mother Earth, published in India under the name '1947: Earth'. Another great movie by a great director, this time in Hindi language, as opposed to "Fire", written in English. <br /> <br /> Deepa Mehta has managed to complete the trilogy despite many problems recently after releasing the last installment "Water". No doubt it would be just as good as the other two.
