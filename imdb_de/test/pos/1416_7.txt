A short history of the time. The cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating, the thoughts are stimulated and the man ... brilliant. Nevertheless, I found it hard to enjoy this documentary. <br /> <br /> The way family members and professors are questioned feels so unnatural. These members were interviewed on specially built sets and uncomfortably run. Most of the time, their reports were very well traded and powerfully managed. The (deliberate) non-acceptance of questions manipulates the given information in a very hard and impersonal format. <br /> <br /> I do not know who was responsible for the interview, but they did a terrible job taking away the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Overall, still a fascinating documentary that is worth seeing, if only for the interesting concepts.
