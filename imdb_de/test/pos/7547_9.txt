The first of five St Trinian films (though the latter is usually reduced) is based on the student figures of artist Ronald Searle and features the wonderful Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton, headmistress, as well as her own brother. Much of the humor is outdated, but strangely touching and outrageous in today's PC world - the girls drink, play, smoke, and are later sold to wealthy Arabs, but always remain in office defeating bureaucrats, police, judges, and other founding members ailing throughout England. Perhaps because the films were so regularly on television, St. Trinians still inspires costume parties and club nights. The films have recurring characters, including PC Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). The precursor to the entire series is a charming film entitled "The Happiest Days of Your Life" (1950).
