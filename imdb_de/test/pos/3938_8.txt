I was really surprised to see that, unlike most documentary films, this was written, directed and produced by a film critic - Richard Schickel. Mostly, I know where movie critics were instrumental in making films. The films turn out to be bombs (Rex Reed with "Myra Breckenridge") and Roger Ebert ("Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" are excellent examples). In this case, however, the critics' powers are used for good and not evil - and the results are better (though that does not say much, since the films mentioned are among the worst films ever made). <Br /> <br /> The documentary is narrated by Clint Eastwood (a pretty good choice) and manages to discuss his long career - from his mute days to his death in the early 1960s. The only negatives, and they are minor, are that the film (like most film documentaries) is awfully short, and there's little about Gary Cooper as human beings - you really do not learn much about your life. As a nice overview of his films, however, it works very well.
