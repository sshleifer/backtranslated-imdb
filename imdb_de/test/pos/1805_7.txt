I have seen this movie a few times, and every time I look at it, it becomes even stranger and funnier. Maybe it's the lack of research in Nicolas Cage's character "Punk" or just the cheese dairy, because it was such a typical Eighties movie ... yet it's a sweet love story with extremely funny, unique characters. I think it's high up with "Fast Times" and "Weird Science" (Quintessence of the Eighties!)
