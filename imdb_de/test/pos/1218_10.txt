My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival. It was great. Stormy is a strong black woman and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. <br /> <br /> Rene is fine !!! Seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the price. Can someone pass on his contact information? <br /> <br /> My friend thinks Flex is the better of the two. She's been a fan of Flex for years, so she might be a bit biased. The cousins ​​were funny and as insignificant as Nana described them. LOL. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theater.
