The great Greta Garbo is in top form in her first talk. She is supported by the rest of the cast, including Charles Bickford, the sturdy sailor who conquers her heart. Ms. Garbo does a great job, as she usually does when she's the estranged daughter of a captain returning after fifteen years. In the cast is also the great actress Marie Dressler. A great movie!
