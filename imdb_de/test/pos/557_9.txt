Wayne Wang's directing may be the ingredient that made this film much more impressive to me than "Slums of Beverly Hills," which is remarkably similar to the ground. The interaction between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is fascinating. Real chemistry there. With this film, I managed to get myself into the dysfunctional life of these two women without feeling depressed. Susan Sarandon's character beats on the nerves that a narcissistic parent can touch with an insecure teenager. She manages to do this amazingly, without acting as crazy or deliberately sadistic. And Natalie Portman rejects any attack on her character's ego with the resigned grace of a smart, juxtaposed child, untouched by the smug cynicism of the Natasha Lyonne character in "Slums of Beverly Hills." Portman's character is a stressed-out teenager, an unusual creature in modern films. The film achieves a very satisfactory resolution, without trying too hard. I highly recommend this movie to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained.
