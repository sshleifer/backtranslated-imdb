Every year it's a much-anticipated hot-blooded big-budget title with the right combination of star, director and motif that fails miserably at the box office. This year it was Superman Returns. In 1982, it was Blade Runner. In 1957, it was Billy Wilder's "The Spirit of St. Louis," a movie that had it all - top director, big star, best-selling true story about an American hero - except enough audiences to cover its costs. Perhaps the public still remembered Lucky Lindy's anti-Semitism and his loud admiration for the achievements of Nazi Germany before the war (in the film that ends with his arrival in Paris before the legend became too bad). Maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just a guy stuck in a cockpit for two hours. Wilder and co-author Wendell Mayes are certainly aware of the dramatic pitfalls of Lindbergh's relatively uneventful flight, which alternates between a well-executed flashback structure, the most important points of his life, and the structure of the flight itself. Once the film is in the air, it is both surprising and exciting. He finds a real drama in his attempts to stay awake and to navigate without proper tools. He also builds a remarkable sense of anxiety that differs from nothing else in Wilder's filmography, combined with a real sense of epic: shots like the ominous thunderclouds over the hanger of the dark dawn Flight carry a real fear of premonition. Even the normally muted and problematic WarnerColor adds more to the movie than distracting. In addition to the superb use of CinemaScope, there is a remarkable score by Franz Waxman: majestic, exciting, but full of impenetrable threat skillfully used as part of the fabric of the film rather than just as a musical accompaniment. The film loses points because he hinted, even though he never directly said that this was a race for the Atlantic - in fact, Lindbergh was the third man to cross the Atlantic after Brits Alcock and Brown were almost completely surprised by the flight before eight Years - but it is still a remarkably exciting and enthralling adventure story that has earned the success it has never found.
