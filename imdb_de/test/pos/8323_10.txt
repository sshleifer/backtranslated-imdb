I saw this series in London TV in 1999 and was blown away. As another user commented - I would have liked to see this when I saw for the first time "Jurassic Park" - the life and death of dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. The CGs are very lifelike, and the variety of dinosaurs and habitats shown also makes them very educational. The series picks up on what's known about dinosaurs and adds many great ideas about "what it could have been." What I've missed was a small bar chart in a corner of the screen that moved between "fiction" and "fact" along with the narration and the pictures because one often asks oneself how much guesswork and how much pure fantasy is <br /> <br /> To get some clues about facts and fiction, you need to see the 50-minute "Making Of", which is not only very instructive about the CG Process is and gather the knowledge of paleontologists and include them in the series, which is also very funny (dinosaurs smoke cigarettes and complain about CG animators). <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend you to watch this series, before you go into the upcoming Disney Dinosaur movie or watch a Jurassic Park movie like this again, it will certainly make you more critical of these films, the Disney trailers looked particularly bad.
