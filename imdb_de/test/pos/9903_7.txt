I was fortunate enough to see this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival, and I have to say that I liked it a lot. When I asked the director if he had attended film school, I was very impressed that he had not. Films like these do not come from people without talent. To start in commercials and then produce a family comedy like this, real reach shows. I'll definitely keep an eye on what he does next. As befits a good indie movie, the movie is very character-driven. As for your average Hollywood movie, which is mainly controlled by Plot. The film revolves around a Jewish family in New York, the Applebaums, all of whom have been invited to the "suicide party" of their fathers. The film is packed with funny, fast, thrilling conversations. The fact that the small Jewish family is obsessed with being Jewish and anyone who is Jewish justifies the unrealistic situation of a "suicide" party. Director Jeff Hare does a wonderful job of pulling the characters out of the actors and bringing them to life on screen. The production design brings the sets to life with great attention to detail and makes the ambience look like a home that has been inhabited for 40 years. Editing keeps the dialogue up to date so you sit in your seat wondering who's going to stab someone with the next funny phrase or punch line. And when appropriate, the movie slows down to allow the audience to delve deeper into the meanings and motivations hidden in these loveable characters. If you're a fan of Woody Allen or films like "As Good As It Gets," watch this movie.
