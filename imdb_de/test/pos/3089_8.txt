Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary film by German filmmaker Werner Herzog, shot over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be heard when the commentary is on. It is a visual celebration of North African (mostly Sahara) images that is timeless. You just could not say that it was made more than 35 years ago. The film's soundtrack, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel) and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also gives it timeless quality. The narrative of three different German narrators (German film historian Lotte Eisner, Eugen Des Montagnes and Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg) is solid, and Herzog goes on and on from Eisner's importance for this project itself and the film history, but the English continues The Spokesman of the translation James William Gledhill has a voice that seems downright depressing, which makes it much more suitable for this project, even though much of the text in both languages ​​is rather superfluous. Yes, the faux biblical sounds of Popul Vuh Mayan's creation myth in the first part of the film, Creation, are interesting, but the text Duke wrote for the remaining two parts (Paradise and The Golden Age), along with quotes from a German poet Duke Names like Manfred Eigendorf, seems almost a satire of the gloomy tone of the first part. The film, it seems, was assembled while filming several other Herzog projects - the fictitious Even Dwarfs Started Small and the documentaries The Land Of Silence & Darkness and The Flying Doctors Of East Africa The beauty of this film includes aerial footage of a flamingo mating lake from afar, conveying an eerie, uncanny sense, rocking over the Duke in his commentary. This eerie feeling is present right at the beginning of the film, when several aircraft landed on a runway in the desert. Their images gradually blur as the heat of the floor increases and amplify the distorting waves that affect the images. That this movie in the? Quatsi films by Godfrey Reggio was influential is an understatement. While Reggio, however, is content to just throw pictures at you, Herzog has an ability that only the American filmmaker Terrence Malick has: to make of the juxtaposition of images and words a completely self-contained vocabulary that relies on emotions is. first push The analysis may fail if forced to make such efforts. Herzog often does not even understand why his art is so good. The best he often does is completely unconscious and hypnotic. For this reason, his contempt for the Lowest Common Denominator Pap of Hollywood is openly stated in the commentary. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best illustration of this is a scene in which Duke in the commentary made us follow a strict drought in Cameroon. It shows the jerky carcasses of cattle, and Duke describes the unbearable stink. However, the viewer can see this from the images, the blackness of the sun-dried parts of animals, and the blanched bones. But even in this commentary Herzog focuses on the stench, not on a deeper meaning. He is content that you can learn and interpret what you want and his work, such as the almost erotically feminized forms of sand dunes reminiscent of a scene from Ingmar Bergman's Hour Of The Wolf, in Max Von Sydow his hand passes Ingrid Thulin's beautiful curves of the naked body. But the archetypal image in this film, which symbolizes much of Herzog's career, is like a mirage of a distant car driving back and forth on the surface of a seemingly seeming lake. It is deep, hypnotic, illusory, elusive, supernatural and yet real, just like Duke, the believer, who comes from a family of militant atheists. But then it ends like everything else.
