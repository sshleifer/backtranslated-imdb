This is the latest entry in the long series of films with French agent O.S.S. 117 (the French answer to James Bond). Launched in the early '50s, the series spawned at least eight films (none ever released in the US). "O.S.S17: Cairo, Nest Of Spies" is a breezy little comedy that should not ... repeat, should be taken too seriously. Our protagonist is in the middle of a spy hunt in Egypt (with Morroco entering Egypt) to find out if a longtime friend has been lost. What follows is the standard of James Bond / Inspector Cloussou. Although our husband is something of a xenophobic, sexist, homophobic person, she is treated as a pure farce (as I said, do not take her too seriously). Although there is a bit of rough language and cartoons violence, it is basically okay for older children (over 12 years). As mentioned in the subject line, sit back, pass the popcorn and just enjoy it.
