I remember seeing the police cadre! when it first appeared on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many gag, non-sequitur and scripts that are filled with puns. In one episode there was a line in which a man named Once was shot twice. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run, but a network executive said the show demanded too much attention from the audience because in each episode the gag of the audience was too big. One I remember was in the opening, where the title of the episode is different from the one shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen's depiction of Frank Drebin was deadly but very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus was not bad in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible as Norberg. But the only character to notice was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy, played by William Duell. After consulting Drebin came cameos from Dick Clark, dr. Joyce Brothers and Dodger Manager Tommy LaSorda. <br /> <br /> Even if the police squad! had a short life at ABC and the Zucker Brothers did not give up on the concept that turned out to be even more successful in the Naked Gun movie. I'll close with a normal toggle. Freeze the end here.
