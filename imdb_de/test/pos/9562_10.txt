If you are watching this movie for the first time, you may hate it, but the second time you see this movie, I guarantee everyone laughs. The owners of the dogs are so eclectic that you can not help but look at them and laugh. From the smallest toy poodle to the announcer everything will make you laugh. And you can learn every nut that exists!
