This film was not really about clich√©s, dance moves or pickup lines. This film was about the vulnerability of people's hearts. It was hard to believe Kevin James could play a convincing role that would gratify Will Smith without action and that such a trite movie genre could be so successful. I do not mean to be overly popular with this movie - it was not groundbreaking in any way - but it was a worth watching movie. Was it believable? No, New York could not be that easy, and there has not been a human being in history who has the "Hutzpah" of Hitch. Sure, there are bar tunnels, but none that can get chicks at all times - except for those in seven figures, of course. What worked best for this movie was its focus on the dramatic side of things, not just the comedy. No doubt it was two funny hours. But it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat, dive into the characters and smile.
