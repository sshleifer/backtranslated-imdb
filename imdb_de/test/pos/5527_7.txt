But George and Gracie's are not among them. The film is fun and the pool table scene with WC Fields must be the funniest I've ever seen, but Gracie and George are more irritating than funny in their roles, in part because of script shortage and partly because of their interpretation. I gave him for the rest of the cast is a 7 out of 10. WC is a treasure of comedic timing and energy into this.
