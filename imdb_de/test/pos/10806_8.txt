This is a great movie to watch as he was so kindly directed by Andrzej Wajda, but at the same time I wish the film had a bit more depth in its story. It's a historically relevant film about the last days of the French Revolution, but the film forgets to focus on the motivations of the character, which may make the film a bit too flat to be considered as a brilliant and relevant film it does not look any less great the movie. It's done with passion and eye for detail. Every aspect of the movie looks good, like settings, costumes and camera work. <br /> <br /> Even the story is still so powerful, although at the same time it could have been much better and better performing with slightly more character development and insight into historical information. If you are fully familiar with the French Revolution and especially with the stories of Danton and Robespierre, this movie is the perfect movie you can watch. <br /> <br /> It's a little bit typical of a French movie, a story slow and subtle, without going into too much detail. This often works charmingly, but in this case, the movie could have really brought more depth. Besides, this film is still a good example of French cinema, although it is run by a Polish director and also plays many Polish actors in it. <br/> <br/> GÃ©rard Depardieu is great at his role, though the film also decides to focus on many other characters. The movie may have a bit too many characters, but every performance is a great one, so this does not really turn out to be a big deal, except that the story gets a bit slower at certain points. <br /> <A great movie that could have been brilliant. <br /> <br /> 8/10
