This film was aimed at two goals: to make a political point and to tell an eerie adventure story. It's often difficult to formulate a political point of view and still have a good story to tell (look at Ellen's highly political but rarely entertaining final season). Beyond Yangon, there is a balance between politics and storytelling. <br /> <br /> I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, and knew something about the oppressive political situation in Burma, so the political message The film was mostly a dramatization of what I already have knew. But I thought the film would have spoken well about Aung San Suu Kyi and the mostly faceless dictators who have been trying to silence them for years. The instrument of presenting an unknown setting through the eyes of a character that viewers can identify with is quite commonplace, but in this film, that's quite well done. <br /> <br /> Of course, the true measure of the movie was its entertainment value. Arquette was distinguished as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant, unknown place to free her from the depression due to the violent death of her husband and son. She is convincingly detached and depressed. Her grieving condition gives her a clear reason for her scattered wanderings into a dangerous situation she does not understand, something she would otherwise be too intelligent to handle. <br /> <br /> Once the dangers become so It is obvious that she herself can see through the cloud of mourning. She is trapped and has no easy escape. This takes her on an adventurous path where she needs her intelligence to survive. The writers deserve a lot of credit for making them intelligent and resourceful enough to cope with many dangerous situations while still finding a plausible reason to be stupid enough to get into trouble at all. The direction is also strong and keeps the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of dictatorship. <br /> <br /> This movie had some additional effects on me and my wife because of other events of the same time. We prepared for a trip to India and heard news about Western tourists taken hostage by a terrorist group in India. To avoid isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is a very different matter from fleeing an oppressive dictatorship. The movie and the news, however, shared the element of avoiding dangers in a foreign land. This common feature gave the film a meaning that went beyond the power of its own nifty storytelling. The film shows the worst nightmare of international tourists.
