A word for it. Hilarious I have not seen in such a movie for a long time. In some places in the movie I totally forgot that it is a movie. I just felt like I was watching Viva La Bam again or even saying my own friend was going through something like that. It was realistic and I liked how Bam, Ryan, Raab, Rake and Brandon and the other guys did not exert too much effort. For me they just behaved like their famous idiots. There were some scenes that I loved more than others, like Raab in the shower, holy, I laughed so much. Honestly, he was probably my favorite character next to Bam. He really made the movie a little bit weirder in my opinion. It's basically a must for all fans of the CKY crew:]
