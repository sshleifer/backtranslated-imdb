I really enjoyed this movie. I'm really into movies where women kick their ass a lot, so this movie already had my hope for a decent conversation. My hopes were met in less than 20 minutes. The action, the humor and the joke that contained this movie easily made it one of my favorite movies of all time. There was Sam Jackson and his undeniable screen presence, Geena Davis, as I've never seen her before, who demanded your respect and made it flatter to take it, even if you did not want to. Geena plays Samantha Caine, an amnesic woman who desperately needs to remember something from her past, but quickly realizes that she wants to find out more the more she wants to forget, and is eventually consumed until Samantha is finally more and only Charly is left. But can Charly and Sam, two completely different women, possibly exist in the same body? We have characters who go in and out of the movie, both sides of Sam / Charly like Sam Jackson and Craig Bierko. Craig is also irresistible as Timothy, the sexy villain without conscience. <br /> <br /> This movie was perfectly staffed and perfectly played, exaggerated and wonderfully entertaining. They observe the impossible and applaud when it happens. SO worth your time. Look at it, you will not be sorry.
