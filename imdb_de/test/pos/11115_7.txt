I expected FAME to be an uplifting movie, but it ended up the opposite. The overall picture that follows the lives of several determined students attending a performing arts school has great potential. However, FAME builds up its characters beautifully and leaves so many questions when it's over. I was very surprised when the final scene appeared - we thought the DVD skipped or something. All characters have internal and external conflicts, and virtually none of them will be resolved when the movie ends! You may think there are too many characters, but there are probably too many scenes. It is obvious that the film was cut and shortened because sometimes it lacks the transition. I think Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I have really connected with the ambition of her character and followed her heart. Boyd Gaines as Michael, the stereotypical poor student who can not read but is a divine dancer, is also very good. I did not really like Irene Cara's character from Coco, but that's not Cara's fault, as her script is weak and her character is not pronounced. Her voice is beautiful, and when you hear her songs, you have to watch the whole movie. In summary, the movie could use many improvements, but the quality actors and great music deserve their place in movie history.
