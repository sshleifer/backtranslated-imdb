This classic has so many great one-liners and unintentionally funny scenes that I do not even know where to start. If you want advice on dating, it is here. Just ignore the person you want and spit out classic lines like "Chicken's good ... I like chicken". Before you know it, you have a one-nighter in a basement (it's a beautiful basement) with a woman 35 years younger than you. Bronson does it all in this movie. He buys a car for no good reason, just to kill two gang members ... pay with "CASH" ... chunnng ... He buys an ice cream, simply because "that's America, isn 'It wastes someone called" the giggler - he laughs when he runs "just because he stole his camera - by the way, this" giggler "is so fast that Bronson's regular gun can not even catch up with him, he has to order a special gun just to make it difficult He's just getting cleaned up so he can eat a really stinking meal (stuffed cabbage) in a rat trap with some old people who want to wear heavy clothes at 90 degrees weather. He always seems to find a crowbar when he needs one (and it's the same one!) And last but not least, he always seems to have a rocket launcher available just in case he has to blow away Richie Cunningham's older brother Chuck, de r is now tightened and urgently needs a makeover. If you have seen this classic, it will all make sense. All I can say is enjoyment! "I owed you this one DUDE"
