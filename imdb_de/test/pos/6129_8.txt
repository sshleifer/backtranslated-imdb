Like anyone who has heard radio reports of the Pearl Harbor attack, anyone who has ever seen PINK FLAMINGOS can tell exactly where they were when they saw him for the first time - and about thirty years later, the movie is still one of the most unspeakable heinous, vile, repulsive and funny-comic films ever set on celluloid to test the toughest stomachs and the toughest funny bones around. PINK FLAMINGOS tells the story of two families around the boulevard title " The Filthiest People Alive "fight. How dirty can they be? Plenty: The movie includes everything from having sex with chickens to a remarkable display of rectal control to a lot of help from Doggie doo, and I guarantee you will not want to eat an egg after a few weeks. See it. <br /> <br /> The cast is either wonderful, cruel or cruelly wonderful, depending on how you look at it. Of course, the star is divine ... and to refer to goddess as the BIGGEST drag queen on the planet would be the understatement of the year. She's a mammoth creature who's got BIG eye make-up, BIG orange hair and BIG expressions - she's the Charleton Heston of Drag and she's almost running down a jogger to brush on a man's front lawn, or Amazing Buyers In real life, while walking on a Baltimore sidewalk, she is both inexpressible and inexpressibly funny. Other performers included Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills and the ever-dreadful Edith Massey as members of the Divines family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary as the white, slavish couple selling baby defying Divines status. <br /> <br /> It should be fairly obvious that PINK FLAMINGOS is not exactly a movie that appeals to everyone, and viewers who know director John Waters only through later films like HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will experience a big jolt , But if you want to see something completely different that even Monty Python can not imagine, this is the film for you. Just make sure you eat something before you see it, as you probably will not want to eat after that - and you may want to keep a Barf bag handy just in case. <br/> <br/> Gary F.
