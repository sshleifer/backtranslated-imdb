That's a great story. Although there are some Jimmy Stewart Cornball parts, most of the time, it's a compelling story about a person with a compelling drive, vision and adventure - to say the least. The bottom line is that it's one of my favorites I've looked at, and I've probably done that dozens of times - that is, until somebody stole it from a bag I left on a plane to California on a plane! <br /> <br /> Some have commented too many flashbacks, but I do not know of a better way to keep a long flight interesting. For those of us who actually fly, the flight can make hours of boredom and moments of horror. I did not want to see the flight shortened at all. The oppressive need for sleep and the drone and the loneliness in the area are part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are many areas I like most, including the launch of Long Island and the night landing in Paris (Wow, things have changed a lot since then with us and the French!). The airplane construction scenes and the record-breaking flight from San Diego are just as interesting as the incident over the Atlantic in ice (which I believe is not quite true, but happened on the flight to San Diego). <br /> <br /> One has the feeling that one of Lindbergh's biggest advantages is both his enlightened followers and his perseverance. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines that ring in my head from time to time include "Pull the chocks!" in the starting scene and "I hope I do not have to use it that way" when he describes the submarine-like "periscope" to the lady who lent him a mirror so he can better see his overhead instruments. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone, but definitely for me. I hope they are on DVD soon so I can replace my stolen version!
