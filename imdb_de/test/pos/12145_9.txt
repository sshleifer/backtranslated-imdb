Classe Tous Risques (The Great Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I watch a film by Jean-Pierre Melville, which I should see as soon as possible. Since discovering Melville and seemingly working backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to mistake this as one of his films, but it was made in 1960 by Claude Sautet before Melville came and claimed his claim French Neo-Noir. <br /> <br /> Classe Tous Risques has two of the best lead men of the day, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster living in exile in Italy, with his wife and two children who want to return to Paris because the police are approaching him. After a roaring and quick opening with a big surprise, Abel is finally connected with Eric Stark (Belmondo), who wants to get into the criminal underworld. Abel's chauffeur becomes strong and ultimately the only friend in an underworld who turns Abel back to Abel after all he has done and gone through. The film shows the duality of the two men. The older Abel at the end of his time, after the tragedy struck him, and the younger Eric started in the same way as Abel and fell in love with a beautiful woman who, after all, held on to her husband the world of which they are a part. It never ends nicely for her or her relatives. It's one thing to see a single criminal come to his death, it's different if he has loved ones he wants to take with them. Much like Melville's film, the seemingly simple story becomes more complicated with it. As usual, as I feel with Melville's films, my head turned (in a good way) and wanted to look it up again to find what I had missed the first time. Classe Tous Risques is definitely a goalkeeper.
