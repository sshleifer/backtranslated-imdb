Sheba Baby is most likely always underestimated because she has a pg rating rather than the usual r rating given to a Grier movie. all the pg means is that Pam does not pick up her top, but she takes off her top in every other movie she's in. it's more exciting than Coffy, more action. It's slow, but by the time she's on the screen, the thrill has started. Like Dolemite d'urville, Martin is trying hard to get Sheba's father, but she does not. she is leading a one-woman war against martin and his buddies. The best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car that I'm still laughing at. i thought it was stupid because of the pg rating, but i was wrong, it replaces sex by violence and in a blaxplotationsfilm that can only be good!
