I found this movie incredible. I was a bit skeptical because I really had no idea what it was about, but it was a nice story. I cried a lot and laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> I think it's very important to make films that deal with the Holocaust and its effects on people (just 60 years ago!) I was in Germany and Eastern Europe and have the Holocaust studied, so this movie has meant a lot to me. I think this movie did an amazing job in capturing that story (I'm not going to go into detail, I do not want to ruin it). But I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a movie to take their attitude towards things.
