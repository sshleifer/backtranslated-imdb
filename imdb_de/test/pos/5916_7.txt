From director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot) I can see that this is an undervalued and underrated film that can be seen. This is the biographical story of Charles Augustus 'Slim' Lindbergh (James Stewart), who wanted to be the first man in 1927 to cross the New York solo flight across the Atlantic and reach Paris in a small cockpit. For the first half hour or whatever, Lindbergh sees the permission to do so, and the construction of the aircraft named "The Spirit of St. Louis" and the necessary preparations. Then, of course, the rest sees his dangerous journey over the journey, overcoming fatigue, almost loss of fuel, and moments of loss of orientation, but he succeeded. Also with Murray Hamilton as Bud Gurney, Patricia Smith as Mirror Girl, Bartlett Robinson as Benjamin Frank Mahoney, Robert Cornthwaite as Harry Knight, Sheila Bond as a model / dancer, Marc Connelly as Father Hussman, Arthur Space as Donald Hall, Harlan Warde as Boedecker and Dabbs Greer as Goldsborough. Apparently Lindbergh was a bit younger, so Stewart was a bit too old to play, but on the other hand, you can not think of anyone else who could do it better. It's a funny and emotional drama where Stewart (as always) is awesome, great music by Frank Waxman and a good sense of Wilder, a good little-known gem. It was nominated for Best Special Effects Oscar (the only award ever given). James Stewart was number 12 in the 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was # 3 at 100, 100 stars - Men and he was # 13 at The World's Greatest Actor. Very well!
