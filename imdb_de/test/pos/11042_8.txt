039: Anna Christie (1930) - published on 21.2.1930; viewed 10.03.06 <br /> <br /> 24th October 1929: Black Thursday crashes the stock market. Now the country and the world are looking to Hollywood to escape the global economic crisis. <br /> <br /> BIRTHDOTS: Anne Frank, June Carter, Yasser Arafat, Bob Newhart, Barbara Walters, Doris Roberts, Ed Asner, Dick Clark, Roy E. Disney and Gene Hackman. <br /> <br/> DOUG: Finally, our Odyssey continues with the first sound film by Greta Garbo, a simple character study called Anna Christie. An excellent performance from Mrs. Garbo, who immediately showed that her talents could be taken from the quiet time (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix does not seem to occupy her.) How strange. I've always noticed how the Swedish accent sounds like replacing the letter J with a Y sound. Anna is the only character I liked. I did not really care about her alienated father or her potential suitor. It looks like the sound recording systems are getting better (nobody leans into the mystery box), but the camera still does not move. We will be sure to change that as our odyssey continues. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Our first film of the thirties is the first sound film of the dumb stars Greta Garbo, Anna Christie. This is a very simple movie with only five different locations where we spend a long time watching the 89-minute movie, often with a static camera. It was great to see Marie Dressler in the sound too, and pretty weird, because what we hear is an endless chain of warm, but intoxicated bows. I really enjoyed the performance of Garbo because she supports the movie even in the slimmest moments. I did not really like George Marion or Charles Bickford, maybe because I did not like any of them. So I was relieved and excited when Anna finally got up for herself and showed them she was not one of them, her alienated father or her muscular Irish boyfriend. It's also great to see that well-known silent screenwriter Frances Marion has not missed a step from breastfeeding to sound. <br /> <br /> Last movie: Speedy (1928). Last movie chronologically: The Love Parade (1929). Next movie: The Blue Angel (1930).
