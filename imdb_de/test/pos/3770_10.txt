A mix of 70s humor with parody of medicine and classic plot. As I've often said about this strip - if you do not understand it - you're so lame ... Classical lines like (parapharsed) "I have this erection and it does not go away, no matter how many times I do it a nurse, what can you give me for it? "Sister responds" All I have is $ 5 and my wedding ring ... "Great soundtrack. The classic "Hyde has nothing to hide". Remains surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original is a joke in the way ..... I met no one with an IQ above 115 who does not find him hysterical. <br /> <br />
