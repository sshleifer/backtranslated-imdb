Rush-in-Rio DVD is an overdue concert release that is both compelling and disappointing. This smooth two-disc set shows Rush at its best. After 30 years refining their unique sound, it's great to have this album by one of the most talented rock bands of all time. The concert features more than two dozen songs, a documentary and three songs with multi-angle viewing Packed in a double-folded holder with a sleeve and a small insert, it is very cheap for the amount of material it contains. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Rush from the late seventies to early eighties and this DVD is capitalized, with half of the show highlighting songs from that time. I will not list the songs if you want to be surprised. If you've been on the Vapor Trails Tour, you know what they're going to play. <br /> <br /> If you play in Rio to its biggest audience of all time, Rush is here a big crowd pleaser. In fact, this was one of the first things that struck me as to what makes this show so special. During most of this two-hour concert you will hear and see the crowd actively singing and dancing to the music. First of all, it's encouraging to see fans giving Rush a well-deserved response. But after a few songs I was ready to hear and see more of the band and less of the crowd. This is in no way a slam of the lot of Rio. More power for her! It is a criticism of the last cut of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my second main reason "I hate it". The video editing is terrible in my opinion. Apart from the multi-angle view bonus cuts, the entire show is a blast of visual chaos. It's as if the director wanted to see how spastic he could make it. I count constantly changing camera angles between every second and four seconds! After about three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. That's a pity, because I would have loved to go through the whole show like I did last year at the concert. Maybe this quick cut is the latest craze for concert DVDs, but I really think that this is a nuisance and a distraction from the overall experience. As mentioned earlier, I would not mind discussing a song or two, but the entire visual aspect of this CD is in a hurry or RUSHed. It's ironic because all of the previous concert clips I've seen from Rush, mainly from Moving Pictures, are strictly filmed directly, with little switching. It's almost boring, visually. This DVD has taken it to the other extreme. I know that many die-hard Rush fans will vehemently disagree with my statements, but that's just my impression. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you are a Rush fan, you are buying this DVD regardless of my review or any other one. I would still have bought it after reading my review. Just do not expect a "normal" concert. Who knows, the above things do not bother you.
