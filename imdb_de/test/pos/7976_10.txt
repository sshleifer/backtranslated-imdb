If you like shooting western, this is a goalkeeper. I found the movie funny to see and see people I have not seen for some time. I'm not an expert, but I enjoyed acting. The city and props, etc., seemed to fit the time and type of city one would experience at the border. This is not western, not enough people and budget. The costumes and firearms were right for the time! I expect to see the young actors again in the future. Rachel, Chance, Rebekah and Kirby were great. The SASS members (Single Action Shooting Society) who contributed to these efforts were pretty good. Hope to see more.
