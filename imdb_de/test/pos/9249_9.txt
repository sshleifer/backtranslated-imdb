I'm a bit biased because I show up in this movie, but I loved it, and I'm only in about seven minutes and not nearly the most interesting part. The film is an honest and intriguing depiction of a classy independent group of filmmakers who want to make a lovable movie. It is also a report of inflated expectations and fallen heroes. The interviews are well patched in the editing. The different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of a person. The interviews are shot in a pretty interesting way, which makes the movie visually satisfying. Definitely a worthwhile movie. I hope it goes around.
