Years ago I read the book "A Máquina" (The Machine). As I read this little book over and over again, I could never stop being intrigued by the writer's imagination and the richness of Brazilian culture. When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorite books! Fortunately, my fears were unjustified, and the film is such a wonderful and delicate work of art. <br /> <br /> I can not remember any other movie that brought tears to my eyes for the beauty of the text. Nor can I remember such a powerful performance as Gustavo Falcão's. <br /> <br /> You can see and feel how colossal his love for Karina is. You can see that he will move mountains and do everything for this love. <br /> <br /> See this movie, see it through the eyes of the child that lives in you, enchant yourself!
