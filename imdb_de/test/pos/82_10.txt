When the circus enters the city and places the lion's cage directly over Bugs Bunny's house, bugs end up somewhere within reach between freaky and unflinching. Despite the title "Acrobatty Bunny", it is only at the end when Bugs and the lion play acrobatics. But even in advance, it's pretty funny what makes bugs so as not to get eaten. Somehow he always manages to use the weakness of the other character against him and then draw all suitable items from nowhere! Bugs later landed in the circus in "Big Top Bunny". I liked this one better because the medication was somewhat depressed by giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know it was during the Cold War, but still). I recommend this. <br /> <br /> And in the end, we can confirm that there will never be Aloha Oe for this cartoon.
