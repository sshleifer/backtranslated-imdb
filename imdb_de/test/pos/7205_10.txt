It's hard to make a movie about a comic. It's extremely difficult to make a good movie about a comic. A good movie about Asterix and Obelix was made. <br /> <br /> This film shows that the French know how to make one: a) funny, b) funny, c) nice, d) excellent movie. The acting is no less than great, the sunny feeling for the whole movie is perfect. A must! This must just be the funniest thing that's come out since we started the new millennium. 10/10
