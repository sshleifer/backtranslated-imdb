Back to the "good old days" of 1971, we can vividly remember when we were treated to a full season by Charles Chaplin in the cinema. That's what the promo guy called it when we saw him on someone's old talk show. (We can not quite remember who it was, either MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest talked about Sir Charles' career and how his films have been since the exclusion of the former "exile" of 1952 were out of service. Little Tramp 'from Los Estados Unidos because he is an "unwanted alien". (No, Schultz, he is NOT from another planet!). CHARLIE was considered "subversive" for his interest and open examination of various political and economic systems: everything from the anarchist movement of the 1920's (and earlier) to the technocracy to socialism in its various forms was a fair discussion point at Chaplin's parties in Hollywood, which of course means the importance of incorporating the Soviet style, which we commonly call communism. <br /> <br /> CONNECTION Mr Chaplin's location has been affected by a small detail. He had never become an American citizen. <br /> <br /> ANYHOW, Enough of that background already! SINNING to say that he had become "Persona Non Free" in the United States of America. It was time to get the old movies out of the mothballs and go back to the Movie Houses. It would certainly be a great gesture from us that quickly forgives Americans and quickly forgets. <br /> <br /> IT would be a good gesture for the great filmmaker. In addition, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences planned to pay homage to Chaplin at the 1972 Academy Awards. This would certainly be a tearful yet joyful package of pathos, and America invited Charlie back and got him to receive a special Oscar for his life's work, in front of a worldwide television audience of millions. <br /> <br /> BESIDES, that would be natural for the promotion of the Chaplin season in the theater! (Remember, little Tramp was as astute as a young businessman like a filmmaker!) The program consisted of MODERN TIMES, CITY LIGHTS, THE DIGITAL DICTATOR, MONSEUR VERDOUX, a King in New York, and finally THE CHAPLIN REVIEW. We are looking forward to the anticipation of the Multi Date Filmfest. <br /> <br /> In our fair city Chicago, it was booked for the Carnegie Theater on Rush Street. The festivities begin with MODERN TIMES and everyone else is shown one after the other, each one remaining for the time it took to satisfy the public's desire for each picture. As we recall, the last event on the program was THE CHAPLIN REVUE. <br /> IN RETROSPECT, we look back and wish that they had run with REVUE; There were undoubtedly legions of moviegoers (much like ourselves) who knew very little about his successes in movies, except for the Keystone, Essanay, and Mutual Silent shorts featured on so many kiddy shows around the world , Well, again, no one has questioned me! <br /> <br /> CONCENTRATING on today's guest film THE CHAPLIN REVUE, we found out that there were actually three separate images; Carefully connected by the use of the story by Chaplin (himself), some lively themes and incidental music (again written by Chaplin) and some happy conversations and serious tales (Ditto of Chaplin). He opens the process by making use of a home-movie film showing the construction of Chaplin Studios in Hollywood, as well as some trial-period films in which director Chaplin shows what exactly shows a group of actors what he wants , <br /> <br /> This segment was well done and well received by the audience. Both the Bauhumor and the sample were amplified by acting accelerated. (The rehearsal of course, the building by speeding up the photographic process of the camera.) The old trick makes it seem that the buildings were almost self-building. <br /> <br /> This amalgam of shorts contained three of Chaplin's short comedies His stay at First National Pictures, approximately from 1917 to 1923. The election was well thought out and gave us a great variety of themes and moods. <br /> <br /> FIRST was SHULTER ARMS (Charles Chaplin Productions) / First National Pictures , 1918.) As the title suggests, it is a story from the First World War. It was published in October 1918, a day before the Armistice Day on November 11. A romance between Private Chaplin and a French girl (Miss Edna Purviance). The lightness is fast, physical and in the grand old tradition of mocking the enemy, the German army. <br /> <br /> An excellent example of the old adage about children and dogs that bring people together, the Next Movie A DOG'S LIFE (Chaplin Productions / First National, 1918) traces the parallel life of Chaplin's Tramp and the newly adopted Stray scraps after. The film history includes families, two of them. A homo sapiens, a dog and both bring us big surprises. <br /> <br /> As a finale, we have THE PILGRIM (Chaplin / First National, 1923) a good choice for the final. It was light, bright and narrow. It was a trip to the Western parody area. Comedies of this kind have since been performed by every comedian and team. The "pilgrim" in the story is not one of your standard Thanksgiving varieties. but rather a "buddy" or "tenderfoot" venturing west. The tramp is not just this guy; But his character is an escaped survivor who is mistakenly seen as the new clergyman of a western city church. <br /> <br /> OUR rating (that's Schultz and me) is ****. (That's four derbies) <br /> <br /> POODLE CARVING !!
