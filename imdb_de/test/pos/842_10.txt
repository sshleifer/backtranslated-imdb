The third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant exploitation films and the third masterpiece in a row "Joshuu Sasori: Kemono-beya". "Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable" (aka "Sasori: Den Of The Beast", in which I live) from 1973 is a film that differs in some aspects from its predecessors, but is equal in its brilliance (or even surpasses). The entire original Sasori series with the wonderful Meiko Kaji is the absolute highlight in the WIP cinema. All the films, especially the first three, uniquely combine exploitation and art-house cinema like no other film. "Beast Stable" is the third and penultimate "Sasori" movie with Meiko Kaji, the last one directed by genius director Shunya Ito and, in my opinion, the biggest of them all. The first film "Joshuu 701-gô: Sasori" from 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of exploitative cinema and simply THE definition of exploitation. In the equally brilliant first sequel "Joshuu Sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô", Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. The third "Sasori" movie, "Beast Stable," sustains surrealism (though not quite as much as the second) and even has more social criticism than its predecessors. Issues such as poverty, forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central topics of the film. <br /> <br /> This third "Sasori" movie is brilliant and sublime in all aspects and probably the best cycle of the generally brilliant cycle (for me it is this, the first movie is just after). Once again, "Best Stable" is both very artistic and very exploitative. The visually stunning film shows an enormous amount of brutal violence and revival, as well as sequences of enormously surrealistic beauty. The stunningly beautiful Meiko Kaji is once again brilliant in her role as Nami Matsushima (aka Sasori). I absolutely adore this wonderful actress, and I'm sure I'm not the only one doing that. The rest of the performances are great as well, especially Mikio Narita is a great police inspector and obsessed with catching Sasori. The music score is the same in all three films, with "Urami-Bushi" sung by Meiko Kaji herself as the main theme, which is great because the score is just perfection. Like its predecessors, "Beast Stable" is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of exploitation art that no serious movie lover should miss. The entire Sasori cycle is at the top of my personal favorites list. "Beast Stable" is probably the most brilliant masterpiece of all! 10/10
