A beloved and dedicated priest from a small town volunteers for a medical experiment that makes him a vampire. <br /> <br /> Physical and psychological changes lead to an affair with a childhood friend's wife, who is oppressed and tired of her earthly life. <br /> <br /> The one-time priest gets deeper into despair and depravity. As things get worse, he struggles to maintain what is left of his humanity ... <br /> <br /> The vampire movie really would have been thanks to the poor efforts of the Twilight and Underworld franchise, but of the director Extincts Add new blood to the vampire's history by putting simple things into perspective. <br /> <br /> These vampires have reflections and no fangs, feed and die anyway. Making a priest out of the main protagonist really opens a can of worms to challenge the file. The priest feeds mainly to make himself better, but when he meets his unfulfilled wife, carnal instincts set in. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie intensely erotic is that when the couple agrees for the first time, they experience experiencing something they have never experienced before, forbidding passion, which makes the scenario more sensual , Chan-Wook adds the necessary sense of humor to the film, which is only realized in the last third of the film. We see the daughter lifting her mother in front of everyone in her chair, and when she realizes her own strength, she just puts the chair down and goes on. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> and the last act would not be out of place in a movie to go on, or even the three stooges, when the couple is fighting for survival or death. <br /> <br /> CGI is subtle and fantastic, and the scenes in which they leap from building to building are so graceful that you can watch ballet. <br /> <br /> The vampire genre will feel fresh and alive after that, but more importantly, the erotic and intensity that most vampire movies lack today. It's violent, but I would not expect anything else from the director in question. <br /> <br /> A really interesting story with fantastic characters and a nice camera.
