This is the second Hitchcock movie on the list, and the second Hitchcock movie I've seen in full. The first one was Rope, which I really liked. With Saboteur, Hitchcock had more free walking space, whereas Rope was all in one room. I did not enjoy this movie as much as Rope, but that does not mean that this is a bad movie. It just seems to be an average film strip that could have been a bit more. <br /> <br /> It seems like a Hitchcock movie is doing this as a break between its serious ones. As a thriller, I find that I can not bring myself to the edge of my seat or deal with the main character running around in the States. The climax of the film feels like a missed opportunity to properly amplify the tension. The sound design is almost nonexistent. You hear their dialogue and some of the environment, but the important things are missing, the stitches tear off the sleeve, the need for music to amplify the tension, everything is missing. Intentionally no doubt, yet he lacks the emotional impact one would expect from such a scene. Then it ends abruptly and you remain empty. <br /> <br /> The film does not feel right as it should, it's almost like a globe trudging from place to place, but it feels closer. The script itself is very average and seems to go the rather confusing ways to get the plot going. <br /> <br /> The performances are there, but nothing special. Everyone plays his role for scripted words on the page. The relationship between the two terminals is weak and requires more work. To emphasize is Otto Kruger, who has this rich, selfish, evil person from Pat. <br /> <br /> In the end, I wanted more of this. I understand that it's one of Hitchcock's least exciting movies, but I had a good time watching it. I can only recommend it, not thrilled.
