This film is one of the most historically accurate war films ever made, showing the reality of soldiers in a combat situation and the particular circumstances of the Battle of Stalingrad when compared to works such as the book by Anthony Beevor "Stalingrad". <br /> <br /> Unlike the more popular "Enemy at the Gates", where the storyline turns into a sniper / hunter story, this film shows what war can do to individuals. "Stalingrad", although filmed by Germans, is anything but a nationalist apologetic film. It shows that war movies can be something beyond the flag waving and jingoistic distortions of the cruel truth of war, as is the case in many Hollywood war products. Film techniques in "Stlingrad" are of the highest caliber. <br /> <br /> It is a must for anyone who intends to join an army and obey orders of any kind of "leader".
