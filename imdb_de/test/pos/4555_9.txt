During my trip to a youth leadership forum I was surfing the channel until I found "Tommy Boy" at TBS. Since I've never seen this movie, I wanted to watch it. My roommate, who has already seen that, told me, "This movie is a classic." After watching the whole movie, I came to the conclusion that he was right. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is consistently funny by the comic duo of Chris Farley and David Spade. Farley is an insurrection as a title character, a spastic fool who simply sails through life as if it were not important. His Slacker-Esqe ways soon come to a standstill when his father (Brian Dennehy), a wealthy "Break Pads King", dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. As a result, Tommy takes to the streets with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend Richard (David Spade) to sell enough brake pads to save the company. <br /> <br /> The main reason that "Tommy Boy" does funny performances from the cast. Farley is the funniest person in this movie, the second funniest person is Spade and the third is Rob Lowe as the villain of the film, who has bad luck. Another funny guy is Dan Aykroyd as Ray Zalinsky, a well-known auto part that is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie works is the large number of jokes. Chris Farley has funny slapstick moments and David Spade has funny comments and one-liners. The gags in the movie (some that include a deer and an airplane bath) are funny, thanks to director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3), the writers Bonnie and Terry Turner. <br /> <br /> (3rd Rock from the Sun, That's 70s Show) and the cast. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is a really funny movie, though most movie critics (including Roger Ebert) for some unknown reason find him awful and listless. (I wonder when her sense of humor died.) I recommend "Tommy Boy" for those who are big fans of comedy. Thank you, roommate.
