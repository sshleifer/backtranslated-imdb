Quite funny parody with great attention to detail: the look of the spy films of the 1960s and the way the action was staged at that time. The fight sequence in the hotel room was a shout and the casting was perfect, with a Peter Lorre lookalike added to the mix of villains. One big advantage: Jean Dujardin is hot and the scene in which he is tied up without a shirt was a highlight. And his eyebrows deserve some recognition for their excellent work. <br /> <br /> Funny aside: the people behind me in the theater gasped after every breather, as if they were seeing a "real" spy thriller trailer for "Get Smart" was shown. The preview made the film look embarrassingly bad, with lame attempts to integrate the jokes and gags from the TV series. Looks like a bombshell and a real contrast to the comparatively sublime jokes and gags of OSS 117, though of course OSS had some dropouts. However, the overall sound of OSS was not an insult to the audience's intelligence, and the material did not feel as if it had been "depressed". I had the distinct impression that if I had understood the language, I would have gotten more of the jokes, and one (the pistol gag) was mistreated in interpreting the subtitles.
