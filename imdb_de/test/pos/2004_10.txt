I started to see this show by accident, but I love it. The fact that the main character is in a wheelchair is missing on television, especially at children's shows. My five-year-old nephew (like most children) only stared at people in a wheelchair or some other type of disability, but after watching Pelswick, it seemed like a normal event for him. Every time he saw a wheelchair, he simply said "Like Pelswick" and continued what he originally did. And yes, the animation is a bit rough, but if you can watch the first season of the Simpsons, that's not so bad. The "genius" is actually an angel who helps Pelswick learn lessons in life. He can NOT walk the other way, he said he could run occasionally, I saw every episode and he never went to my memory, he's a paraplegic and has no feeling under his armpits (he mentions it in an episode). As for humor, if you can get a copy of the "Ntalented" episode, which are Lampoon Boy bands, you'll love this show right away.
