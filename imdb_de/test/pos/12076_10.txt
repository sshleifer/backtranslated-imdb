I originally saw this at its premiere in the UK. I was fascinated by it, and it had been in tears all the time. I taped it to the TV for safekeeping, but over the years it has worn out. And television never seems to show it. So it was a pleasure to hear that True Movies owns the copyright and shows it in their channels. This time I stuck it on a DVD so I can enjoy it again and again. Lucile Fray (played magnificently by Ann - Margret) discovers that she has cancer and that it is endless. Her husband has arthritis, and although he loves, he is an alcoholic and would be unable to look after her children after she left. Therefore, she has to find a new home for each of her children before she dies. <br /> <br /> The acting is first class, the music is beautiful, and she has passed the test of time wonderful!) If you ever get the chance, you would be stupid to miss this. It's a wonderful movie! A must for everyone !!!
