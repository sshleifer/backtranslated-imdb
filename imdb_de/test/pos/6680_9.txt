at least for me. and rather unexpected - as a topic. A film in which you question your beliefs, your life, your approach to everything. This will help you to see the world you live in, through a lens - or through a variety of lenses ... a moving, surprising and haunting movie. <br /> <br /> and he benefits from one of the best performances Kevin Spacey ever had. very well seconded by Jeff Bridges. There is no wrong note in this tango. It's a perfect dance. perfect to the end. <br /> <br /> What does the end reveal? well ... everything you want ... <br /> <br /> a movie that you want to see again. maybe not the same. maybe after a few days. Months. Years. but it is something to go - or to come - back.
