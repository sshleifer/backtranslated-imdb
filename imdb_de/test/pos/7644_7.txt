I saw this movie on HBO and had a great time. <br /> <br /> The director has done a great job. I was totally immersed in this movie when it started. The performance of Norman Reedus is cool. I expect more chilled movies from him. <br /> <br /> I was so excited that I occasionally wanted to take Norman's weapon and shoot this snake girl. Hehe. I like the movies when innocent-looking girls play tricks with men. The end was what I wanted :)) <br /> <br /> This movie is full of moments. They expect that, but something else happens. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, those massive images that had cut scenes were very painful to the eyes. <br /> <br /> Although it was not shown when Norman Reedus changed the banknotes? Or am I standing by the fridge? :)
