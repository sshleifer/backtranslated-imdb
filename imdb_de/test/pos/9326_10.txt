Michael Jackson is the greatest singer and dancer ever to live, and this movie proves it. It's great to watch and the dance is fantastic. When Michael turns into a werewolf, that's a bit on the other side of the seat the first time around. The rap by Vincent Price increases the fear as all zombies rise from their graves. If you like that, then I suggest that you buy 'Making Michael Jackson's Thriller', which then makes the film after making it. Doing this shows an incredible performance of 'billie jean' by michael when he first played the moonwalk on tv. look at it
