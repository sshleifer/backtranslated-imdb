EXCUSE ME!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! CUBA GOODING, Jr. Should have won an Oscar for his performance in this movie !!! He was the movie! While the film may leave something to be desired in some areas, Cuba was great ... and for me, this is the best role he has ever played! The scene in the movie, where he finds out that his mother died, made me collapse and cry in THE THEATER !! I suppose I could really relate to this movie because I saw the same treatment of people in my own school as they grow up ... what a tragedy! Seeing the "right" radio and coach at the end of the film was also something special! If you can see this movie and are not moved to tears, you need a heart check! If you liked "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", you will love "Radio" too! I wish they would make more movies like this ... Radio is the real deal!
