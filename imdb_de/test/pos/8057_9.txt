To view the fictionalized biography "The Phenix City Story", I claim that she has to enter fields that American filmmakers seldom venture into. Director Phil Karlson received his directing work in the TV hit hit series "The Untouchables" largely based on Kansas City's Confidentiality "and this movie, and it has become one of the most admired and most imitated movies ever The rarest accomplishment for US filmmakers seems to be the target group oriented anti-crime film or TV series focused on heroes, reminding the audience how powerful "Cain's Hundred" and "Hardcastle and McCormick "and even the producers of the" untouchables "had to do anything to produce anything but episodes that are largely devoted to the unfair activities of criminals rather than their activities, ethical opponents.This powerful, groundbreaking and very gritty movie has its own style and their lesson seems to be the attention to detail about the opponents and victims of criminal organizations as well as their gang members There is a twelve-minute prelude to the film in which reporter Clete Roberts interviews the real Alabama participants who fought against their corrupt vice-gangs. The problem was caused by the presence of Fort Benning on the other side of the river and the nearly one hundred year existence of pits in the area. The film describes the return of John Patterson from Germany, where he was a prosecutor. His father, who was defeated in front of the Attorney General of Alabama, refuses, despite several provocations, including the beatings of his son, who was avenged by Patterson at his tormentor. There are several well-developed characters, including Ellie, who works in one of the clubs, and her honest friend, the leader of the syndicate, Patterson's wife and John, Ed Gage, the Vikelords staff, and Zeke Ward, an honest black man Victim for his resistance to her. The feature films by Harry Neumann and the Art Direction by Stanley Fleischer are in black and white and are similar to the news film and contribute to the film's realistic power. Music by Harry Sukman effectively contributes to the movie. The author Daniel Mainwaring and Crane Wilbur produced a fast and straightforward story that is divided into parts. Part 1 shows the realm of vikelords from one of their clubs. It shows the fate of a victim beaten by the police and then taken to the mob by the police. In the second part, Albert Patterson refuses to oppose the leader of the mob, the intelligent Rhett Tanner. In the third part, the young Patterson returns and after several incidents, including the fact that he must have beaten the mob head to avenge his own punches, he decides to run his father as Attorney General. His wife is horrified; and the mob kills Zeke Ward's daughter and throws the body in Patterson's house with a warning that his children will come next. A few more such incidents, including the loss of a lawsuit in which the Pattersons prove that the thug killed a friend of theirs, who had found the car involved in the murder of the little girl, and watch the investigation Accidentally sees death, persuade Patterson to run away, and he wins the Democratic National Nomination despite the statistical tactics of the mob - and is immediately assassinated. John Patterson prevents a vigilante from starting an open war with the 14th Street Mob and uses their votes to call the capital and demand martial rights for Phenix City. The clubs are closed and the equipment is confiscated, but not before the girl in the house is murdered by the mob. Patterson must be stopped by Zeke Ward to kill Tanner instead of putting him off the law. The end of the drama is optimistic; but the prognosis for the city is less sanguin than painted; The mob actually tried to come back and moved to Tennessee. In this well-made classic of the anti-crime film, Richard Kiley is young, but very strong as Patterson, with no accent to play. John Mcintyre as his father is very good, while Edward Andrews is awarded as a Boss Tanner with a caliber. Other performers include Kathryn Grant as a girl, Ellie, Jean Carson and Kathy Marlowe as women of the mob, John Larch as her idiot, Biff Mcguire as a young victim, James Edwards as Zeke Ward and Lenka Peterson as John's wife, some good character actors like Citizens and mob bosses. I find it hard to make good statements about the realism and lack of attitude in this film. It is certainly one of the best efforts of Phil Karlson. Karlson also made "The Scarface Mob" later "Walking Tall". A sobering and inspiring look at the ease with which self-confident citizens of a public-interest democracy can join the tyranny, and how some honest men can teach them to fight for their rights.
