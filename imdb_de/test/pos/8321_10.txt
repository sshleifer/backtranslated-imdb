and frankly, that just sums it up. <br /> <br /> It's a small computer animation series filmed like an animal documentary. <br /> <br /> The animation is almost flawless (I thought the long-necked dinosaur eyes looked spotty. <br /> <br /> However, some of the model shots did not seem so realistic ... <br / > <br /> and I thought that Jurrassic Park is a better T Rex, if this is the kind of thing we see in a normal British television series, I can not wait to see what they can achieve in the movies . <br /> <br /> I give this 10/10 star ... <br /> <br /> (and the "making of" video was great too ..... the dinosaur on the skateboard was halarious) <br /> <br /> <..>
