* The whereabouts of Al Capone <br /> <br /> * Who shot JFK? <br /> <br /> * Cynthia Gibb lands the part of "Gypsy" on TV remake <br /> <br /> These are some of the great unresolved secrets of the 20th century. How else can I say it unless I thought she was terribly terrible. Mannequin mannerisms, bad reactionary actions (ie, that blank, stoic look as he plays in the scene) and a vocal voice that most voice trainers would classify as "mediocre." But she is amazingly gorgeous and does the Gypsy character have anything at all? She cashed in because she had not cut the mustard in the talent department. <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... Bette is fantastic. It does not matter if she's playing herself or Mama Rose is playing, it works either way, and I thought Rosalind Russell was as exciting as drywall at first. Peter Riegart as "Herbie" is the perfect, unobtrusive foil to Bed's towering Mama, and he's the mid-temperature porridge between Midler's hot dish and Gibbs cold porridge. Riegart is right. <br /> <br /> One last roar to the man who had been affected by Cher jokes for decades: Bob Mackie. Drag queens would kill here for glamor and glamor. Everything comes with sequins and pearl beads! <br /> <br />
