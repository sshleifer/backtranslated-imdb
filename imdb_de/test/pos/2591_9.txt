This is the middle cartoon of the three (between Rabbit Fire and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!) And is the weakest of the three, while still quite funny. It just depends on a gag for too much action. Still a good cartoon. I definitely feel compassion for Daffy in this case, which is rare for me. Daffy is so overwhelmed that sometimes it gets painful to look at her. Good cartoon in a magnificent series. Recommended.
