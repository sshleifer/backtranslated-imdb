This is a haunting short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner deliver services that hurt, come true and stay with you. Since this is called a tragic story, this is not a big spoiler. But I wanted to change the result, even if it's true for the story, because I've already taken care of these people. I can only imagine a few short films that influenced me so much. Nice shot, traded, edited. High-caliber work all around, even using the right sound and / or the right music to push the story. The end of the credit song ended the job and robbed me of even more emotions. This is the first installment from start to finish. Kudos to the author / director and everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is my first review of a movie in the comment section. I promised to exchange this for a copy of the DVD. The review could be good or bad, just my honest opinion. That's it and that's the least I can do. I am so glad that I could see it.
