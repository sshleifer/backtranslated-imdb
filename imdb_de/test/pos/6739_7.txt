This is a gently amusing comic book series from the later, more mature phase of Neil Simon's writing. While there are many secrets to discover, this is not one of those Neil Simon pieces where every character will look jokes out of a liner for two hours as if they were guest stars of a Bob Hope special. There are also dramatic elements (some work, some exaggerated) that add weight to the story. <br /> <br /> The performances are consistently good, especially Blythe Danner as a mother (though she and Judith Ivey were there) oddly WASP-ish choices to play Jewish women). I've never been a fan of Jonathan Silverman, but I'll say he hits the right notes as a nasty, gawky, and totally horned teen narrator / protagonist in the story. <br /> <br /> The film is very similar to the sound of Woody Allen's "Radio Days", but the latter is far more resourceful and funnier than this one.
