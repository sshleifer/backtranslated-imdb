This movie is a fantastic remake of the original with the same title. The movie was cool, although I hate new ones! The cast was great. It has a great cast and a great plot !! The main act is that a man is poisoned and he has to dissolve his own murder, neatly, right? Dennis Quaid is the man who is "DOA" (in other words: Dead On Arrival) Now a suspect !! Dennis has several hours to find out who poisoned him. The movie is pretty fast and full of action. Two other big stars are in Meg Ryan (City of Angels, Courage Under Fire) and Daniel Stern (Alone At Home, Very Bad Things, Bush Whip) in supporting roles in this awesome, cool remake of a classic movie !!
