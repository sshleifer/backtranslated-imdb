I found it really shocking to turn William Shakespeare's love masterpiece into a bloody, violent, and confused sensual film adaptation of the movie. But once you've looked at it, it's kind of growing in you when you see it the second and third times as you overcome the shock and appreciate the movie on your own - solid acting, good dialogue, nice sequencing and choreography Not too bad soundtrack and some of the (special) effects that go on. Oh, and also the end. What an uprising!
