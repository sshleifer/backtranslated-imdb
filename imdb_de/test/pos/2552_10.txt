Ramin Bahrani sets up a scene early in Chop Shop, which immediately identifies me, where the character of Ale (Alejandro Polanco) and his friend come from. The two get on a subway, and once the doors are closed they ask if they can catch everyone's attention for a moment, and sell candy bars or M & M or something, and then sell some bars. If you have ever been to a subway in New York City (like me), this is the situation that happens so often that you almost do not notice it. Often people in a subway see children like these or minorities selling something or announcing something in a subway and talking about it without telling them anything. Bahrani's focus is not necessarily on children who sell things on subway rides, but on the survival and status of being one when you're in the lower grade in America. It is retrospective in his hands, thoughtful and heartbreaking, usually at once. To compare it with Pixote or the bicycle thief, it is not too far from a jump (actually, in the latter at least the father) and son have each other), although Bahrani has his intentions in his documentary style. We take care of this character Ali, who is no older than eleven and works in a car business, cleaning a few cars and helping to disassemble others, and his sister, who comes from the city to stay with him. But it's not just because we force-fed every clich√© except for one brother and one sister (more brother) who try to take care of each other. Bahrani exposes the story by the simple claim that Ali pursues, the goal that is possible in his situation: save enough to buy a used food truck that Ali and Isamar can serve themselves. <br /> <br /> It's Ali works for everything, but what Bahrani shows us in brutal details is this work. What Ali needs to do to make this possible, even if it's unpleasant things, like tearing off hubcaps from the cars in the Shea Stadium or stealing a bag at a point in a desperate moment. This makes it all the more serious as Ale sees at night what his sister casually does for money and does sexual pleasures for men in a deserted roadside truck. He does not mention it and pushes it aside, but it's always something that increases the tension Ale wants to protect his sister. It adds to the tragedy when ale finds the real cost of what's needed to make the food truck a profit, adding to the fear he's just internalized. <br /> <br /> One could immediately see the fact that Ale is an orphan in a neighborhood where the movie was filmed in Queens, as if the film were like a neo-neo-realism (as it was Practically all non-professional actors in the fields of mechanics and workers and people on the street - but Bahrani focuses more on the here and now, and that makes Chop Shop so immediate and heartfelt. No trace of melodrama can be found in the film, hardly a musical accompaniment, apart from the live Latino music that comes from cars and radios. Sometimes Bahrani focuses on a very subtle moment, which in other scenes expresses how Ale is awake, but as if he was sleeping on the first night after experiencing Isamar's late-night tryst, and we see how She probably sneaks into bed knowing he is awake, but no one can say a word. Or in many other scenes, poetic touches work seamlessly, as when the man shows ale, as the pigeons feed. <br /> <br /> It's coarse and bleak as you can expect, and it does not give much hope for its main characters, despite the few moments of happiness that you sprinkle over. It is also a magnificently shot, hand-held film in which the technique, as with a variety of films made in its urban tone and approach, informs and complements the subjects on the canvas and what they do but it is never ruthlessly shot or conspicuous. The filmmaker has a great cast of "real-life" (ale was stolen from a public school in New York without any experience) and knows how he wastes no shot while at the same time achieving a brutal artifice by showing what he's showing , It is not a city of God or Pixote; It's a little masterpiece of a character or characters that we would not normally (or hardly) ever look at in our city, like New York. If you are not moved by ale and his daily struggles, I do not know what to do for you.
