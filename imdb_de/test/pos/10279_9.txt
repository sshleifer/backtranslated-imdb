Several years ago, I saw this movie without subtitles on TV, and although I did not understand a word of what the characters were saying, I still had the general idea, and the mood of the film intrigued me endlessly. <br /> <Finally I saw it again a few weeks ago. My heart jumped when I saw the picture in the TV magazine, and for eight days until the movie was really shown, I told everyone I could see it. the story reminded me a little of alfred hitchcock's dizziness. a slow, brooding film about a man who one day thinks he sees the girlfriend who disappeared years ago. What follows is a wild rollercoaster ride with flashbacks, changing perspectives and really imaginative twists in the plot, and at the end of the movie I was breathless. I definitely did not get what I expected (and actually I had already seen the movie!). Be ready to be confused. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
