I grew up in Baltimore, so I was exposed to the films of John Waters because I was too young to look at them. And if you know John Waters is limited to Hairspray or Cry-Baby or other family-friendly movies, you'll need to prepare for Pink Flamingos. Explicit sex acts, incest, an old lady Who only eats eggs and unhygienic acts with chickens are only part of the depravity in this film. The film ends with Divine, Waters Â£ 300. Cross dressing star eating dog feces. <br /> <br /> The premise is about two families: one a pair of inbred rubbish containing Divine and Edith Massey as the Oath Lady; and the other is a rich, swinging couple. Both families compete for the title "Filthiest person live". Enjoy the most beautiful movie by John Waters, but only see him if you are an open-minded person with a strong belly, because some scenes in this movie will offend you.
