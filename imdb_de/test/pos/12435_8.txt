This movie is just beautiful. It's funny and as old as the hills. Acting is awesome and it's fascinating to see how Britain was after the war and how we behaved during those days. This seems to have been a forerunner of the St. Trinians movies (given the connection between Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford - there is also a very young George Cole who appeared in many St. Trinians movies), but I myself do not understand that the connection. It was recently featured on BBC4 after a biography of Trinians creator Ronald Searle, but I've missed enough biography to miss the connection to this film. Definitely a great movie in itself and something that should be preserved for all time!
