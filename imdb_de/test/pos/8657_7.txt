The Bothersome Man is a smart, surreal movie where you re-evaluate what you do with your life and what makes you tick. When you see these people in zombie-like trance-making routines, realizing that this is what we do and what we want in real life, it's really close to home. This is a surprisingly effective movie where you end up asking questions about your direction and not so much about the movie. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the main character whose life we ​​get an impression of a third person, as he tries to adapt to a new life after a move. In the beginning, he seems to be the most popular guy in town, as everyone gets involved in his work and he is invited to dinner. A good example is the scene with his new boss, who offers him an envelope with an undefined amount of money saying "here's something to get you started". Andreas even gets a girlfriend in 20 minutes, in which he finally pulls. This seems to be an ideal living situation as his girlfriend is an established interior designer, is attractive and never complains about anything he does. But Andreas is not satisfied with their relationship as with anything else in this world. He begins an affair with a colleague named Ingeborg, for whom he leaves Anne and claims he is in love. After telling Ingeborg how she feels, she tells him that she also sees other colleagues and says that all relationships are "nice". Soon after we see Andreas at a train station, where he tries to end his misery and to the disappointment of the audience does not come. Still looking for salvation, Andreas meets Hugo, who has found a hole from which to listen to music. So you go on a mission to get to the other side. Will it be better or will it be worse? <br /> <br /> "The Bothersome Man" shows us the obsession of society with appearance and its materialistic way of thinking. It's a great job to make fun of us by filling houses with IKEA products, which the characters spend each year choosing. I think he makes fun of the boring Scandinavian society and the high rates of suicide. For example, there is a scene in the movie where Andreas comes across a man jumping out of a building onto a barbed wire. Even Andreas, who is tired of this world, cuts off his finger and later jumps in front of a train; This is one of the strangest / most outrageous scenes I have ever seen. This world created by Lien corresponds to a purgatory in which there is no punishment or reward. In this world drink, Andreas never got drunk, the sex was unfulfilled, and no matter how many times he tried, he could not kill himself. This movie reminded me of "Fight Club" and how both main characters were out of synch with the world around them. In "Fight Club" Tyler Durden creates a second person who does everything he does not want, and in this movie, the awakened Andreas Tyler Durden is equivalent. After a while, he wakes up trying to escape the bland life he now separates by fleeing through a hole in a wall. <br /> <br /> Lien does a great job with continuity in this movie, which means that when a character has half a full cup in his hand and cuts it away, they come back, they have the glass in the same hand and it is not full or empty shows that the shot was made on another day. Nowadays, directors are more worried about the sound effects and overlook the little things like the character who wears the bracelet on the same hand as yesterday's film footage? Since I've done TV production in high school for three years, it's hard for me not to look for continuity or voice-offs that drive me crazy. Lien does the little things well, he has good lighting in each shot, never lets you know why there is something in the shot, and brings an interesting subject with him. This film really worked for me because it's not just the Scandinavians, but the western society and what's wrong with that. The only real problem I had was with the man who committed suicide by jumping on a barbed wire. Because you finally find out that this world has no death, but he was motionless, forcing you to assume he was dead, and I think that's never answered. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the only protagonist, as others come and go and never do more than support him. His first girlfriend Anne Britt is an interior designer who seems perfect to him on the surface, but turns out to be boring. This leads him to Ingeborg, with whom he begins an affair and falls in love with her. He quickly finds out she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real. Andreas finally meets Hugo in the bathroom of a bar and complains that nothing tastes good and that he can no longer get drunk. He follows Hugo home to find the hole in the wall filled with children's laughter and birdsong. <br /> <br /> Lien does not have much in the CV, but "The Bothersome Man" is more than a start to a great career, but a preview of an aspiring director. If this is an indication of his talent and his potential as a storyteller, Lien has a bright future and we can only hope that his future films will not take so long to make it overseas for our viewing pleasure. Sit down and enjoy the ride while director Jens Lien takes you from home to the beautiful world of The Bothersome Man.
