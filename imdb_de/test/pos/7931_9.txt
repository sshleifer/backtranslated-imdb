In Alexander Nevsy, a film directed by the Russian legend Sergei M. Eisenstein (directed by Dmitri Vasilyev in his only role), some of the sequences (um, the entire third of the film dedicated to the battle on the ice is) observed credit, has made me realize how much really must go, at least on such a scale. If I had been a member of a prize group at the time of this film's release, I would probably award Eisenstein the Posthumous Director's Award of the Year. It is a crazy move of the cinematic genius to evoke some of the things subtracted in the film, though for some such director after his best work - Battleship Potemkin and October - it was the case he sneered at the beginning. But in the midst of a movie that is sometimes a bit frustrating, with only a few shades of gray entering the black and white motif, it's still a marvel of celluloid almost 70 years later. Lord of the Rings fans, meet the grandfather of the movies, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Saying that something is a propaganda piece already has a connotation, and often a bad one. It's something that has a full message and a point of view. It is still a matter of hot debate (see the flocks of argument about Moore's films), whether great art can emerge from something undecided that is meant to arouse the audience in a certain way. In this particular case, the Russians are against the Germans. By the time World War II was approaching World War II, Russia was once again confronted with the "German invaders," and it is interesting to know that Eisenstein was actually commissioned to shoot this film since the Russians never forget an important piece of her story. The end result, however, is something that is actually somewhat common when you see battleship and october. If nothing else comes through these films, the most important thing for Eisenstein is that the image and content can finally come together for the viewer. This style can fully envelop the viewer completely. Under these conditions, Alexander Nevsky is fearless. <br /> <br /> But even with the whole idea of ​​"Russia great, Germans bad", there are some small moments when things are a little less strict, a little less strict to those ideals. For example, when we first see the Germans in Privka, they are not some faceless blob who is totally barbaric and has a blind purpose of conquest (not that they do not want to take what they can). They also have their own national pride that it would be no less if they continued with what their Christian led lords tell them. At least, the evil of the image has a face, but kept to a low minimum so that the prevailing side can enter. There is also a short scene before the Ice Land Battle in which the Russian troupe told a joke and laughed about it, adding a bit more depth where otherwise little could be valuable. Because in Alexander Nevsky, with his war songs loaded with pride in the warfare, there is usually no complexity for the characters, especially Nevsky himself (ultra-heroic played, just before the launch of Nikolai Cherkasov questioned)) which may have to be in Eistenstein's intention to have him as the only infallible force to reckon with in history. Searching for naturalism in an Eisenstein movie is like trying to find non-kosher pork feet in a deli. <br /> <br /> But the real reason to see the picture is not acting. But for the look of the film, how it moves and picks up in such a vast environment that Eisenstein interprets. On the epic scale, it's as ambitious as his 20s films, with a host of extras, not just in the main battle scenes, but also in the scenes in the cities where hundreds of people live. In fact, I would say that any director working in Hollywood or elsewhere who was thinking of making a big epic, especially war, would watch this movie well, even if only the sound is off. It's even better to think of yourself as a silent movie, with the visual strokes sometimes being highlighted fantastically. One could spend a whole month analyzing the battle on the ice, starting with the German soldiers in the distance and then appearing like bugs, and then, as Eisenstein switches between the fighters of the fighting actors and then to long shots and with accelerated processing. And of course, one can not ignore the power of music: Sergei Prokofiev delivers one of the great stirring scores of an epic work. Meanwhile, the editor's cut keeps our eyes on frenzied speed with this raging action. If it is just a short film, he would certainly be among the greats, similar to the sequence of Odessa Stairs. <br /> <br /> If I find it a little less great, it would be because of the mistakes. That comes from a director who is much better suited for the silent medium than for the sound. While I have not yet seen Ivan the Terrible, my only negative criticism of his directing would be the actor who is really as broad as possible, with the melodrama at such a high pitch being his staggering (the negotiation of the two) soldiers around fighting the Olga is the best example I can imagine. Despite this, Alexander Nevsky is too extraordinary to be ignored, and he adds that engagement in action and filmmaking is at a level that sets the current state of the art as a benchmark for trying and living.
