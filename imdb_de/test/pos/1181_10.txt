Movies are not always about deep, provocative thoughts. Sometimes they are just meant to escape reality. Out to Sea fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> A carefree romantic comedy "Golden Years". Out To Sea is not a big budget. You can easily tell when they played in front of a green screen, but it's still a lot of a movie worth watching. A sweet movie that needs a break. <br /> <br /> That's just good, carefree fun. It should not be a deep movie. It is something worth seeing. When it comes to nothing else, you need to see it for Brent Spiner's humorous, stiff and sincere version of Oye Como Va. Gil is a character you want to hate, and Mr. Spiner pulls off two popular comedy movie gods for the perfect nasty comic strip.
