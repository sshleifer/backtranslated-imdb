This was a very dark movie about anti-Semitism. In contrast to GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT (which also deals with anti-Semitism), the film has aged well and does not seem cumbersome. In other words, it is a topic without appearing preaching or banal by today's standards. Robert Ryan plays one of the worst characters because he beats a guy to death just because he's Jewish. Robert Mitchum plays the investigator who tries to get to the bottom of this crime. <br /> <br /> I give the film Kudos for its sombre and relentless look on hate. It is in many ways an example of Film Noir - even if it's not about the usual gangsters or robbery.
