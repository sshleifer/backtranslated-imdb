After reading all of these reviews, I am amazed to see that no one has ever noticed that this show is based on Lee Marvin's 1957-1960 NBC cop show "M Squad." I compared the reviews with "Dragnet". and some of the Quinn Martin police shows, but if you look at M Squad, you'll find it's based on it. In the late 1958 episode of M Squad, you see Lee Marvin playing Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger, getting out of his car and then being shot at, and he shoots back. The beginning of the Police Squad is basically the same (including jazz music), and then Lee Marvin tells what's going on (detective detective Frank Ballinger, M Squad, a special Chicago police department) and Leslie Neilsen in the police squad does the same Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Command, a special department of the police department), and so on, in one of the M Squad episodes, there is even the character of the Johnny the shoeshine guy, and there is an M Squad episode entitled "More Deadly." a police unit entitled "A Great Gift (The Broken Promise)" that's the same story!
