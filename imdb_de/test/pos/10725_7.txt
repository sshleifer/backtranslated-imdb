The child actor certainly deserves a lot of recognition. It was a pretty weak field for Best Picture this year. I think "Apocalypse Now" should have taken it, but the Academy probably considered it too violent and alien, and Vietnam was still too new. Meryl Streep was as always enormous and played a very unlikely character. Normally, I do not congratulate the directors, but I really liked the lift doors. Note B
