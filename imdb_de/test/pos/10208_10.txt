Fritz Lang ran two big westerns: "Western Union" and "The Return of Frank James". The Frank James movie is "Jesse James". "Western Union" is one of the great westerns of Randolph Scott. I have never seen Robert Young in a western. He is outstanding as a telegraph employee. This is the only film that I can imagine that the telegraph company opens in the West. It's a high-profile story about the telegraph in the West, a love triangle story, and loyalty. <br /> <br /> The side occupation is outstanding. Dean Jagger, who made some westerns, plays the telegraph manager. Virginia Gilmore, the sister of Mr. Jagger, is the love interest in the movie. Mrs. Gilmore had a short career in movies. She gave up the film in 1952 and became a drama coach. She is known primarily as the first wife Yul Brynner. It's great to see Slim Summerville in a movie with Mr. Scott again. They were in two other great movies: "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Jesse James."
