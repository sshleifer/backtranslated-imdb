Darling Lili is fantastic! It's by far one of my favorite movies! It certainly did not deserve the bad reviews it received. Julie Andrews, the title role of Lili Smith (Schmidt), is the best part of the entire movie. It is fascinating and spectacular! Since Julie Andrews is by far my favorite actress and singer, I was definitely not surprised how impressive she is. This movie is just ... great (I have no adjectives!), He's great, wonderful, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad and just a total thrill, and all thanks to Lady Julie Andrews! to her husband, director Blake Edwards. Oh yes, Rock Hudson was okay too. <br /> <br /> Julie Andrews is the beautiful and popular singer Lili Smith. Rock Hudson portrays Major Larabee, who quickly falls in love with Lili, and she with him. But her affair was not shaped by money. The German government had planned a meeting (I'm not sure if that's exactly how you would call it, but you understand the point), because the warm, happy, singing entertainer Lili is actually a German spy. Lili is to seduce Major LArabee to get information about the new Top Secret Opertaion (later "Crepe Suzette"). Although Lili is on a solemn mission, she really falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee), which makes her original task a challenge. But Lili prevails and does her job after finding out something that is not really true about Bill. The end is not said by me, because it is wonderfully designed. If anything, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly. I certainly did that !!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
