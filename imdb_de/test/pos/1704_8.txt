Three American boys are rallying across Europe, challenging each other to collect as many brave stunts and hot baby legs as they can. But Andy is looking for true love. He finds this during her bungee jump attempt on the Eiffel Tower as he encounters a stunning and heartbreaking Julie Delpy. His attempts to find this girl and the mystery he discovers lead him and his friends into a fast-paced adventure full of action, romance, crush, and inspired humor, never to be taken seriously or anything but wildly entertaining Minutes drive. I have seen this movie several times and find it a much more rewarding experience than the "Londoner" original, though both films are so different that it is not fair to compare them or even consider them as a sequel.
