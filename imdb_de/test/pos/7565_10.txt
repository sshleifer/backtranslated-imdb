Behind the nostalgic music we see a boy getting off the train. He arrives from Yugoslavia to meet his father, a man he has not seen in ten years. At the train station we meet the man. He never smiles. <br /> <br /> So we start our journey in "Four Friends," the powerful and amazing movie by Arthur Penn. You may be wondering why I started my review like this. Well, that's how the video box describes the movie. You may have figured out that the movie will be the story of the boy trying to get along with this emotionless man, and eventually he'll peel off his cover and reveal the kindness. <br /> <br /> Well, if you bought that, I have a bridge that I want to sell you. You see, modern Hollywood would make this movie. Penn has always been an outsider and has never resorted to typical clich√© storytelling. He always tells interesting stories about people (his credits include "Bonnie and Clyde", "The Chase", "Alice's Restaurant" and the underrated "Mickey One") and "Four Friends" are no exception. <br /> <br /> A typical Hollywood movie would focus on the boy named Danilo. However, Steve Tesich's script only focuses on it for about 4 minutes and then leaves. We meet adult Danilo, played by Craig Wasson (whom you know at "Body Double" and "Nightmare on Elm Street 3") and his friends Tom, David and passionate Georgia. The film takes us through the sixties. Now the events in a smaller movie would get the attention. But in "Four Friends" these events happen, but Penn and Tesich are more concerned with character studies than with plotting, and I think the movie is better that way. We know the events. We do not have to deal with them again. <br /> <br /> I know, I have not described much of the plot, but I do not know if you can describe "Four Friends". It's not one of those "high-concept" films that can be described in a single sentence. It is a movie with many moods and textures. It is also a really emotional experience. The last twenty minutes of this movie have moved me to tears. I am not ashamed to admit it. Seldom does a movie have such a power that it can reduce me to tears. The show is first-rate, especially by Craig Wasson, who seems to be one of the least-used actors. This is such a difficult, emotional achievement, and Wasson manages it. He should have received an Oscar for that. Another great achievement is Jodi Thelen, who plays an even more difficult role than Wasson. But she handles it very well and gives Georgia a certain dignity that most Hollywood actresses would not do (they would be too scared to even try it, they would be more concerned with image than playing a great performance; that's not what acting is about). She also earned an Oscar. <br /> <br /> "Four Friends" did not get a big boost in 1981. Maybe people just did not have the emotional ability to handle it. And unsuspecting executives could not do it as another "American graffiti" (the joke of "Four Friends" is missing). So they let it die. Too bad, because this is one of the best movies of the 1980s, a decade in which more and more plain trash was created and a great art like this was without a home. I ask you to give this film a chance. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
