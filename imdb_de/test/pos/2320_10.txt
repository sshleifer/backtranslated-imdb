Look, we rated this at 10 as entertainment value. It's certainly a comedy, not an epic like Lord of the Rings or Gone with the Wind. Still for the comedy, especially these days, it's a 10th. <br /> <br /> No long movie that moves quickly and easily. At home in the Kelsey grammar, this is the role of a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel submarine played in a war game against the US nuclear navy to see if terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defenses , (somewhat ironic this plot ... before 911) Do not take this topic seriously, because it usually laughs from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is the second commander (like "Frank Burns") and attracts many laughs. Everyone else is perfect for their parts too. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern. <br /> <br /> Just look, you have 90 minutes and need a laugh or pick me up and you are not a cheat (there is some language and allusion), then rent it. or buy it (we did it) and enjoy it! I wish they would do a part 2!
