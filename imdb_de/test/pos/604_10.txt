Jim Henson's The Muppet is a charming, witty and brilliant movie that adults and children can see AND enjoy. I think this is my favorite children's film because it combines great characters, a great story and a great joke that is irresistible. The plot includes the frog Kermit (played and voiced by Henson) in his odyssey across America to follow his dream in Hollywood. Along the way he meets Fozzie Bear, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf and DR. Teeth and the electrical mess. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many good things that I can not even say. But it's memorable and every time I think of a puppet or Muppet, I'll think about this movie. Look for Cameos by Mel Brooks, Dom DeLouise, Paul Williams, Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey), Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, and the great Orson Welles. Excellent and spectacular, one of the best films of the 70s. A ++
