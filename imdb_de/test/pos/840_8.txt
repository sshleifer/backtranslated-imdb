BEAST STABLE is considered by many to be the last of the "true" FEMALE PRISONER films, as it is the last in the series directed by Shunya Ito, followed by another film (GRUDGE SONG) by another director. I have not seen GRUDGE SONG yet (but I will soon ...), so I do not know how it fits in with the previous FP movies - but it will be interesting to see. The way BEAST STABLE ended did not leave much room for another predecessor - but I think I'll find out ... <br /> <br /> This entry has Scorpion fleeing from the cops where she joins a street hooker who becomes pregnant with her retarded brother (oh yes - that's not a lie ... I have to love those lanky storylines). Scorpion is eventually kidnapped by an old rival, but (since she's so good ...) she flees and takes revenge on some people who have hurt some of her hooker friends ... <br /> <br /> I agree with some Other reviewers agree that this point is slightly slower and "more serious" at points than the two previous entries. The story can be a bit confusing and complicated at times, but many of those little movies of the '70s era are - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE is pretty bad in the nudity, which was pretty disappointing - but I found it strong in other areas - plot, cinematography, some sloppiness etc ... Anyway, it's worth it for fans of this kind of people, or those enjoyed the other women PRISONER movies ... 8/10
