Incredibly funny of the Italian rootsploitation of the 70s with a lot of disagreeable S & M, lesbian sex, racist atrocities, etc. Only a few redeeming film qualities, except the rather cool theme music with dubby "African" drums and flute. Brilliant sample dialog: <br /> <br /> White Slave Owner (to White Plantation Manager): "You are so stupid, I bet you forgot to interrogate this late midwife!" <Br /> <br /> White Plantation Manager: "Not only did I interrogate her, I did so well that she died before I could get answers from her!" <br /> <br /> All black actors have 70s Afros, and say "yes, Massa" in a high voice. The female lead has sex with everyone on the plantation. 10 stars for fans of tasteless sleaze.
