You can not watch this movie for a history lesson. This was the first time I had heard of the Ma Barker saga, but I could almost immediately say that the facts were far away. And with a little internet research, I realized that I was right, of course. Ma Barker is certainly not the sexy, calculating woman in whom the movie portrays her as, and apparently she has not orchestrated all the bank robbers, kidnappings and murders her criminal boys have carried out. But do not expect a brilliant crime drama. The script and drama are appropriate, the shootings are exaggerated and mostly unrealistic, and there is a very ridiculous slow motion death scene. Why did I give him a 7 out of 10 points? <br /> <br /> Because it was damn entertaining. The shootings are fun, but there are some deeper issues that pop up between them. The film has a strong sense of ego intimidation among its performers of alpha males, each with its own agenda. And I appreciate the minimal use of curses for that time. The sets are magnificent and represent a compelling era of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie like a cult movie and take the exaggerated bloodthirstiness and recklessness of the kitschy, extremely serious comments of the FBI man with who wants to take the Barkers off at any cost. In other words, do not take it too seriously, just have fun with it. And if you like it, you'll love Serial Mom.
