I have to admit that I have prejudices about my vote on this film, but I have strong reasons because I know some of the true story that has been dealt with here in Hollywood. Edna Ferber's novel, on which this is based, comes from a time in which real names can not be used. In a way, this movie is all smoke & mirrors. Although it was published in 1946, it was filmed shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman radiates the most radiant in this film as a brunette. <br /> <br /> She plays a beautiful woman who tries to act with her beauty to get a rich husband. Today this is a gold digger, but in this social era she is desirable and the woman who makes all men have her, and all the old, crappy types of society talk about her and avoid them while they wish they were. Ingrid is in great shape and plays this role well. <br /> <br /> Some sympathy for Ingrid's character is shown in the New Orleans section of this film, when she managed to get a decent late tomb for her scandalized mother as part of her settlement from her relatives, so that she can leave New Orleans. The damn family of relatives is so scared of her that she'll do almost anything to make her leave the city. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper is doing well in this movie, although he is getting a bit older to play a Texas Bachelor / Gambler. He puts it well, considering the handicap he smokes because of his real life. Flora Robison as Ingrid's Maid was nominated for an Oscar as a Supporting Actress in this film. Jerry Austin as Cupidor has been overlooked for his role in many ways, but is the only comic relief in the movie and is doing well. <br /> <br /> When the film moves to Saratoga, it shows just how important Saratoga was in this era. I like the sequence when Bergman goes to the Saratoge Spring to get some of the "sulphurous" water, that everyone thought was so healthy. When she drinks something, she forces herself not to face and comment on how good it is and that she has to have more. <br /> <br /> The real story is the railroad battle that really took place on the railway line in Tunnel, New York - which is the actual Saratoga trunk from which the movie's title derives. This battle actually took place in 1869 between the agents of Andrew Carnagie and J. P. Morgan. The line was in 1869 the economic key of the country, which connected the coal country and the east coast. The hints are very real throughout the movie. There are even some dialogues in which Carnagie is described as a "Scot," although the reference to anyone who does not know the history of the battle is vague and unknown. <br /> <br /> The railroad and tunnel in Tunnel, New York (zip code 13848) still exists, although the film was filmed in California. The actual tunnel is about 1 mile long. It is still part of an important freight line, years later. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's line in the film, as he pulls the train into the tunnel, is true, it's still "mighty pretty country."
