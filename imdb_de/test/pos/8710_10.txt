This is one of the best and most moody vampire stories of all time! I really love this movie. The character is great, even the places and the story. The picture is not a big budget production, but it is absolutely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> OK, there are some bugs (especially the names of the castle and the places) in this movie, but it's usually such mistakes and almost every horror movie. <br /> <br /> The scenery fits perfectly with the story and is close to reality. I can honestly say that, because I visit them once when I was in Romania on my holidays. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best part of the subspecies series.
