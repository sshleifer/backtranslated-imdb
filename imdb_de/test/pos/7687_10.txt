I remember seeing this movie as a kid in the 60s. It took my breath away at a young age. I was glued to my seat in front of my black and white TV. The cast was one of the best I've ever seen in my life. The musical was one of the greatest ever written. Please refer to the Gershwin and Goldwyn Families, please publish them on video or DVD so that generations can experience now and in the future what I am sure what many of us did when we saw this great work of art not the Work of this great man is not seen for years. I pray and hope that the hearts of these families will soften and the world will see this great movie again.
