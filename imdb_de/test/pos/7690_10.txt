I saw this on TV more than two years ago, as I can remember, but I've never forgotten the performance of Sammy Davis, Jr. This rendering of Porgy and Bess is a treasure. I would like to see it again and introduce my son too. I just can not imagine why it's not being announced as one of Sammy Davis, Jr.'s greatest performances. Who is responsible for not bringing the audience, should be ashamed of his ignorance. But I will continue to search for it. Perhaps those responsible for such things will realize the forgotten work of so many African American actors.
