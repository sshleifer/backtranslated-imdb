This is a great horror movie for people who do not want that much vomit and thrill. This movie has just as much horror, excitement, humor and even a bit of light nudity, but nothing big. Linnea Quigley is not exaggerating as in "Return of the Living Dead," where she danced naked in a crypt, but she is still the same sloppy character. Cathy Podewell is a virgin and chaste figure before moving on to "Dallas," and we're also introduced to Amelia [soon Mimi] Kinkade, the house's sexy and weird wannabe darkmatrice. When she and Linnea are obsessed and take over the house, they revive the dead bodies of their dead friends to scare the survivors. I've heard that many people have compared this movie to "The Evil Dead," but if anything, this movie is a rival to the movie, just as Freddie competes with Jason. However, this film series is far superior!
