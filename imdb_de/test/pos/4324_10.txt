First, all I have to say is that I'm a big LOST fan. Everyone who does the show, I love them. There is really everything in it. <br /> <br /> I'm glad they have great people who can do it, for example Jack Bender is the best director, well, maybe after J.J. Abrams And of course, full appreciation for Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse. They are geniuses. <br /> <br /> The season two finale is definitely one of the best episodes of LOST !!! Live Together, The Alone focuses on Desmond David Hume's story of how he came to the island, and Henry Ian Cusick is so great at playing that character! The creators of the show would have been very stupid if they let Old'Des die with us. <br /> <br /> So, in LOST, the survivors of the plane crash have been there for 65 days ... 65 days, man. Whileas Rousseau has been there for sixteen years, and the others have been there for God for how long. Regarding Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof & Abrams. Anyway, I hope we get the answers we need in the third season. I can not wait any longer! My voice is nine.
