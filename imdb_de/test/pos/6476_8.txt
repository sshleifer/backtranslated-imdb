"Knute Rockne All American", the biopic about the famous Notre Dame trainer Knute Rockne, is an excellent sports movie. After never having seen it, we were surprised by the technique that director Lloyd Bacon used in the film. He shows that when shooting football matches he was ahead of his time. The result is a vivid picture of the man responsible for the heritage of collegiate sports, Knute Rockne. The film features Rockne from his modest roots in Chicago to his studies at the famous Notre Dame University in South Bend Indiana. He was an ambitious man who had a vision of how the game should be played. Luckily, he gave his beloved Notre Dame the fame he was looking for. Pat O'Brien looks a little older when he starts as a freshman. In fact, he does not change much throughout the movie, but as Mr. Rockne, he's fine. Pat O'Brien shows he was able to inspire the players by being just a father figure. Gale Page plays Bonnie Rockne, the wise woman who understood the call of her husband in life. Ronald Reagan plays George "The Gipper" Gipp, who was a legend who died far too early but left a legacy. Donald Crisp does a good job as Father John Callahan, who was Rockne's mentor at the university. <br /> <br /> This movie will not only inspire the sport because of the direction of LLoyd Bacon and the fast pace he gives to the movie.
