Take someone you love or love, and watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It touches you in the right places. <br /> <br /> All the other reviewers here have said everything. <br /> <br /> Maybe the cynical will not be impressed. <br /> <br /> You just seem to like the stuff that leaves you feeling depressed for days. <br /> <br /> This movie is Ga- I'm so glad the director is not USC-trained. This confirms my premise that there is too much mediocrity and conformity these days in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's because of the USC Lockstep mentality and inbreeding. <br /> <br /> Hurray for Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus, cast and crew. Well done!
