Thank God for the Coen brothers. Their success has given them bigger budgets, but they have not robbed them of their creativity. I had planned to watch another movie but it was sold out, so I went to that movie instead. When it started, I had forgotten what movie I would see there. I was surprised in several ways. This movie is funny, but they do not make cheap jokes just to get the laughs. The writing is brilliant and is delivered by George Clooney (and after that nobody can say that he is just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast with great skill. It can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can not remember the last time I saw a movie that was so smart. I have seen others that I would describe as beautiful, fascinating, funny and charming. Everyone also describes "Oh Brother," but this movie reminded me of older Seinfeld episodes that ended up with all the subplots. You can feel their journey is focused on something, but you can not say what. And the Coen brothers are not failing us, the end is certainly not disappointing. It is surprising and binds all loose ends neatly, without exhausting the story.
