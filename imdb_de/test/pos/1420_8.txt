A short history of time is not just a documentary about the beginning and the end of the universe and reality as we know it, it's a story about the man and the genius known as Stephen Hawking. It is his story that reflects the history of time and change in the history of the universe. The style of the documentary / editing style of the interviews begins and ends with a quick blackening. Almost like flashing between segments and interviews, the documentary gives a strange feeling, as if this were the perspective of Stephen Hawking and not the eye of the camera. The running time is just over an hour. It's a short story, but it could be talked about days and days. An interesting and proud story.
