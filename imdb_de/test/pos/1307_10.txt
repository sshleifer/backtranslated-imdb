That was a great movie. It had a "sot-so-beautiful" outburst. There were also some very intense (drama) scenes that could make it inappropriate for younger viewers under the age of 6. For a movie under the radar film, the acting was pretty enjoyable and set in our family room for a near-perfect landing. It caught the attention of our entire family, and we were sorry to see the end. <br /> <br /> This film had elements of espionage kids with young people rescuing the day, but got a more credible scenario. The dream scenes were initially a distraction, but have done much to set the story. The pranks and hi-jinx were also quite amusing. <br /> <br /> We hope you enjoy as much as we do.
