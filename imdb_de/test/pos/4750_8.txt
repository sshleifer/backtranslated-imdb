This movie is a classic seventies strip that unfortunately was overlooked for some reason. It's basically French Connection meets Bullit. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider plays the head of an elite group of detectives, known as "Seven Ups" an undercover op and gets killed. Scheider and his team have to find their killers. You are involved in a fight with the mob. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film must be the chase, which is obviously part of Bullit's success. However, this chase dominates Bullitt due to its length, speed and excitement. It's a breathtaking roller coaster ride that ends unexpectedly and spectacularly. Do not miss this little gem !!
