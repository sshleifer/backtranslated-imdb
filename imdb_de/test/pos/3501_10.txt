The thing with Ali G is that he picks himself and his character. <br /> <br /> Humor is a brand in which "Like it or love it" is a politically incorrect, disrespectful and self-extinguishing type. <br /> <br /> I personally love this movie totally and so has everyone I met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and select new gags each time. The humor is both acoustic and visual and the timing is impeccable. The humor is probably very English and especially London, so non-English viewers may not get the humor. Think of yourself as a teenager and you will love it - especially if you love Kevin & Perry Go Large!
