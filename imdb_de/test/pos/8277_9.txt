The full-length CGI movie was released just this year, but although it will provide children with a lot of entertainment, this is probably for diehard Alvin fanatics and followers who grew up with the cartoon shows in the '60s and' 80s, probably The Chipmunk Adventure The best Alvin and Chipmunks animated movie of all time. <br /> <br /> For beginners, the animation is as great as ever, the character designs are as they should be in the cartoons - unlike the movie itself is just plain fun to watch. There are no celebrity voices, no CGI effects, just pure 2-D quality, hand-drawn animations and the colors are fantastic - bright, bold and beautiful. The jokes and humor are typical chipmunk standards and the narration is just right. In truth, The Chipmunk Adventure is everything the live action movie should have been, but it is not. Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete with the Chipettes, Elenor, Jeanette and Britney in a hot air balloon contest. Along the way, the children encounter all kinds of problems and dilemmas that they have to solve in their own way. And no chipmunk movie is complete without the weird renditions of classic rock and pop anthems. <br /> <br /> The Chipmunk adventure is for kids and adults alike. This is another advantage over the CGI movie version will attract a few new admirers; the 1987 movie will appeal to both young and older chipmunk fans. Bagdarasian and Karman deliver the helium-like voices of the film trio. Overall, this movie is a must for fans of the comic shows themselves - you will not be disappointed. By contrast, once you've seen the live action version, you'll feel that this movie is a much better effort. If not, then you should see it or forget the Jason Lee movie and stay as an alternative
