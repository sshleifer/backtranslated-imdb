This episode of Buffy was one of my personal favorites. Also number three of Joss' personal favorites. In the episode, there was very little dialogue and despite the decision of the good people at Emmy it was a nomination. Unfortunately, it did not win. The premiere of Hush reached approximately 6 million viewers, which was the top rated fourth season episode. That should tell you something. Although there was very little talk, people were so fascinated that they could get involved. These gentleman characters (who played my pantomime) were some of the scariest creatures that produced the series (or any television show I've ever seen). Nothing is scarier than a bunch of men with silver teeth who approach you with a scalpel while they smile. I think the actors did a fantastic job despite the lack of dialogue in the episode.
