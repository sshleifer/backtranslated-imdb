Who should watch this movie? Anyone who has ever taken acid has read Philip K. Dick, thought the premise of the Matrix was better than the special effects, interested in philosophy, or liked to mix their sense of reality. I laughed a lot at this movie just because it was so outrageous and so punctual. This movie is great. This movie is cool. It's better than the matrix, in the long run (I did not fall asleep in existence, for a push: action / special-effects movies bore me dumb, and despite a plausible philosophical gleam, this is the matrix). , Existence is crude, it is disturbing and it is funny. David Cronenberg did some shonky stuff (Rabid) and some genius stuff (videodrome is another thing worth checking, as is Stephen King's The Dead Zone). But that's one of my absolute favorites. I can not remember the end - which is a good thing because it means I can watch it again. Or maybe I have not seen this movie at all. Maybe it's an implanted memory. Or maybe that really happened to me. I dont know. Anyway, it blends seamlessly into my general illusion of reality and I'm glad.
