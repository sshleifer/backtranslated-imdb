I recommend it to anyone who likes good acts, good actors (though not so well known) (often it's just better), science and / or science fiction intelligently portrayed on the (small) canvas, good special effects even if they did not have billions of dollars to produce them ... <br /> <br /> much better than any war in the stars ... <br /> There was only one commentary not necessary: When talking about the comet, the commentator says that LIFE may have been brought to Earth by a comet ... it's fun, there must always be a chance for a magical path, right? This is the good thing about life, it can go anywhere without external forces being needed
