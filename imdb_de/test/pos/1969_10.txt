This was a movie I came across by chance. I flipped through and saw it was on Showtime, so I looked at it. Now I watch it at least once a month. This is a movie filled with symbols that could cause some people to throw it in the bin. Do not listen to people who hate this movie. If you want an action movie with expensive footage, you should have rented a movie that promises them. If you are in the mood for a good science fiction, I can only recommend. When buying on DVD, I recommend the Alliance Atlantic Edition of the film, which contains much more extras than the Dimension Films Edition.
