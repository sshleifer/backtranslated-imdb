I agree with all the above comments. This show was a pleasure to see. Funny, funny, terrific drama and crazy sets. It's always a thrill to find a show that has been skilfully written, provided the audience has a brain and a subtle sense of humor. I would spend good, hard earned money to watch it on DVD again. And as long as we demand the Smart series that never had a chance ... How about the DVD releases of Maximum Bob (another well written, weird duck show with a wonderful cast of characters.) And add to list .. Middle Ages or Frank's Place. There is a way to bring these shows out of the vault into the hands of enthusiastic fans and new viewers.
