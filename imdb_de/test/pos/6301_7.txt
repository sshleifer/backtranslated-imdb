I saw this interesting film at the last film festival in Dubai with the Sino-French movie "2046". Both were intelligent works in the same year (2004/2005). Both had the main characters in a "hotel". In both films, the hotel is more a metaphor of exile than a place. Both dealt with the love between a man and a woman. Both had wonderful music and fascinating performances. What a coincidence and yet how do the two films differ in the treatment of the topic! At some point at the beginning of the film, a man walking on a sidewalk looks at a woman and beats a lamppost. The audience breaks out of an innocent volcano. But is not this short recording the summary of the movie that will entertain you for 2 hours? While the film is a wonderful mix of black comedy (with a stethoscope, for example, to hear the conversation of the neighbors), the film builds on what Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati had earlier introduced to the cinema - stoic faces leading to a comedy the equally intelligent world of Robin Williams or heartwarming Danny Kaye. A sudden burst of activity transforms an otherwise stoical character as the money moves from the hotel to the bank reminiscent of Tati's works. <br /> <br /> But the movie is not a mere comedy. The anti-automation statement (cash count and the bank employees' reaction to the statements, the dummy acting as an ineffective warning to the raving lady, the reference to "Moulimix" as the fictitious "company" he works for, and so on). ) are various indications that the director offers the viewer a loaded comedy. Laugh, yes, but think about it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The film's power lies in a short staccato script (by director Paul Sorrentino) that features a comedy mixed with philosophy ("Truth is boring" "Dad is dead, but nobody told him") "Bad luck does not exist - it's the invention of the losers and the poor." Then the director introduces you to a fascinating lecture by the main character in front of Insomniacs: They will not sleep through this lecture. <br /> <br /> Sorrentino offers Entertainment tied to the theme the Italians know best - The Mafia It's an existential Mafia movie <br /> <br /> Since "The Truth is Boring," the director offers a dessert as part of it the fine dining of superb drama (Toni Servillo), good music, skillful camera work (Luca Bigazzi), a beautiful, enigmatic actress (Magnani, granddaughter of Anna and a powerful script.) The dessert is for the viewer to find out if that, What in the movie, the truth was. It would have been boring, d If it was, right?
