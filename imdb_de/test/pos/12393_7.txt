It is generally an accepted fact that Marcel Carné's films from 1936 to 1946 are masterpieces, and it is polite to say that the rest is mediocre. This is an unfair opinion: At least two of the last epochs are excellent to see: "Thérèse Raquin", his best postwar work and "les tricheurs" (the cheats). <br /> <br /> There is a strange development from Prevert's golden hour to "les tricheurs": "les enfants du paradis" "quai des brumes" "or" le jour se lève ", which becomes true love There is no real love left in "les tricheurs": we are dealing with a group of young people who believe in nothing, falling in love would be incompatible with this youth, adults are not villains at all and Mother are kind people, but she is beyond her command Very few adults turn up anyway. <br /> <br /> For two hours, the characters do not stop playing around, dancing, listening to jazz records (a music that was not quiet.) part of the bourgeois culture) and drinking heavily.If two of them discover that they care about each other, it will be too late. <br/> <br /> The cast is pretty good, Laurent Terzieff as existential cynic and Andréa Paris as rich Child is the standout. On the other hand, Pascale Petit and especially Jacques Charrier (who married Brigitte Bardot in the same year as "les tricheurs") do not possess the ambiguity their members demand. They all smile, too cute and too nice to be credible. Strangely, "les tricheurs" was called "nouvelle vague"! You know what the priests of this cinema school (like Godard) thought of Carné, it's really a good joke. But the disappointment that you feel throughout the movie is really disturbing.
