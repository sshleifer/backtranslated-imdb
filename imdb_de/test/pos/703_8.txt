Probably, because this is the first movie in Colombia in color, the colors look different, especially in the interior shots. They seem to be stronger and sharper and the result is somewhat unrealistic, but very pleasing. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy, but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford, who is an outlaw who wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman who begins to fall for Ford, and Claire Trevor is the Countess who leads the hall. There's a funny character named Nitro who does not think twice before he blows it. I especially enjoyed two moments of the movie, one when there is a huge horse stomachs product and you see thousands of horses. At that time, there was no computer that could help. I suppose you must have collected all these horses, not an easy task. Another moment is the last shootout, technically very good. There is also a fist fight. When you see this 1943 Western star with such great action scenes, you come to a sad conclusion: you do not do it anymore. Could they do it, if they wanted it? I have my doubts.
