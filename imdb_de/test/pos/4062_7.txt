Since many of today's films are to blame, the plot is not exactly outstanding, the movie does not move anyone, and this certainly will not justify a price (outside of Blockbusters' maybe) care. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro teamed up to produce a very funny, sometimes hilarious movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small games well. Man, I hope my wife will be as old as Miss Renee in the future. <br /> <br /> This "buddy" cop moves in a reasonable time with a big laugh. The movie is pleasant enough to avoid waiting for the release of videos / DVDs and continue instead. Eddie Murphy is in his usual top form and is absolutely enjoyable to watch. De Niro has shaped this kind of role perfectly. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and I think that any real movie fan who needs a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy Showtime. <Br /> <br /> High Performance: Murphy. Hilarious Enough said. Director: Nice. Nice action scenes that Murphy and De Niro used together as a charm, Russo had a nice side job. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. It will not move you or anything ... but it's a very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> It's Showtime ... was a great success.
