"Putney Swope" is a unique gem from the late 1960s that would probably have been forgotten in the time, if not for two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (called Don Cheadle's character in "Boogie Nights"). Buck Swope (after the eponymous hero of this movie) and the limited DVD release. "Putney Swope" is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it may not make much sense (at least not for me the first time), but you have to respect the film for its passion and respect for its outrageously rebellious message. I did not understand much about "Putney Swope", but for the most part I liked it. The more I think about the movie, the more it grows for me. <br /> <br /> The film is advertised as a parody of New York's Madison Avenue, which became known in the 1960s as an advertising space in the world. Generation X and Y members may be lost on this concept, but luckily, "Mad Men" is on television to deliver this otherwise lost piece of US history. Before you watch this movie, you need to know that these ad agencies were mostly masculine and mostly white facilities. <br /> <br /> From this point of view, the film opens with a board meeting of an advertising agency. The members are mostly white, with the exception of Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson, who in this movie has a sinister resemblance to Dick Gregory), the African African American on the blackboard. The board members are so selfish and soulless that if their chairman dies before them, their only concern is who will be chairman next. Without removing the body from the boardroom, they begin a paper choice to elect the next chairman. Putney Swope is chosen by a landslide, but not because the other members consider Swope qualified. The vote for Swope was an unfortunate attempt for these board members to sabotage the opportunity of another member to be elected chairman. After her plans backfired, Swope takes responsibility and "sinks the boat," fires all but one of the original members and sets all the colored people in their place. <br /> <br /> After that point the movie became (for me) very funny and hard to follow. There may not even have been a conspiracy. The whole idea of ​​the film seems to be a "what if" scenario, with the result that the new "Truth and Soul Inc." Company would be unconventional, but still successful. The company makes so much money that members build a huge glass cabinet to keep the money for inexplicable purposes. It may be that Swope does not trust the banks, although this point in the film is not touched or explained. It could also be metaphorical in a sense, but who knows. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in the advertising agency, with occasional scenes in the White House with a president who for some unknown reason is a dwarf I assume that a political joke was made, however I can not figure out what. Did the filmmakers say that the president is a small, insignificant part of American life? Did you say that the last elected officials (then Nixon) were insignificant candidates? I dont know. I found it a bit scary that the man who played the president had a striking resemblance to future President Ronald Reagan. It is funny to make this connection 40 years after the film is made. <br /> <br /> What may have benefited this movie is how consumers outside the ad agency responded to the new ads. Of course, the commercial had a weird, weird attraction for its unconventional creativity, but did these ads convince people to buy the product? If so, how? The film pointed to the idea that the new ad campaign was successful due to customer interaction and White House appeals. However, it would have been instructive to see average people, as this demographic evolution has always been the most profitable for advertisers. <br /> <br /> Even if the parodies and political messages that this film has made were probably not the test of time, this film still had many unique qualities. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X-factor for him, which greatly benefited him in this film. Swope's rough voice was actually the director Robert Downey, Sr.'s voice, sometimes badly sung, but suited the character who is a meaningful outsider. He hires and dismisses workers randomly, but earns the respect of all but one of the employees for revolutionizing the advertising agency and finding new ideas. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film was and is incredibly risky, especially since the film was written and directed by a white man (Robert Downey, sr.). However, this film refuses to fall prey to negative black stereotypes that would later lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre. Although some of the sex scenes may be a bit daunting for some viewers, the main message is that a black-owned company can thrive on innovation and risk-taking. Many people may not take a positive message from this movie, but I just did it. <br /> <br /> "Putney Swope" remains an overlooked movie from a foreign time and Downey Senior (despite his youngest son) comeback) never got the recognition as a director he deserved. However, if you find a DVD of this movie, buy it and look at it. If it's on Netflix, too. It's a film that can be confusing at times, but it's worth seeing for its ambition, ambition, and non-conformist stature, even after today's film standards.
