Do not get me wrong, it was fun to watch. It has some nice animations except for weird looking bugs and some nice music. And the outstanding scene was definitely Elmer, Bugs and Daffy's dance on the floor, that was such a nice and funny touch. In fact, the whole cartoon is nice to look at, but all in all, it's not what I call Carrotblanca. There are some very nice gags, but they were used before I felt, and there was not much that I would find funny. And Daffy joins Elmer? Somehow, when he was a hunter's target, it did not seem strange that he was friends with him. Although I have to admit that it was nice to have Daffy with me. The voice output was also above average, but somehow I missed Mel Blanc. <br /> <br /> All in all an extraordinary but very nice cartoon. Bethany Cox
