Sweet, entertaining story about a 17-year-old boy controlled by a presumptuous religious mother and withdrawn father, and found in working with a retired, eccentric and tragic actress. Very well played, especially by Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of the teenager well and shows that his talent lasts longer than the Harry Potter film series. Laura Linney plays his ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of salvation, so there's no room to like her at all. But the film is a very entertaining film, well done by the British in the style of Keeping Mum and Calendar Girls.
