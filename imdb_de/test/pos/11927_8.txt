This was a big surprise for me. I had never heard of this movie when I saw it for the first time, and the title really showed something other than a great terrorist / hostage situation at a high school. Toy Soldiers made the most of their time in the early '90s, when action movies were carefree and very enjoyable. The action is good, the plot is interesting and anything but usual, the villain is a one-dimensional, hateful douchebag (which is great), Louis Gossett Jr. is there, it's just a feel-good movie that I really liked. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong if you like action. I give a solid rating of 8/10.
