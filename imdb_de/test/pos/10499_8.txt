Nobody can say much about this film ... the plot is pretty simple: two police officers (who also happen to be lovers) use a brothel as a stakeout to catch a criminal with the help of the "criminal". Lady of the House, "played by hardcore pornstar Chloe, anyone can guess there are some plot changes and some blurry alliances, but the writing was just awful, even for a softcore movie. <br /> <br /> Me I've read some of the previous posts about Nicole Hilbig's accent (she plays the female cop) Yes, it's hard to understand what she sometimes says, but I think I've placed it, I've been snooping a bit ... I think so she comes from Germany, hence her funny sounding accent, she makes an impression without speaking too ... she has a great looking body. <br /> <br /> In this movie there were some sex scenes "of back ", which was pretty graphic for a softcore movie ... excellent work there, the three-way scene towards the end was not bad either. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> < br /> I knew the cop turned into a part-time girl In the end. She enjoyed her three-way WAY too much. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> I will not know much about TOO history a lot as this is a low budget, direct-to-video softcore movie. However, it seems that I have seen too many films with a similar kind of plot in this genre. <br /> <br /> Women: B (Chloe and Hilbig were alright as eye candy) Sex: B + (The scenes were a bit short, but good.) Story: C (a recycled plot, but whatever works, or?) Total: B-
