I recently saw the short name "The Reader" and found that the movie was well planned and executed. I really felt for both characters that Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz portrayed in this film. Elizabeth could show a great reach with her blind character and felt emotionally connected. Morgan was able to sell me that she was totally committed to saving "Sissy" or Franz from the grief of losing her sister who lives in Copenhagen. The great thing about the film was the short running time and the budget of only ten thousand dollars. Duncan Rodgers was able to make a well-made film that sustained the viewer's interest. Rodgers has a great insight into the actor's abilities and the transition to great camera settings to show off his talent. I always have the feeling that if a director on a small budget can make a great movie, what can he do with a much bigger one? Great job, Duncan !!
