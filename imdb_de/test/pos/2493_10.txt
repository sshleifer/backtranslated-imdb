You can not watch a movie like Peter Watkins' Privilege, a story about the exploitation of a pop musician by big corporations, the state and even organized religion, without thinking of creatively degenerate goods like Michael Jackson or Britney Spears. to cherish the wrong ones like Pepsi or another poison for money. Or any number of entertainers in music or films who become tools of political parties or commercial religious interests such as Scientology and Kabbalah. A film like Privilege's 1967 release seemed almost science fiction, so fantastic was his premise. Nowadays, we tend to take celebrities for granted, without having to address the more worrying implications. Watkins' vision has not only become reality, we tacitly accept this reality as "normal." <br /> <br /> Now consider Punishment Park. While Privilege challenges the viewer to examine what is being sold to us and why, Punishment Park demands that we reckon on what is being taken and why. <br /> <br /> Heaven helps America and the world when contemporary politicians get their hands on this film. It's already so close to reality that lately I have experienced a real, nauseating sense of anxiety. Watkins skilfully uses a documentary narrative. While some rough edges of the technique became visible in Privilege, Punishment Park developed a sharp, seamless perfection. The sense of realism is reinforced by disarmingly unpretentious, economic and credible representations of the entire cast. This kind of acting has completely turned Hollywood away in its favor in favor of cosmetically perfect image projections. The cast has first-rate material that Watkins script can work with. <br /> <br /> Many cinematic visionaries have tried to rip the viewer out of their random, false sense of security. No one has ever achieved this result with such blatant and worrying accuracy as Peter Watkins does here. <br /> <br /> "What seems clear now is that it is trying to bring the alienated and excluded Americans like this back to the national community, the government has decided to accept and exploit the current division within the country and campaign for the majority Instead of the policy of reconciliation, she has chosen the politics of polarization. "<br /> <br /> To formulate one of the characters, we do not have to call them pigs because they know what they are. Better than us.
