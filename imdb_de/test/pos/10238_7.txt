The fun of Barker's Nightbreed is that it's the story of someone who was raging, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. In this case, the monsters (the offspring of the title) are the "good" guys. With Addams Family's first film and much of Tim Burton's work, he shares his sense of celebrating the other, the twisted and the dark. It also has the piety one would expect from a piece by Barker. <br /> <br /> Especially enjoy the performance of Cronenberg as a really bad, human doctor who wants to destroy the Nightbreed. As in most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the monster's castle with torches and pitchforks. Only this time, the modern environment replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic "weapons" with weapons and bombs. And this time, the sympathy you felt when you burned Frankenstein's monster in the windmill was the real center of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, and even Barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling, working. But it's fun, it looks good and stays light without mocking. Worth a look!
