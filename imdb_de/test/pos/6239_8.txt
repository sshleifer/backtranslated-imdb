Despite a stupid premise, ridiculous action devices, and low budget, Tourist Trap <br /> <br /> manages to be conspicuous. A creative, beautifully recorded film, a must. You have to throw rationality out the window to fully appreciate what the director has been trying to do. If you can do that, you will experience a pleasant surprise. Also note that this is one of the few semi-classic horror movies that has not been spoiled by numerous sequels.
