One day, I surfed through IMDb as I stumbled upon "The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird." When I realized how dark it was, I decided to look for it. Thanks to Digiview, it did not take long, so I bought it for a dollar, and when I got home, I saw it, though I have to say that I was pretty impressed. Three of Them The paintings in a royal dwelling, a shepherdess, a chimney sweep, and a self-portrait of the king (who is as selfish and sadistic as the king himself) come to life one night while the king sleeps. The shepherdess and the chimney sweep flee while the king's painting calls the police to catch the couple. Fortunately for the couple, Mr. Wonderbird helps them and often scoffs at the police and the king. The back of the DVD case describes this film as "a surreal visual delight and underestimated introduction to the history of classic animation." I could not agree with that, because many backgrounds are quite bizarre and many characters are weird, including the depressive citizens an underground city and hungry lions calmed down by the music of a blind man (who looks like Andy Warhol, not to mention Mr. Wonderbird himself, is a bit eccentric.) The movie is very creative and fun, and the only drawback is that he can move slowly, but on the whole the film was very good and is really recommended by you. <br /> <br /> Note: B + (Awesome)
