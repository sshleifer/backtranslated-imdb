What could happen in a boring Texas town this summer? Well, a few teens find out that a few things can happen. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the Mexican werewolf of this story is nothing less than el chupacabra, and the film, unlike the name suggests, is not a remake or a lookalike of American werewolf movies, but something completely different , Overall, it's not bad for an obviously low budget movie! Slightly camerawork, pretty-looking traditional creature and gore effects, and exceptionally ignorant people who can make mistakes and make a shot like a colleague who thinks it's the big, bad beast, and is stunned by things, they might not know. <br /> <br /> Get involved in this action with a million dollar blockbuster production, and you'll disgust it after a while. Sit down and expect a bit of entertainment and a relatively simple story, and it's pretty good! All in all, it gets 8/10 from me because I'm creative, OK and did a good job on the budget of this movie.
