This was a great movie in the truest sense of the word. It deals with the topic of tribadism in a society that does not tolerate any deviation from the norm. It criticizes many Indian customs that many find oppressive - such as the mediation of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the evaluation of women in terms of their ability to produce baby, the mandatory concepts of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that transcends the boundaries of society that the two protagonists find. The movie is well played and real, unlike most Bollywood films, it's absolutely believable from start to finish. The main flaws of the film, as I saw it, were, first, that the two lovers do not necessarily feel attracted by a natural affinity for each other, rather than being rewarded by the fact that they are stuck in dead ends without passion and no. This can play a role in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people who are in the same situation do not become "homosexual." It seems clear from the start that the two characters are quite heterosexual - when Radha plays her scene with Aashok at the end of the film, she makes it clear that "she was dead without desire," and the implication was, if he wished if he had been able to fulfill them completely, and even if Sita seemed very disappointed, as if her husband did not seem to like her. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals - they may seek consolation from others in the same position, but the film does not make it clear at all that they are lesbians from the beginning - on the contrary. Although some people are bisexual, most people tend to be either straight or homosexual. The ladies in the film both had insensitive jerks for husbands. , , If this had not been the case, would they of course have felt the need to express their desire in a relationship that they otherwise might not have considered? The movie ignores this. The other mistake is the naming of the characters. , , The names Sita and Radha appear to be deliberately considered as shock and outrage (imagine a movie in America depicting a gay relationship between a man named "Jesus" and another name "Paul"!) By name use that are related to various Hindu fonts. The film is strong enough to stand alone and does not need such devices in my opinion. Anyway, the mistakes of the film's strength do not decrease much. It is, indeed, a very touching and powerful story - the pictures and characters stay with you long after you leave the theater.
