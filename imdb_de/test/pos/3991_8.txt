Attention - this movie has some amazing graphic images and should never be seen by children. <br /> <br /> The artist that is the subject of this story was indeed a fine Korean painter who has risen from the deepest depths to become her the greatest painter Unfortunately, this guy was in many ways an idiot. Part of it was the artistic temperament, and what seemed to be annoying was only his demanding nature when it came to art. At other times he was just a drunken idiot - especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. Late in the film, his annoying, raw and unnecessarily cruel nature seemed to have waned. Although not all that made him a nice man, it is important to record on film so that we understand a lot about the artist's nature. <br /> <br /> I really loved the movie and loved it like The actual work of the artists was shown throughout the movie (as in LUST FOR LIFE). I really wish I could show this to my students (I teach at an art school), but I can not, because there is just too much material for adults. Yes, there is nudity, but even more problematic for any audience (especially younger ones) is when he ... hmmm, I do not think IMDb even lets me describe what happened, but it was very descriptive involving bodily fluids , Not just an unpleasant and disgusting scene that did NOT have to be seen, but also a reason to keep Junior from watching this otherwise wonderful movie. It's a shame.
