After seeing "A Texas Tale of Treason," you'll feel a renewed loathing for the nature of the Hollywood beast. In the interviews and conversations of everyone involved in the project, there is a general sense of camaraderie and rebellion that includes backgrounds, social classifications and even geography. This is due to the hard work on the uninterrupted dedication of the entire production for the project and the love of the story from the original film and the complete creation of the vacuum created by it. The scale of the people involved in "Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday" was amazing for me, with no budget and no fame production. There were no trailers or craft shops, no amenities, and yet everyone involved stuck to it. If nothing comes out of this project, Antstuie Productions have laid the foundation to be a serious, honest company that never indulges and takes or sells and makes a movie just for the money. I would like to see an L.A. director conduct the guerrilla process to get a shot. A more realistic, realistic cinema is missing at this time of CG and Green Screens. The masses may enjoy their entertainment spoon fed to them in pretty, bite-sized, censored quiet pieces, but there's a large group of people around the world who share the opinions and insights of the filmmakers, who still films for the love of the Doing material or love of storytelling, no DVD sales or box office. I loved this documentary, and I hope that the IFC has the Cahones to pick them up and air them so that maybe another person decides to get a camera and film a real life so that we even watch the viewer One may have the temporary understanding that all people are the same everywhere, and anyone can be a true storyteller.
