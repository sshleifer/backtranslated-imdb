Please let me know from any versions of Precious Bane or Gone to Earth on video that people know. I wholeheartedly love the books of Mary Webb and would be very grateful to have information on VHS or DVD. <br /> <br /> I've read Precious Bane and Gone to Earth, my favorites from Mary Webb. many times and have also collected other novels from her. I was fortunate enough to have found her poems and essays on "Springs of Joy," but I never saw the Precious Bane version of Masterpiece Theater or the full version of Gone to Earth, though there was an American film classic broadcast by The Wild Heart, a hacked version of Gone to Earth's original movie. <br /> <br /> If someone can assist me in obtaining copies of these films (full versions), I would be grateful!
