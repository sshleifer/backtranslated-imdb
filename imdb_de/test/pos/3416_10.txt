We saw this movie last year at the Toronto Film Festival. It was a really moving experience. I had heard about the process of Truth and Reconciliation, but as others have written, I did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and growth that can occur when people are able to face their past, understand the events from the perspective of other stakeholders, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in the development of the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions. Seeing this movie gave me hope for humanity. If we can do T & R, we may not destroy ourselves. People will look back on T and R as the first step out of human youth and maturity. <br /> <br /> As a film, of course, there were shortcomings. I have not encountered any major problems in acting, directing or writing - but for the first time in years, I was completely lost in a movie, so maybe I did not notice. The audience in Toronto would not give up the stage for the next movie, we had so many questions and comments for the stars and the director. Tom Hooper, Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor went outside to the sidewalk to continue the conversation. People came by to shake hands and thank them for the movie. It moved us all.
