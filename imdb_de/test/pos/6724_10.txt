I first saw the Korean version of Daisy. It was a simple love story that flowed well from start to finish. I saw it 3 times while waiting for my copy of the director-cut. <br /> <br /> Then I got the DC and looked at him. Impressive! I think that's the first REAL Director's Cut I've ever seen. Amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions! The DC is designed like a hardcore thriller, with the love story in the background. It moves slower than the Korean version. The differences between the two versions are so dramatic that it looks like two completely different films. I thought I would watch the movie again and laugh at it, just to look for the added scenes. That was not the case. It really felt like I was seeing a whole new movie. <br /> <br /> Although the DC is 20 minutes longer than the Korean version, it will be difficult for you to determine where or what has changed. Chopped off for 2 seconds here. A second one added. An entire scene added here. Another one was deleted there. In both versions, scenes were added, omitted or decomposed and rearranged. In some scenes entire lines of dialogue were replaced or rearranged - while the scene itself remained untouched. In each version even simple sound effects were added / omitted - which significantly influences the mood of the film and sometimes even changes the result of a scene. What appears to be a tender moment in the Korean version is a sad, bleak moment in the DC. The ends of both versions leave room for interpretation. As far as I can tell, both versions end much differently and were intended this way. I'm assuming that most people will buy the director's cut of the movie and find the movie pretty decent, but a bit long and boring. If so, look for the Korean version. Same movie, but different feeling. I think there is a Deluxe 3 DVD version that contains both parts of the movie - not sure. <br /> <br /> The versions complement each other so well that I, as a couple, often see Daisy as one of my other favorite Korean movies. Alone I would say that the Korean version is a beautiful love story that I would watch from time to time. The directorial cut, maybe I'll watch once or twice, then never again, if I find the tempo boring. But they just go together so well! For what I consider the best experience, I first look at the Korean version. Then take a look at the director's cut to fill in the gaps that interested you. <br /> <br /> The cut is the real star of the movie.
