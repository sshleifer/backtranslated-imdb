Campfire Tales is definitely not just a creepy and always fun ride through several popular stories, not just for urban legend lovers. It's also a movie that surpasses my (low) expectations. A horror movie that I've never heard or read about, direct publication of the video (the latter often surprises, but horror movies can be all or nothing these days). ... well, I'll leave you the math. <br /> <br /> The film proves to be entertaining, exciting and overall very enjoyable. The four stories are good and satisfactory. The only thing I thought was weaker was "The Locket," for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for its plot or the actions of the characters. Nevertheless, I loved the story, its atmosphere and its end. My favorite was the third story, "People Can Lick Too" - the excitement is not only tangible, but also instructive chance, and then recommends it to anyone. <br /> <br /> 7/10
