Funny and cheap comedy at its best. These unique, individual sketches with rich, self-contained humor are reminiscent of really slippery kids in the hall. Be prepared for some of the most arbitrary and most recitative lines filled with ethnic insults and terrible language. Sex toys included! <br /> <br /> There should be more comedy today. This collection of sketches on a DVD will warrant many views and reviews to honor some of the pieces. If you've enjoyed The State and / or Wet Hot American Summer, get ready for more fame. If you consider this for a younger audience, I would say that every child on earth should see this.
