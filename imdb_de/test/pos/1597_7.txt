A movie to share the viewers. Only points of criticism point to the tempo of mourning, overly used zoom zooms and stubborn glances between the protagonists. Proponents refer to the impressive performance of Dirk Bogarde and the reference photography of Pasqualino De Santis in Venice. <br /> <br /> Taken together, this could be an indulgent, romantic elegance for the nobility of homosexual love (at one time, 1971, when it was amicably legal). In fact, Visconti has managed to create a richer and more complex film than such a single issue vehicle. He has put his ideas - weaknesses and everything - into a meticulously moving arc. Inside is actually the central power of Bogardes Aschenbach. Instead of being a simple-minded, recently gay Johnny, he succeeds in giving a pathetic composer who is struck by tragedies and misunderstood integrity and sees salvation in Tadzio. His intriguing staggering around an increasingly hellish Venice after the boy is a metaphor for the artist's stubbornness for the truth in the teeth of the Dilettantenmob (and he is explicitly cut with such a flashback). Mahler's music may be a bit overwhelmed, although it is well suited. The Italian overdub is a major anachronism, but fortunately, acting does not suffer too much. 10.7
