There have been many great comments on this film and I would like to add my voice to the praise. Yul Brynner has never been so attractive. His Major Surov was fascinating. Your eyes just can not leave the screen when it's on it. That's his movie. The rest of the cast, which was also exemplary, especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson, is not objectionable. Since they were mostly stage actors, they have brought many nuances in their performances. For example, I've seen this movie at least four times, but this is the first time I've noticed the reaction of the German woman when she was facing a Russian soldier. Although he did not threaten, her hysterical reaction made me realize that she had been in Germany after the Second World War and was most likely raped by the Red Army. Being able to discover deeper stories that lie just below the surface makes me see this fascinating film again and again. Please put it on DVD.
