This film continues with 8 shots, 2 kisses and 100 clich√©s, as it should be possible. Nevertheless, it still works. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> As I drove home from the theater, I tried to figure out what to do with movie staples like the pages of a novel manuscript blowing across a beach, or the impossible series of random coincidences without the entire audience coming out and shouted, "I've seen that a million times before, and you've gone beyond the limits of credibility!" But the actors were so adorable and the screen filled with credible extras that I forgot to be interested. A friend who had seen it with me said it would transport him so perfectly to Paris that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized that we were still in Indiana, joke and elan.
