I need help identifying an episode of King of Queens. It begins with a scene in which Doug talks to Carrie on the phone and suggests that they agree to end each conversation with "I love you." However, it is hard to do and he calls her back just to close with "I love you". It's a very smart moment, and I think he says a lot about relationships that lasted a long time. <br /> <br /> I think (but I'm sure) to whistle Carrie and persuade her with loud comments to strengthen her mood. <br /> <br /> I saw this episode recently, but it was probably a repeat. I do not know in which network I saw it. Can someone give me the title and season of this episode?
