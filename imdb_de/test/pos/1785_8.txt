Well, I'm afraid that my review of this special does not pay much heed to the others' watch, but I just saw it - during a PBS membership - and honestly, I'm too excited not to say anything. To appreciate the puzzle Barbra Streisand really, you have to look back at the movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon in the mid-60s. When television was still a young medium, there was a form of entertainment in the air that today is only a memory: musical diversity. Some music shows were weekly series, while others were unique one-time specials that usually showed the special talent of each performer. Here we get the raw, uninhibited first glances on Streisand. She has been a guest actress on other variety shows such as Garry Moore and Ed Sullivan, and has made a one-time tandem appearance with the woman who will leave her with the baton of Belter: Judy Garland. In 1966, COLOR ME BARBRA introduced Barbra Streisand in color (hence the title), but almost copying the format of her first special a year earlier. In three different acts we get an abstract Streisand (in an art museum for afternoons, which looks at works of art and sometimes becomes works of art), a Comic-Streisand, who admires an already revered in a studio circus audience (with many fuzzy and furry animals). And, best of all, a singing Streisand in mini-concert format - well, honestly, just like that. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised she still had the movie debut of FUNNY GIRL and was a songwriter, director and political activist. Here she is barely 24 years old and doing extraordinary things because, as she introduces in her own camera introduction, 'we did not know we could not, so we have'. The sequence of the art museum will be shot on a weekend in Philadelphia immediately after the museum was closed to the public on Saturday night. Apparently, this is done only with a color camera. Nevertheless, there are cuts, crossfades and tracking shots in abundance, resulting in a rather spectacular climax - the modern, slightly beatnik "Gotta Move". Having lost themselves between the modern abstracts, the Jazz Club Bongos begin. Streisand appeared in a psychedelic robe and glittery eye make-up and played the catchy staccato melody with an almost androgynous sex appeal. Do not you believe it or not that the moment is matched by Act 3, or not, that the moment is surpassed by another feat: in the concert sequence, in a white dress and in pearl earrings, Streisand recites the torch "Every Place." I hang my cap at home, "Tear the last notes and reveal one of those belts that makes you scream like a little girl, even if you're 44 years old ... and a guy. Just great old TV. Listen.
