It's always hard to put a 450-page book on a three-hour movie. I read the book before and found the BBC production to be the best for this difficulty. The qualities of the book have not been lost: the dense and vivid portrayal of a finger-smith patchwork family in London in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty of Maud's growing up, the characterization of different social groups through different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the movie makes viewers look the same in the same scenes, when told first from Sue's point of view and then from Maud's narrative. The main characters are doing very well, and above all the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first climax in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgive all the evil they were ready and doing each other. Because they still love each other. <br /> <br /> For each of her books, author Sarah Waters has thoroughly investigated what life was like in the British 19th century. While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of vaudeville theater and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the horrible reality of jailers and the fashionable evocation of ghosts, she reveals in Fingersmith the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhumane treatment of Persons suspected or declared disturbed in asylum on the basis of reading sources and scientific research. This translates very well to the movie, so the scenes show a high degree of historical truth. I highly recommend this movie production as it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions and excitement.
