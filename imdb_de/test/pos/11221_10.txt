After a few more reflections on this film, I find it far too easy to reject this as the boy's dream. I've actually got a spiritual power from Northfork ... angels really exist ... we're definitely entertained by angels ... most of the time we're not aware of that ... at a point of spiritual and emotional confusion in mine I personally really needed that movie for life. Yes, as I wrote, there are so many talking ... I can not wait to go to heaven ... <br /> <br /> "To be sick of the FX and Formula stuff, me I can only say that he has touched me so much that I can still fix everything The Heart The spiritual aspect is so intriguing to me, make sure that you do Using the brain and the heart that God has given you to follow the story These are the people he cares about the most: I want to watch him several times just to take in everything! <br /> <br / > Industry needs to study this movie to see that we exist. <br /> <br /> Thank you to everyone involved in the film.
