Valentine "Dogkiller" Dussaut and Joe "The Judge" Kern are pooling the streets of Geneva together! Thrill as they direct the kibosh at international heroin smugglers, Polish refugees, spies, veiled girlfriends, renegade dogs, and throwing bugs too lazy to store their recyclables. Do not be fooled by the misleading Miramax advertising campaign that defines her as a presumptuous Kunsthaus film. This movie is 100% action!
