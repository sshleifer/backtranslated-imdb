The two sisters Su-mi (IM Soo-jung) and Su-yeon (MOON Geun-young) return home with their father (Kim Gap-soo). Eun-joo (YEOM Jeong-ah) welcomes you, but su-mis behavior is bitter for her. Su-mi hates Eun-joo because his father behaved like a housewife after the death of the nurse. As Eun-joo sees her attitude, she treats the sisters cold and creates a tense atmosphere. <br /> <br /> As called by the atmosphere, there are a number of mysterious things in the house. When Su-mi hangs her dress in her wardrobe, many dresses of the same design have already been hung. When she puts her journal in a drawer, she finds another diary of the same kind there. When she sleeps in bed with frightened Su-yeon, she wakes a nightmare and she finds a woman on her - and a hand dangles from her skirt the woman! also other people. The next evening, the brother of Eun-joo and his wife visit the family and have dinner together. Eun-joo talks cheerfully about a crazy man she met as a kid, but nobody cares about her conversation. She says the crazy man annoys his brother, but he says he knows nothing about the man. <br /> <br /> The brother's wife listens as she hears her conversation. Panic. <br /> <br /> After dinner, the conflict between Eun-joo and the sisters is the worst. Eun-joo pulls Su-yeon into a wardrobe and locks her up. Su-mi saves the screaming sister and complains to her father what Eun-joo did to his daughter. But his answer is unexpected. "Give me a break." he says furiously, "Su-mi, please, do not make me tired." <br /> <br /> And the following words from the father's mouth are more shocking than what they saw in the house. <br /> <br /> Truth be told, I hate horror movies. Although I put myself in a theater because my intuition told me that the movie was something else, I regretted that my curiosity had made me act when he started to show. The regret, however, had changed to expectation ten minutes later. <br /> <br /> This movie is a tragic mystery more than a horror - painful more than terrible; nice more than sensational. This may have disappointed a hardcore horror fanatic, but for a mystery fan like me, this movie is a must. (9 out of 10)
