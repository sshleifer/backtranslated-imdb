This documentary focuses on the events in Gothenburg in 2001. In the Swedish media, the demonstrators were portrayed as criminals who stood for anarchy and violence. This film shows that there are no intelligent, articulate people who have anything to say - and this with the power of bricks. They believe in a better world, a world where people can think and say what they want - without aiming. But is your belief in having the opportunity to change society realistic? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This documentary will shed light on the issues of greed, capitalism and the future he might bring. It's a great documentary that's not propaganda because it's not shown as what you think is right. All it shows is what some people think, and it is up to the viewer to decide if what they do and what they are is right or wrong. I've heard a lot of people calling this propaganda and choosing to not see it, I think they are making a bad decision, because even if you sympathize with the police or the faith of the demonstrators, you'll just get more facts you can rely on. For example, the boy who was shot says he thinks It's good to throw a brick through a McDonalds window because it's the step between thinking and acting, as you think. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie freaked me out because you can not really dismiss the facts that the few police officers who have fought violence by force, has not been convicted or held in custody, despite the evidence that Bringing bricks on the march (and in some cases beating people with a baton, even though they come to rest on the road without resistance) were as good as they could be. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10 - Very good, but not the best!
