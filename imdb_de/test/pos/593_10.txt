Who does not remember The Muppet Movie? <br /> <br /> Kermit the Frog is now an American cultural icon. Which child does not like this character? <br /> <br /> As the first actual Muppet movie, the movie was simply called "The Muppet Movie" was very good. Kermit accepts the advice of a Hollywood agent and leaves his native swamp to respond to the ad. On the way he meets a pig, a bear, chickens, a rock band and a few other quality dolls. Look out for dozens of cameo appearances like Madaline Kahn, Steve Martian, Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks and many more. I grew up with this movie and I loved it.
