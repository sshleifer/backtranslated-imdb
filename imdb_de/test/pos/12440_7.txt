The happiest days of your life show some of Britain's greatest comedy talents of its time in a traditional farce and obsession. In general, it's a whistle-stop tour of stuffy English behavior, with the girls' school just providing a great backdrop to the shabby bustle. Margaret Rutherford, Alastair Sim and - especially! - Joyce Grenfell are all fantastic and laugh at us as they express their terror about what they are dealing with. As the film progresses, things get more and more dark, and the school cruise for the parents is an appropriate highlight for crackers. <br /> <br /> At this point I would like to once again Joyce Grenfell and. Mention her wonderful character Miss Gossage. She is so extraordinarily innocent, stupid, apologetic and ineffective that she seems to steal the entire movie. The biggest laugh of the movie is she flirting with a male teacher ("Call me sausage!"). <br /> <br /> While some of the films are slow or outdated and are not always very involved, they still keep the bulk of their sparkle and make for little romance. Good for a stupid, harmless giggle. <br /> <br /> 7/10
