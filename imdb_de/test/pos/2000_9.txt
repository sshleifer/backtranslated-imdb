A ghost story about a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects. Taylan Biraderler (Taylan Brothers) had her first recordings in a TV series a few years ago, as far as I know. This was a kind of Turkish X-Files, they had very nice stories, but lacked visual effects. This time they had what they needed and used it well. This movie will surely make you laugh and you could be scared too. It has a nice plot and some young, bright actors. If you are a high school student in Turkey, you will find so many things about you here. There are many clues in the film about its history and its end, some understand it at the moment, some make sense later, the dialogues were very cleverly written. This makes the movie one of the best Turk films of recent years. Do not forget that this film is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry.
