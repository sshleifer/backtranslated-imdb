I love foreign films and that's one of the best. I tend not to see this as a comedy, as it is listed, and find a comment on how we see others around us. Firmine's starring role in the film is not considered a must-have since she's a housewife in a large company and people are constantly saying and doing things around her that they would not otherwise tell her leave a wealth of information to the public Mortals can determine or break. :) This actress is wonderful as this character and it is a poignant story. There is an underlying story and almost many stories within the story in this movie. I just hope that if someone decides to make an American / English version of this movie, it's not the vein of Three Men and a baby who would definitely do a disservice to that FILM.
