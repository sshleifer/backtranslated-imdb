OK, that's nothing like the explosive pace of the opening sequence of the first part. still to his visual shock value; plus the melancholy tension of the second installment. No, it is surprising and refreshingly different (apart from the two main characters). The humorous futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other with an almost gravitational force across genres and languages. The moment of collision is your choice: a) Shakespeare's metaphor of life and humanity in a jersey; b) sublimation of violence in homo-eroticism; c) humorous detonation of an impossible construction. Everything up to this point is even less clear. Beware of those who have a refined palate.
