This wonderful movie is a love story and shows that not all relationships are permanent. Nevertheless, they can be great and worth the pain and suffering of separation. <br /> <br /> Director Pieter Verhoeff gives us a glimpse into the time around 1900, the way society (mis) treats women and how strong she is. (Nynke) deals with. With great costumes, landscapes, lovely music and good actors, this photoplay pulls you in for the full length of the movie. <br /> <br /> First, the ending ends a bit suddenly, a page that describes the rest of her life scrolls. Thinking, this is a great (the best) way to create your own fantasy for the rest of your life. <br /> <br /> This was the second movie for me that people had to sit in while the final titles of (The First Schindler's List). Apparently, the film had this effect for all.
