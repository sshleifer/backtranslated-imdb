I watched this show until my adolescence, but I still reflected many situations that worried us as a teenager, even though it was a family-oriented show. Until the mid-90s, it focused more on the young adults and their situation. <br /> <br /> That's why I loved "Step By Step". I mean, it offered situations for all ages and unlike many shows of this kind, it delivered expectations. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest; This was not an extremely funny show, no, but there were some situations that you could feel connected to, but only funnier. <br /> <br /> There was an extremely good charm between Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers. Duffy rocked! Sommers was tender and actually funny. I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was extremely sexy (she loved her legs) and was funny. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with his Cody figure. He was the man a day! Oh, the memories. Nowadays, this show could not adapt properly to the new generations, so it should be kept in the vault of memories. That's it, just memories. <br /> <br /> Thank you for making my puberty funnier.
