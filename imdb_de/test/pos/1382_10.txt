Got a chance today to see this with a friend and was impressed with what it has achieved on such a small budget. Not that it bothered me anyway, because I love low-budget science fiction like Dr. Who, Blakes 7 and Dark Star. Damn it, Outland was not a big budget thing. Although money helps, it takes more than just throwing money to make it good. <br /> <br /> The story is initially straightforward with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Your ship is under attack and they have to land on the next planet. Then they discover that the prisoner has made it too, he is a true cold nut case and that's just the beginning of their problems. <br /> <br /> The effects, aside from the shootings, are minimalistic and add a towering effect to the movie. Computer effects sometimes seem somewhat dubious, but they serve their purpose well and add to the story, giving the processes a futuristic feel. Movies like myself, Robot could have benefited from this approach, rather than largely replacing style and substance and replacing a plot with special effects, like too many Hollywood offerings. <br /> <br /> While none of the actors receives Oscar material, it's scanned tight and shot and at one hour and ten minutes it's not welcome. The characters are not pronounced much, but not in Predator, which resembles the feeling. The big man Mike Mitchell is a good representative for Arnie and is a good combination of mind and muscle. <br /> <br /> Some people may be annoyed when explanations are lacking, but I like it. Unlike many films and shows that keep things unclear, it's not so unclear that you can not handle them at all, and I'd like to see a sequel continue exploring the nature of the aliens. <br /> <br /> <br /> A small, crisp movie by an enterprising team that is cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. If that's what they can do with a bargain, I'd like to see what they would do with a little more money, and hope the movie industry and the talentless armchair critics will not let them get all the creativity out of the way first. > <br /> Recommended.
