Batman Returns is more gothic and darker than its predecessor, and I like it a lot. In addition, the scenery is darker, and the whole environment is sad, along with the soulful music composed by the talented Danny Elfman. <br /> <br /> However, I did not like the idea Penguin is a monster, unlike the comic books where he is human. Even though he looks like a monster, he shows well that he has a human dignity, and I was very sorry to see the tombstones of his deceased parents. Still, he was a dangerous villain, and he had to be stopped. Michael Keaton made a "tour de force" with his return as Dark Knight, and this time he is mighty the original Batman. It's not difficult to understand why he sometimes called Batman in public ... <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is also so sexy and good in her role, and she has a faithful performance as a female villain / crimefighter shown dressed like a cat The actors have really done a masterful job with Batman Returns, which has made him a successful movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked Batman, check out the great sequel, as he is a very valuable lover for all dark knight hardcore heads. <br /> <br /> Steve Baillargeon
