GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie ever, but also the most influential first-person shooter ever released on the gaming console market. If you are unaware of the plot of this game, that's no problem, because it's the same as the popular James Bond movie GoldenEye, released in 1995 - two years before the release of this game. <br /> <br /> This is a game filled with techniques and styles that would be imitated in future games of the future, offering players a variety of goals and challenging challenges. The A.I. is intelligent (especially at higher levels of difficulty) and the environments are complex enough to entertain and challenge all players. <br /> <br /> Introducing logical hit points for your enemies is a great feature. Even bosses in this game can be defeated with a targeted shot on the head. It's that kind of realism that makes you really feel like James Bond, and you can sneak in, sneak out, secretly take out stooges or trigger alerts and go through massive shootings. That's why there are many ways to beat the game, and unlimited ways to get things done. AKA: You can take simple or difficult ways to beat the levels ... and if you do not have a strategy guide, you need to figure out these paths yourself (which I can add is a lot of fun if you want to). Waste A day away). <br /> <br /> This is one of the games where the more you play, the more you can appreciate its contribution to the gaming industry. Every time I play it, I notice aspects that have been repeated in many subsequent FPS games. So if you have a Nintendo 64 and dust this vacuum cleaner and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007 because you trust me as a Bond fan and casual player, I can say that this game is highly recommended for those who want it Follow in the footsteps of James Bond, or simply experience a fantastic, immersive gaming experience. <br /> <br /> (Also look for the sister game Perfect Dark, which also follows on the N64 after doing the same controls and very similar weapon applications.)
