I can not imagine why everyone hates this movie so much. I often literally had to cry with laughter ("I trust you slept well?" "Actually, we had a hard night." "Ah, the dangers of adultery.") Granted, the end is a bit flat, but has Still his moments (the obvious counterfeit Booger ball being flown into the ocean, "Beach House Paradiso") movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
