This wonderfully funny comedy drama thrilled audiences at the Philadelphia Film Festival and brought them to wild applause at the end. The film is underpinned for years by expert performances of a nuanced cast, a robust performance by director Jeff Hare, a brisk pace and one of Peter Falk's finest performances, and is a loving tribute to the ups and downs of family life. <br /> <br /> Falk is a ninety-year-old Jewish man: Morris Applebaum, a decidedly eccentric Shakespearean who ends his life, but not before he brings his three adult children together and celebrates a "big, fat Jewish suicide party". The movie is full of irresistible pleasures. There is Morris "Plush Room"; Laura San Giacomo's passionate portrayal of Morris' cynical daughter; Comedic dialogue reminiscent of Neil Simon and Woody Allen; the dry timing of David Paymer, who plays Morris' son, a closely wounded psychotherapist; and the patented eggcreams from Morris (but be careful if you drink them too fast, this will freeze a bad brain). It is all surrounded by a comfortable, intimate atmosphere in New York City. <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare proves to be a master craftsman, producing remarkable performances from his cast and giving the film a happy humanity. I was fortunate enough to see Hare's previous film: the dark and powerful "Perfect Little Man" starring Neal McDonough ("Minority Report") as a Los Angeles man who goes insane. The visceral splinter of "Perfect" and the nostalgic breeze of "Checking Out" bear witness to Harle's eclecticism and talent. I look forward to reviewing his future work. <br /> <br /> I heard that "Checking Out" has no distributor at this point. A smart business would do well for this rousing jewel, as it is a potential feature film titan in the sense of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." The noblest thing is that people all over the world would get the chance to experience the pleasures of this movie.
