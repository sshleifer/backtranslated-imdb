I can not rate that very well because I can not say I liked it. But it was the story that bothered me, not the realization of the movie. The acting, the direction, the atmosphere and the music were all good. It's just that the movie ends after seeing a number of people doing things that you can not really identify with. It is educational in that it shows the horrors of war from home and how feelings do not have to make any sense at all and are still strong, but that is it. The plot covers a period of several years, in which the Poet Dylan Thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex-girlfriend. He is married, bringing his wife and later the child, while the ex (Knightley) marries another man. But the tension is there, Dylan is a selfish idiot and the new husband comes home from the war with a slight case of PTSD. Add some pretty spirited characters, and you'll have your hands full. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: You have to be "in the mood" to like this movie. The hard part is to define this mood. I do not think I've ever been there. Ever. Therefore, it is probably better for adults who understand comic behaviors and may be curious about Dylan Thomas.
