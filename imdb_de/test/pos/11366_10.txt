I followed this whole series when I was a kid in elementary school, by choice, not because it was necessary for the school. I have read the pieces in the tempo of the series. This experience gave me a lifelong love for Shakespeare and the story. It even gave me a bit of an acting mistake, but only for amateurs. Whenever I read one of Shakespeare's historical plays, the images I first come to think of are from this black and white production that can be seen on a large "furniture" television with rabbit ear antenna, with all the "ghosts" and wobbly ones That goes with it. <br /> <br /> Although the sets were minimal, if I recall correctly, that was completely irrelevant because the acting was so good. At the time, I had no idea who the actor was. Now I see that many of them have become known over the years. I especially enjoyed Hotspur and Hal, which I see played by Sean Connery and Robert Hardy. I would love to see it available on video, especially since many of the songs are rarely performed and even less available on video. It would also be valuable as a document of television productions from the mid-20th century.
