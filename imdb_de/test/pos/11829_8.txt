Interesting story and sympathetic treatment of racial discrimination. Son of the Gods is a bit too long and contains a bit of a hammock, but remains a fascinating movie overall. <br /> <br /> Story of a Chinese who starts as White (Bartholdy Barthelmess) when Barthelmess leaves college after being annoyed by three mindless colleagues. He undertakes a world tour to discover himself and ends up as secretary to a British playwright (Claude King). In Monte Carlo he meets the beautiful Alanna Wagner (Constance Bennett) and they fall in love. When she discovers that he is Chinese, she goes insane in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Plagued with guilt and love, Alanna gets into a mental spiral and tries to contact Barthelmess. After the death of his father, he takes over the business (banking?) And puts on Chinese clothes, as a symbol of his hatred of the white race, which has spurned him. After a San Francisco detective tells him the truth about his birth, Barthelmess makes the decision to honor his Chinese father and mother. <br /> <br /> And I agree that a reviewer never saw this movie. Alanna explains her love for Sam BEFORE telling her about his latest discovery. And that makes the difference in this movie. <br /> <br /> Barthelmess and Bennett each have a few scenes chewing the scenery, but on the whole, this is a solid and interesting drama. Frank Albertson is good as a nice college friend, Claude King is solid as the playwright Bathurst, Bess Flowers has a scene as an Oklahoma Indian and E. Alyn Warren is the Chinese father, Dorothy Mathews is evil Alice. Not as good are Anders Randolf as Bennett's father and Mildred Van Dorn as Eileen. Also note the gorgeous blonde to the right of Barthelmess at the roulette table. What a stunner, whoever she was!
