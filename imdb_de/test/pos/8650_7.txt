The whole movie made me think of the first circle of Dante's Inferno, in which the souls who "fool" themselves believe that they are happy. They never realize that they are actually in an inferno, but nothing is fun, they just move on without emotions. In that sense, Dante said that they were in the worst part because they would never actively try to change their situation. No one can die in this place, but it hurts when he tries. I'm not sure if the author based his story on this medieval manuscript or not, but the similarity is absolutely striking. <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy the movie when I saw it, as I had an expected climax that never came. Still, it made me think afterwards, and now I think it's a good movie - it definitely sticks.
