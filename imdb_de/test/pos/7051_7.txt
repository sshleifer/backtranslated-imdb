The plot is predictable. It has been done many times in other films. Here you have summer camps in competition: The rich children vs. the subordinates fighting for "bragging rights" in the typical camp competitions, while the children and comforters pranks, sex and "a good time!" Follow. "Are you ready for the summer?" Meatballs is the first (and best) summer camp movie for feel-good comedy. As others have written, it's not a Citizen Kane, but it's not supposed to be that kind of movie. The film works because of the wonderful comic timing and the classic one-liners by Bill Murray. His scenes with a motor home in which he tries to increase the self-esteem of the child are very good. Bill's one-liners throughout the movie are very funny. <br /> <br /> I also like that this movie is not filthy or explicit, as is the case with many other "teenagers in the camp" today. There are some mild sexual references and maybe one or two swear words throughout the movie. But Meatballs is the kind of teen movie that is actually suitable for younger audiences. It is a PG. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you have to see a few times to get all the jokes! When Bill Murray is on the screen or does one of his classic "PA announcements", it pulls you into the movie. Bill seems to be the film alone. But he does it so well that when you see Meatballs you realize that this is the movie that made him a star! A side note to this review is to avoid ALL meatball movie sequences. They are terribly bad.
