I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 12 years old. It's one of my favorites since ... It's so perfect in all its splendor, with fantastic soundtrack and kitschy dialogue, and it was both hilarious and terribly sad. The first movie I really just had a seizure in the end ... I will not ruin it for you, but boy it's a tear wanker ... I remember that I felt SO so sad for Gary! What a bunch of cool characters in this movie is awesome !!! They are all so great, even the nerdy girl that Gary does not like ... (she had a nice little body). I can not believe that all the girls are going for Rick, he's such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck !!! ha ha ha ... If you look at this movie, you have to be (almost) prepared for many sex jokes with sexually transmitted diseases. But a love story in the heart with real problems that lead from uncertainty to life-changing decisions that make you think and feel real concern about the occupation. I love this movie !!! If you love Valley Girl as another classic, you will!
