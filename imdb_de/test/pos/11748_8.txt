Age can not affect the beauty of this East-West love story for me. If we ignore the famous and beautiful theme song and its lyrics, we have a dramatic biography of two remarkable people trapped in a moment of countercurrents, including social conformity, bigotry, war, doubt, and the need for tremendous courage. Against the background of Hong Kong, this film tells the story of a Eurasian doctor and a US journalist who meet and fall in love during the Korean War. William Holden is smart, airy and a bit weak as Mark Elliott. Jennifer Jones may be as good as Dr. Han Suyin, alternately doubtful and ecstatic, eager and hesitant. Others in the large cast were Torin Thatcher, Isobel Elsom, Murray Matheson, Virginia Gregg, Richard Loo, Soo Yong, Philip Ahn, Jorja Curtright and Donna Martell; Many of Hollywood's best oriental actors also played smaller, uncredited roles. The screenplay by John Patrick followed hans exquisite novel. The direction of Henry King was firm as always. The plot of the story is how reluctantly Han fell in love with Elliott, with her busy and demanding schedule as a doctor and her doubts about her future; and how fearless he was, despite the intolerance and interference they faced when their affair became known. The film is undoubtedly physically busy, interesting and often beautiful. The hill to which the lovers settle, the lovely bay where they swim, is set in front of a bustling and crowded business city, major social events and teeming streets, hospital corridors and arterial arteries. With feature films by Leon Shamroy, Ben Neye's makeup, and Helen Turpin's hairstyles, the magnificent works of decorators, sound and light, the arts department, and all those involved, this is one of the most memorable productions taking place in a major US city outside the US at all times and one of the hardest to capture on film. But what most remembers here are the lovers, who fortunately are not extremely young, face up to the contradictions and accurately assess what they are - and then go on as if love played a role and the conditions that are set up as love barriers, not. The highlight of the affair is that Mark returns to war. Afterwards, Han gets his letters, even after she knows he was killed. They seem to be messages from a better world. In a world of hope, courage is the price of entry into the world, and it is always summer on a high and windy hill, above a zone where beauty and individual desires are sacrificed can. Lucky or pushed aside by evil forces of militants. Really, love is a treasured thing, Dr. Han. and this film is one of the luminous evidences of this doctrine, shining like a pearl, timeless as a Chinese proverb, and lovely as polished jade against a rough background.
