What can I say about this film, which all the other comments have not said here, they pretty much summarize everything, the people who love him appreciate him, the people who hate him ... well, they hate it. This is the movie equivalent of Marmite. Personally, I've remembered every second of it, it's cyclical, claustrophobic, introspective, magical, and stands as one of the most unique films ever made. Despite what many have said, I think this is a cult movie, it's a raw diamond, just waiting to be discovered. Once discovered, his fantastic psychedelic imagery and incredible soundtrack are unforgettable, which is already a feat. One of my friends who saw it was more like a musical, and in many ways with those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is shot, he would probably get more of it, when he sees Head as such. <BR /> <br /> I've always loved the Monkees, especially the TV show when it was repeated in the 80's. My mother had Head recorded for me when it was shown on television late at night because she knew I liked her. I looked at it a day later and it was remembered until about two decades later I could find a DVD on DVD. What I would love now is a special edition. It would be fascinating to get a deeper insight into the genesis of this masterpiece. We can only hope.
