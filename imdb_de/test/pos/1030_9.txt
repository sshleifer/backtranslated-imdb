Oppenheimer was a great show (it was the first thing I saw in Waterston) and there are not too bad copies available. A similar situation exists for "Glory Enough for All," a British series from the same period, about the discovery of insulin. I would pay both for a good price on DVD. Is it really that difficult to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that can be played in the US? Another very pleasant series, also from the same time, was "Danger UXB". A series about defusing UneXploded Bombs, hence the name. You can get it at your local library. <br /> <br /> Pete
