Ignore the bad reviews here, this movie is fantastic! "Before Before Dawn" is a great example of what is possible in a movie on a minimal budget, if you have a dedicated crew, a decent script, and a cool idea for a movie. It's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed it a lot more than most of the other 80s slashers because the killer is so unique. "Wrong Turn" tore this movie from something violent! There is a lot of blood and anxiety. My girlfriend was freaking out and she watches almost everything with me and does not flinch. It has this weirdness about it. <br /> <br /> I would say "Just Before Dawn" is the best slasher of the early 80's. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
