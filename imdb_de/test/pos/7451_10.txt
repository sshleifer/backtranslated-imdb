Well, after seeing The Advent Children twice, the plot is not as superficial as the majority has criticized in my opinion. If you have not played FFVII or have not liked it for some reason, this movie is most likely not for you. Familiarizing the original story is a prerequisite to fully understanding AC. Otherwise, you'll only see the biggest CG animation in your life. <br /> <br /> Without really ruining the plot, I have to admit that I've seen AC. We've put together parts with my friends that rely on our knowledge of FFVII. Seeing it the second time allowed it to actually pay more attention to the story, and most of the questions we might have got answered. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players / fans and honestly does not try to be anything else. Outside the FFVII world, there is little realism that serves this purpose. Music is mostly reconstructed FFVII themes with a stronger note (TBM team after credits) and works invariably well with the Eye Candy. I've found that the music enhances the experience that has contributed to the visual fireworks in all situations. <br /> <br /> We all know that you can not use a FFVII in 1.5 hours, and considering that the storyline actually offers more than I expected. In FFVII there are two problems: AC and both stories were very smoothly grouped between the action sequences. And trust me when I say that there is a lot of it. Action, that is. <br /> <br /> I change my voice from 9 to 10 after watching it a second time because I missed some explanatory sequences that I could not put together the first time to give answers. As a warning it will be easy to ignore the story and focus on the graphics, but do not try to judge the Adevent Children. If you do not let the story in, it's no wonder she looks sloppy. <br /> <br /> I will not praise the graphics because we assume that we all know that they are fantastic, which could be an understatement. Especially characters speak with their facial expression so much more than ever before. I hope you pay attention to the story, because it really makes sense and works well with the whole. Get ready for the ride of your life, there are no breaks.
