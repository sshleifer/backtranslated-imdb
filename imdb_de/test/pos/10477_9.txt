This movie is almost unknown, but it is very good. In a lonely Danish town live two old sisters, who remember a distant youth, when they had to reject the luck due to a strict puritanical education. Lonely, then, living with a dignified severity, until Babette, who flies from Paris before the horror of war, comes. In no time, she will be able to apply the kindness and love she received when she arrived. With a good lottery prize she can organize a great banquet according to the best rules of French gastronomy. All quarters are invited (all fanatical Puritans). They accept, but they do, to show no trace of enjoyment or enjoyment, as this would be a sin. The seductive power of the delicious meal they eat, however, seduces the sensuality of French gastronomy. The banquet ends in a very felt, if quiet, happiness. The love between people has awakened. With the miracle of ascension, human kindness has begun because of the lust for meaning. The movie is surprisingly good, but not for every taste. Nothing happens for most of the film, everything is so quiet and so peaceful that for many minutes you can only see the life of the city's inhabitants. But with the development of the film, it becomes more and more valuable when Babette wins the lottery prize (after a 30-minute movie), the show begins. The author can show us with perfect direction how Babette prepares the banquet, how she blends all the ingredients with the most wonderful (love), all in a delicious way, with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting. Then, as the banquet passes by, the quality that shows us how the mood of all eaters changes through food, just with the first shots, with impressively filmed scenes in a row, is simply amazing. In addition, the tact with the colors and photography is also excellent, almost every scene in the film is like a picture, so the work is involved there. If you are able to admire good cinema, and realize that sometimes it is more important to tell you something than what is told, then this is your film. If you like good food and love good food, you'll probably enjoy yourself knowing most of the movie's feelings. An absolutely deserved Oscar. The only problem is its slowness in building the story, but I can forgive it (I hope so, too).
