Very glad to see that this excellent movie is rated so well by the users of IMDB. The best years of her life are still the best cinematic statement about veterans who have returned from the war. Easily the best performance of the often overlooked Frederick March. In fact, the entire cast shines, including music legend Hoagy Carmichael, who treats us all with a subtle version of his classic lazy river. I would recommend this excellent movie to anyone who loves movies.
