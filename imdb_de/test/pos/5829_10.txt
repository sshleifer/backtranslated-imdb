One of the best TV shows, if not the best. Why? Quite simply: It has the courage to show us the real life in prison without clich√©s and predictable twists. This is not a Prison Break or any other show, in comparison to Oz the show Sopranos seems like a story to kids. Obscenities, curses, explicit outbreaks of violence and drug use, disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rape ... all this and much more in Oz. However, this is not the best part of Oz. The characters are the strongest point of the show; They are all excellent and not annoying, even though we consider brutal criminals. The actors are excellent, my favorites are the actors who play Ryan O'Reilly and Tobias Beecher because they are so unique and completely change their behavior. And above all ... they have no remorse for their actions. Overall ... Oz is a great show, the best out there. Forget about CSI and shows about stupid doctors ... that's the deal ... OZ!
