What is there to say about an anti-establishment film produced in a time of colorless emptiness, social indifference and authoritarian contentment? Cassevette's first major independent film was not an instant box office hit and still has not received the critical attention it deserves. I compare this wave of independent American projects, consisting of such beat filmmakers as Robert Frank and Harry Smith, with the burgeoning scene that emerged in Paris in the late 1950s and is known as the French New Wave, discussing poetry, philosophy and vulnerability in one Time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with the rediscovery of American cultural supremacy; Already in this phase, this peculiar, highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political encyclopedias and fanatics that had kept the development of the arts at bay in the mid-twentieth century, portraying man as weak in the face of love because of us as a culture dazzled by our own racial bias and prejudice. The great element of most of Cassevette's works is that his films are almost inverted and minimalist. A mental reaction is triggered by subtle character relationships, not so much by pictures. For this reason, his work appears to be dwelling because he is the most important in pursuing the definition of characters that are less dependent on explicit actions and more on interpretation, in a more intimate way.
