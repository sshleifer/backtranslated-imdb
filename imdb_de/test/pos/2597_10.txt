I can only imagine a movie that could be as good or better than Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck - ALI BABA BUNNY. However, it is irrelevant to decide which is the best. Look at both of you and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I compared that to ALI BABA BUNNY, because both have Daffy in his worst form - greedy, evil and very funny the process. I think I prefer RABBIT SEASONING simply because Bugs is pretty awful - every time Daffy tries a dirty trick to do terrible things right at Daffy. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Daffy Rabbit leaving, going up to Bugs' Hole in the hope that a hunter (of course Elmer) will blow up the rabbit and leave Daffy alone! Not to be outdone, Bugs keeps taking Daffy's tricks and turning them around - and in most cases, it's about Daffy being shot in the face! It's all very, very smart and funny and I do not care how old you are, this cartoon will make you laugh if you're not grumpy. I especially love the great and unexpected ending, but I will not say more, as I do not want to spoil the surprise.
