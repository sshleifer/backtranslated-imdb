What I liked best about this full-length animated film from 1941 is the great feeling it conveys for the early 1940s. It's the songs, the clothes, the cars, the buildings that talked the day, etc. They feel like they've stepped back into the past. <br /> <br /> After reading some of the reviews, I see that this was a tough -luck movie, released a few days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Wow, nobody would be interested in going to a cartoon during these eventful and shocking days, I'm sure. Too bad, because people miss some nice animations, which were really impressed almost 70 years ago. The colors are beautiful, the drawings are good and the story includes as we focus on the mistakes led by "Hoppity" and his beautiful girl "Honey" to make it happy and eternal. It's also about finding a grassy spot to live on and not worrying about people crushing them. <br /> <br /> However, there is one evil villain - "C. Bagley Beetle" - and two of his henchmen. These helpers ("Swat, The Fly" and "Smack, the Mosquito") are comedians with their Brooklyn accents! The story is a familiar one in which a wicked old man wants to marry the sweet, young thing and force her hand with unscrupulous means. The good man has stacked the ceiling against him, but in the end, of course, everything prevails. <br /> <br /> My favorite part - that sounds worse than what he was - was as the good one. "Hoppity" was temporarily electrocuted and he danced in black and white. That was a fantastic animation! <br /> <br /> You know, it's a good thing that I did not see that as a very small child. I would have been scared to play outside and crush all those cute beetles! You never know what (or who) is in the grass under your feet!
