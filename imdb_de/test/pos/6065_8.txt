First of all, I'm an American - I have not seen any comments on this series from a US viewer on this series. Second, I work in the television business in development. So I wallow in the mud of American radio programs. "Unit One" is an example of television, which is a return to what I would call scripting in the style of the 70s. These films were made by young authors who were able to move freely to make the dramas more realistic and to enable organic character development. It moves more towards British British dramas such as "Cracker" and "Prime Suspect" as well as Australia's brilliant "Underbelly". "Unit One" consists of stand-alone cases, which are defined every week and then resolved. The mysteries are not extraordinary or especially Byzantine. They usually center around a single turn and usually clock at the 40-minute mark, and the resolution is neatly packaged in the 15 minutes thereafter. What makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it contains key characters that can addict you in Episode 2. These characters are real, breathing, living characters who have their own personal luggage, but it's not flashy, daring luggage that buys American flotsam such as "Gray's Anatomy" or "Desperate Housewives." These are realistic individuals whose background stories leisurely unfold throughout the series as if they were working with them daily. After the careless decade of "CSI's," "NCIS's" and "Criminal Minds," along with the ensuing spawns, it's refreshing to actually sit down to see friends with whom you want to spend time, as in the case of " Unit One ". "The Quippy banter, the unobtrusive dialogue of wood and the excessive danger these American series that I talked about, that they nag us every week, are absurd with the nuance and the quiet resonance you get with this remarkable Danish series I'm in Episode 7 of Season One, but I've already bought all four seasons and am on long haul trips, if you need explosions and hardened testosterone, along with music from The Who and a fast, neon-lit, nervous Palsy cam If you're an adult starving for subtle, poignant, thoughtful, and sometimes straightforward procedural crime dramas, I urge you to watch this show.
