I had heard of "Gaming" and "Dungeons and Dragons" before, but I knew it could be as I saw it in Gamers: Dorkness Rising. These guys are so funny and fun to watch. Especially the guy who plays the "Bard" or "Minstrel" or whatever has a talent for physical comedy and timing. There are so many background humor and energy in some of the scenes that you really get the impression that at least a part of it has been improvised on the set. The special effects had to be worked a bit, but I saw it last year at a convention.
