All you need is a great house, a babysitter and a telephone. Simon West is directing this exciting and frightening remake of the 1979 original. This version is more of a thriller than a horror movie. Emotionally tense with an escalating anxiety factor. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) has to deal with an excessive mobile bill; She takes over the task, the two children of Dr. med. and Mrs. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant) to babysit. The house is a beautiful masterpiece from the 1970s. Secluded and peaceful. The children are already in bed, the wind blows and is accompanied by falling rain. The phone starts ringing, ringing and ringing. The babysitter soon finds himself in a frantic way of survival for fear of the scary stranger on the other end of the phone. Belle is great as an innocent, intelligent and strong babysitter. The stranger's voice on the phone is that of Lance Henriksen, while the physically unknown is played by Tommy Flanagan. You can also see Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Kudos to James Dooley for the atmospheric original music.
