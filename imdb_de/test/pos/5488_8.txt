Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action suspense movie. I'm not a special fan of him, but I have to shake his hand: he can make entertaining films. This is another example. It did not hurt to have John Malkovich as his co-star. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is fascinating to see, thanks to his various disguises and the great dialogue he has given. He also has an interesting voice. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is quite reserved (for her), but that's fine and Eastwood plays the usual role as a solitary cop. I think he could not stop playing the Dirty Harry characters, but he played them well. <br /> <br /> However, there were some negatives in this film, namely: Partial credibility, as there was a couple If this had been true, the killer would have abolished Eastwood. Especially the climate scene had too many holes. There were too many abuses of the name of the Lord here. Overall, though, this is good and escapitc.
