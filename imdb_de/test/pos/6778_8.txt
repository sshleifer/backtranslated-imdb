De Gr√∏nne slagtere or The Green Butchers, as it's called in English, is a very dark comedy about two losers who work for a popular butcher. They are fed up with the criticism of their bosses and decide to start their own business. Their store is expensive and there is not even electricity everywhere. And worse, they have no customers (as their former boss predicted). When the man visits her in her store, he asks her to provide the meat for a dinner party organized by him. <br /> <br /> Then a tragic accident happens. One of the butchers locks the electrician in the freezer as he closes the shop. The man dies and the neurotic, one of the two butchers, decides to cut fillets off the electrician's thigh and serves the dinner party instead of calling the police. It is an incredible success. Suddenly everyone in the village wants to try this incredible "chicken". Overwhelmed by his sudden success, the butcher sees no other option than to kill more people he can sell as a chicken. <br /> <br /> I guess cannibalism does not appeal to everyone, especially not because it's shown with a lot of humor. I personally liked it very much. It perfectly shows to what extent some people seek social acceptance and come out of their isolation. It may sound a bit far-fetched, but I'm sure you'd be surprised how people sometimes behave in real life. <br /> <br /> In addition to the original theme, I was also very happy with the actors. Performances and the humor. There is no exaggeration, as one might expect from this kind of films, it is all very sober and realistic (I think that's typical of the Scandinavian and Scandinavian films). The same goes for the humor. I'm sure I would not have liked it as much as now, if the humor had been exaggerated, or with a lot of farting, vomiting ... as so often happens in American movies. I loved this movie and give it 8/10.
