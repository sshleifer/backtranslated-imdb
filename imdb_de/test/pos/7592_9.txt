Although it is nothing more than a pleasant 11-minute musical diversion (this is rightly referred to as a "tabloid musical"), EVERY Sunday is one of the most famous and valuable documents in film history as it offers an invaluable look at the nascent talents of two of them offers the most talented and popular musical performers on the screen: Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. <br /> <br /> Although often referred to as a screen test produced by MGM to test the youthful appeal of studio contractors Durbin and Garland, whose options were available to support this allegedly renewal claim is not quite right. When EVERY Sunday was produced in July 1936, Deanna Durbin's contract with MGM had already expired, and it had been signed by Universal just a month ago, in June 1936. <br /> <br /> However, a provision in Durbin The MGM contract allowed the studio to offer up to sixty days an option on their services, provided they had not started working on a picture in their new studio yet. Since Durbin's debut vehicle THREE SMART GIRLS was not yet ready to start filming, MGM opted to pursue its option, and although Durbin was formally under contract with Universal at the time, Durbin found himself back on the MGM lot to film this pleasant short theme with Judy Garland, a hopeful singing mate. <br /> <br /> This, together with Garland's much earlier professional performance experience / training (which included appearances in several previous short films) may explain why EVERY Sunday often seems to favor Judy Garland over Deanna Durbin, Garland gives more lines to talk and an original song ("Americana") to sing, while Durbin offers the popular classic art song "Il Bacio" by Luigi Ardiiti. Certainly, it would make sense that MGM would prefer one of its own contract players to another from a rival studio. Ironically, although Garland's character is the more offensive proactive Two Girls in this short film, it would be Durbin's vivacious and impulsive "Little Miss Fixit" character at Universal, calling her the world's first "teen idol" with her debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, and Making Garland's a Superstar Worldwide A more passive "wistful wallflower" idomancy would normally see her in supporting roles opposite frequent screen partner Mickey Rooney and rising star Lana Turner (in ZIEGFELD GIRL). Not until her fifteenth MGM feature film, 1942 'FOR ME AND MY GAL' (which was her first full adult role), would Garland gain solo status over the title of "payroll" and "solo attraction" of a true superstar Immediately six years earlier. <br /> <br /> It is therefore completely inaccurate to suggest that Garland is the only "superstar" attraction of the two girls, given that Durbin's status in the press was nearly ten years Literally in the foreclosure at the time of their signing, the evidence on the screen strongly suggests that Universal Deanna's full superstar potential recognized much faster than MGM's with Judy, and it's worth noting that nearly every notable achievement Garland scored at MGM, which was achieved by the superstar bill Deanna Durbin received specially written for their talents and their enthusiasm vehicles, which were asked, their Fu√üabd Graumann's Chinese Theater on the forecourt to receive an "Honorary Oscar" for her talent before giving her gift MGM Contemporary. <br /> <br /> Every Sunday EVERY Sunday is a delightful, totally unpretentious musical short: its storyline (Durbin and Garland use their vocal talents to rescue Durbin's grandfather from the compulsion the city council has forcibly taken out of retirement Conducting his Sunday concerts in the park), he announces the plot of Garland's "Let's Put On a Show" musicals with Mickey Rooney and Durbins 100 MEN AN D A Girl. In contrast to Garland's later BABES films, the short film never seriously deals with the nonessential plot, and therefore its eleven-minute playing time goes by. <br /> <br /> The true magic of EVERY Sunday, of course, is to watch the already remarkable talents / screen presence of Durbin and Garland at the start of their legendary career. Both girls already had remarkable screen presence at this early stage and are completely natural and untouched in their presentation as a singer and actress. Garland explodes briskly in front of the screen as she literally ejects the lyrical lyrics "Americana". As she sings the number with suitable hand gestures, Judy literally chews the words of the song as she contracts her mouth and pulls out her eyes in her intense zeal to show what she can do. <br /> <In contrast, Durbin's presentation of "Il Bacio" is much more restrained and restrained. Although she is well suited to her "classic" selection, Durbin's Arditi Waltz is much more of the traditional "stand 'n sing" variety than Garland's physical-emotional turn. Although "miniature diva" Deanna does not draw attention to herself, with her open eyes, her dazzling smile and her ineligible delivery she easily holds the screen with "jazz baby" Judy and her adorable duo "Americana" in shorts. The final regrets All the more so as producer Joe Pasternak never realized his dream of Durbin and Garland in a feature film (because Universal declined to lend "Number One Asset" Durbin). <br /> <br /> An invaluable document about the emerging talents of two remarkable and absolutely unique talents. See this if you have a chance!
