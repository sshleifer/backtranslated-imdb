I really enjoyed watching Squire Trelane join the crew in this episode, though it just seemed too long after a while. Sure, the histrionics were kinda funny for a while and the end was a pretty good way to put it together. I think the problem was that I enjoyed seeing Trelane when he was full of bravado and fun. The fun seemed to vanish as Trelane became vengeful and angry. Talk about a mood killer - from a disgusting but friendly host to a guy who condemns Kirk to death! Nevertheless, the episode was enjoyable and worth my time. For diehard trekkies this is a must, for others it is just a nice run of the mill.
