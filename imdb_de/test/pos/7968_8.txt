If you watch this movie "A Cannon for Cordoba", you feel like it's going to be great. The reason? The film opens with a stirring score by the famous composer Elmer Bernstein, who gave us memorable themes such as "The Great Flight and the Great Seven". In fact, if you read the opening credits in which the cast plays the main role, it's George Peppard as Captain Rod Douglas, you know there'll be action and a lot of it. If you watch actor John Russell play General John J. Pershing, you know you expect a heroic saga. The story stems from the annals of the Mexican Revolution and involves the US in a border dispute with the Mexican bandits who crossed the Rio Grande in the early 1900s. Among the brazen leaders of the rebels is General Cordova (Raf Vallone). With his army of Mexican revolutionaries, he attacks Pershing, killing his men and stealing valuable artillery pieces. Since the US Army can not legally enter Mexico, Captain Douglas is promoted to suicide mission, without orders and without the help of Pershing. His mission is to procure the cannons, destroy a rebel fortress and bring Cordova to life. Douglas selects the roughest, hardest, most experienced and certainly the most outrageous men who come to Mexico, and attacks the almost impregnable fortress. This is followed by a dramatic action and a lot of explosive excitement. If you ask for criticism, I would say the choice of heavyweights. Vallone and John Larch are not very threatening. Not so with the men who team up with Peppard. Pete Duel and Don Gordon (Who is Superb.) Nevertheless, this movie is recommended as a good ad. ****
