As a quadriplegic, he relies on the friendliness of strangers for everything. Since his accident Ramon thinks only one more thing: How does he end his life! This is the moral theme at the heart of the story, based on the life of the real Ramon Sampedro. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar tells the story from Ramon's point of view. Nothing is wrong or manipulative here. Finally, he relies on facts that were well known in his country, as this case became a "celebration" of euthanasia, a topic that no one in this country wanted to engage in Spain. <br /> <br /> Spain is predominantly a Roman Catholic country and has become one of the most democratic societies in Europe. A distinction that is characterized above all by its long, dominated by a dictator years. Despite the progress in this society, the idea of ​​taking one's life is not clearly understood by the majority of citizens, who still regard this issue as something that is not possible in their country. <Br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro was a man who loved life. As a young man, he lived an intense life when he discovered the world as a sailor. Since he had no money, this was the only way for him to see other countries, to experience other cultures. Ramon's love of the sea is something that people in Galicia learn to love from childhood. Imagine that the same friendly sea takes away Ramon's life, as he knew it! In a second, Ramon goes from a lively young man to a vegetable! <br /> <br /> Ramon's family is shaken by this experience. Suddenly they have to leave everything aside to look after him at home. His brother and sister-in-law are Stoic people who are actually dealing with the situation. Her life becomes thought-provoking, because Ramon's life comes first. They take care of the sick without protesting or blaming Ramon for the sacrifices they have to make to keep him alive. That's why the sampedros in their thoughts can not understand Ramon's desire to finish it all. Did not you give up having a normal life to take care of him? This moral issue weighs heavily on this simple and simple man, because they do in their minds what happened naturally. The second theme of the film is the legal issue of euthanasia and well-intentioned people. You suddenly enter Ramon's life to help him put an end to his suffering. There is Julia, the lawyer who is disabled and has a rare illness.

Mr. Bardem makes this man real. This may be Javier Bardem's best role in his career. He excels his own award-winning performance as Reynaldo Arenas, the late Cuban poet he portrayed in "Before Night Falls." <br /> <br /> In the supporting roles, Belen Rueda makes an impressive appearance as Julia, the woman who fights against her own physical problems. Lola Duenas is also effective as Rosa, the kindred soul that deeply loves Ramon. Celso Bugallo, as Ramon's brother shows a man at the crossroads of his own life. Mabel Rivera makes a merciful Manuela, the sister-in-law, who never demands anything from life, but declines to Ramon, without asking why she has to do it at all.
