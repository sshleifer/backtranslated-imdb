Sandra Bullock paints a believable image as a troubled detective, even though she sees her as a cynical, consuming victim and persecutor, requires an advance of trust (or two). The two creepy, restless children are presented appropriately by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of trouble putting Ben Chaplin in the equation (the same problem occurred as "The Truth About Cats & Dogs" (http://www.imdb.com/title/) I mean, if you put an Englishman in a purely American movie, should not there be at least one reason to put him there? Should not there be a story that leads to the fact that an Englishman serves as a detective? with an American police, should not there be a dialogue that highlights and explains this fairly obvious fact, or even some jokes that he's English? <br /> <br /> He looks out of place here in The Truth about cats and dogs "he was inappropriate, the producers should really notice it, it distracts and bothers the audience (at least me), nothing is wrong with Chaplin's acting, it's all about making an actor that is." inappropriate 'credible and worthy Do not take him somewhere without a good reason or storyline. <br /> <br /> The movie itself: Well, thrillers, especially those who do it To solve a complicated crime, you must expose the unbelief. This is not different. Actually, it takes a bit more effort than usual. To make Bullock smart enough to solve the case despite all the pressure that forced her to let go of the case, some unrealistic assumptions are made about the evidence, and I am sure that many of the people watching him have a few moments "Come on, this is highly unlikely under the circumstances" or even "Hey, you can not put proofs aside to finish this movie!". <br /> <br /> As I said before, it's entertaining and observable. Do not use this as a required ad for detective investigations. There are no links.
