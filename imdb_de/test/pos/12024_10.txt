Dan Finnerty and the Dan band are so good, they have to be seen to be believed. Does anyone have a copy of the Bravo concert out there for sale? Please inform us all if there is a publication. I checked the Bravo site, but it's not a future date for a repeat of the most attractive guys ever choreographed, the Dan band. What kind of energy do they emit, they deal with a cute attitude of American boys, based on Butch sensitivity, wrapped in sequins and tears, making men and women fall in love with them. I hope enough people can influence Bravo's powers to bring the show back into our lives as a semi-annual special.
