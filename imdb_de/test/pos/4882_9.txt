Finally!!! A good movie made with the most demeaned serial killer in history. For those less familiar with Ed Gein, he was basically the madman who was known to have robbed and skinned his victims (which most horror fans broke off). The film was shot in an epochal style that perfectly reflects the gloomy levels of Wisconsin. This is by far the most atmospheric horror film that shows Gein and his cruel murders. Kane Hodder (Jason of Friday's 13th series) and Michael Berryman (Hills's Eyes I & II) deliver frightening performances in this serial killeropus, easily leaving behind the lackluster past Gein attempts. So far I would say that this is one of the better horror movies released this year (Turistas = 0).
