I was first introduced to this movie in San Antonio, Tx. This movie was the second one. in a double feature. Unfortunately, the theater in which I saw this was demolished. Five Fingers of Death (aka King Boxer) was released in 1972 and launched in the US the following year. Like many "other" kung fu films released on Enter the Dragon's "Tail Tails," this movie was actually pretty good. It is the story of a country boy sent to a martial arts institute to improve himself and his martial arts. In the meantime, the "adversary" is planning the martial arts school and plans to thwart our hero by using dirty tactics to throw him off the track and keep him from participating in the tournament. Surprised, I thought, since Warner Bros. distributed this movie in the US, Warner Bros. will release a DVD. It never happened. As far as I know, this movie was released both in English and in Cantonise, with subtitles ..... the latter is a "cleaner and clearer" version. The combat sequences are a bit funny (eg, flying in the air, bouncing on buildings, a fighter uses his head ... literally ... to hit his opponent, etc.), but it's still classic Kung -Fu action wonderfully planned and executed. If you like "Enter the Dragon", "Five Fingers of Death" would be a great addition to any movie collection ... if you can find it.
