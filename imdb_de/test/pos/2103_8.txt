With the remake of ADV Films, I had the opportunity to see "The Giant Majin" for the first time without the deep cuts and unfriendly words of a horror chiller theater. Guess what? It's a damn good movie! <br /> <br /> The sets are authentic, the acting is muted and believable, and the giant Majin is handsome, powerful and unstoppable. I loved the subtle fantasy accents (the enchanted wood, the good luck charms etc) and the potrayal of God as something less than "good". <br /> <br /> This movie asks for a remake in the New Century!
