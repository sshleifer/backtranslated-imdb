It's fun to watch a young James Cagney doing his thing. He plays the cheap skater, who takes his job very seriously and tiptoes a bunch of crooked politicians. He is offered to the world but retains his integrity. He is beaten and hired, but that's the problem. We never know if he really is in danger. They say he is in a position, but still seems to have room to move and do what he needs to do. Sometimes he is so intrepid that he does not do much to protect himself. His allies are in the police department, but everything else is pretty corrupt. Of course he insists (almost too good to be true) and we move for him. The problem for me is the lack of sustained tension. It would have been much better if he had cleared his name. He never falls into the depths, even if he is rejected by his wife. It's still fun with the bad guys who implode. Just see it to watch Cagney posing his hard guy.
