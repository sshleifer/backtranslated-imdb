Over the years, some of the most beautiful movies about dysfunctional families have been. Bonjour, Monsieur Sholmi is such a movie. This is an Isreali movie about a Jewish family in Morocco. <br /> <br /> It could be about every family and every culture. We all know or want to meet people like this in this comic book gem. <br /> <br /> This 2003 Joy was written and directed by Shemi Zorkin. Let's hope he has a long career. <br /> <br /> The film is seen through the eyes of the 16-year-old son, who seems to care for everyone in the family. Heis played brilliantly by Oshri Cohen (he was 18 when he made the film.) <br /> <br /> He's been around for a couple of years and I know I'll find her. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is great, I hope I see it again. <br /> <br /> I loved every person in the cast to a degree. <br /> <br /> It has been nominated for many international awards and has won 8. It's earned everyone. <br /> <br /> Since it's a movie in a language other than English, it had a very limited US pass, which I find regrettable. <br /> < br /> Borrow this movie, you'll be glad that you did. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (from 10) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Since the story is not new, this is such a high rating that it can receive.
