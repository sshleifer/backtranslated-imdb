I have seen this in a preview and does not seem to have been released in the US. Still, it was one of the more pleasurable little comedies. It is the rivalry of two funeral directors in a British town. The plot of the movie will be slightly out of control in the third act, but the characters are very pleasant and memorable. <br /> <br /> Acting is great across the board. Surely to be overlooked in the crisis of blockbuster, this is a movie that is worth to look. I know, I will try to catch this in the cinemas again and / or buy the video.
