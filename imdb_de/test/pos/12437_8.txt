A limping error in the Ministry of Education has led to the Nutbourne Boys School having to be shared with St. Swithin's School For Girls. This confuses the headmaster of each school and leads to all sorts of chaotic events, but the two are forced to come to an uncomfortable alliance in the hope of avoiding greater difficulties. The happiest days of Your Life are based on the 1948 John Dighton play, with Dighton writing the role of Headmaster Whitchurch specifically for Margaret Rutherford. Alastair Sim replaces George Howe from the game in the role of Headmaster Pond. This is the culmination of this filmic adaptation. Sim & Rutherford are absolutely wonderful and bounce off each other to basically make a joke movie. very entertaining. Directed by talented Frank Launder and equally talented Sidney Gilliat, The Happiest Days Of Your Life is a typically British film, evidently a forerunner of the St. Trinians franchise, and the film entertains the children with their sibling high-hearted, while the tickling watching adults with their very naughty undercurrent. Fortunately, the chaotic ending cemented everything that has left this viewer with as big a grin as Nutbourne Rail Station - great fun of 8/10.
