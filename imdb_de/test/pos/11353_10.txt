I was recommended this movie as one of the best love stories ever told. And since I'm a big fan of love, I bought the tickets and put myself in the theater. After 90 minutes, I left the theater with disappointment and the theme song as the only positive element of the film. I was appalled by the story itself that two people can love each other but are afraid to never play them. I simply could not overcome the language barrier and the cultural barrier. The second time I came across it ... I was in a different mood, had no more expectations ... and had more patience, more relaxation to "see" the movie ... and as soon as I opened my eyes I discovered the love ... the beauty of the movie. I went beyond the language and the love story and saw the acting (not even for a moment did I feel like they were acting!) And the cinematography. When I first heard a definition of a movie, I was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photos (shots). This is the movie that matches the description. Almost every recording has an idea and combined with the music ... and the light effects ... the result is just a masterpiece! And a masterpiece is just something you need to have in your movie collection.
