Most other responses from subscribers to this service were very apt, though some found it slow or ambiguous. Instead of being ambiguous, it was complex and multi-layered in meaning. It can be considered as a war against the war, because of the initial and final scenes and the folly of pretended grandeur, how wonderful the cavalrymen looked as they prepared for the great load in Eylau, as opposed to their so terrible and disturbing conclusion seeing the bloody uniforms, the boyish dead, etc. - but mostly I see the movie as a moral man in an immoral society. In the end, Chabert chooses to retire from the corrupt post-Napoleonic French world and opts for the simple pleasures that Derville offers (saved even by his recognition of Chabert's basic decency and morals of his renunciation choices) - white bread, cheese, some wine and tobacco - over the wealth he leaves the shame to his wife and her and their society. In her case, we can also see the film as a feminist in the then position of women, in which Mme Chabert is endowed only with her charm, her beauty, her cunning and ultimately with money.
