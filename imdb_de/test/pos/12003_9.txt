Columbo is a visiting lecturer for a criminology class. The students invite him to a meeting after class. They pass through the nearby parking garage and discover their regular teacher next to his car, who died of a gunshot wound. (No, Columbo was not after the man's job.) As a lesson project, Columbo gets the students into his mess. Two students who were tentatively identified as guilty by the viewer were the class in the lecture hall. In addition, parking garage surveillance cameras show that no one else but the professor has entered or left after being unexpectedly abandoned by the evil (?) Duo, eager for progress reports and an ear to their theories. Forensic evidence is almost nonexistent. The solution of the case depends on a possible and interesting luck. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it seemed as if Columbo had devoured the misleading of the perpetrators; However, upon repeated consideration, small details showed that this was not the case at all. <br /> <br /> This reviewer has not had enough of "Columbo Goes to College" yet.
