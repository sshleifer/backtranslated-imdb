My impression, when I saw this documentary, was that Nathaniel Kahn had more questions than before, before he made the film. <br /> <br /> It took him five years to do it, a job of love and longing. I can only imagine the turbulence of the editing process, what's left over, what's to be taken out. <br /> <br /> His father, the famous architect Louis Kahn, seems too selfish and selfish to be emotionally accessible not just to a woman, not just three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were fascinated by seclusion and creativity. <br /> <br /> One of his lovers said he was "accessible", but that's never been researched. Other comments from people who knew him well suffer the same fate. A shame. <br /> <br /> The tension between the three half-siblings in the room of a house designed by Louis is also noticeable. The unsaid floats above the conversation. The only traces left by his father were some great in the buildings he left behind, some not so great. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the music ship and the Salk Institute. Saddened by the baby mothers who were caught forever by his callous impregnations, this was never more than what he told the director's mother when he learned of her pregnancy - "not again!" <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, beautifully filmed, real. <br /> <br /> In this case, the son does not seem to be the man's father.
