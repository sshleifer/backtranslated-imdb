This is the forty-minute film that introduces us to the role of the butcher who will later be explored in the feature film "Seul Contre Tous". In this film he follows his early life from 1965 to 1979, but focuses on the late seventies. The first pictures show a slaughter of a horse, then the birth of a baby, the butcher's daughter, whom we see growing up each year. The Butcher (played by Philippe Nahon in both films) is a cosmopolitan man. He hates many things. His anger comes to a head as a man attacks his autistic daughter. The butcher then mutilates the wrong man and is in jail. This film follows the butcher's life until shortly after his release from prison, then Seul takes over Tire from there. I saw the movies wrong, first Seul Contre Tous. Try this little movie first if you can.
