Critics and audiences have messed up this movie pretty well, but I did not think it was that bad! Even the critics I usually agree with thought it was crap, and I usually hate PG-13 as "horror movies." So that means one of two things: either (1) I'm overly pleased and my taste in movies has declined over the years or (2) "When a Stranger Calls" is not nearly as horrible as it looks. Well, to be honest, some of the criticisms of the movie are true - there is not much character development and in the story, not much happens. But living people, how much did you expect from a movie about a babysitter being persecuted? Cut them a little loose! As a former babysitter watching this movie late at night with the lights off, I can safely say that the stalker guy was an eerie mofo! Who knows? I think such things only the Willies give me. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit, I enjoyed watching it, and I do not care how big a minority is that puts me in the ring .;)
