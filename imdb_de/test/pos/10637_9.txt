I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival 2001. La Pianiste affirms the thesis "Austrian = grim", which I formulate. Isabelle Huppert was honored with the deserved prize for best actress in Cannes for her portrayal of a woman who loses her humanity in her efforts to realize the artistic ideal. Trapped by her talent, she suppresses her emotions and sexuality until she can only be expressed in a twisted and frightening way. When a younger student falls in love with them, our hopes rise, but are soon destroyed by the realization that they can not experience love as others can. It's too late for her, and amazingly, the last thirty shattering minutes of the movie are without the beautiful music that wore the first 90 minutes. The message seems to be that even without the life and beauty it describes, the music is not enough.
