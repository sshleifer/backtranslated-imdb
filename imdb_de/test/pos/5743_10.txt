Forget Samara / Sadako and Jason ... Horror has a new name: GRANNY. The plot is simple but efficient. The actors are good (two thumbs up for "Michelle" and the killer) and the dialogues are actually pretty smart. From start to finish, the action will make you breathless, you just can not escape ... There's blood, terrible murders, funny moments and a sense of perversity that goes far beyond any rule. "Déjà-vu"? Certainly NOT: "Granny" is not another slash movie, it's truly a classic in itself ... It deserves the success it had, and there's even more success with its re-release. Congratulation!
