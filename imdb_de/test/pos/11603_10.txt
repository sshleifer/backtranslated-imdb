What do you do if you're Aishwarya Rai, who's from a blockbuster movie like Devdas, with some skeptical critics who are still relentlessly dissatisfied with your amazing performance or who are convinced of your strong on-screen presence and outstanding acting. Go home, sit down and sulk? No. If you are Aishwarya Rai, sign up for the next strong period score that turns out, and continue to be worthy of all the praise, praise, great screenplays and equally great roles. And that is exactly what she has done with and in "Chokher Bali - a Passion Play" in which she plays and shines as Binodini, a young widow who causes controversy well before her time. Directed by Rituparno Ghosh {who later directs her into the equally excellent 'Raincoat'} Prasenjit Chatterjee {Devdas in Bengali}.
