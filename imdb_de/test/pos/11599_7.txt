I saw this film at the Locarno Film Festival in Italian-speaking Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai looks good. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 7/10 because of its beautiful moments. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Ahead * <br /> <br /> It has some really nice cinematic moments, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> Although my general feeling is this too long (over 2 hours and 40 minutes) and contains too many dialogues. And almost no dance. <br /> <br /> A Bollywood movie like Lagaan or Devdas is clearly a different movie than Chokher Bali.
