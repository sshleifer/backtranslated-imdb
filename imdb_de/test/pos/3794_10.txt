The few reviews I found online about Barnens really do not do it justice. I read them all before I ordered the DVD, but for some reason I ordered them anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already passed, so I could not break it off. I am very happy now that I could not. It's an extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> I will not give a summary of the story as other reviewers have already done so. But I'll say I do not understand comments that are bleak, shocking, funny, clinical, depressing or pornographic. It's certainly very unusual, which I suspect may seem odd to some people, but the other points of criticism must reflect the reviewer's own problems because I have not seen any of it in the movie I just saw. I do not feel attracted to boys, so nudity did not seem to be pornographic at all - it's just a kid trying to figure out who he is without help from the irresponsible adults in his life. And it's Sweden, not Utah, so topless women are not a big deal. <br /> <br /> But most of all I was surprised at how positive the movie is in the portrayal of this brave lost child undergoing a sort of Odyssey undergoing all sorts of strange experiences, finding and ultimately finding oneself. It is fascinating, through and through original and deeply satisfying. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that Barnens รถ won three big Guldbagge awards for the best movie, director and best actor, but I'm absolutely amazed The actor who won was not Tomas Fryk , the boy whose fearless performance as a pure should be one of the most notable ever made, but Ingvar Hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of Stig, pure murderer friend of Rein's mother. I do not understand that at all, but it does not change the fact that this is a great movie.
