In a land where the king does not like anyone and no one, like the king, likes a shepherdess and a chimney sweep from two nearby paintings, they come to life. A portrait of the king who loves the shepherdess kills the real king and takes his place. A giant bird, the miracle bird of the title, acts like a hero and helps our two lovers. <br /> <br /> This is a strange, strange movie ... not a surreal, very, very surreal. <Br /> <br /> The background style is very European, while the characters are Fliescher and Warner, but early Arty Warner is the non-main character. They move in both realistic and cartoon-like ways. <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie and it takes a bit to get in, but Peter Ustinov is a bird, the bird is a riot. There are police officers in rubber ducks and a bear design that makes you smile. <br /> <br /> And there is a deep philosophy in the film about the existence of a world out there ... outside of a metropolis metropolis. <br /> <br /> This is a really nice movie. It's something so strange and unique that it rewards you if you stick to it all the way. It's not perfect, but what the hell? <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can find. If your local bargain DVD store has the Capcom version (paired with Alice in Paris), buy it. It should run under $ 10, probably at five, and the price is well worth it, especially if you find it comes with two full cartoons, two short cartoons, and some pretty commercials and other fun stuff.
