Before you watch this movie - clean your ears, remove the make-up from your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. She does not have to. This picture gives you enough warmth to sustain your relationship for a lifetime. If you are Jewish / Russian / Ukrainian / immigrant - yes, what is the popular minority movie altogether -, laugh in your memories. If you are something else or whatever you are, laugh for the bittersweet memory of the meaning of friendship and family. Nothing will seem strange in this movie, though it may seem strange. However, I am afraid that few will see this movie because it is not the kind of pictures people see when they go to the movies. But please, do it for humanity and do not forget to get the soundtrack, for pleasure.
