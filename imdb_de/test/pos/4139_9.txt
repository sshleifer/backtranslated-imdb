What a great movie! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but I knew his lively and funny music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950s. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I do not know how accurate the movie is, but I'm assuming, at least for the most part, that the movie gets more interesting. The music throughout the film adds only pizazz to this biography. I do not think I would change anything in this movie, it was all good! What a difference in the stars from the 50s to today's music stars. How do you compare someone like Buddy Holly with Justin Timberlake? or one of the other popular singers of this generation?
