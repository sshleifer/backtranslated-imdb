I hate movies about sports. I think the pre-made Hollywood sports movie is a little hard to swallow for me because it follows the same ideas every year. I'm trying to say that there's not much creativity in this genre. Use exhibition "A" ?? "The Schedule" as proof if you want. Needless to say, I was reluctant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme, but at the same time I could not wait, because I love to watch documentaries like Step into Liquid and Billabong Odyssey. I took a step, I plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at first I was not happy. I did not like the direction, the people or the style of the film to present these young sports entrepreneurs. On my first visit, I thought the story could not be fully recorded, so I thought that Stacy Peralta filmed footage with faux-like actors from the late '70s. The music was intense and it went well together. Peralta had made a mixed tape of this generation to our delight, but the visuals were far from stimulating. The elongated scenes, while using amazing music in support, only seemed red and too long for my attention. I wanted to get to know the pioneers and not just skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted to make a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their ascension, and where they are now. It felt like watching the birth of our nation with a great score for the settlers rowing their boats all day. I wanted to meet the men behind the myths. <br /> <br /> Then, thinking that I would have another negative review under my belt, I re-watched the movie with Peralta's audio commentary. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to make this movie "wow-ed". This suddenly turned into the movie that I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know where these children are today, what they are still doing and how difficult it has been to get some of them into the camera. He had not seen many of them in over 20 years. When he heard these challenges, he brought the human element back to the surface. He was sincere. He was sympathetic, but he showed so much commitment to this project. While I disagree with everything he has chosen (ie H., The Sean Penn Chaos is not a PUNK ROCK), he has revitalized this film for me. Because of this comment I rate this movie much higher than originally thought. <br /> <br /> Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the names that must be mentioned and praised over and over again if skateboarding is to continue the rapidly growing trend it currently sees. While Tony Hawk sells products under his name, it's these guys, those meek pavters, that redefine a whole sport. Sure, others probably did it back in the Stone Age, but these guys did it with style and grace, taking it to the next level. This was a hobby for them, but it also took them in a direction that I believe none of them was willing to do. "Dogtown and Z-Boys" is the evolutionary story of being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation where there is no TV that keeps us neat, and friendship. We've seen so many stories over the years that show the progress of humanity, and this is definitely a story to be added. I can not say I loved this movie or not, but it should be the standard for anyone who wants to learn or want to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. It was sad, it was emotional and these guys are not multi-millionaires again? They are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not watch this movie anymore, but I will always recommend it to friends and family members. I think that the downfall for this movie was the shooting for me? the attempts to be the avant-garde with the style that ultimately distanced itself from the characters and events. As mentioned before, there were some elements that stretched too far, leaving us too little time to know where these guys are now. Peralta obviously had a passion for the sport, for the people, but at times he seemed out of focus. The music was intense and worked perfectly with the movie. Sean Penn, though decent with his voice, was not necessary at all. They could have spent the money elsewhere. On the positive side, the audio commentary captures everything the regular movie was missing. Peralta's voice instead of Penn's brings a stronger human element to the scene as he tells us better stories of people, places, and events. Watch this movie, but do not expect to fly away. Listen to the audio commentary. I think you will be impressed. <br /> <br /> Note: *** Â½ of *****
