This has always been a favorite movie of mine. I have a VHS copy and a few months ago I found a DVD release that is also part of my video collection. I also happened to be a big baseball fan. As part of my off-season reading, I took a copy of Robert Whiting's outstanding book "You Gotta Have WA," which describes the peculiarities of Japanese baseball and the challenges that foreign players have played in Japan. When I started reading yesterday, I had to think about this movie because the script seems to be almost literally based on this book. The parallels are scary. The character of Jack Elliot resembles Bob Horner, an aging MLB bat whose best days lay behind him. Horner's team-mate Leon Lee is also in the character Max "Hammer" Dubois, a veteran in the Japanese league, who has found peace with the frustrations of the Japanese game and helps keep his teammates healthy. The Elliot character goes through the same sequence of encounters as Horner, from big fanfare signatures, early success that already fuels the coveted sports media, and the ensuing slump, the frustration, alienation of teammates, fans and media, and the resulting disillusionment triggers the desire to return home to the US. The only difference is that the film adds such Hollywood accents as love interest and happy ending. <br /> <br /> Speaking of love interests, I'm sure many viewers (like me) came to this site to see the actress playing "Hiroko" (the beautiful Aya Takanashi) and what for another work she has done It only lists this movie. Based on an article I've read, it turns out that the short love scene she has with Tom Selleck (a foreigner) in this movie (according to our standards mild - they usually kiss each other while he is in the bathtub and wears a towel), an indignation on the part of the Japanese public (especially men) that she has never been offered a different role in movies or on television - essentially played black by the Japanese film industry. It's a pity, because she's a pretty talented actress in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like the movie for the baseball elements and cultural differences as much as I do, then choose an edition of "You Gotta Have WA" by Robert Whiting. A good read and a great companion book to this film.
