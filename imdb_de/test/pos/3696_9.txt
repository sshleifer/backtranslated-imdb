Jenny Lewis plays a clumsy girl named Jade. She smokes and drinks. She does not have many friends and she has a distressing mother (Beverly D'Angelo). Jade approaches her boyfriend Billy (Rob Estes), maybe she'll dress him. Of course, I do not have to tell you what happens afterwards. <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best drama I've seen in TV movies. Beverly D'Angelo does a really good job as a sweet and loving, but careless and blind mother. She could not see what was going on under her own roof. Rob Estes is best here as Sleazeball. Jenny Lewis is the challenger. She seems to be exactly like her character. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to love this movie!
