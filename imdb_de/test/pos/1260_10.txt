What a movie. Maybe the best I've ever seen, the direction, the production, the score and the cinematography, absolutely wonderful. The spectacle is also outstanding and the Man / Robot scenes have to be seen to be believed. I can not recommend this movie enough. Put it on video now, turn off the light and enjoy it.
