Ignore the comment in front of me. The show is weird, the most underrated show ever. 3 reasons why. Reason 1, the flashbacks are hilarious. Who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story? They make me laugh so much that it hurts. Is not that the idea of ​​a good comedy program? People who do not think it funny have no sense of humor. Who cares if they happen to be, it's a t.v. Show that you can do whatever you want and people say it's not realistic, and a cartoon is not animated. Reason 2, The jokes are generally just funny, Seth McFarlane and the other authors are sooooooooooooo weird, everything from the Star Wars credentials to the fun of celebrities, I love them all. And Reason 3, the stories are just awesome and funny, they're all jokes with their crazy character and their craziness, just so much funnier. <br /> <br /> I have this late on BBC2 and I have never returned, I have all seven seasons and the type of film (Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story), I have several shirts, posters and my collection keeps growing. I've never had a collection of TV shows, but it was so funny that I just had to get everything. <br /> <br /> Just look at the third season and trust me that you'll be thrilled for life, the funniest show ever created, and I hope it never ends!
