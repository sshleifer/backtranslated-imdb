I was quite impressed with Martha's story and how she influenced the emotional hearts of the audience and how she must have influenced the family. The forward-backward movement of the plot was well done, and usually I do not enjoy movies with flash back / flash forward effects. Throughout the film's development, I felt that "Tommy certainly did it". It leaves a sense of how these people have lived their lives almost completely free of each other, and the consequences that you do not feel like answering the question, "It's 10 am Do you know where your children are?" And besides, "What the hell are you doing?" Or "Does it interest me?" Rich, rotten brats literally get away with murder. Or so they thought .......
