I firmly believe that a movie, television series or any other form of art should be fully appreciated as soon as the time factor - when written, produced or conceived - is taken into account. <br /> <br /> Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is one such series. I remember watching it on TV in the mid-'80s and doing the reruns on the videocassette libraries in the early '90s. and laugh out loud and be addicted to it. So I bought the complete DVD set and surprised surprises - the comedy and the moments of the good old days just fell to the ground. Even the very popular "30 years of experience" "GULAAAAB JAMUN!" and "sofa cum bed" did not exclaim the kind of joy that I thought. The time factor: For the 80s, this was the showstopper. The main event. The mother of all television comedies. And it worked in age and in time! Maybe you can not say the same thing now, but watching the DVD did bring back pleasant memories. <br /> <br /> I wish the seasons with Shafi Inamdar and Swarup Sampat were longer. Satish Shah was incredibly good at the show, with equally effective support from Farida Jalal, Tiku Talsania and Bengali neighbors. Rakesh Bedi hams throughout. <br /> <br /> All in all, an experience that evokes memories of those who have seen it in prime time can not appeal to younger viewers or first-time visitors!
