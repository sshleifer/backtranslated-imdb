I had the opportunity to see Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it was one of the most intriguing films I had seen in a long time. One of the film's best points was to meet new, fresh faces and great actors in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed grand venues. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs through the entire movie, making it so exciting. You are in extraordinary landscapes discovered by such an original eye (the work of the DOP is simply great), so you feel like you are discovering it for the first time. The mood of the desert is swamping everywhere and even the scenes filmed in Los Angeles or San Francisaco seem to be a natural extension. The story leads you smoothly through all these beautiful scenery and leads you to a bittersweet end. This is the perfect climax for this perfect journey. The construction of the film itself is a masterpiece. The skilful use of innovative resources (like stills that put Danny's memories into the film) will compare to the hand-crafted works that are so rare and so enjoyable. Blind Spot manages to capture the essence of the desert and leads you to a universal commonality where each one of us can feel like a discoverer and a native.
