As a local performer, I thought that "Grease" was what Broadway producers wanted, and it showed a bit of the acting population. Although my favorites did not win (but came in second), I enjoyed comparing myself to them and seeing what I liked and where I could improve as a performer is the obvious link between the Broadway production and the television audience. <br /> <br /> They sang songs from the movie ("Hopelessly Devoted") as these songs are included in the new production. <br /> <br /> I agree with the earlier statement that the B'Way-Cast looks so much older, but keep in mind that these are people who were on Broadway and worked their tails off to be there , If the whole cast were green and fresh, I think that would have affected the casting process, by which the producers choose their talent.
