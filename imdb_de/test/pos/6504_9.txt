A wonderfully funny, impressive contribution to the pioneers of turntablism. DJ Shadow and Q-Bert are amazing in this great documentary. With Herbie Hancock's post-bop classic "Rockit" and the footage of some of the most complex and breathtaking turntable routines of all time, you can watch every great DJ play.
