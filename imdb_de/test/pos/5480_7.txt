An addict thriller in the form of "Day of the Jackal" in "The Line of Fire" has the additional twist that Eastwood's classic car bodyguard Frank Horrigan is disturbed by past failures. The hunt becomes personal when John Malkovich's reptilian assassin Leary ridicules him for this neurosis - with the rather awkward exception of the love of a good woman (Russos Lilly Raines), Frank can not help but lay Leary down personally. > <br /> Malkovich is a fleeting presence - not only flammable on screen, but often a variable actor. This is one of his good, focused and playing director Petersen's game. Eastwood is too old, but a) the audience does not care because it's him and b) his age is written in the script, not just in the narrative, but also as a recurring joke. Just as you would expect, but treated well. 10.7
