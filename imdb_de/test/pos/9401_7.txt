I recently hired Twister, a movie I saw on TV several years ago, and he has aged well. I laughed out loud about it several times, and strange as these people were, in the end I took deep care of them. This is a kind of small movie made for a cult audience, because, like Howdy's Gazpacho (well, I think that's it), it's a learned taste: you have to tune in to its particular wavelength. The production values ​​may be considered cheap, and the tempo and atmosphere take a while to calm down, but the film has an "appearance," especially in some wonderful settings that contrast the dry flatness of the country with the confusing nouveau Riche opulence of contrasting mansion interior: Michael Almereyda already had a good eye. Living with the sodapop magnate Eugene Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton) and his household (two grown children, a grandchild and a housekeeper) seems to be so detached from the outside life that we could be in Gormenghast. Everyone in this movie is wonderful (especially Suzy Amis and Crispin Glover as directionless genius siblings Maureen and Howdy), who occupy their roles so comfortably that after a while they buy the weird premise that somehow survived the tornado and is seemingly incapable of happiness, These people are lucky and do not really know what to do with their luck. There are some really great scenes: Eugen's quarrels first with his gutting TV girlfriend Virginia (a sour Pert Lois Chiles), then with his kids; William S. Burroughs, who exercises in the barn and tells a story about a mysterious Jim; Maureen's friend Chris proves himself by battling a hut full of wasps, clothed in a tablecloth with doilies and old fedora; Howdy, Violet, Maureen, and Chris are all sitting on the couch (the last three in suitably light summer clothes, the first in red blazer and black leather rock'n'roll equipment) staring at images of deserts in the huge TV and watching them the future (images were created by Bill Viola, who made the background video installation for the last tour of Nine Inch Nails). Crispin Glover is predictably great as Howdy: As always, he remains perfect in character. Howdy has made a cult out of his misery and brilliance; He's like Oscar Wilde of Kansas trying to live up to his red velvet suit. Whether he beats silently on an electric guitar, pops a full-fledged bullwhip while wearing a very black cowboy outfit, ripping off a room or even doing simple things like driving or pouring the above soup from a blender jug, he is fascinating. If you like his work, you will like it.
