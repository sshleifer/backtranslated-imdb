I caught this movie on TV and I watched it again. I told myself it was a long time since I saw this movie, so why not. And again, this movie inspired me. It's so easy, so observable and so human that I do not know why some people do not like it. <br /> <br /> John Travolta shines as Michael (his dance and every movement), an angel who can hardly relate to that word. He smokes, drinks and he eats like a savage, but he has a big heart. On his way Michael helps all the people he meets. Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) singing and finding a real man. Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) developed as a good and decent man. Michael even helped dear old Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton) - this last scene is beautiful when they dance on the street. <br /> <br /> Travolta was very helpful to other actors. Andie MacDowell is so beautiful and sympathetic, William Hurt is great as always, Robert Pastorelli shows his talent. Jean Stapleton and Teri Garr are good too, but my favorite supporting actor in this movie is Bob Hoskins as a boulevard owner. <br /> <br /> So we have a solid movie about people with a warm story attractive cast. Just do not take this movie seriously and I can guarantee that you will have fun.
