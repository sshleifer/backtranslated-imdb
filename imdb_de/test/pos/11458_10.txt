This movie was great, do not understand the disrespect it gets. It was my first time in this scene in 87-88 and it was really scary. If you're a horror fan of the 80s, you should not have a problem with this movie. He has everything that makes the horror of the 80s great. I met some of the actors and they were cool. What's wrong with a creepy old house, demons, crazy parties and horny handsome young people. The dialogue and the special fx made this film a classic. This movie has also taken care of one of those classic rumors about horror that the black man does not always have to die in the end. Although this movie was great, one thing remains undiscovered about what really happened to the old couple in the end. In the end, it was intentional or not this little side story that had always baffled me.
