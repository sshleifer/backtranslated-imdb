I'm a die-hard Dads Army fan and it will not change. I have all the tapes, DVDs and audiobooks and every time I see / hear them, it's brand new. <br /> <br /> The movie. The film is a reiteration of certain episodes, man and hour, enemy within goals, combat school and numerous others with a different edge. The introduction of a new general instead of Captain Square was an ingenious move - especially if he did not cash the check (something that is rarely done now). <br /> <br /> It follows in the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, startup and training. All in all a great movie for a boring Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Two disadvantages. One is the German False Fake Dodgy Accents (come one, Germans can not pronounce the letter "W" as we did) and Two The cast of Liz Frazer instead of the well-known Janet Davis. I like Liz in other movies like the broadcasters, but she does not wear it properly and Janet Davis would have been a better choice.
