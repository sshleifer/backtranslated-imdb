When I was in grade 10, I and my buddy were late in his house, spinning around the cable and watching this movie. We saw it because it looked kind of funny and had breasts. But then came the end and we just sat completely speechless. I think, after a minute of seeing the credits, he just whimpered "Oh Dude ....." It goes from the stupid 80s sex comedy to nihilistic realism so fast that it hits you off guard. I tried for years to rent this movie and could not find it - and nobody but me and my friend ever saw it - it seems. But now it is available! I strongly recommend renting and calming down.
