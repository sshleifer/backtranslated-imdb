At the age of 39, this movie moved me in the same way that all the footage and coverage of Dogtown influenced me at the age of thirteen. For all who criticized the self-promotion of the interviewed Z-boys, they laugh for the last time. That was their whole deal: "We're better than all of you and here's the reason ... (insert footage of the smoothest pool imaginable)" This was a movie to tell their story, and that was her story, whether you like it or not. It was her opinion of her skating that mattered ... not yours or mine. I thought the movie had captured her attitude and influence just as I had realized in the 1970s. The reality is that they revolutionized skateboarding, they were the catalyst for extreme sports, and they injected a culture paradigm that went to every corner of the Americana. In this film, images of Bertleman were reborn on a wave, and Alva and Jay Adams ripped through the foul, which was the California Dream, a whole culture of young American teens who just wanted to have fun and get a bike! When I saw this movie, I realized that I lived with these images every day until I was old enough to move to So Cal after my family moved to Nor Cal at the age of five. By the time I got back, my buddy and I were ramping up and down Ramp, looking for every empty pool and imitating everything Stecyk told them about. We are all trained and now have family and career, but this movie reminds me of who I was at that age and why I am still surfing. This is an inspired movie that anyone who is interested in pop culture, extreme sports, the 70s, or just the documentary can fully enjoy. With cable I can not change the channel. Kudos to Stacy Peralta for making a beautiful work of art!
