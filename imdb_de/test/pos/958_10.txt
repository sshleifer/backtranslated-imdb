Big Fat Liar is the best movie ever! It's funny and cool. Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) proves he did not lie and goes to Los Angeles to retrieve his paper from Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Together with his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes), his life messes up because Marty will not call Jason's father and say he wrote the paper! Nevertheless, everything is fine and a good movie to watch!
