Clint Eastwood plays a wounded Union soldier found by a girl from a Confederate boarding school. He is received and nursed healthy, instead of being handed over to Confederate soldiers. It seems that the women in this place have ulterior motives. Geraldine Paige, the headmistress, justifies not turning him into a confederation and even lists him as her cousin. Of course, when the man feels better, he pretty much becomes the man of the lady and does quite a lot of the rounds, but if he breaks, he REALLY gets broken, actually so bad that his leg gets cut off, but it's his Best of course not in retaliation. Things are carried a little further if certain women do not get what they want. I have not seen this for years and it still has a certain horror that is still pretty weird by today's standards. Not typical for Eastwood at all. If you have not seen them, it is worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
