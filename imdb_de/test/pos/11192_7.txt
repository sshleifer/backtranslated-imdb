I do not agree with the critics, but I really was not that moved by this movie. I hesitated a bit renting it, as I look through some of the same things that the protagonist is supposed to experience. But I avoided it because I thought I could experience catharsis or at least understand that I'm not alone. Although I understood the irritation of the protagonist with his careless cousin, but I did not feel his inner struggle as much as I would have liked. I felt that much more emphasis was placed on his disruptive cousin to withstand his reception. It's a beautifully filmed movie, and I've appreciated the use of silence to emphasize the feeling of isolation.
