Great movie. I laughed the whole time. Why? Well, I come from Austria and get on with the German (Bavarian) kind of humor. I think this movie only makes sense if you are a native German speaker. Stefan and Erkan both speak with a new Turkish-German accent, which became very popular in our countries (GER & AUT). But of course they are very stupid. As in any comedy, your personal humor, whether thumbs up or down, will decide.
