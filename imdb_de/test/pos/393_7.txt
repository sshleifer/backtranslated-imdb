Very pleasant western of the 50s. I have it in my collection and recommend it to western fans. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie by Victor Mature and quite well done in my estimation. <br /> <br /> He is a trapper who acts as a scout. Red Cloud has captured three of them on their land and taken their possessions with them. They all joined after their loss as Boy Scouts. Victor has turned his attention to the Colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regard to the rules. <br /> <br /> Action performed quite convincingly But no great depth or feeling for other characters. <br /> <br /> 50s Westerns are my favorites and this easily slides to satisfaction. A Western of this kind is on the pages of the past and may never be made again. One to enjoy. Was there a 7 rating. Probably worth 6.8, but movies like these will become more valuable over time. <br /> <br /> For movie noir fans ... "The Big Steal" "They live at night" "Side Street" are the most wonderful films enjoyed Bought and viewed Noir seems to somewhat resemble Westerns. Some time ago and never forever.
