This movie is excellent. Not because it does something special or new, but because it is consistently great in all its parts. No part is "groundbreaking" or "outstanding", but all parts are well above average and that makes a great movie for me. I 'll own several copies of this movie I'll one day buy it on collector' s DVD or Blu - Ray (just because of the high Blu - ray prices right now and of course face that I do not have a Blu - Ray player). but that is beside the point of this post). <br /> <br /> It seems like an ordinary movie, but it quickly turns into a drama filled with excitement, action, strong characters, and a thoughtful storyline that will keep you going all the way into the years , <br /> <br /> Wait, no, it does NOT start normally. <br /> <br /> It somehow starts what a Qun is. Tar. Movie WISH it could be. With a great scene in which trying to buy coffee and donuts is ... very, very wrong. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, nothing was as it seemed and a few people are dead and some people are very rich. I will not tell you who ... watch and enjoy! Overall Rating: 10/10, A **, Excellent!
