I watched an NFL game and started surfing during a break, finding it on one of the channels of the HBO type. I missed the beginning, but when I started looking at Deadly Voyage, the clicker was turned off and did not even think until the credits rolled. You will be rooting against the villagers and at the edge of your La Z-Boy throughout this time. If you get the chance, take the time to look at it. From time to time, I think about the fact that the cable company exempts my movie channels. However, if you come across such big channels, you know why it pays extra to pay for it. Happy Holidays to everyone from Cape Cod !!!
