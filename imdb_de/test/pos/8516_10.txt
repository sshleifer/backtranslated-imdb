There are many similarities between Never Say Never Again and Thunderball, not only in Sean Connery, but also in the story and plot. Apart from the actors, all others are identical to the abduction of atomic bombs, the demand for ransom, the transportation of nuclear weapons in a ship, etc. The only difference is the location of the thunder ball plot that exists in Bahamas. And in Thunderball, the NATO / RAF itself invites nuclear weapons into a plane and in Never Say Never Again this is changed by a "rouge arm of the ax" and air is thrown across the US and stolen in the Caribbean. Almost 99% are the same. If someone wants to contest this, they are welcome.
