The gimmicks of this 1934 Paramount comedy are the six comedy performers who band together in three male-female teams, all performing together. W. C. Fields and his frequent film partner Alsion Skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their role as small-town sheriff and innkeeper. Fields seems to have given the freedom to incorporate much of his own unmistakable, surreal comedy into his part, and it works wonderfully, especially where he has his famous pool table routine, a digression is absolutely welcome as it's weird is. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it seemed a mismatch to present a movie that was to be worn by the subtle local comedy of Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland alongside the band. A broad, witty vaudeville rattle of the big one George Burns and Gracie Allen's man-and-women comedy teams, but here it works perfectly because George and Gracie contain the roles in the script. There are freeloaders who travel to California with Ruggles and Boland's honeymoon, finding ways to annoy them every step of the way, even if they cling to a cliff to love their lives /> <br /> If you're two sympathetic Characters harassed with Burns and Allen turns out to be the perfect way to integrate their comedy characters living far beyond the borders into a real world - the comedy of the people they're responding to credibly as a goldmine, as Gracie's famous naive delivery herself. Charlie Ruggles deserves special mention for his feat as fussy banker "Pinky" Whinney. He is amazingly subtle and underplaying and laughing at lines that may not have even been heard in the hands of another actor. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully funny through and through, and most of the time a perfectly extended comedy of frustration, in which our sympathy with the poor Whinneys is that no moment can get alone, and the added bonus is that, what frustrates her is just first-class comedy material from Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> For the pre-code observers, there is some rather suggestive material in some of the funniest scenes, as Whinney tries to teach George why he and his wife want to be alone a while. <br /> <br /> There are a few signs of a hectic production - the occasional jump cut, one of the most obvious drop sets you'll ever see in a movie (topped with WC Field's own) in short, "The Golf Specialist "), and the knot in Field's tie is constantly changing. However, these do not bother me, and they should not bother anyone who likes the movie. <br /> <br /> "Six of a Kind" is a true little-known gem and one of the funniest movies I've seen has been around for a while. If you are thinking about looking at it, the answer should be yes.
