This is a perfectly observant, adventurous film with a great cast and a good story based on true events. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the story of the film is based on true events. Above all, it's an adventurous story with all the usual ingredients one would expect from an adventurous movie in an Arab world. So many sword fights, good old honors, religion and a rich and proud country. The movie is also full of humor to make the movie easy and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The constant back-and-forth involvement of the Moroccan plot between Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American conspiracy Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) was, in my opinion, not the best approach. The two things have completely different steps, completely different characters, they are just completely different worlds! Of course, both storylines are connected and focused on the same thing, but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big to make it work. The film does not always feel connected and a bit incoherent. The American plot line is mostly political, while the Moroccan plot line is purely adventurous and action packed. In the end, you might even wonder what the point of Roosevelt was in this movie. Apparently, John Milius is just a big admirer of his. Often, the American plot line would remove the far more interesting and action-packed Moroccan plot line. After all, John Milius was always in top form as an action director. <br /> <br /> Only halfway through the film does the movie get up to speed. The action with the largest and largest scaling of the film then begins. Especially the big fight in the end does not disappoint. I wish the whole movie was like that. In that way, this movie would undoubtedly have been better known. <br /> <br /> The film has some great Jerry Goldsmith music, perhaps better known than the actual movie. The film also looks good, with great production design and good-looking action and combat sequences. Apparently, the movie costs only $ 4,000,000, but that's really hard to believe considering the movie's settings and size. I mean, John Milius, his most famous movie "Conan the Barbarian," cost about $ 20,000,000, but was a lot slower and less impressive. <br /> <br /> Pretty funny to see Arab talking is a big, fat Scottish accent, but hey, it's Sean Connery, so you just tend to accept that. He fits in well with his role. Candice Bergen too. It's always hard for a female character to be credible and work in a movie like this, but she does. John Huston also plays a great role in this film! <br /> <br /> An absolutely predictable movie! <br /> <br /> 7/10
