I have seen this movie several times and find it very convincing and sad. The lack of real emotion in most characters is very disturbing. They look empty and hopeless. The story is based on a real event. <br /> <br /> A teenager is murdered by her boyfriend for no apparent reason - apparently he just felt that way. Then he praises his friends about it and since they do not believe him, he takes her to the body - a few times. Nobody reports the murder. There are two strong clues - Keanu Reeves and Crispen Glover - The character of Crispen Glovers is very annoying. <br /> <br /> Keanu's character Matt seems to be the only one who has a sense of right and wrong. This is Keanu at his best - a flawless performance and very believable - whoever believes this man can not act should watch this movie. Matt's little brother is almost the most troubling character in the movie. Only twelve and no pity or love factor in his life. It is very sad to think that there are so many children. It really makes you grateful for what you have. 10.9.
