I like many others saw it as a kid and I loved it and it shocked me to adulthood. I tried to find this movie, and even sought to play it on television sometime, since it was originally in US networks. Does anyone know where you can buy this movie, or does anyone have a movie and would you like to make a copy for me? Does anyone know if there is a chance to be re-televised? Maybe we should all fans write a station in the hope that they will radiate them again. I do not think they advertised this movie well in the past, because nobody really knows, people only know the Stepford wives and the Stepford husband films. Nobody knows the fact that there was a children's version. Maybe they should also do a remake as they seem to be dealing with many of my old favorite thriller / horror flicks lately. Well, if anyone has any input please write me with information. Thank you Taira tcampo23@aol.com
