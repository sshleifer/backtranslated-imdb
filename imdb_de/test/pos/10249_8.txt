On the surface, COOLEY HIGH is a snappy ensemble comedy disguised as a historic piece (early '60s with a flawless Motown soundtrack). But this movie contains SO much more - it gets better every time I see it. The cast of unknowns (at that time) is excellent, and it is notable that this is a film that does not lapse into blaxpitation clich√©s - sometimes COLEY HIGH feels almost like an updated urban neo-realist movie. with a lot of tense humor. Sometimes the budget is pretty tight, but the limitations are actually good for the movie - here's a sharpness and honesty of emotions that give the film an immediacy that lacks most like-minded films (like Schultz's later CAR WASH, the more popular) but largely meaningless.] Warm-hearted, but also lifelike, this could be one of the sleepers of the 70s - celebrated at this time, few movie freaks seem to know about this today - their loss - that's a fine, fine movie. < br /> <br /> The nude Pan & Scan DVD (no widescreen!?!) shows how little care this great movie offers.
