Despite the ominous title of the powerhouse cast attracts the audience in the theater. Jake Gyllenhaal visited Conan O'Brien to promote the film, explaining that "Rendition" is a euphemism for receiving information through torture. Since September 11, the "extraordinary rendition" has enabled the government's intelligence service to free people without a proper trial without questioning and to use all the necessary means to exchange information) that is torn from its mandate, making it an unorthodox observer Interrogation in an underground detention center outside the US makes. <br /> <br /> Omar Metwally plays the alleged terrorist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, the Egyptian national teammate of the American Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon). Isabella and her son are waiting for Anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane's passenger manifest.
