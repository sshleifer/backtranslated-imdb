Absolutely one of the 10 best music films of all time! An absolutely indispensable educational experience for any music fanatic - especially young rock / punk fans of today ... to understand the beginnings of a certain "artistic" movement, you must absolutely understand the roots of the music as well as the mindset and musical environment of the music know .... not to mention the political and social factors involved at the time. Also, this documentary is Rock-n-Roll F U N !! Do not miss!!! Can I tell you when, if at all, "the decline of Western civilization" ... Part 1 (not part 2, the metal version) will be made available again ... hopefully on DVD?
