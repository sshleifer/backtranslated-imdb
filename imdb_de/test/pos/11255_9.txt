Spoilers Begin The movie focuses on three friends, Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Steel) and Owen (Aaron Paul). The film begins with Sam and Owen as drug addicts and Chris, the track star, as the one who takes care of her. As things get worse for Chris at home, he asks Sam what the drug looks like. Sam is at the point of withdrawal and sober and tells him that it makes everything better. Chris then brings in Owen and they start to use. Chris needs two times until he is a "full time member". After some trouble with a dealer and a confession to Sam, she returns. That's how the downward spiral begins for her. Chris od is breaking a promise to Sam (I want part of the movie to be a surprise). He dies, Sam joins as an architect and Owen is arrested. This ends the story <br /> <br /> Spoiler ends. smaller spoilers everywhere Nick Nick is incredible. He will one day have an Oscar. His portrayal of Chris was Heartbreaking. As far as drug use is concerned, he was the only person in the film who felt that he was real. Aaron Paul, who played Owen, acted as if he had speed and not heroin. Summer Phoenix was good, she's talented, but what can I say, Nick Stahl stole the movie. His stunned eyes, his slow movements, everything was perfect. <br /> <br /> The authors had to show retreats in the film. That's one of the main reasons why people do not want to stop. Aside from the funny scenes (the mall scene and the backstreet boy scene, Man Steel hit the reactions right on the head), touching, sad scenes (like the scene between Sam and Chris in their bedroom, after being beaten up, I scolded and the park scene.). It was also realistic. Like the way I used it again, when Chris wanted to flush the drug down the toilet and Chris used it again after going to Own, even though he had been clean for two weeks, the train was too strong. it's all realistic. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie for a great cast, great music, and a half-story report on drug addiction.
