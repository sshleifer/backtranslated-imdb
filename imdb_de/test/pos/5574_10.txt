After using this site for 2 years for movie reviews, I eventually signed up with IMDB to give Farscape a "10". The show's authors, performers and crew have proven to be unequivocal masters of the science fiction genre. Even those who do not normally appreciate Sci-Fi should be encouraged to give this extraordinary series a chance! <br /> <br /> The virtues of Farscape are simply too numerous to list. The quality of the writing is amazing. I have not heard such a good dialogue since "Blakes 7". In fact, Farscape feels like a "Blake's 7" with good special effects and a bit more romance. <br /> <br /> All, have fun!
