This is a very special kind of episode. It begins when Jim returns from a weekend break with a new girlfriend, the recently divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney - daughter-in-law of John Huston, who knew a lot about the Noir movie) and her daughter. When they arrive, Karen enters the house while Jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her to her room. Then he discovers that Karen has disappeared without a trace. Of course, he calls Dennis and when the police arrive, they see no sign of Karen, but they find their neighbor murdered in the bushes. This of course makes Jim an instant suspect. <br /> <br /> This is a big puzzler and the first half of the story shows Rocky asking Jim to reread the story. Rocky suggests that by telling the story, Jim remembered a small detail he did not think was important at the time, but may now give an indication of what happened. It's a really well written scene and completes the transition of the Rocky figure from a grapple to an affected parent. It's also a long way to show that Rocky is not just some clueless old man. He says, "You come to me because I am your father, and I am smarter than you!" This is one of the times when Jim has his skills. <br /> <br /> This episode also features an appearance by hottie Lara Parker, who played Angelique in the "Dark Shadows" series, and then played Laura Banner, the wife of Bruce in the series "Incredible Hulk" a few years later , Here she looks great. <br /> <br /> This episode is also the first mention of the Minette crime family, a name that would almost always appear in the Rockford files when it needed a Mob family. This time it's his Vincent Minette that supports Rockford in the arrest. <br /> <br /> Lt. Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance in the series and Dennis is quietly downgraded by a police lieutenant who was in the previous season of an episode to a police Sargent. I think they thought it would be better to make Dennis less powerful and add a conflict between Jim and the police. Honestly, they were right, although I have the later Lt. Chapman prefers Lt. Diehl. <br /> <br /> Not much Rockford humor in this episode, but a good Mysterium with a lot of heart.
