This movie is hilarious. The laughter never stops. Every scene is full of funny comedy. Chris Farley is a comic genius and Spade plays his character to the tee. Farley was one of the best slapstick comics ever, and in this movie (as in all of his films) we see how much time and energy he has devoted to showing his character the way he sees fit held. "Tommy Boy" is a great example of a comedy. It always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen her.
