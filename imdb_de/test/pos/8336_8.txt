SPOILERS FORWARD? In the first ten minutes of Star Witness, we introduced a typical urban American family in a nameless city, which is a different way of saying Warner Brothers' version of NYC. Apart from the young children, including the charming Dickie Moore and the exciting Sally Blane, they are rather bleak and their conversation at the table is boring and we wish that the story would move on with the star Walter Huston. But wait, people, wait. Suddenly, there is a serious gangster filmmaking, in which the family is drafted against their will. After that, the baby never lets up. There is suspense, an Oscar-nominated screenplay, good acting. all you want is that old movies are? it is here. I doubt Chic Sales performance; he must be an acquired taste, but his presence proves crucial to the conspiracy. He has a special status in the credits, so Warner Bros. was a real eye-catcher, but as his blatant old routine fits in with the public, something is lost to me. Maybe it has been lost for the time, an unrecognizable factor that had to be understood in 1931 as a moviegoer. Even the climax is typically melodramatic. Still, this is currently the best release of the studio I've seen so far this year (though I've only seen eight, so this may not be a conclusive view). Do not miss this when TCM shows it. 8 out of 10.
