In 1983, Michael Jackson's popularity was so popular that if he wanted to produce a $ 1 million horror music video with the "American Werewolf" team and the voice of Vincent Price, that's exactly what he would do. And never before has a music video produced such a sensation before or since ... When it was released on VHS, this 13-minute short film became the biggest-selling musical in the world. But you know that you know all about it, because whenever there is a list of the best music videos of all time, it almost always comes first. <br /> <br /> It begins with Michael Jackson walking through the dark street with his date after her car collapsed. He explains that he is "not like other men" (damn right), and then the full moon appears behind the clouds. His girlfriend is standing there shouting and screaming and then shouting something else during an elaborate transformation sequence when Michael Jackson becomes a werewolf. He chases them through the forest, catches them and we ... cut into a movie theater. Ah, it's all in a horror movie that Michael Jackson and his date are seeing. <br /> <br /> We are there for five minutes and still no trace of the song "Thriller". Extravagant, much? Anyway, you need to know what's going on ... dancing, singing ... Cemetery ... Vincent Price ... Zombies ... "What's the problem?" ... then credits. Credits for a friggin 'music video. "Thriller" is not one of Michael Jackson's most memorable songs, but even for today's standards, it's certainly a hurdle for a visual experience. If you have not fully seen it, you should definitely do it soon.
