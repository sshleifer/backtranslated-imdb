For upper and middle school teachers, "The Cure" will be an excellent educational tool, both as a companion to "Huckleberry Finn" and as an individual course. Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme, the strong addition of friendship and love that develops between Eric and Dexter is a strong message for teens. Writing instructions that focus on the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. I also propose a focused class discussion on how Eric develops from a manipulative user to a loving friend.
