I will not bore you with a summary, you probably already know her. And hopefully, you're already familiar with Park Chan-Wook's work. <br /> <br /> I disagree with some other commentators because "Park has not turned from the revenge trilogy to blah blah blah". Because you know something? He has!!! The revenge trilogy initially differed stylistically from each other. How can you even compare the slackness and subtlety of "Sympathy For Mr Vengeance" with the hustle and extravagance of "Oldboy"? Park Chan-Wook has an incredible style, but his films do not have the same style! That was true and remains with the release of "Thirst". <br /> <br /> "Thirst" is an incredible picture, it literally has EVERYTHING you want in a movie. Insane violence, tasty blood, great humor, incredible tension and even very realistic sex scenes. The story is so crazy that you can never guess what's going to happen next. I'm so happy to say that Park is back in peak shape with this awesome dark comic vampire love story. Check it out as soon as possible!
