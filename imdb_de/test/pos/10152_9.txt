This movie is the one you fall in love with. Alfred Hitchcock should always be above the directors of his time. The most influential aspects of his films are simple simplicity & gripping drama. The other best thing about Hitchcock's films is a definite and thrilling ending. Everything that is said about "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is less. Film, drama, dialogue and camera are great in this movie. The song "Que Sera Sera" in the end remains in our memories for the entire life span. The movie is so pleasant from beginning to end that we never know when it will end. Seldom would Hitchcock incorporate humor into his films, this film has comic scenes that fit in the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely brilliant and as good as Vertigo.
