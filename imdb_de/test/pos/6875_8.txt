Matthau is a widowed hospital doctor and enjoys his unique status and the workforce's pedestrian and available nurses, while colleague and friend Richard Benjamin looks amused and puzzled. Your boss is hard to hear, the senile chief of staff, Art Carney, who is re-elected to this post. He is content to play the field without obligation until he meets the single mother Glenda Jackson who insists she is the only woman in his life while she is in his life. At the same time, he is pressured to respond to the in-love advances of a potential litigant in a malpractice case and to support the shabby and incompetent Carney in his attempt to be re-elected as chief of staff. This is a superior, old-fashioned romantic comedy written by four A's Actors and a superb supporting actor with a first-class dry, corrosive and sarcastic font is designed. Carney steals every scene he's in right now, and we're getting IMDb rolling on the floor when he appears on the screen. Otherwise, we are entertained by the on-off relationship between the two main characters and the various sub-sites. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of ambition to be a great movie, but it remains one of the best of its kind and can be viewed -watchable solely for its comedic value. It deserves more attention than it seems, and is worth the cost of the DVD or video cassette.
