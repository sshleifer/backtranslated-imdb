Usually I do not check online, but it's Saturday and I'm trapped in my room on a rainy day. All I have to do is watch sci-fi movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can not see the damn "Joxer") Mighty 'song out of my head, it's been around for about ten years, it just happens by accident, though someone (I) does something idiotic. If you have any complaints about this movie and actually publish it on the internet, do you have any idea how much you look like an idiot? If you expect more from Bruce Campbell than from what he (literally) expresses, why in G-d's holy name, are you watching his films? No one watches a Bruce Campbell movie if they want to see something ingenious and understandable. We look at them to make us feel better (like the people who watch Jerry Springer and eat Chunky Monkey) and let us easily chatter with mindless chatter. I personally love Bruce Campbell movies. I'm not an absolute idiot, I see myself as intellectual and scholar (haha, shut up, Ally). His films reflect insane, random, quirky, ridiculous ideals that anyone who has a brain or screams or not can enjoy. That, and he was somehow sexy on Xena: Warrior Princess, even with the facial hair. I rate this movie as an excellent 10 just because I can. If you can not accept simplified action plans (if any), hot babes in sci-fi splendor (leather, spandex) and familiar, though not exhausted, views of madness, then do not watch the movie (or something like that Mention Bruce Campbell's name). Oh yes, Ted Raimi was great in this movie! Keep it up, Ted! They made the best of what they had. ; |
