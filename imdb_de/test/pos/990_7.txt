Although I am very familiar with the poet Dylan Thomas, I know nothing about his life. Whatever concerns his life and especially his marriage, I would imagine The Edge of Love (based on the novel) manipulating things a bit, but if you're not a historian or a poet, who cares. <br /> <br /> The movie is less about Thomas than the two most important women in his life. One is his wife Kathrine and the other is Vera, who was his first love. A romantic night on the beach as a teenager is something both have tried to leave behind, but now they are grown up, they are good friends. I forgot to mention that this happens during the war. Vera becomes engaged to Captain Will Killing, who makes her pregnant and goes to war. While he is not there, Vera falls in love with Thomas again and Kathrine falls in love with him. She also carries the child of another man. Emotionally complex, however, it will be when Capt Killig comes back. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is a very soap operatic plot, forming in a dreary slow fairy-tale form with perhaps too many a sequence of sappy dialogue. But not all is lost yet. For a non-Hollywood production, I think the edge of love is as stylish as you can get. It's certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary romances, Hollywood production or not. Part of it has to do with the attitude during the war, which leads to emotional conflicts that feel more convincing and less artificial, a bit like reconciliation. Joe Wright's Oscar nominees are equally talented with drama and cinematography, but he is much more dependent on a steady pace and progress. Everything is fine at the beginning and at the end, but in the middle range the attention span can be tested, unless you are deeply rooted in history. <br /> <br /> I doubt The Edge of Love will have such an impact on the viewer, but it's a good movie to check. It could even be a good date-night movie, considering that it's so much smarter than the chick movies that friends have to endure today.
