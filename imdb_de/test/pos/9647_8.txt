I do not have a really solid thesis here, so I'll just throw a few observations. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie is absolutely great. It is recorded in high-contrast black and white and some of the scenes are so well composed that they almost distract. <br /> <br /> There are a number of intense protests, and some of the shots were amazing - Three guys start tear gas at the protesters, etc. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think that one of the biggest signs that this is a new film that looks back on the sixties, that it really is about how The idealism of the revolution turned into something else. The attitude to this shift is really interesting - I think that both the political phase of things and the artistic and self-sufficient phase have strengths and weaknesses. The movie does not necessarily take the position that things are going down. <br /> <br /> Third, I think the romance works very well. <br /> <br /> Finally I really, very much hated the end. It was too melodramatic. You could even say that the end of the movie that preceded it is unworthy.
