The Coen brothers have done it again. Three critics from the Depression (George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson) escape a Mississippi chain of chains and search for buried treasures that will finance their new lives. On the way they sing on the radio and are searched for stars as well as for escape. Great laugh and a soundtrack that is a lesson / introduction to bluegrass music. Clooney is outstanding as the fast-talking, quickly-understood Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays his strange wife. Turturro and Nelson are flawless stubs. Also in the cast are John Goodman and Charles Durning. Dan Tyminksi provides George Clooney with the vocal score for "I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow", the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as the template for the Bluegrass soundtrack, which also features Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, the Whites, John Hartford, the Cox Family and Gillian Welch contains. Tiptoe, Knee fun for the whole family. You'll be surprised how relaxed and funny this movie is.
