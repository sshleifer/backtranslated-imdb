I really liked this movie very much, but the ads I saw implied, and in a published review it says that this movie "benefits from a light touch". This is very misleading for me. <br /> <br /> There is indeed a lot of humor: eccentric, unobtrusive, sometimes a little twisted. The humor is generally very appealing. But most of the humor is the kind that is always aware of what is deeply serious, deeply sensitive, even profoundly painful. The film combines the themes of past and present, perception and truth, memory and activity, life and death. The entire film is steeped in the history of European anti-Semitism in general and the Holocaust in particular. How can humor and horror be combined in one film? The review I saw suggested that the humor is absurd. I do not think that's the case at all. at least not in common sense. I think this film is in the tradition of many Jewish / Yiddish literature and theater. I do not pretend to be any expert in this field; But from everything I've seen, humor in this cultural context is being used as a coping tool for the terribly tragic experiences of this people; and humor is also used as a means of "regaining the divine" for men and women who choose a path of faith rather than a path of despair or absurdity. In "Fiddler on the Roof" you will find humor in this rich tradition. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Jonathon) Wood wears horn-rimmed glasses that make him look really good, well, odd: compare Sin City when he wore the same eyewear with a cooling effect. In this film, it's easy to see how the goggles become a metaphor for both his quest and his struggle between perception and truth. Eugene Hutz (Young Alex) and Boris Lesking (Old Alex) are both really wonderful. Jonathon and Young Alex are from the same generation, but they seem to be very, very different. and then realize that they are not so different. And the way the apparent narrative voice gradually changes from that of Jonathon to that of Young Alex. As a journey of intended discovery for Jonathon becomes a discovery for Young Alex and Old Alex ... is so moving for me. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful scenes and panoramas of (I am told) Prague and surroundings that stand for the history of Ukraine. Everything feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful feel for the place; Although I have never gone to Ukraine myself and can hardly witness it first-hand. All in all, if you are looking for a light comedy, I would not recommend this movie. On the other hand, if you are looking for a wonderful, adorable and deeply moving movie, watch this wonderful movie.
