I was never really sure if I liked this documentation or not. It was featured on Channel 4 before a reduced version of Revelations and is in front of the uncut show on the Revelations videotape. The documentary is basically a friend of Bill and says he was great for an hour, with video clips of the show that look like a trailer for the movie you're watching. David Letterman pukes like a worm for throwing Bill out of his show before he dies. The reason? Bill made a joke about how people from the pro-life area should make funerals, and Letterman had pro-life advertising. Anyway, check out the video, because Revelations is Bill's best when he rants the best :)
