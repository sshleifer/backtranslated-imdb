I find this movie kind, timid, lethargic and deftly a poor choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw away a script, turn on the camera and play a fool. I find the unfavorable performances, the lighting, the cinematography, the sound and the laws of the film school that D 'Urville Martin broke, funny. When I speak from the perspective of a film director, sometimes I just want to drop everything and have fun on the set. This movie looks like fun. When other up-and-coming film directors ask for advice, I'll simply tell them to watch a movie by Rudy Ray Moore. They always throw a confused look back and ask me why they do not see the champions Woody Allen, Scorsese, Lucas, Capra. I laugh and add that you always want to know first what you are not supposed to do in movie history.
