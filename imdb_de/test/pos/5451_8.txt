Good movie, great story, great characters, I really enjoyed it, enough to buy the DVD when it came out. <br /> <br /> The real life story she claims to be telling is more intriguing and compelling than anything the fictionalizers could ever bring out. My friend, who works in the media business, said that he should not show such insider deals as this gives the deal a bad name. As if. <br /> <br /> However, there are a few problems with the DVD: First, the volume is very low, so you need to raise the volume of the TV to watch it. I note that this is also the case when HBO does it in the original production version. Second, for about the first five minutes, the left side of the video is cut off, that is, the image is cut off about one inch from the left side. After five minutes, it fills the screen properly from left to right. Such a sloppy technical production is very amateurish, and I do not know why director and producer let such sloppiness pass by. <br /> <br /> Despite the technical flaws, it's a gratifying story, one of the best of HBO in my opinion.
