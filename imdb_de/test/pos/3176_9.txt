This is one of those films that was never released and was therefore missing when it was originally played in theaters. <br /> <br /> I found this when switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in the story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and irresponsibility hurt everyone around him. I often wanted to see the movie again, but I could not even remember his name and have never seen him in the rental shops. James Coburn and Slim Pickens were outstanding in their roles Rodeo footage was first-rate. Although it is an action film with a Western backdrop and a Western theme, it can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of their tastes.
