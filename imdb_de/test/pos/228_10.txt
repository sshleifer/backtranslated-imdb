To say that this is a good show does not mean anything. After all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other funny and brilliant films. The writing is excellent. Although the show is single-line, they do not get overbearing or annoying. Leslie Nielsen bends his comedy muscle as if he were saying: you have not seen anything yet. The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun. When viewing these films, keep track of how many shticks are taken from the TV program. The genius part is that they do not have to be changed too much. The show was really a test field for later bigger and better versions.
