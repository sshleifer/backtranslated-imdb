As a 90's kid, I really enjoyed this show and I can say with pride that I really enjoyed it and even more than the classic WB cartoons. <br /> <br /> I do not know why; Caricatures of the early 90s had something special; I do not know if it was the uncertainty atmosphere, a generational change or whatever. "Tiny Toons" maintained the atmosphere of the 90s and provided one of the most popular, funniest and undervalued cartoons ever created. <br /> <br /> The memories are murky, but I can only say that I liked every single episode and every product in connection with the show. No other cartoon made me laugh in a gentle way (before he went into dark, teenage sitcoms). The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a real main character. Every single character was funny and deserves to be called a lead.
