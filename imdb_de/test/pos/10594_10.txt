I have never seen such a movie before, nor so funny. I laughed my goddamn ass and saw him repeatedly. Infact I'm watching it now. Chad from CKY is hot too. If you never liked it, it'll blow you in the ass, you have no taste. In the film, Ry (Ryan Dunn) has just split from his girlfriend who turned to Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon DiCamillo) to find out what she did with "Hellboy" (Rake Yohn) and with the help did Raab (Chris Raab / Raab himself) they do just that. <br /> <br /> The fender scene and the scene with Cactus in the Record Bin were weird.
