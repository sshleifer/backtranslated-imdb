Two years after "Airplane!" Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker pulled off one of their stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series, a glorious start to old American detective shows like Dragnet. Nielsen played Frank Drebin, America's answer to Inspector Clouseau. It had the same humor as "Airplane!"; clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities and recurring characters like Johnny, the shoeshine who seems to know everything about everything. Guest stars (including William Shatner!) Were killed in the opening credits. "Police Squad" was the first US sitcom since "Batman", which had no laughter. Many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were made, but I think it was about right. The concept would never have been able to hold a full 24-episode run. Five years later, "Police Squad" was successfully broadcast on the big screen when the first of the "Naked Gun" trilogy was released. Jim, Jerry, David and Leslie had the last laugh.
