Of the two Slaughter films, this is the better, and although it's hardly a Schindlers list in terms of complexity, it's damn funny. All men are the goodies or the bad guys and the women are all just horny and emotionally needy. B. Slaughter's Girl. It's also damn funny and The Pro has to be the funniest movie pimp ever. You just can not get enough of these hats, purple suits, gold necklaces and jive patois. The best is where he has the harem around him "DO YOU BITCHES UNNASTAN". Everything about him is bigger than life and reminds of Morris Day in Purple Rain. Jim Brown also proves that he is a private cock for all chicks, and again he kicks white butts in all directions. The car scene is very unrealistic that they survive unscathed, but hey, these are the movies. In any case, the best Blax strip surpassing Shaft (1971). Even the first movie is pretty good.
