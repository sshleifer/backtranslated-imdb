Although several scenes by Wirey Spindell can be described as "over the top". I thought it was refreshing to see something ready to go to an almost taboo, twisted comedy. <br /> <br /> Wirey Spindell is a great movie with great dialogue. I would not say that this movie is for everyone, but the movie is on my top 10 list. <br /> <br /> If you can look beyond occasional offensiveness and watch him for the movie, he would do that. I hope you could see it in the same light as I do.
