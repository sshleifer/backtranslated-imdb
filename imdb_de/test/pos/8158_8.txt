Latter Days is a very, very independent film. And in comparison to many of today's more modern films, there are many missing points. The shoot is sometimes very amateurish, the dialogues can be a bit hacked and the characters are not impressively complex. So do not hope too high hopes for this film, because he is, as I said, very independent. Whatever is missing in the concrete aspects of the film can be overlooked because of the charm of the story! I can not say that the plot is exceptionally original, but the story is still beautiful and heartwarming in many ways! It's not about being gay and not about it, it's about faith and how you decide to live your own life! It's a stupid story that makes you want to cry and smile at the same time! To be honest, the Latter Days are far from perfect, but I really loved the movie and would highly recommend it! It's very critical of the religious aspects of our society, and it's about homosexuality - but be open-minded and I'm pretty sure most people will enjoy it as much as I do!
