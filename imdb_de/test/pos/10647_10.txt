Based on the actual events of 1905, the silent movie THE BATTLIPPING POTEMKIN is an imperial Russian ship in which heinous conditions lead to a mutiny. Shocked by the conditions on the ship, citizens of the port city of Odessa gather in support of the mutineers - and as a result, they are at the mercy of the Imperial forces, which attack the civilian supporters with ferocity. <br /> <br /> POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds they belong to, and it achieves its incredible power by blasting the clash of groups and crowds in a series of shows extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences. Surprisingly, each of these sequences manages to surpass the previous one, and the film gains in strength as it passes from the mutiny to the public rally to the massacre on the Odessa steps - the latter being one of the most famous sequences in film history. Director Eisenstein's vision is great, where the real events have actually taken place, and his vision is extraordinary, for he builds up some of the most memorable images ever created for the film, not just sequentially but moment by moment within each sequence <br /> POTEMKIN being a great movie is an understatement. It is an absolute must, an absolute must for anyone seriously interested in cinema as an art form, a purely visual cinema from its most brilliant side, often imitated, rarely equal, never surpassed. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
