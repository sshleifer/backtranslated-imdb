The movie was very good when it came out, I attended Cooley High and the Cooley Upper Grade Center. By 1968, I was also homecoming queen and grew up in the area of ​​Cabrini Greens. I knew a lot of people in the movie. It was nice to see friends in the movie who lived in the area and they had the chance to be a star who was a unique experience for them. I had good times when I grew up on the north side Hard times where I can relate to the movie Cooley High is no longer standing, but a person like me and others still remember the fun we had with Cooley Had grown up high. There is a lot of history to tell in this area in the north.
