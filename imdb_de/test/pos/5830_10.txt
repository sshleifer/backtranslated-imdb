I admit I almost gave up watching TV. Why? Because most of them are about doctors, forensics or girls / boys who can predict a murder by sitting on the toilet seat. But I have to say that I was wrong when I saw the first episode of Oz, one of the most brilliant shows on television, to this day. Oz is a show about the highest level of safe prison and shows episodes in the lives of all prisoners and their frustrations. What I like about this show is the fact that it has the courage to show the real life in prison without distracting characters, stereotypes and unrealistic dialogues. Even though the characters on the show are not heroes, they quickly became attached to her and her life. Sure, there's a lot of violence in this show and some disturbing pictures of rape and drug abuse, but that's the point of this show. to show how brutal and frustrating life in prison can be ... crap, you can not show life in prison like a "clean environment" with "sympathetic characters", right? Oz is perfect in every way, the actors do a great job and the whole hour of the show is very fast. The only thing I did not like about this show was the last season of the show. I think it was too funny and brutal and the final was not satisfactory. But overall, Oz is still my favorite show on TV, surpassing sopranos and millions of CSI and Dr. House with only one main title. Brilliant show that has the balls to show what other shows take away from us; Realism.
