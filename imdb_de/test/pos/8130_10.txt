The biggest tragedy surrounding this thoroughly sexy movie is the lack of US distribution. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at the Boston International Festival of Women's Cinema and would highly recommend it to anyone who can see it. Great performances, a well thought-out script and a great direction by the talented and funny Rose Troche make this movie a winner!
