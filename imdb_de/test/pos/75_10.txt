This often-spoiled movie is a must for fans of Blake Edwards, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini or Hollywood musicals. Other authors have commented on the tonal shifts, the confusion of the conspiracy, etc., but the film has many things to recommend. The score is one of Henry Mancini's best (and he has written many wonderful pieces), several songs are sung by Andrews perfectly, Julie's performance is nuanced and she is adorned with beautiful clothes (she is absolutely the most loved one here). The on-scene footage is breathtaking, and there are some fun gossips of the Inspector Clouseau type. Rock Hudson basically called in his performance, but he's pretty good. A real curiosity as it was the last big movie that Julie has done for about 10 years and is in many ways a precursor to Victor / Victoria. It's nice to look at and hear. When will it be available on DVD? If so, I want both versions - the longer and shorter, Director's Cut. Since it is in S.O.B. would be ridiculed, they would make a great pack of two!
