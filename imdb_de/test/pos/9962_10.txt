My guide to the quality of a movie is when I still think about it after leaving the theater. I still think about it the next day, which does not happen often. <br /> <br /> The scenery (a reasonable supposition for 16th century Italy), costumes, lighting and cinematography are all outstanding. It's a beautiful movie visually. <br /> <br /> Characters can never rise above the script they have to recite, but these actors have made the most of their material, which is excellent. This is one of Shakespeare's finest pieces that people will enjoy 400 years later. All principals were interesting and enjoyable. Those who call this antisemitic must be deaf and blind. If anything, it is a 16th century Catholic anti-Venetian. While Shylock plays a man who is controlled and tortured by the injuries suffered, it is obvious that the society in which he lives is largely to blame. The script clearly puts its personal responsibility where it belongs. <br /> <br /> A great movie.
