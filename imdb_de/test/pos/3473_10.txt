I did not know anything about this movie until I saw it ... my brother actually suggested to take a look. Usually his suggestions are not much cop, but I was determined to see something, so I saw it. <br /> <br /> Well, to make it short, I give 10/10. <Br /> <br /> The film revolves around two people who meet when they live in the same location. One is very dependent on the institution around him at first, the other is a rebel. One does what pleases him, the other, as he said. <br /> <br /> In the first few moments of the movie, we quickly see the friendship between the two buildings and see them rubbing off a bit. It's a remarkable piece of work that manages to tell a good story without a turn, when people jump out of bathtubs or superheroes come to save the day, because everything can not go right - not all golf courses can be spanned - and this movie shows a lot. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie, you are not impressed ..... I would suggest that you do not see anything anymore.
