I've noticed that many people call to account Opera for the way Betty reacts to the murders. I think they rely on these complaints as they imagine a "normal" person. The thing is ... Betty is not a "normal" person because of her childhood traumatic events. She's had a long struggle before the movie even starts ... and at the end of the opera ... in my opinion ... she's totally out of whack. <br /> <br /> ------- -------------- SPOILERS -------------------- ---------------- ---- You must remember that when she was a very young child, she witnessed that her mother's lover had at least committed a brutal murder while her sadomasochist mother was just looking at him. <br /> <br /> She was raised by a woman who achieved sexual liberation, tied up and watched as girls were hacked, cut and strangled. That does not make a healthy life. I think it's pretty easy to conclude that her mother used all sorts of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to make sure her daughter never taunted her. It's also likely that Betty, at her impressive age, was deeply confused by what she saw. Is this just something adults do, etc. Betty obviously looks up to her mother ... I mean ... she's become an opera singer just like her. Mommy can not be bad, right? She could not tell the police about her mum or that mysterious, hooded guy she connects with Mommy. Betty has many deep-seated emotional issues. Her mind has been trying for years to fade out the memory of what she has seen her mother ... but it keeps coming to the surface, manifesting itself as terrible nightmares, skull-migraine, dependency on relaxation techniques. and sexual frigidity She combines brutal violence / bloody death with sex on an unconscious level. There is an inner struggle between the part of Betty that has confused murder / sex and the part of her that thinks these things wrong. <br /> <br /> After she saw her boyfriend murdered by the man with the hood ... she calls the police but is not willing to give her name. The part of her that believes murder is forcing her to make the call, but the ambivalent part does not allow her to meddle in herself. The ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way. So she leaves the phone in the rain ... and when she gets picked up by the director, she behaves surprisingly quiet, not as angry as one would think a "normal" person would be ... because her part of it was stuff to block since she was a kid, she's damned damned to block the horror of what she's just experienced. <br /> <br /> The situation in her life contributes to a dead-end in Betty's psyche. Her singing career is bearing fruit ... she's going to be a great opera singer, just as her mother was. But will she be like her mother in every way? In the darker ways? Or will she be able to go her own way? Add this to the reappearance of the hooded man who is murdering everyone around her. <br /> <br /> Only when the man with the hooded figure kills Daria Nicolodi does Betty really take an active part in defeating the killer. Here's someone who loves Betty, who wholeheartedly supported her in her aspiring career and is indeed a mother figure in Betty's life since Mum's death died. Imagine how awful it would be to lose your real mother and then see the woman closest to a mother's eye through the eyeball. I could go on ... but I habit. What I mean by that is that Betty's character is much more complex than most reviewers who were willing to acknowledge it. <br /> <br /> Opera is one of the best ... and not just for the visual images (although they are really great) and not just for the inventive murders (though they are). There is a depth here ... and attention must be paid.
