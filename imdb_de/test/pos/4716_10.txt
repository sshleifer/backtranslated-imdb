I've seen Beyond Rangoon about 20 times, it was so good. When I looked at it, I first saw the story of Laura Bowman. Later, after several screenings, I realized that this was also a parallel documentary. It occurred to me to keep a story about Aung San Suu Kyi and the struggles of women in the face of uncertainty, danger and sadness. I would also list history and politics after further consideration, as I learned a lot about Burma's past and present and could only guess at his future. This movie is not just a movie you want to see, but a copy that you absolutely want to own. It's a movie that could easily be seen by the whole family, though not for kids under thirteen. However, the pedagogical benefits of this film can not be underestimated.
