I do not cry easily about movies, but I have to admit, that moved me to tears. Although I'm not a Ms. Streep fan, her performance was excellent. The title defines in a sentence what the love of a mother is. For the first hour, I did not like any of the characters, but that changed throughout the movie. The film also explained why certain marriages last even though there are obstacles. A must see movie.
