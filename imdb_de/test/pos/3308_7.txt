An extremely enjoyable screen version of Rona Jaffe's best-selling pot boiler on the difficulties and difficulties (and, of course, love) of a group of women working in New York publishing in one way or another. Directed by Jean Negulesco, quite fresh after the success of "Three Coins in a Fountain" and the prototype for "Sex and the City", except that sex takes place off-screen. <br /> <The bright young talents of the day (Hope Long, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker, Martha Hyer) are all well occupied, while Joan Crawford appears as the editor's queen bitch who could probably eat Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly and spit it out; With absolutely no effort, she steals the movie. The men include Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan (if it was not Rossano Brazzi, it had to be Louis Jourdan), Robert Evans (before he wisely backed the camera), and Brian Aherne. There are more foams than you'll find in an average laundromat, but if you like "Desperate Housewives," like me, not to mention Carrie Bradshaw and the society, you're probably going to love this. A very guilty pleasure.
