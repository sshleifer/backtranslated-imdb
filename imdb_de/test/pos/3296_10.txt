This twisted comedy is well played and directed. Very funny and the production quality is excellent. It is easy to see why this short film has been received and awarded in so many festivals. <br /> <br /> Anyone can identify with Calvin, who has a bad day, a bad week, a bad life. Travis Davis plays the role very well! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding, which gives this film just the right confusion. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who would not love the suicidal goldfish? <br /> <br /> This short brings a lot of laughs. And do not miss the credits as they end up playing!
