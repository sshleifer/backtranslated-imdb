Robert McKimson's "Acrobatty Bunny" is one of the director's best shorts. Although the circus-based setting may bring back vile memories of McKimson's dreadful "Big Top Bunny," "Acrobatty Bunny" is not nearly as boring as this travesty. "Bugs Bunny" against a wild lion, "Acrobatty Bunny" is fresh and funny right from the beginning, not to mention a very attractive look. There's a classic scene where Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of its hole to step straight into the lion's throat. In a brilliant Disney parody, he coughs "Pinocchio" into the lion's throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of the coming. At first there are expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion cage, followed by a funny, grotesque and irritating rendition of 'Laughing Clown Laughing', which I regularly imitated as a kid! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence that gives the caricature its name. I've never loved the circus as a cartooning ground and find that this usually leads to a boring and predictable set of gags, but "Acrobatty Bunny" breaks out of the mold and the result is an exciting fun that's among the best of McKimson belongs.
