I had the PRIVILEGE of this evening to attend British Prime Minister Inglorious Basterds! After seeing the trailers, I had high hopes, but had doubts about a series of self-indulgent movies (c'mon let's face it, self-indulgence is his middle name in Tarantinos) he pulled the cat out of his pocket with it. The film is full of interesting dialogues, Perfect Timed Comedy with a touch of brutal murder. <br /> <br /> However, the culmination of this film lies with Christoph Waltz, who makes no mistakes or mistakes. He manages to create a real tension in the audience while remaining quite "theatrical" (I can not imagine a better word). He has definitely earned his prize in Cannes and is undoubtedly reliant on an Oscar !!!! We hope to see him again soon!
