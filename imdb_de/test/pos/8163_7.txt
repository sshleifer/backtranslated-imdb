LAST DAYS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Annoying when a LA partyboy (Wes Ramsey) falls in love with a handsome one Mormon missionary (Steve Sandvoss). <br /> <br /> This sympathetic film is a big success on the festival gyro and on the limited-release theatrical release - the feature debut by scriptwriter C. Jay Cox (SWEET HOME ALABAMA) - is an exercise in "opposites attract" in which Ramsey's lowly-minded character is forever changed after he has advised harshly on the vulnerable beauty Sandvoss, who is constrained by the dictates of his religious beliefs. The path of true love is fraught with difficulties, not least to which Sandvoss' fellow Mitmons respond to his newly discovered sexuality, leading to his excommunication from the church and the wrath of his outraged parents (Mary Kay Place has a smaller but more devastating Cameo as the boy's indignant mother). However, Cox's script focuses primarily on Ramsey's path to salvation, as his hedonistic lifestyle is disrupted by Sandvoss's influence and responsibilities arising from his maturing maturity: he volunteers as an outreach participant and supplies AIDS patients living at home, leading to an unexpected friendship with former party boy Erik Palladino (TV "he"), whose illness Ramsey offers a much needed wake up call. <br /> <br /> Cox's script is full of juicy threads One-liners and different beads of wisdom (on Mormonism: "Your congregation does not like alcohol or homosexuals? I definitely do not join in - I can not imagine Heaven without both! "), and the characters are surprisingly complex and well drawn. Ramsey has the keener, sexier role (he first saw how he did something rude to a willing participant!) But it's Sandvoss who has become a kind of gay icon, with his sensitive portrayal of a sweet innocent whose way off The darkness into the light leads to a surprising revelation about his place in the world around him. He and Ramsey are well matched, and their inevitable sex scene (short but memorable) is followed by a compelling sequence in which Ramsey describes a childhood trauma that has shaped his life so far. <br /> Filmed on hi -def video and transferred to 35mm for the theatrical exhibition, the film's meager budget narrows the scope and size of Cox's ambitions, though the characters and situations are strong enough to survive this small drawback. Jacqueline Bisset shines as the world-renowned restaurateur in the diner where Ramsey waits, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("Third Rock of the Sun") steals as Sandvoss's colleague Mormon anyone who defies his friend's relationship with Ramsey religious principle ... but ONLY according to the principle. Although stilted in some places, the movie hurts from romantic yearning and deserves praise for honesty and compassion. Best viewed with a crowd of like-minded spectators, preferably with a loved one by your side.
