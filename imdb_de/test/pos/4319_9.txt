"Live Together, The Alone" is divided into three main lines, and each of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So if you put all together, you have a great 3 episode. It was a brave move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in three episodes so far, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely mesmerizing, both are informative about the island's past & Swan Station move yourself and honestly. Desmond and Penny seem magically connected, even though they are at the other end of the world, and both characters are beautifully played (it's hard not to cry when Desmond reads Penny's letter). The action in the hatch is tense as Locke is determined not to press the button again, convinced that all this was just a psychological experiment. Desmond gradually realizes the consequences of this decision and Eko is locked up outside and desperately trying to get back inside. The melting of the watch and Locke's "I'm wrong" are unforgettable moments. Outside, Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and Hurley were captured by the Others for Michael's betrayal (after making a puzzling Pearl-related discovery), and "Henry Gale" returns as the leader of the others. Even the least important plotline, Sayid, Jin, and Sun, who sail to the beach where the others are supposedly camping, contains one of the show's biggest mythological mysteries, the giant statue that is almost completely missing, except for a foot with four toes , In short: emotion + story + mythology + adventure + suspense + the threat of annihilation + a glimmer of hope = a classic LOST episode. *** 1/2 of 4.
