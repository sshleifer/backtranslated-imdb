I have a letter from Ms. Knight, who went to college with my older sister. In it she tells of the strains of this film. She herself was pregnant - an interesting connection with the plot of the film - and the new director was unsure, quite green and had great difficulties with all the decisions, the logistics, etc. They were constantly on the move, and it was a very difficult shoot. <br /> <br /> However, the film, with a strong debut for James Caan, remains effective and influenced. It's a great showcase for the talent that Ms. Knight has spent her entire career on television, in movies, and on stage, where she won Tony for "Kennedy's Children." <br /> <br /> This movie has aged well.
