The 1980s produced a lot of bloody little horror movies, most of them in the Slasher sub-genre - leaving that movie the rest of the whole thing. Night of the Demons is a mix of the ultimate horror movie The Evil Dead; and Haunted House-cum-slash movie Hell Night. Movies like this usually show a confused / deformed lunatic as the lead actor; But here we have bloodthirsty demons, which is always more interesting than a maniac, if you ask me. There is also a lot of comedy in this film, and the first third of the movie could easily be the cornerstone of a comedy movie. But as soon as the characters enter the central place; an eerie funeral home known as 'Hull House' - the movie turns into a horror movie you'd expect given the title. The story is as simple as you would expect, and we follow a group of children who decide to hold a Halloween party at the funeral home. However, this turns out to be a bad idea as soon as it turns out that the house is obsessed; and the demons begin to inhabit the bodies of the children! Their only salvation is on the other side of the underground river ... but finding the gateway to the site is not as easy as it sounds. <br /> <br /> The heart of the film is the gothic mansion where the action takes place. This creaky old house is a great horror film location. The fact that it used to be a funeral home only adds to that. Director Kevin Tenney shoots the house well, and it's been particularly good to see the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and it's difficult to escape. The comedy at the beginning of the film is generally very funny, and I was hoping that the laughter would continue once the horror started. The movie has its comedy moments when the kids enter Hull House, but it's never overly funny and it's obvious that horror is the movie's main target. Not that this is a problem. But the night of the demons could have been much better if they had fused these elements properly. The characters are pretty much what you would expect from such a movie. But acting suits the film well, and it's clear that the young cast had a good time making this film, and that it transfers well to the screen. The effects are good in that they fit in well with the movie, and since most death sequences are performed well; It's a good bet that most people do not get bored looking at this. This is not a classic or has to watch movie; But I highly recommend it as it offers a good time and will appeal to fans of stupid horror feeders.
