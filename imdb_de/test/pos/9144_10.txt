As a great horror fanatic, I had given up on the vampire subgenre, because the vampire on most vampire flicks has become feminine and not threatening, benign and basically weak. This was the attitude I brought to Souls Midnight, and I am pleased to say that the vampires in this movie are at least hungry to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies! Armand Assante, one of my favorite actor of all time, was born to play the charming vampire with ferocious intensity. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interested me is the central location in the Borgo Hotel. That's cool because (and I went back to my high school copy to check) in Dracula, the Borgo Pass is the place where Jonathan Harker has to pass to get to Dracula's castle whoever made the decision has to make the creature a real effect and not a damn CGI! That's the one thing that's great about many low budget movies. They can not afford the garbage computer effects that plague many Hollywood monstrosities, a sheer vampire. Cheers, YES
