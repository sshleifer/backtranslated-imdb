This is one of the best movies from the 80s punk scene. I saw this on a "bootleg" copy a few years ago and was amazed. Only a handful of today's kids know the true roots of punk and this movie shows some of the 80s punk legends like The Germs and shows what it was like back then. There's so much punk with MTV and radio in the mainstream these days, and it's nice to see the real underground rebellion of the original scene. Darby Crash (of the germs) is one of my heroes and this movie shows why. A must for all "punks" and all those who are interested in the punk scene of the 80s
