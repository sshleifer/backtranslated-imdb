I was really looking forward to watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I knew it would be a different kind of Revenge of the Nerds movie, I was still impressed. <br /> <The fact of this kind of learning is very true and strongly believes that this should be allowed in a "new school style". Conventional teaching methods do not always teach students what they should know or should or should know. <br /> <br /> This type of teaching should continue to be sought in real academic courses. <br /> <br /> While there was still too much In the party scenes, it obviously had to be thrown in - to make Hollywood a comedy about college ... though we all know that life is not. <br /> <br /> An incredible note, still funny and with a deadly ending. <br /> <br /> Great ending. Crucial for the entire story and very surprising. <br /> <br /> Without the last scene, the movie would have been only half as good. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie and did not have to. I have too much curses or nudity or jokes to make it good. <br /> <br /> Great crew and cast, story and even the generic typing of compulsory "Hampton frat members" was well done. <br /> <br /> American Pie 1, 2 3 and American Wedding or whatever the clones do that makers can not measure with 1/3. <br /> <br /> Far better than most comedies about the first year college with No Humble stupid jokes to suck someone. <br /> <br /> I liked it, although it was easy ... it was interesting and even had heart ... my only regret that I have seen this movie, it is no longer
