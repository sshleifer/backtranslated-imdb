This is a great movie that I've watched since my sixth year with my big sister. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and still laugh, smile and cry without ever getting bored like other movies. It is a film that will live on forever through generations of families. I love it :) If I rank from 1-10 in my case, I would easily rate it at 9.9. <br /> <br /> It's a film about changing a girl (baby) and her first boyfriend (Johnny) about their relationships within the family, about the changes in the world of baby and Johnny during their relationship <br /> DIRTY DANCING WILL LIVE FOR A TIMELESS CLASSIC. Thanks for the short comment.
