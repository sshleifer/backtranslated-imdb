For anyone who is confused by the length and pace of this movie ("Why does he say he's putting spaceships on for about 15 minutes?"), We have a word to think about: <br /> <br /> Beauty. <br /> <br /> Beauty is an undervalued concept. Sure, in movies you often see beautiful photography and so on. But when did you last see a movie in which beauty is pure? There is a strange belief among moviegoers that anything that does not refer to the plot or the character has to be removed. This is depressing Hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the plot of the movie. A director can show 15 minutes spaceships without reason that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so. <br /> <br /> '2001' requires you to look in a different way than you normally watch movies. It requires that you relax. You must experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Do not get me wrong, actions and characters are good, but they are not the nuts and bolts of everything. There are different types of films, and to enjoy '2001' you have to set your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the joy of beauty, of pure beauty, unrestricted by the banal conventions of everyday movies. "All art is complete useless "- Oscar Wilde.
