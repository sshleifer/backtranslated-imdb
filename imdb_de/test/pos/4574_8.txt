I would say that's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge has an eye for things nobody would expect from Office Space. Hemake's statement about the dumbing down of society and the survival of the fittest are mere dreams in 500 years. This pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to set the day. Yes, there is a lot of potty humor in it, and it's about getting the story moving and communicating its point of view. The real frustration with Private Joe Bowers, however, is priceless and a few instances that we all may affect at some point in our lives. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the humor, look at it from a different perspective and look at it again. I have looked at it twice to really appreciate this movie, what it is? And with, after I've looked at him twice? I will read a book now.
