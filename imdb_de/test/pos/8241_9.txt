A really good Australian movie. Nice the look and feel of Sydney as in the 1950s. This movie really impressed me when I saw it for the first time on its first movie release and it still stands very well. Fine directorial work by Phil Noyce, wonderful camera work, thoughtful lighting and good performance across the board. An absolute "must see" for all Australian cinema students of the 70s. An "out of the box"!
