Well done! Was very exciting and had great stunts. A show that really rocked. Was a great job for all who worked on this. and especially the acting of Bobbie Phillips. That would have been great on the big screen. Want to see more of these movies of the week or maybe a weekly series. This was a great conversation and I'm glad I watched it! By far the best of the three. Keep up the good work with UPN and Bobbie Phillips. I will search for the next one.
