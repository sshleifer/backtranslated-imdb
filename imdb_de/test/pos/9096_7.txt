Originally I was Tenacious D-Fan of their first album and heard some tracks from The P.O.D. and was rather disappointed. After watching the movie, my view changed. The movie is pretty funny from beginning to end and found that my self was there, although it was really a stupid act, due to the attitudes that KG and Jaybles make in the film. <br /> <br /> Much more entertaining and entertaining than films I've seen in cinemas lately. Ex. Saw III (boring and sluggish), Casino Royale (Way to Homo-Erotic), which I really enjoyed in previous installments. <br /> <br /> If you've enjoyed Borat, you'll be the story of The Greatest Band enjoy on the earth
