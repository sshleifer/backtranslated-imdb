Shawn Michaels vs. Edge-8- It's hard to believe that Shawn Michaels is in the opening game, but still a great fight between the two men, Edge. Whether you like it or not, is a great performer in the ring, and Shawn Michaels is simply timeless. When it comes to his performance, The Undertaker Vs. Heidenreich. Casket Match-2 OK, after a good kick-off match, now what a crappy match. Undertaker did some great matches at the Royal Rumble, and the 1998 Royal Rumble against Shawn Michaels was the same kind of match, but that's a lot worse than this match. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. Bradshaw. Triple Threat WWE Championship-6- It's alright, I think all three men did a better job, they really did not show it at their best. <br /> <br /> Randy Orton vs. Triple H. World Heavyweight Championship 9- Triple H wins a clear victory. Can you believe it? Sure, he gets the sledgehammer out, but does not use it. Randy Orton was great when he pretended to have a concussion, but the way he got the concussion is really ridiculous. I really liked this match, this was the best performance I've seen from HHH for a long time. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble Match-7 - This was very entertaining and I usually do not get a royal rumble match that high. The winner is again very predictable, but just this had many moments that were very entertaining to see. The segments with Flair and Guerrero are the best segments I've seen in a long time, this is a great PPV and a must have for wrestling fans.
