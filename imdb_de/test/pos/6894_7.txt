A tomb raider sits in his cell waiting for his execution. A monk visits him to suppress his last words for posterity and as a warning to the terrible life he leads. At first, the young tomb raider hesitates, but his tongue is loosened by drinking, and tells of his story, which is full of dead, undead, and things that come in the night. The New York horror movie horror movie (shot in part on Staten Island and undoubtedly the ghost of Andy Milligan) is one of the better horror comedies that has been around for some time. This is an often very funny movie that expresses its story in every way. The cast is first class. Dominic Monaghan plays Arthur Blake, the tomb robber, who tells his story. Ron Perlman is Father Duffy, the monk who takes the testimony and perhaps interferes too much in the story. Both men clearly have a great old time and it shows. The rest of the cast is just as good. The music of Jeff Grace is excellent. The effects are perfect for this kind of scary stupidity. The movie is a lot of fun. If there are problems with the movie, it may be that he throws his net a little far, because the result far too much happens. I do not want to give away too much, but I do not think we needed the alien body in the mix. Still, this is a lot of fun, and I'm pretty sure I'll show up at the IFC in the theaters I saw for the first time, and I'm sure I'll pick up the DVD. > <br /> worth a look.
