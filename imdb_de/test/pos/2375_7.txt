The robots are actually called "replicants", a reference to Dicks Blade Runner (several visual allusions to the film are also found) and the villain is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with restricting reproduction by using a compulsory drug for "heterosexual" love is fleeting and homosexual love is eternal ".... Fighting struggles follow, a premiere for the dead or living movies.The funny highlight is that the two leads become a winged robot with a huge phallus for a head Their individual mind and later literal heads act as testicles, ending with the mayor playing his free-jazz boy Lakey as the robot seems to be one The wall around them ruptures, the last words of the mayor "Oh f * &%", followed by a quick fade in black.
