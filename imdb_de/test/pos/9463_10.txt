OK, now I thought at first that this would be another kitschy romantic comedy holding back the comedy, but that was not it. I mean, how could it have been with the fabulous Amanda Bynes staring at it! She was amazing, very funny and is still amazing! The guys were also extremely fit, a major reason for becoming girls! The plot is heavily based on the Shakespeare play 'Twelfth Night', since it was extremely similar. There was even a spider called Malvolio, which belonged to the malvolio-like character. The script was really well written and pulled together and it was very funny. The football arts were fantastic too, I even thought of playing football myself! All in all, this is a carefree movie about young romance that gets very confusing! Go and see it!
