Prue and Piper bring dr. Griffiths home to save him from the assassin of the sauce Shax. While Phoebe is searching for Shadow's book after defeating the demon, Prue and Piper fight in the street and chase Shax down the street to destroy him. However, they are shown and exposed as witches live in the television news. They become a national sensation with a crowd in front of their house. Phoebe trusts in Cole and goes to the underworld with Leo to ask him to summon Tempus and reverse time, while a fanatical woman shoots Piper, who dies. The source suggests that Phoebe stay with him, and in return he would save her sister. Phoebe accepts the deal, and the time is reset to the moment when Shax Prue, Piper and Dr. Griffits attacks. <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a good but incoherent episode. Why should The Source, after Piper dies dead and The Power of Three be destroyed, turn back time to save her? But this dramatic show is certainly one of the best of the third season and lets the audience anxiously wait for the next episode. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Voltando no Tempo" ("Back in time")
