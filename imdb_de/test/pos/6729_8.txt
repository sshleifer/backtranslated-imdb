I remember seeing it as a kid on CBBC as part of the Children's Movie Foundations Friday Film Specials and recently found a copy. <br /> <br /> In the approximately twenty years since I last saw this movie, nothing has been lost. <br /> <br /> It's an atmospheric story that entices with Cornish folklore and adds elements of truly spooky images of the mind of young miner Billy. <br /> <br /> Shot in the beautiful countryside Port Loe Harbor in Cornwall uses the mix of rugged coastline and deserted tin mines to make the area truly believable. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of stuff in this CFF drama, something that has been lost to children's television today and today. It's worth taking a look if you can find a copy.
