Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. What else can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet who has ever adorned the stage and captures every inch of the character. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is well represented and presented. Some people have complained about their age, but you honestly can not say it when you look at the movie. If anything, he looks drastically younger than 40. I just wish it had been found a worthier Ophelia. Her acting is passable, but she does not look that way. The only really extraordinary performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, a great Claudius. The rest of the cast is good, but Jacobi is what really enhances this televised game.
