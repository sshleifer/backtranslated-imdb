Altman and Scorsese have sexed together in one of the biggest American films of the last 20 years. Boogie Nights has not caused much of a stir, and I still do not think it has received the recognition it deserves. The immediate noise around the movie ("Some Porn Movies with Marky Mark") was completely unfounded. What Paul Thomas Anderson created is nothing short of an impressive portrayal of the persecution and subsequent loss of the American dream (if there is one). For those of you who have lived in an American community box (or confessional) for the last 8 years, Boogie Nights tells the literal rise and fall story of young Eddie Adams (Wahlberg). Eddie is just a stupid kid from Torrance, California, who wants something more out of life. His room is soaked in muscular, naive Americana. His dreams are much bigger than his potential, but not quite as big as his ... special gift. His bald-headed southern gentleman quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming, ubiquitous adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds as the daddy with the movie's sparkling eyes) gets wind of Eddie's hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie. Before you can say, "Deep Throat", Eddie changed his name to Dirk Diggler and made his massive member known to a wide-eyed audience. Fame and fortune make Dirk famous, as does a crush of local porn celebrities. His friends and colleagues are becoming his provisional family, but it's soon becoming a Sunday picnic like no other. When the feel-good 70's give way to the coke-addicted, video-friendly 80s, Dirk & Co. begins a dangerous relapse. <br /> <br /> Anderson put everything he had in this glorious, moving epic. It never sizzles and sizzles. Hardly a frame of this monumental image is wasted, and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after ELO has strayed from the soundtrack. Look at this immediately. And then look at it again. <br /> <br /> And again.
