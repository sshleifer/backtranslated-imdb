Recap: Based on the true story of Charlie Wilson, an American congressman who (according to this film) was involved in the stealthy US war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Comments: A pretty funny movie about not so funny stuff, especially since they were real. Hanks, however, focuses on the film and can very well assert himself as a vicious congressman with a good heart that will win the covert war in Afghanistan. Hanks and especially the entire movie, Philip Seymor Hoffman, has a rather humorous tone. So much that it would be appropriate to add comedy to the genre. But the story she tells, and perhaps the end of it, is indeed serious. <br /> <br /> A story about what happened, with some questions about what might have been. So the movie works as a comedy if you want one, and a much more serious one if you want one. Something for everyone 7/10
