This BBC series is amazingly fun. I had only seen a few minutes before I knew I had to afford it and have to look at it with all my friends again. I would not recommend that to anyone, but almost everyone else will enjoy it - from cinema to entertaining masses. The main character is a lesbian, but it's still worth watching if that's not your thing. Rachael Stirling is incredible in her lead role, which leads her to a dazzling array of emotions and sometimes bizarre situations of nature. No one who has seen this series would ever say that she can not act. It makes us laugh, weep, is struck and beats us in the forehead in astonishment. <br /> <br /> You can not really compare this story to anything else. It is not a work-up of style or action. It is entirely his own beast-part comedy, historical drama, erotic, comic-of-age story, musical and more. <br /> <br /> Must praise the BBC for making this story. I can not imagine anyone in the (overly prude and formulaic) US ever did it. So stop reading and go.
