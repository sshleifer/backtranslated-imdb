I love this movie!! Maybe it's my generation, but I can really connect with what he talks about and what he wants to do. it made me laugh all the time. Duration of the movie, the next day and beyond. I think this movie is not one you can look at, focusing mainly on plot and character development. This movie is pretty much just for the generation that will understand it. There are many things that you know are brought up in this generation that you would not be if you said 40. I think Sacha Barren Cohen was very good and I mean very well. He is a genius. And the reason he's such an idiot is because he can get people interested in idiots while making fun of them !! Very good movie. strongly recommend !!!! (not so strong if you are over 30)
