If you are looking for a movie with fantastic music, beautiful instrumentation and an action that is not difficult to understand; FAME is for you. <br /> <br /> I have several scenes that I love in this movie. Some make you laugh, others make you thoughtful. The editing is wonderful in my opinion, very fast and often funny. Sure, maybe the whole thing would have had more potential, all the stories are somehow on the surface; Maybe a bit too many characters are involved. But I do not care, because the real stars are ... <br /> <br /> ... the musical scenes! One of my favorites: the hot lunch jam sequence. This piece is just so rough, funky and filmed in a special way (hand-camera style in "Music-Hell-Break-Loose"), it's just electrifying! I miss this raw energy in today's music clips. The only similar energy I might have found in Bette Midler's "The Rose", the whole concert material. It's about catching something "wild" that is "really" happening and not doing it perfectly. take by take. <br /> <br /> FAME is a wonderful nostalgic journey to synthesizers where heavy and walkmans are not available. I recommend it once a year; certainly not for everyone.
