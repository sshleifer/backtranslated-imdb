These films have made me suffer and I loved it! I loved it! It haunted me for days. I think Erika is the kind of character you both hate and moan at the same time. The most horrible sex scene ever caught in the movie. This is the best of Hanekes previous work. He is the only living director who has been redefining the pace since Kubrick. The violence in this movie is beautiful. In short, the movie is about self-hatred. In one sentence, the film is about finding love, not hate anymore, and finding that this is a hopeless hope.
