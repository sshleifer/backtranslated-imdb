The main reason for viewing this image is the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson. Ms. Merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as a nanny, the woman who believes in doing good, no matter to whom, without any restrictions. This actress clearly shows a range that is amazing. <br /> <br /> Thanks to director George Wolf, who brought together this outstanding cast of some of the best black Americans. This ensemble group, under its close management, creates the right atmosphere in which the action takes place. Of course all this would not have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson had not written his wonderful piece. Working with Mr. Wolf, perhaps the best theater director of this generation, they have opened the play so that it evokes a not too distant past in which a child lives under the influence of Mrs. Crosby and his own parents are not there for him take care Mrs. Crosby becomes the revering mother of little Ruben; In a way, he represents her reward because he has lost his own daughter. Unfortunately, there is no time to develop some of the characters as the action focuses solely on improving the relationship between Nanny and the adolescent Ruben, played by the young Marcus Carl Franklin, who is a natural is. The only thing that could have happened otherwise was the voice over narrative, which is sometimes intrusive because it does not clarify or justify what you see. Honestly, just by watching the interaction of the players, that's self-explanatory. <br /> <br /> There is always music in the background. No matter in which difficult times these people go through, but Nanny's house is full of laughter and the wonderful music that puts us back in time. <br /> <br /> Apart from Ms. Merkerson, other notable performances are given by Terrence Dashon Howard, one of the up-and-coming stars of the moment. Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Marcy Gray, Louis Gossett Jr., Delroy Lindo, Rosie Perez, Carmen Ejogo, Jimmy Smits and the rest. <br /> <br /> Mrs. S. Ephata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience to become. In "Lackawanna Blues" she shows clearly that she can do anything she wants, because of her enormous talent and charisma.
