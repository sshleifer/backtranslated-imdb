The Kite Runner should win an Oscar! It's perfect in every way, the story, the script, the acting, the cinematography ... You would never guess it was made in China. The story of two childhood friends and what follows in their adult lives will leave a lasting impression. The portrayal of life in Afghanistan under the Taliban is all too real and terrible. I did not read the book, but I saw comments that disturbed the movie because "the book is always better" ... It does not matter. No one put down "Gone With The Wind" because it did not fit the book! It was even awarded the Oscar for Best Picture and several other Oscars. I think this movie is brilliant - BRAVO for the author and director and the actors!
