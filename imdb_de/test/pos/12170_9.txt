These three directors are on their way to a good start. The three stories are remarkably well done for independent productions and catch the traumatic feelings of "coming out" if you are not sure if this is a good idea. I laughed at those veiled glances in the locker room of Pool Days; I smiled at the notion that fans of Bette Midler, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand are considered gay in "A Friend of Dorothy" (ie searching the CD music shelves); and I writhed in "The Disco Years" about the "Jock", whose memory of sweet sex was now "blurred" by alcohol. It all seemed so real. I am looking forward to further offers from these three directors.
