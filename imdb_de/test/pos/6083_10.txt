I saw this movie when it was released, and when I was young and not too much for the movies, this was one of the most mesmerizing movie experiences I've ever done, and it really left an impression on me. At first I did not quite understand the story. Probably it was not possible to create the necessary correlations between past and present as the film presents them to the viewer. <br /> <br /> years after I first saw it, I managed to see it again and that was the time I fell in love with "The English Patient", it touched me so deeply and for It made me the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Anthony Minghella made an absolutely breathtaking film, all the places are fantastic and through his camera he manages to create incredible emotions in you. <br /> <br /> Of course, the music of the movie is so much of the characters' entire emotional journey, and the movie would not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> But personally the best thing was the fragile performance that Ralph Fiennes gave in th is a masterpiece. He plays the man so slowly, but so deeply in love with Katherine Clifton, so well, opens his heart and plunges into this forbidden matter. <br /> <br /> The most heartbreaking scene for me will always be the one where Katherine is hurt by Almasy to the swimmer's lair and she is wearing the thimble he bought her. She says, "I've always worn her, I've always loved you," and at that moment he starts to cry, and the pain comes out of him. <br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserves the Oscar she won. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that everyone who calls himself a movie lover should see in his movie.
