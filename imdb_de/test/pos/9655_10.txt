This is a great movie you absolutely must have. I liked every aspect of it, from swordplay to romance, the costumes were really well made and put together. The landscape is absolutely beautiful. I also loved the mystery and the magic. Even the message of the power of love, this love, is the greatest power there is. I really like the king's heart in the sense that he wants peace instead of bloodshed and hatred. I wish I could live in the sky with flying ships and castles in such a world. I also like how they brought the animals into the movie. I also thought that the chef is really funny. I have seen it many times in one day and am still tired of it. I only wish they would put it on a DVD.
