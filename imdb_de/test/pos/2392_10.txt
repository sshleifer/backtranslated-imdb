I have been writing tough crime thrillers for several years. When an author develops a story, he always has a character / actor in mind to bring the story to life. Last weekend I found a new one in Paul Vario when I played Uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe. This was a smooth film highlighted by Vario's presence both on screen and off screen (as his voice-over narrative can also be heard). I also especially liked the actress who played Benny's niece and Eddie's ex-wife, though everyone did a good job in this exciting movie because they played with bad guys and the associated double crossings. An all-round nice job ... and Mr. Vario shone the brightest. He has to be my Tony Gangi someday ...
