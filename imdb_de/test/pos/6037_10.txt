Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes) is an orchestral conductor who has a secret affair with his pianist. When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal, if he does not leave his wife, he has no choice but to murder her and make her look as if she had committed suicide. Too bad for him is our crumpled detective, Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk), in the case. Stephen Bochco has written another razor-sharp episode for the series, which follows amazing details with amazing detail. We watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for twenty-five minutes, and we are fully engrossed. When Columbo shows up, it gets even better. <br /> <br /> We see Columbo after the murder (as usual). This time he is with his new dog at the vet. Scenes of pure comic relief are usually the weakest on the show (think of Columbo's uneasiness about the nude model in "For Framing"). Columbo is funny when he deliberately wavers to stumble in his quarry; but too many writers make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he's with non-suspects. Bochco, on the other hand, shows Columbo a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of unobtrusive scenes that are witty and artfully integrated into the story. (And I'm grateful that he did not campaign for a punchline in Columbus' quest for the name, so far as we learn, the dog remains nameless.) Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode and Peter Falk makes the best of it. He is especially good at a monologue where he disbelieves that anyone could kill himself, let alone this brilliant and beautiful young pianist. In his scenes, he is even better when playing with Cassavete's cat and mouse. It is to be expected that these two longtime friends and coworkers would excellently play each other out. and we get that. Notice how Alex Benedict can not help admiring the deceptively weak Columbo, even though the brilliant detective pulls the noose around his neck. <br /> <br /> Bochco makes the best of every situation in his screenplay. When Columbo questioned Benedict's crafty mechanic, of course? Of course! ?? he asks the man to look at his own pile. And if Benedict finds Columbo before the rehearsal in the Hollywood Bowl, of course? Of course! ?? he plays "Chopsticks" on the piano. And what should our brave lieutenant bring, but the typewriter of the victim with the fake farewell letter still in the role. Columbo also has good scenes with a precocious little girl (Dawn Frame) and pretty Blythe Danner playing Cassavetes wife. It's nice to see that Myrna Loy appears as Danner's mother, although she does little with her supporting role. <br /> <br /> Director Nicholas Colasanto (who also coached Cheers) is a perfect job, although he follows the lead of almost every other "Columbo" director by stealing one or two Adds flourishes. The scenes end with a sharpness progression and begin with the focus. Then is there where Cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped at the scene? and we see an enlarged view of it in his sunglasses. There is also a scene with Myrna Loy and a group of old Fogies, cruelly performed by all but Cassavetes. <br /> <br /> But these are problems. This is a wonderfully entertaining episode that made me a Columbo fan.
