This is one of the best films of the French Revolution ever produced. I was a person who knew very well during that time, and I was astonished on the detail level. The costumes are just right. Even the detailed little everyday objects like ink tanks, serving plates, etc. are perfect. As an American living in France, who has access to the places in the film through his membership in various historical associations such as the Napoleonic Alliance, I can not say how impressed I was with the visual accuracy of the film. </ Br> /> The well-known dialogue is a virtual quote and the unrecorded location has its character. I was very happy with this movie and am disappointed that it does not yet appear on DVD. So should historical drama be made. Worth seeing....
