For people who are working in filmmaking for the first time, I think they did an excellent job !! We have to support the emerging industry, especially from the north. It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and a lot of laughter. It's a feel-good movie and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema! It has Nordic humor and is positive about the community it represents. The movie has just been opened, I hope it's alright - people should support this little movie. I think this "vinny ..." person is very bitter about something! And too personal? Shame!! I tell all participants that they were well done. I look forward to seeing you next.
