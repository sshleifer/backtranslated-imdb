I decided to write a commentary on this amazing movie because it is quoted on IMDb that John Woo, a mediocre director who has made some decent movies in his pre-American years, has his reputation in the USA for his recent work completely ruined films produced. plans to redo it. Well, there are a few reasons why it's one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever: the plot of the movie is simple and even clich√© by today's standards, but what makes the movie a masterpiece is the four main portrayals , unique director at Mellville, cinematography, music and her style. There is no way a director can make such a movie today. It's impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today's box office movie business. <br /> <br /> John Woo shot a more or less decent movie that was borrowed from Melville's Le Samourai - The Killer, but remember, the movie was made when the director was not hit by big budgets and expensive (in Salaries) expensive, but spoiled became cheap (in acting) actors. So I say that this is one of the greatest movies ever made, along with another film by Melville - Le Samourai. Look at it. And even if the remake is done, try to avoid it before you see the big original first.
