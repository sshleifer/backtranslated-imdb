I've read viciously hidden commentary on a previous commentary that said this movie showed a bunch of gay guys hanging around their gays. <br /> <br /> This could not be more misleading. "Eighteen" is not a gay movie. It has only three gay characters, and one of them is the victim of prejudice against people like the one who wrote the comments, despite his commitment to fairness. Pip's grandfather was not gay. The tender scene of the soldier and his sergeant is a male bond at the crucial moment of death. Some people are appalled by a kiss and a welcome scene in which a man is killed by a bomb. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is on the direct relationship between Pip and the sweet girl and her opposite social commitment and parenting. <br /> <br /> Ralph Rewes www.r1313.info
