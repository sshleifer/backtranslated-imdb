My introduction to a lifelong love for Shakespeare. My brother was 5 and I was not quite 7 when WTTW sent Chicago to Age of Kings. It became a family ritual, including repetitions. As an autumn series, my dad bought us a rare treat for the Midwest - pomegranates; and my mother slammed corn on the stove. Wonderful acting of actors whose name meant nothing to me then (though I will never forget the terribly young Sean Connery as a hotspot), but do it now! And they published the scripts as paperback so we could understand the language. I managed to memorize most of Richard III. So glad that it comes out on DVD! Highly recommended for any age and degree of familiarity with Shakespeare or English history.
