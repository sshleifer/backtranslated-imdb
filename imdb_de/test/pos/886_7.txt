After seeing a preview of this movie in my mall, where there is a booth to buy foreign films, I found it very entertaining. Before I saw the movie, I went to the IMDb to see what reviews and comments he had received. I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. Despite the hype, I watched movies and to my surprise, I found that incredible. <br /> <br /> The story was great (just paying attention) and the characters and their relationships within the movie are amazing. I have not seen such a good combination of main characters for a long time. I really felt for both characters and felt a strong bond. Since I've read in previous posts that this film is not "epic" enough or lacking martial arts, I could not argue anymore. This movie is what it is, it's not Braveheart and not Enter the Dragon, but it's still a wonderful movie that combines great work and action and action combined. <br /> <br /> While Sword In The Moon is not so perfect (which movie is it?) it's still wonderful and moving. Just wait until the final scene, with music and cinematography together, it's breathtaking. I just hope more people can watch this movie for a fair vote.
