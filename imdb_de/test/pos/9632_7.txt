Man, I think people forgot how to watch a movie. Everyone considers them a critic. They comment on things that the average moviegoer does not know or think about. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie. It was what I expected, so I was not disappointed. Steven gets a bad rap if he puts his views in his films, but that's also a reason to watch. Even funnier are the people who complain about his films, say he's the worst and we should not watch his films, but still watch his films. Everyone can comment on how bad they are. Who is the dummy? If you do not like his work, do not watch. Then you do not have to undergo this supposedly painful event. <br /> <br /> Stop comparing movies with other movies and watch a movie one by one, and you can enjoy movies again.
