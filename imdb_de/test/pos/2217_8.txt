"Half Empty" is a hilarious musical about the eternal optimist. In this case, it is a self-help book-writer who erroneously thinks he is popular there. Instead of an admirable audience, he finds himself in a world of worn-out misanthropy, including the woman who is supposed to be his publicist. His attempts to find friends in largely improvised scenes lead to a great encounter after another, when he is verbally abused by nihilistic musicians, gruff gangsters, etc. Heart and mind - but his own worldview shakes when it turns out to be his Hero, a much more popular self-help writer, is not what he seems. The action is interrupted by several music numbers. <br /> <br /> We saw this at the DeadCenter Film Festival in Oklahoma City and loved it. This is a really fun, inspired, little indie production. You might argue about a few technical things (like the lighting that's a bit dark), but the piece is funny and inspiring enough that you do not care too much about it. If Voltaire wrote "Candide" today, the character would be a self-help writer.
