"Nagisa no Shindobaddo" or "Like Grains of Sand" is a stunningly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls who deal with the state of oneness with who they are. This movie is not about homosexuality, but it's about sexuality. <br /> <br /> Aihara, a distanced girl, will definitely make the viewer think about who is behind the distanced girl. Does she love Yoshida? Or does she love ito? Or has she somehow turned into a lesbian because of the "incident"? (I doubt it). <br /> <br /> And what about Yoshida? Does he realize that he loves Ito in the end? We all know that he loves him as a friend. But you'll never know when you'll see this movie ... haha ​​:) In the end, Aihara (along with Ito) delivers an extraordinary message to the audience: which means that it does NOT matter if you have a boy or a boy Love girls. And I have to tell you, I'm so tight that I did not understand it at first. ^^ ;; It's not talking scenes because of the whole thing ... You have to try to understand what the characters think and say through their actions and NOT by what they say (especially the last part ... Phew, boy, that was confusing! ) It's a confusing story, but it's still nice. :) This movie is certainly one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen (and trust me, I've seen a lot).
