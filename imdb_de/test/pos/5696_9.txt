While many people found this movie too slow and too simple, I was really into it. There is no conspiracy as such, but the film is a human survival story about three people who have trapped a tree, with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought Acting was usually very good, although the roles were sometimes quite exhausting, and I felt a sense of warmth for the characters. The situation they were in was pretty scary and I was really nervous for them. I found the whole movie quite nerve-racking because of the sheer helplessness of his situation and the constant threat to her survival. <br /> <br /> The crocodile effects have been handled surprisingly well for such a low-budget movie, and believe me: I've seen my fair share of dodgy Croc movies. The creature was moving well and had a real threat, and although the audience I worked with did not seem too much for the movie, they kept jerking and snapping when the crocodile appeared. <br /> <br /> Script-wise I would have made a few changes towards the end, but that was not a big deal. For fans of the slow-burning horror that is in reality, this will be a compelling film, but unfortunately I think that for many viewers looking for a thrilling ride and higher production values ​​from their cinematic experience, the point is simply overlooked.
