I saw this for the first time with my girlfriend on the big screen. It was a fun game with cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover and, as I recall, in the middle fold. She is really cute and cheeky and has a lot of charm. The movie made me see more of her, so I looked for other things. She is in Steven Spielberg's "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and Barbara Streisand's "The Main Event" and Bill Murray's "Meatballs" as well as many TV shows such as Night Court and TV movies. Me and my friends really enjoy them. But in her starring role in Alice in Wonderland, the focus is right where she should be, right on Kristine as the center of attention, probably the prettiest, hottest girl I've ever seen in movies.
