Five medical students (Kevin Bacon, David Labraccio, William Baldwin, Dr. Joe Hurley, Oliver Platt, Randy Steckle, Julia Roberts, Dr. Rachel Mannus, Kiefer Sutherland, Nelson) are experimenting with secret experiences near death and post-life life for medical and personal education. Gradually every heart of a medical student is stopped and then revived. <br /> <br /> Among the passing deaths, everyone experiences bizarre visions, including forgotten childhood memories. Their flashbacks are like nightmares of children. The revived students are disturbed when they remember the remorse they have committed or committed against them. When they experience life after death, they bring real experiences back to the present. As they continue to experiment, their memories intensify dramatically; so much, some are physically overcome. Therefore, they investigate and transcend deeper into the experiences after death after trying to find a cure. <br /> <br /> Although the DVD was released in 2007, this movie was released in 1990. Therefore, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland were in the early stages of their adult career. Apart from the fact that the plot is extremely intriguing, the suspense leads to a dramatic climax, and the script is tight and compelling, all young actors make flatliners, which is now an all-star cult semi-sci-fi suspense , Who knew 17 years ago that the film career of this young actor group would skyrocket? I suspect that director Joel Schumacher has done it.
