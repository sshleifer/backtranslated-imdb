This movie was really well written and was very entertaining. Luke Perry has done a very convincing job. (as he always does) If you are looking for an eventful movie that can be viewed, it should be at the top of your list. There is a mix of comedy, drama and action. You can literally feel what the actors feel at points. I was very impressed by this movie. The special effects were done very well. The whole movie was very convincing. This movie is one of my favorites. What has happened, North America could be torn apart and Jack and his team must try to stop an outbreak by destroying North America. It was a very cool and creative idea. I loved this movie and I know that you will too.
