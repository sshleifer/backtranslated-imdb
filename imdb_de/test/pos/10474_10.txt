A gentle story of anger, with a redemptive message and a glorious celebration. The photography is wonderfully executed. Cinematographers look at this type of film to improve their craft not just on what the eye can do to improve a story, but also what the right camera vocabulary can do to enhance an emotion. By definition, feeding the soul is what this film is about, but with an elegance and grace that does not happen that much, at least with that degree of taste, restraint and finesse. If you are interested in the development of stories and characters, this is also a great movie that serves as an example of how simple lines and the right delivery can completely fill the sense of a character. Combine all this with a film score that is almost minimalist in character and perfectly designed, and you will "get" that film.
