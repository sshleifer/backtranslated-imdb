There are other movies about boarding schools and the antics of the students and staff, but "The Bells of St. Trinian's" towers over them all! The plot was summarized in detail by other posters, so I do not describe the same floor. I just want to say that it is a pity that it FINALLY appears on DVD, but in a format that can not be used in the US! :-( <br /> <br /> Have fun, dear fans in New Zealand and Australia, and if anyone reading this has any incentive, PLEASE help publish it on DVD with Region 1 encoding! -Mail be notified if (I do not say "if") it is released on DVD in the United States? Thanks a lot!
