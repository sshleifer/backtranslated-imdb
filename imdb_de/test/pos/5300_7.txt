Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gone No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea), is a wonderful fun and imaginative childhood look. In a time when it seems that the film animation was dominated by Disney / Pixar CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and reassuring to know that Miyazaki still relies on traditional hand-drawn animations to add to his charming and enchanting stories tell. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the friendship between a magical sea spirit / goldfish and the human child she encounters on a curious excursion into the human world. The human child Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in southern Japan (on Seto Island), where he lives with his young mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko). Sosuke calls the strange goldfish "Ponyo" and takes him to the daycare center where Lisa works. Definitely not a typical goldfish, Ponyo begins to adapt quickly and take on human aspects (she develops human language and an appetite for ham meat) by taking blood from a cut on Sosuke's finger. <br /> <br /> But just as Sosuke and Ponyo form a connection, Ponyo is being withdrawn by her father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who is a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now trying to gather and develop magical elixirs from the sea that help him to repair and rejuvenate the oceans of the world. <br /> <br /> Ponyo's desire to become human has grown so strong that Fujimoto can no longer handle her more human appearance and freed herself from her home in the water world and goes back to Sosuke. <br /> <br /> During her outburst, Ponyo unintentionally releases Fujimoto's magical elixirs that unleash all sorts of magical marine life that causes a violent storm in the seas around Sosuke's town. Desperate to dissolve Ponyo's rebellion, he soon calls on the help of his beautiful wife, Ponyo's mother, the water elemental mother / woman of the sea (Amami Yuki). <br /> <br /> As in his latest films, Miyazaki's "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" touches on various ecology and environmental issues, focusing on the health and vitality of the oceans. The opening sequence is sometimes sobering as Ponyo encounters a murderous ship scraping the bottom of the sea and exposing mountains of garbage and debris. One can understand the anger and frustration of the character of Fujimoto, who has spent his entire life trying to repair the damage that civilization is inflicting on his oceans and yet is a frightening and almost fruitless endeavor for him. Enough not to be said of the remarkable animation in this movie. It is sometimes bizarre and outrageous, but at the same time charming and curious. Miyazaki clearly wanted to capture the meaning and style of a child's imagination. The art style has the look of crayon / pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and imaginative. It's almost as if a color book of a child is brought to life. <br /> <br /> The children actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do a great job as Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring delightful charm into their roles. In particular, Nara Yuria sounds as cute as Ponyo, that it's no wonder that Doi's Sosuke falls in love with the magical girl. The former campaign girl and actress Yamaguchi Tomoko (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail) is also very good in her role as the modern mother of Sosuke, Lisa. At first I was a little confused by her character when I first thought she was Sosuke's older sister. It did not help that Sosuke always referred to her as "Lisa" and not as a mother, but I think it may be a sign of the times and an indication of the modern Japanese family (in the anime series Crayon Shinchan, Shinnosuke points to this as well ) his mother also by the first name). <br /> <br /> The 80s comedian Tokoro Joji sounds completely different from the serious Fujimoto, but makes wisely what does not make his character look like a villainous or stupid threat. While we no longer get to know his character, former professional baseball player and actor Nagashima Kazushige (who represents Sosuke's father Koichi) also does some good language work. The opening theme "Umi No Okasan" by Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is just beautiful and captivating. In contrast, the theme "Geke No Ue No Ponyo" by Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi is bright and amusing and reminiscent of a traditional Japanese nursery rhyme. During a brilliant sequence, the soundtrack assumes an almost Wagnerian operatic sound with music that sounds like "The Valkyrie". <br /> <br /> However, the film is not perfect and suffers from moments in which the central story of Ponyo and Sosuke plays takes some of Miyazaki's overwhelming fantastic images into the background. I also wished that we had more time to explore Fujimoto's backstory and the relationship between Sosuke and his father. <br /> <br /> Like "Kiki's Delivery / Majo No Takkyubin", "Howl's Moving Castle", "Princess Momonoke / Momonoke Hime" and "My Neighbor Totoro / Tonari No Totoro", "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" Another Miyazaki classic, which is a wonderful eye candy. Like a modern fairy tale, the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be appreciated in the coming years.
