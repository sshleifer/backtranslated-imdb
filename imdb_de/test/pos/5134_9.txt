In Hoot, Mullet Fingers takes part in sabotage to stop the pancake house. The problem is that construction workers start all over again and they have to take more drastic measures. When confronted with the dogs, he scares them with snakes, not before he is bitten by a dog and has to go to the hospital. <br /> <br /> Before bed, Roy asks his father, who works with the Department of Justice, how to deal with crooks. His father says that it is the tedious steps of copying papers, because sooner or later they all slip off. You can see that with Enron and WorldCom. Roy looks at documents pertaining to the pancake house and finds a suppressed document (he has to get into the trailer of the company). If the police see it, he has the law on his side. Unlike the circumvention of the police. As you've already mentioned, Roy is not always law-abiding, and if the man kills owls (illegal) in the company, Mullet Fingers takes direct action. He can not wait for the law (Mullet Fingers is hiding). The film suggests that one should work in the system.
