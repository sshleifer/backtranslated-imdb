Bridge's drama about a reporter who discovers some deficiencies in a nuclear power plant's safety precautions is well-directed and a rather interesting late-'70s film. It's not amazing, but solid, the acting is pretty good, especially Jack Lemmon, but Douglas and Fonda were good too. It was a pretty good script and Bridge's direction was solid and fitting. This is definitely not one of the best movies of the 70s, but it is one of the better ones. A good early Michael Douglas movie and Lemmon in his prime
