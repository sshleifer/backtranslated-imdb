from Adam's apple and with your permission. I did not know until I looked up. Also the errrrrrrrmmmmm 'Wilbur wants to kill himself' I prefer this very focused Deadpan ... drama about Adam's apple over the comic zeal. But With Your Permission is much more layered and subtle, but that's another director. As soon as the 'meaty' part of the story takes place, I was scared to return to the store again and again. A bit claustrophobic ... maybe that's what it's meant to be. It builds on the atmosphere. You are afraid of rediscovery and again and again until 'kick in the shin'. <br /> <br /> that's a weird stuff.
