The curse of the monkey island. Exactly six years after the success of Monkey Island 2 released. With the comic ending of Monkey Island 2, one would think that it would end Monkey Island once and for all. But it turned out to be a trick to lure Guybrush into captivity. But enough of that, the whole thing is that Monkey Island has returned and the voices are just phenomenal. If LucasArts from Monkey Island did a movie, it would probably look and sound like that. The plot is really good and everything about it is just great. If you have not heard anything yet about the Monkey Island series, buy the Monkey Island Archives or the Monkey Island Booty Pack and play all the games, starting with The Secret of Monkey Island, then Monkey Island 2 and The Curse of Monkey Island , Monkey Island 4 was really good, but it towers above all.
