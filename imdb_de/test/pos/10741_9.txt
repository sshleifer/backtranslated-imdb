This outstanding film offers the best acting you'll ever see, and that alone makes it a must. The entire cast is excellent, but it also needed to keep up with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. It did not take long for me to get hooked on this movie, and apart from a court scene that's only good, this is top notch entertainment. This is a rare movie that actually deserves the Oscar recognition it received. Convince yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed.
