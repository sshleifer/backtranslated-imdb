I was born in Beijing, China, and moved to the United States at the age of 9. I have been to Beijing several times since then and have loved it every time. I love the people and the ambience they bring to the city. "You hau hao hao shuo" (what more exactly to "if you have something to say, say it beautiful") captures this feeling of Beijing in a delightful and truthful way. I suppose you must have lived in Beijing and its people to get the most out of this movie, even if you could enjoy it anyway. <br /> <br />> The story is not complicated, deliberately kind of weird and captivating. I will let it unfold itself and not say too much to you except a few comments. Every detail, from the pictures on the wall, to the decorations, the streets and restaurants, looks like home. (Zhang Yimou probably shot everything "on the spot"). But more importantly, the characters - our "hero", the girl, the kind-hearted but unfortunate "laptop-man" and the owner of the nightclub are each born in Beijing and are adorable in their different ways. Their conversations capture the essence of each character. The story, which is mainly determined by situations and conversations (except for the brilliant Bafoonery degree), is intriguing and always interesting. <br /> <br />> I'm 21 years old now. My parents and I love this movie. We are always amazed at Zhang Yimou's ability to transform ordinary people into believable screen characters and everyday life into extraordinary situations. <br /> <br /> "stay cool" - different. hilarious.
