Ninja Hunter (also known as Wu Tang vs Ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish due to his vile characters, nonsensical plot, and lack of any claims. The creators of this film have given us a true OTT masterpiece that must have been seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Wu Tang villains, Abbot White, who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and wants to be superior martial artists. For this purpose, he works with a clan of ninjas, led by three masters. Gold Lamé Ninja, White Mustachioed Ninja and Black Ninja? and he succeeds in destroying the Shaolin Temple and most of its inhabitants. However, there are some survivors. It is their task to pass on the knowledge of the Shaolin Finger Jab to a new generation that must defeat the Ninjas and Abbott White if rest and order are to be restored. Unfortunately, Abbott White is a difficult opponent that can be defeated because he is able to become virtually indestructible by sucking the life force out of hot, naked chicks (an excuse for a welcome, unfounded nudity!) A lot impressive fighting (though some of it has been accelerated), some really amazing outfits (the aforementioned Gold Lamé Ninja, the yin-yang suits of Abbott White, and even some killers wearing swastika tunics), a ninja who is Turning into a flying carpet will turn some cheesy blood into a good measure. And I almost forgot to mention the really impressive eyebrows in this movie? certainly a good reason not to miss this gem.
