Hey man, these films are all about choices. At all times in your life, you have to choose something or it just goes by ... And this movie proves it! Of course, life is not really like a beautiful picture, as shown in this film ... it does not show, but some may believe that too. I try to say that it is full of pain, love and deep lessons in life. Aaron, the Mormon missionary, is the true shepherd who deepens the thing deep in Chisthian, the skin sensation ... <br /> <br /> It's a great ending and you always believe in fate because it will surprise you a round or another of your live like Latter Days ... <br /> <br /> Great thing, look at it !!!
