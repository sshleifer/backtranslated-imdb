When Patricia Newell is attacked after her cousin's murder, Detective Carrella searches the city for her killer. If the killer is identified after an intense persecution, Patricia is sent to relatives in the country "Blood Relatives" is an overlooked masterpiece. Donald Sutherland plays a policeman and it's nice to see Donald Pleasance as a child molester in a small role. The conclusion is pretty disturbing horror movie, so fans of gore will be disappointed. A must for fans of old-fashioned mystery movies.9 out of 10.
