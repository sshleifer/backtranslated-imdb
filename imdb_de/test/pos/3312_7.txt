Although outdated, this movie is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened, and it changed my life ... I just had to live in New York. It offers great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis surrender "Romance is still ... the best of everything ..." competing with those of West Side Story. There's a pretty stilted performance from the world's first REAL supermodel Suzy Parker (sorry, Janice D.), but it's a great eye-catcher! It also offers an insight into the American customs of the late fifties - our obsession with (and oppression of) sex (at work, not less!), Romance, and marriage before women's rights. It's a time when New York was at its best and a bitchy performance by Joan Crawford is just the icing on the cake.
