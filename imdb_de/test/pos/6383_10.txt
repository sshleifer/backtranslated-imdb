This movie has rocked !!!! A few weeks ago, a screener saw it. Somehow a strange story in which James Franco plays this idiot, who marries Sienna Miller to leave the country, and they go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. I do not want to give it away because the movie is not released yet, but it's totally cool and you would never expect that to happen. I somehow thought I hated it because it's a romance, but it's kind of twisted and stuff I like a lot. Acting is really good and Sienna Miller totally smokes and plays this really cute girl. I think she should do more roles like that. James makes a fool, but in the end you like him and the end of the movie is really good. David Carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. I gave this movie a 10 because I really liked the movie and wanted to see it again, which I did not expect and my girlfriend really liked it and cried. good date strip
