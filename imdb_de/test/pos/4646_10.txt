This movie is typical for the early eighties as well as for fun !! I remember watching this movie on HBO when I was little, and it was my favorite movie. Since I was a while ago, nobody I ever met knew what it was. About the time my roommate had said she had seen it too, and that it was her favorite, they started printing it again !! Luckily I have a copy now !! If anyone wants to see the biggest (cheesy) scavenger hunt, which were probably the first ideas on how to comfort Frats, then this movie is !!! (Watcher - must have a serious love for cheesy movies of the 80s !!)
