I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It offers updates of technical news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official channels of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamer or something really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely improved their game since the reviewer under me (2006). It is the only place where I get my technical information. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work wonderfully together and the show always has segments that relate to things in the game, movie, comic, etc. If you know these universes, you will understand the jokes. Long story short, aots is a funny show that teaches me and everyone the news of everything and everything that matters to you. I'm watching it as I type this, they're in San Diego to hold the Red Bull Races. Sweet.
