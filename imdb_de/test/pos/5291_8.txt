Like the five-year-old protagonist of his newest opus, Hayao Miyazaki's "Ponyo" enchants with his unbridled innocence, as if the anime master himself had become a child by developing a narrative that delights in its simplicity while radiating contagious charm. Miyazaki remembers his earlier works and paints a colorful world that is obviously aimed at the younger audience, and the raw effervescence removes the grim thematic elements that characterize his immediate predecessors. Ponyo (affectionately voiced by Yuria) Nara), a fish with the face of a young girl (she looks like a cuddly child in a pink overgrown Halloween costume) flees from her underwater house and her sister school to explore the surface. Stranded ashore, she is rescued by Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), a five-year-old boy who lives with his mother Risa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) in a house on the nearby cliff. This initial encounter, and ultimately friendship, has a profound impact on Ponyo, who now wants to become human. By accidentally losing the balance of nature and unleashing a whirlwind in the countryside. With Sosukes help, Ponyo has to pass a test to lift this curse and become completely human. Despite the conspiracy, the philosophical sophistication of his recent "Spirited Away," "Ponyo," lacks nothing less than an amazing follow-up, characterized by the meticulous attention to detail and masterful balancing of the real and the fantastic as well as the simple pleasures and big fears. It's a straightforward story that, though occasionally stunted by its tendency to move like a toddler, is in tune with her juvenile pedigree to magically delight. "I will protect you," says Sosuke factually, a childlike statement that is not unlike the way Miyazaki decorates his story with artful mind.
