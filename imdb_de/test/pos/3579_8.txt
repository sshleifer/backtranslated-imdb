Blue Planet ... Wow ... where do I start? The years of hard work have paid off, without question one of the best documentary films ever created. <br /> <br /> The sights and sounds of Blue Planet, like most Attenborough stamped documentary films, are rare and not even experienced by most people. That alone should be reason enough to buy this series, especially if you're the curious guy who wants to know if he wants to know. <br /> <br /> Blue Planet, however, is not a perfect documentary. After the third episode, it gets a bit repetitive. How many different marine life can swim, kill, poo, mate, and lay eggs, and do all these ways really need to be explored? However, if you have a deep interest in life in the sea, this repetition should not be a problem for you at all.
