The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can someone tell me how I can get the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack is enough. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but it is not there. I tried CD baby, not even there. I searched Google to get some details, but there were none. I would be glad if someone could give me the answer to my question. I know the songs belong to country music and are sung by a country artist. I only need the title names together with the singer. I would recommend this movie or the songs of any country friend.
