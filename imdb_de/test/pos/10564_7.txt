I'm not sure why I ordered "Fingersmith" from Netflix - probably because I like BBC dramas, it was on a list of recommendations. I had no idea what I would see. The plot, which I will generally describe only so as not to spoil it for anyone who will see it after reading my review, has more twists and turns than a mountain road in the Rocky Mountains, as they usually do in "capers" occurs. Movies. They are very unusual in a time drama. Since I had not read the novel (and I do not intend to do so), I was completely unprepared for the surprise that ended the first segment of the DVD, and equally surprised by the subsequent twists and turns. Nevertheless, the two young principals (especially Sally Hawkins as Sue and Elaine Cassidy as Maud) and Imelda Staunton as the mother figure in a thieves' house and Beethoven play extremely well Charles Dance as a rich uncle who collects pornographic material and the young Maud saves from the madhouse where her mother lived as a secretary. The lesbian affair between Maud and Sue is the "big news" in the film, but not its core. The centerpiece is a plot to steal the fortune that Maud is due on her 21st birthday. The twists and turns in the plot give the film tension, if not much credibility. However, no viewer will doubt that Maud and Sue - unlikely - will somehow land together when the credits roll. Although one was brought up as a child and serves a collector of pornography and the other is a pickpocket pretending to be a maid of a lady, the author obviously means that they end up living together. It's a bit hard to swallow, as both have conspired. Despite these reservations, I liked the movie a lot. It does not quite deserve the praise that others have wasted on it. The most frightening and interesting scenes take place in the madhouse, where one of the two young women was imprisoned, until they can flee and return to London to bring the story to its unexpected conclusion. Sally Hawkins (Sue) is a very impressive young actress who is able to convey the cascading and changing emotions of her character with her facial expression and eyes. No doubt we will see more of her. I really hope so.
