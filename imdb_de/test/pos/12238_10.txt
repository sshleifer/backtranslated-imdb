Basically a lovingly Chintzian and idiotic $ 1.50 version of the underground creature of the early '80s with the favorite "The Boogens". This fun, fluffy chap turns on a wicked, rickety monster that turns every unfortunate soul into an instant meal around the notoriously forbidden Gold Spike Mine. Her colorful assortment of intrepid boneheads - hard-nosed mine bosses, cute but bland blonde babe, playful geologist lady, whopping, inexplicable, Australian (!) Experienced old miner hand, charmless doofus, hunky, funny guy and, probably the most annoying character of the equally irritating one Group, a nerd, aspiring, aspiring writer dweeb, who tends to speak in flowery, melodramatic remarks - wander into the dark, uninviting cave in search of gold. Of course, these extremely unbearable fools find that the allegedly abandoned mine is home to a deadly, ugly, multi-tiered animal that over time commits the damn B-Flick fashion with a cruel bag. Director, co-author, co-producer and co-publisher of Melanie Anne Phillips, confused with a startling fool. He looked with a disquieting flatness through a no-name cast that was further clouded by lethargic tempo, an agile narrative, somber, underexposed. Exhaustive cinematography, a trembling, superfluously pounding pseudo-John Carpenter synthesizer score, and a cruel, jerky, stop-motion animation worm-thing that can only be seen quickly at the end of the movie, and that's extremely clunky, amateurish and therefore very delicious The terrible would-be Scarefest commits all the necessary bad movie mistakes to qualify as a real four star stinkeroonie.
