I found this an entertaining account of the challenges that an independent filmmaker could face (something I never thought about). The movie has been holding my interest all the time and I actually laughed more than once! I'm not a filmmaker, so I do not know about the technology, but I thought it was well edited and neatly told the story. As a disclaimer, after contributing music to the soundtrack, I contributed to this effort, but I was not involved in creating this movie, and I could not tell you anything about Repo Man unless I remembered him back then I'm not really a sci-fi friend). I enjoyed the comparisons of the movie from punk rock files and punk rock music. My wife was with me to see the movie and she did not know about it before and we had a great time.
