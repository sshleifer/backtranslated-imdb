My first test at IMDB, after a few years of constant use of this site ... Anyway, I saw this on the subway the other day, I liked it a lot. It is in the mindset of a dangerous spirit or a substitute, but much better. I was sure that Rex in Waking Life was Speedy Levitch for a moment, but after a review it does not seem to be that way. <br /> <br /> I can see why many have problems with this plot and their poems, but I also think that these people are open-minded. Admittedly, the end was not exactly what I was hoping for, but overall it was so unique and good-natured that I can not complain. I would not call that cheesy, as a reviewer did, it did the scene better than most movies of the 80's. And they refrained from playing any really datable music of the 80s. <br /> <br /> I can not remember everything that made me smile when I saw that, but basically it showed very creative people surrounded by mediocrity and if I share Rex's beliefs or not, I love original attempts to describe the meaning of life. And his mutant theory is original to my knowledge. He also struggled a lot, but they showed how confused he was sometimes and why he had psychological problems. And in his moments of clarity he was an extraordinary philosopher, a person who noticed the little details in life and tried to express them. <br /> <br /> I too was very impressed by John Savage as a teacher. Normally, actors fail in this role. He did a great job. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed Waking Life, I say, watch this movie if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> pk
