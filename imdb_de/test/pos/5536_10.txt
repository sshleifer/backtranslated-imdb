Married To The Mob was one of the first VHS tapes I had with Coming To America and Grease. I still have good memories of this movie after all these years. I still have the VHS of this movie in good condition. <br /> <br /> The story: Undercover police officer Mike Downey (Matthew Modine) is dispatched to spy on Angela De Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer), wife of the dead mafia member Frank "Cucumber" De Marco (Alec Baldwin). He falls in love with her later, after realizing that she is innocent in all this. Angela not only has to deal with the unwanted advances of mob boss Tony "The Tiger" Russo (Dean Stockwell), but also with his jealous wife Connie Russo (Mercedes Ruehl). <br /> <br /> Married to The mob is fun and still interesting if it does not try to be funny. I like the little jabs you need in mafia life (the jealous mafia woman, the mob boss who does not realize he's not a chick magnet, etc.) and you like the characters of Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was the last fun phase of Johnathan Demme's before he got serious and gave you gems like Philadelphia and Silence Of The Lambs (the best thriller of all time). If you feel like comedy, Married To The Mob is a keeper. It's better than the garbage that's now considered a comedy (Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet The Spartans, Disaster Movie, etc.).
