An online poll by TV Asahi in 2006 of Japan's 100 most popular animation TV series of all time placed this series in fourth place. That tells you everything you need to know. So go and look at it;) I will not comment on the story, just because I do not want to ruin anything. I only urge you to keep watching after you've seen the first episode. The animation is really good and above the TV average. The best thing about this series is that there is finally something new. I mean, it's not groundbreaking, but it still offers a fresh new idea and sympathetic characters. You will not regret going into Suzumiya Haruhi's world. <br /> <br /> and the best that a movie expects soon
