This film is based on the true story of Iowa housewife Lucille Fray, who got breast cancer after the birth of her 10th child. Realizing that the state would take the children away from her ineffective, alcoholic husband, she dedicated herself to the last year of her life traveling the state to find a new home for each child. A terrific screenplay - which still stands 20 years after its creation. The grown-up children, many of whom had not seen each other since the death of their mother in the late 1950s, were reunited before the film was released in 1983 on That's Incredible. Barbara Stanwyck won the Emmy for best actress in a television movie or mini-series, but during her acceptance speech, she did everything to filter out Ann-Margret for her moving performance.
