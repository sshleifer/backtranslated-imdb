I remember the first time I saw an episode of "Police Squad!" It was completely random. It was during the first network of the show, which ran on ABC in early 1982. I am a chronic channel surfer and hit the dial one evening when suddenly the resolution sequence of "Police Squad!" Turned on my TV screen. I immediately recognized it as sending in the opening credits of "M-Squad" with Lee Marvin, one of my favorite cop shows of all time. I stopped surfing. Then, of course, the headquarters was shot, followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln. Meanwhile, I said to myself, "What the hell is that ??". Then came "Special Guest Star" George Stanford Brown, who was flattened by a falling safe. I was addicted from that moment on. The episode was "Ring of Fear / A Dangerous Assignment" with the weird references to "On The Waterfront" and "Muhammed Ali", but memorable were of course all sight gazers and non-sequencers. Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their casual parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of "M Squad" were an absolute uproar. "Finally," I told myself, "a network television program that is really worth watching !!!". Would not you know that it will be canceled a few weeks later? Leave it to the networks - I should have known. I have bought the DVD collection of all six episodes and they are just as funny today as they were 27 years ago. The "Naked Gun" movies were great as well, but I did have Alan North (he was as good as Ed Hocken), Peter Lupus as Nordberg (what did they think when they were casting OJ in this part?) And especially William Duell's "Johnny" really misses "The Shoeshine." Great stuff.
