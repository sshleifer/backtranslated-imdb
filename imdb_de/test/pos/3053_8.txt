Please note that this movie has nothing to do with Radio City Music Hall! As Archivist: The Music Hall ... I know what's connected to the New York venue and what's not. The Theodore of the film is just the "Music Hall". No Rockettes are in the movie. Only wonderful skaters, great actors and fun. I just thought you would like to know. Really a wonderful movie. You'll never guess who the "murderer" is while watching this movie ... until the end. What a great property and beautiful ice skating. You never see such performances again. The Roxy Theater and the Center Theaters in New York had skating on stage!
