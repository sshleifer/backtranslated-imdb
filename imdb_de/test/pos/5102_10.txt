I saw this movie when it first came out and did not know exactly what to expect. What followed the overture was one of the most beautiful cinematic experiences I've ever had. A lush selection of songs and music by British Leslie Bricusse (by Doctor Doolittle & Wilie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, as well as the Broadway music scene) and the unparalleled John Williams. There is no bad song in the whole movie. Here are some of the most beautiful movie, costume and film locations I've ever seen in a movie. Not to mention the Oscar-nominated performance of Peter O'Toole and, in my opinion, equally strong performance by the wonderful Petula Clark. Now that Peter is not the same caliber as Petula, he still manages to sell his songs to the audience, and that's the point. This is a faithful adaptation of James Hilton's excellent book and deserves to be appreciated for generations. I recommend this movie for families, although most men consider it a "chick". However, if you like a really great movie musical, this movie is for you. But be warned that a Kleenex standby box is as important to your viewing pleasure as popcorn.
