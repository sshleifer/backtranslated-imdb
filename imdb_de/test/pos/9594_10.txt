I have it on VHS, but it's not a great specimen since I've seen it two or three times a year since 1999. I also fear that "she's inside" will throw her out at the annual VHS clean-up. <br /> <My brother and I (late 30 'are still laughing at the continuation of this fantastic show.) Tim Healy's Lucky Cup Hat and telling the apprentice that you CAN NOT DO (shoot, overtake, etc.), and he turns out to be Beardsley as Peter. As a Leeds fan, I have to laugh over the empty dossier on Bostock before the cup final (or did it only say shit?). <br /> <br /> The reason I went online today was that my Bro wants it for Christmas so ITV, please get it on DVD come up the UnderFelt Men !!
