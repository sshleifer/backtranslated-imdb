Kristin Scott Thomas would be my choice of all the actresses in the film today if I had to choose a beach vacation on a desert island. <br /> <br /> I could just watch her, for example sitting in a chair for a few hours. Therefore, it is difficult for me to be objective about one of their films. <br /> <br /> However, this movie and its story in itself has more than the average rating among the many people who have previously commented on this site. Harrison Ford, however, is not one of the actors whose performances I like the most. But he belongs to a handful that has reached the level of change from 7 to 8 per movie. Who can I argue with? <br /> <br /> Ford is often droll in his acting style and sometimes seems to need an antacid and a shot of caffeine - and "Random Hearts" belongs to this group. His obsession with investigating the losses he and Thomas had to endure in relation to their marriage is understandable given his profession as a detective - but not at the level shown here. Although not far, he crossed the border into the category "annoying". <br /> <br /> However, most of the scenes after he and Thomas were involved were interesting and well played. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a 9-star movie, but I would lower it a few levels based on Ford's overall performance, and another because it contained more of the subsidiary plugs than it did appeared.
