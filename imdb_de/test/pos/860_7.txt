I really enjoyed this movie and to this day it is one of my favorites. The story was excellent, though the ending was far too predictable and I knew what would happen too soon. When this happens, the movie is usually spoiled for me (like "The Others"), but even if I know the result, I still enjoyed it to the very end. If you look at the comments of others, many people were impressed by the performance of Kelly Overton (Eve). I'm afraid I was not. Their appearance seemed to me to be the weak part of the film, in contrast to the amazing performance (or characterization) of James Haven (Don Wake) ... I hope we see more of him. What a great little movie to recommend to everyone!
