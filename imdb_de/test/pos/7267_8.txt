.. the princess meets bridal ... good trainspotting. But wait, it's really a good combination! This was definitely one of the better movies I've seen in a long time ... it has the kind of witty dialogue I associate with The Princess Bride or Cemetery Man, along with the disgusting scenes of horror movie violence ... The heroic Feeling of Princess Bride combined with the (this is strange) lack of really good guys who had trainspotting. I'm not saying it was as good as the Princess Bride, but it was in the arena and it rocked. Some of the dialogues are pleasing and brilliant, the plot is interesting, the characters - while anonymous at SLIGHTLY - are not anacronic, since they do not conform to their intrinsic character (in the 18th century there were gay gays, in contrast to the comments of a previous reviewer) but only in a bit of the language they used. The anachronisms, however, were fun and were not cheesy and easy to refuse. <br /> <br /> If you've ever read any Simon R. Green or Gleen Cook's Garrett series, you know EXACTLY what that movie is. Listen. It is great.
