I have seen this movie with care. A suicidal "comedy" did not seem consistent. Since I have a brother who has tried to commit suicide and see the devastation that has caused our entire family, I know first hand how sensible it can be to deal with this problem. I have to say - this film treats the viewer in such a way that he "leaves inside" the viewer, who suffers and simply does not know why or how to stop him. While the film is not perfect, it respects the theme and makes it accessible to the masses. I know for our family, the humor helped us with a lot of pain. And Max and Grace are exactly what they claim - a suicidal COMEDY. It's funny - and I also felt that the characters were real and alive. It is also extremely intelligent, yet simple. It is hunting and I appreciate that! I give a 9 and will recommend it.
