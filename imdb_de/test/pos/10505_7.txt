A strange ray of light pervades Dr. Dorm's bedroom. Craig Burton (Arnold Vosloo) and his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) while they love each other. About two hours are disregarded, as they seem to be unharmed. During a session with the psychiatrist dr. Susan Lamarche (Lindsay Crouse) under hypnosis, Craig discovers that his wife was impregnated by aliens. Sherry resists this idea as absurd and is happy to send word to her husband that she is indeed pregnant. Ecstatically, after trying to conceive for ages, Sherry is afraid of Craigs insistence that the fetus is not his. This results from a review of his low sperm count with a very high probability that he would not have his wife can impregnate. Clumsy, disquieting experiences with the fetus inside her lead Sherry to scary discoveries. Her physician, David Wetherly (Wilford Brimley), states that the ultrasound produces unusual results in the appearance of the developing child, but Craig notes that it resembles an alien! Sparks ignite the shutdown of electrical equipment and even turn off the pacemaker from Wetherly! Through hypnosis, Sherry reveals the experience of her kidnapping, but Lamarche believes her problem is psychological rather than physiological. Since no one believes in the theory of alien impregnation of his wife, Craig turns to the sociologist dr. Bert Clavell (Brad Dourif), whose work deals with the study of alien life and kidnapping. Bert, however, is reluctant to help Craig, who goes to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from possible damage. Tragic results occur when Lamarche and others try to keep Craig from his goals of "eliminating the cause" and believe he is crazy. Craig will still do his job and try to pull Bert along this path. Grim, absorbing horror stories about a man's struggle to rescue his wife from the harm of beings no one else believes he has. Fortunately, Dourif's character is not a quack, but an intelligent doctor who wants to learn more, but his quest for the truth of aliens is not hostile. He hopes to learn from Sherry, but is not incredibly demanding goal. The story is told realistically. It is easy to understand why others consider Craig Craig to be "off-his-rocker". Vosloo does not take the character too far, but expresses the distress of his current situation. How can he save his wife from these hostile ones and prove to others that he is not crazy? McWhirter deserves credit for the demands of difficult kidnapping scenes where her unfortunate character is naked at this table and is probed and harassed by these things. Crouse is good in her limited but important role as the voice of reason in a situation where her clients are psychologically out of control. The monster effects are icky and effective. I think the movie works well and director Yuzna deserves credit for at least holding back for this film. The last twenty minutes in which Craig tries to perform his "removal operation" with a frightened situation that Bert watches as the crazy situation escalates is nagging. <br /> <br /> You know, fans of "Fire in the Sky" could bury this buried
