Operation Scorpio (AKAThe Scorpion King) is in full swing for the last 25 minutes, but when the action reaches full speed, it delivers some truly amazing martial arts scenes that require the viewer's attention. That does not mean that the first hour is worthless? Compared to the last fight, it seems a bit oppressive. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Yuk-Su, a talented cartoonist who dreams of being a hero, as well as the ones he portrays his drawings. When Yuk-Su rescues a young maid, Siu-Yu, who is being sold for prostitution, he attracts the wrath of her evil boss Wa. Led by Sonny, the master of the scorpion kung fu, What henchmen follow Yuk-su and the girl. Yuk-Sus's father intervenes, but he is hurt. After being rescued by some fellow bodybuilders, the three eventually hide in a noodle restaurant owned by their friend, Master Yat. Yuk-Su learns to cook noodles, but also sneaks out regularly Build up his power secretly and learn Kung Fu under the guidance of Jean, the teacher of the muscular Hulks, who have saved her. If Master Yat has to leave on business, Yuk-Su will be responsible for the kitchen; However, he sets off to practice his skills with Jean and allows Siu-Yu to the customers. Sonny and his men visit the restaurant and shock the restaurant, disgusting with the noodles they serve. <br /> <br /> When Master Yat learns that Yuk-Su has sneaked up, he tells him that he should have learned Kung Fu from him; It turns out that Master Yat used to be a top Triad assassin until he decided to change his ways. Under the guidance of Master Yat, Yuk-Su improves his skills and even learns the art of shadowless kick! Finally, Yuk-Su gets the chance to become a real hero when his friend Fatty announces that his maid has also been sold to prostitution. They visit Wa with Jean and pose as French brothel keepers looking for new women. When Fatty's maid is presented to them, she accidentally beats her cunning, and finally the action begins on a grand scale. Despite his best efforts, Jean is severely beaten by Sonny and he and Yuk-Su have to flee. When Yuk-Su returns to the restaurant, it's in flames. and worst of all, the bad guys have found Siu-Yu! Yuk Su, accompanied by Master Yat, returns to Was Square to save and rescue Siu-Yu. Despite some quite entertaining training scenes, the slow build-up of the last action in Was Haus is rather too big and without serious fight scenes. It's a shame that boredom was not interrupted by a decent scrap of paper halfway, instead of saving all the juicy stuff to the end. The last fight, however, is worth the wait end; Won Jin does a stunning job as the up-and-coming Sonny, who romps, twists and turns with astonishing skill and skill, and Chin Kar-Lok gives a solid performance as Yuk-Su, the artist who became a fighter. Especially good is the old Kung Fu star Lau Kar-Leung (also known as Liu Chia Liang) as Master Yat, who proves that this vintage car still has the stuff to kick in the ass! Although it is not a perfect movie, Operation Scorpio has enough action in the final to definitely guarantee a visit. <br /> <br /> NB. I may have misunderstood some names. My DVD calls characters with a different name than the one listed on IMDb.
