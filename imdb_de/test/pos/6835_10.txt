But not too hip. And not too shaky. "Judas Kiss" nails the new noir thing just right. Great speed and a nuanced score complete a curvy story filled with sex, betrayal and safe missions. All-around inspiring work. Kudos especially for HalHolbrook (his best work of all time), Gil Bellows (Ally Mc-what?) And Carla Gugino (the best fatal for years ... smart, funny and extremely hot) ... of 10) and that's because 10 should be reserved for like, Humphrey Bogart and Coen Bros films.
