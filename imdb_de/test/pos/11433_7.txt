"The missing star", who fought for the Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Film Festival, is a film that, if you think about it, is the first adjective that comes to your mind: intense. Intense looks, intense sequences, the intensity of this film captivates the viewer since the very first scenes at the steel plant in Italy (I could not see the city, maybe Genoa or even Naples), though the pace is pretty slow. <br /> <br/> Vincenzo Buonavolont√†, the male protagonist, and with him the entire audience, sees a completely different China than a Western West imagines: a terrible skyscraper with about 800 apartment owners, skyscrapers, desolation, fog, Scrapers and cranes everywhere, but also the beauty of the Yangtze Kiang River, which soon becomes a big lake due to the controversial dike that will destroy many cities. China is a country under construction, but among all these colossal public works there is still poverty, backwardness and unfair laws. <br /> <br /> We can relate more easily to this story because the expert director Gianni Amelio chose two phenomenal lead actors: Sergio Castellitto, a well-known actor in Italy, and the Chinese surprise Tai Ling, a completely unknown girl as intense an interpretation as Castellittos is. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect. There are some shortcomings here and there, but that does not mean it's a mediocre movie. Try to see it.
