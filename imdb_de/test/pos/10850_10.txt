I love this movie. I've watched it over and over again when I rented it to Netflix. It had a lot of substance and meaning for me. I think many people will enjoy it. I've read and seen some lesbian stories over the years, and I'm happy to say that they always get better when presented and feel like gay women. It's nice to see two women finding themselves and being as happy as others in this society. We are aware that lesbians live a full and healthy life and we have wonderful stories that both individuals and families can see without hesitation and can.
