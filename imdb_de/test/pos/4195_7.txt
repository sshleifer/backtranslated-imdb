One would really have to remember the Monkees and have a clear understanding of where and how they fit into the second half of the 1960s to fully appreciate this film. <br /> <br /> There is no action as such. Basically it's a crazy, mixed pastiche from different, non-contiguous sequences. But it's interesting AND entertaining in its own way as soon as you reach its wavelength. In short, it was a classic, thoughtful and well-designed example of experimental cinema of the late 1960s. It contains some good songs, some extremely groovy cinematography and many other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique. <br /> <br /> I give 7 out of 10 for various reasons. First, it took a lot of guts to spin such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream, where both its stars and its producers were firmly anchored. When a movie flops at the box office, the consequences can be severe for everyone involved. Second, for the most part, it was a creative success. And finally, as already mentioned, it is undoubtedly a classic of the genre, and as such it is historically important. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Head" came too late in Monkees' career. But even there, they could not have done it earlier, because it is essentially about a very sharp and cynical satire of their own image. Of course, the members of the group knew only too well that the entire Monkees juggernaut had just denied the race when they started working on this project. In a way, it was their swan song, and they were determined to hang everything. They were tired of being treated as mere farmers in the powerful parlor game in which they had been manipulated and exploited in recent years. In short, they wanted to "get out" and they wanted to say a few things before they left. However, the story has confirmed the band. Let the critics be damned. The Monkees left behind some of the best, most polished and successful pop albums of the decade. Yes, they had a lot of help. But at the end of the day they stood in front of the studio microphones, they turned on the movie and TV cameras and they performed the concerts. They were funny and just a little crazy. But unlike some of their contemporaries, they never threatened. You could safely introduce a monkey into your older aunt. <br /> <br /> "Head" is probably borrowing a bit too hard from the Beatles "Hard Day's Night", but it's still worth it for those who were there at that time or for younger retrophiles who understand the importance of this Appreciate art. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
