26 out of 28 awards he was nominated for are undoubtedly one of the best in 2007. The fact that he was made with non-professionals trained in drama and dance makes it even more special. <br /> <br /> It's not a Bollywood production, it's art. A girl of the lower caste wants to sing and dance. She wants to move up in society, but there is a limit. In India, not every president can be, there is a caste system, and the narrow minds do not allow it to get hurt. Vanaja (Mamatha Bhukya) leaves school at 15 and goes to the landlady (Urmila Dammannagari), who used to be a dancer. After spending some time working with the animals, she learns singing and dancing. The film is strikingly beautiful with rich colors. It is amazing what can be achieved with $ 20,000, as this film was a master project for the director. <br /> <br /> The Landlady's son (Karan Singh) returns from America to run for office. But she is a lower caste and can only be a vessel for his lust. Home is no better when her father drinks and eats and steals her money. She is pregnant and has to sell the baby to the landlady. In the end, she is never above her caste, but the story was fascinating and the acting was really good.
