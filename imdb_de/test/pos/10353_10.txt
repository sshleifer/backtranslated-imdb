Totally disgusting and cheap humor. I loved it!!! It's the most disgusting and totally terrible movie, except for Nicolas Read, who plays an immortal Court Jester, with weird brilliance. But as it was, I laughed so often and I have to hand it over to the filmmakers, it was in no way overbearing or ordinary. Rape, fight, zombies vomit their rape victims. Which other movie does that have? Not for the needy, but with a pizza, a bong and a six-pack of beer, you've made it if you have a cast-iron stomach and a Juvenille humor like mine.
