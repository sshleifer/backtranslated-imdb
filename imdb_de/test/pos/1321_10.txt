Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget about Sunday mornings. Movie images are works of art that stay with you forever. Mishima falls into the latter category. This is the kind of thing that should win Oscar awards, a brilliant, visual piece of film that is both depressing and uplifting. Instead of looking directly at Yukio Mishima's life, director Paul Schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories to a glimpse of his past and final day on Earth, the day he tried to kill the Japanese military on behalf of Yukio Mishima to rebel the emperor. If he does not do so, he will commit a ritual suicide at an end that hits you like a ton of bricks. The three adaptations of the short story allow a glimpse at what brought him to it, and are presented in an experimental way, making them look like filmed stage plays. Ken Ogata is great as Mishima. Despite his eccentricities he is very sympathetic, a man who is quite willing to die for his faith and to do so. This makes the ending all the more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful. Of the three-story adaptations, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, the Kyoko House, and the Runaway Horses, this is the last and most emotional one. It is also the story that best fits Mishima's mood in his last years and shows what really led him to the events of November 1970. This review may not be complete without mentioning the remarkable music of Philip Glass. Not since 2001 was film music such a perfect compliment to her visuals. Paul Schrader has designed one of the finest films of the eighties or another decade for that matter. Keep your handkerchiefs ready as the end will make you cry. Mishima: Living in four chapters reminds you that sometimes the film is still an art form and brilliant as art.
