Earlier commentators have noted the similarity between this film and The Third Man, the classic film Noir by director Carol Reed starring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. This similarity strikes the viewer almost immediately. Indeed, it is a high praise to be compared to Robert Krasker's award-winning cinematography in The Third Man. <br /> <br /> The Conspiracy of Stolen Identity has also been fairly well-defined, but in quite ordinary terms. I found it very creative and entertaining. As common as the "error - or stolen - identity device" is both in theater and in the cinema, it is just a device and not to be confused with the plot itself. Thus, while the viewer has seen this device "a thousand times", the act of stolen identity is full of surprises and phrases based on this device. It's the unexpected twists that make this movie much fresher, more original, and more compelling, than an act that could convey a synopsis. The stolen identity is not based on the kind of suspense that characterizes most Film Noire, because there is no real mystery here. Instead, it relies on constant, minor surprises. In short, the device of false identity is more common. But this conspiracy is not the case. <br /> <br /> Although I was unfamiliar with the cast I found the acting consistently good, sometimes excellent. I could easily have imagined that other actors would turn this film into a melodrama, with bombast, over-the-top gestures, and obvious facial expressions. The spectacle is always more restrained and subtle. Donald Buka is particularly cautious and credible. He "never blows his cover" with an obvious expression on his face, as we too often see in films based on maintaining the delusion to sustain dramatic tensions. The only disappointment in this otherwise fine film was the very weak evolution of the love story. As it stands, it seems a reflection - in fact a slight surprise - that will end up being tacked on. Or maybe the actors just did not convey a noticeable level of chemistry during their shared suffering that I appreciated. This signing should have become clearer with the unfolding of the story. All in all, I thought this movie was a beautiful little gem, and I was wondering why I had never seen it before. Try it, you will like it.
