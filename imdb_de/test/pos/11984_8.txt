About 18 months after its release, this B & W movie reached the Spartan film house of my Frisian village. At that time, most of our uncompromising comedies came from Denmark (Nils Poppe, anyone?), So this movie came like a blitz - and I had to cry with helpless joy, ROTFL, as we put it now. OK, so some of the sight gaggers were actually made of recycled vaudeville 'shtick', but how was this barefoot boy with the brass cheeks supposed to know that then? Anyway, my favorite scenes were Jerry's unique brand for wild clowning, like this boxing match in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> When I saw "Sailor Beware" again fifty years later, I was still laughing aloud at the bustle. Granted, without the nostalgic component, it would probably just be another mediocre comedy. But another movie in which I used to be more helpless, the Spike Jones outing "Fireman Save My Child," now seems a bit too old, except for a few too short orchestral pieces and Doodles Weaver scenes. It must be a special ingredient that keeps the Martin & Lewis product fresh longer. For me, this is at least eight out of ten.
