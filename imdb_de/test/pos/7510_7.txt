The hospital is a movie that was ahead of its time. Produced by scriptwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who has given us the Oscar-winning film "Network", this film features overworked staff, gross incompetence, and bureaucratic corruption in a large Manhattan hospital. George C. Scott is excellently served as a chief physician for alcoholism and a death wish as he tries to recover from divorce, throwing his son out of the house, and at worst, a medical facility. Corruption and incompetence take precedence over care and healing of the sick and injured. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott makes the film his own and viewers will be shocked by what they see in this medical facility. You can feel the "pain" of what this hospital has done to him. The living images of the incompetence of this hospital are so alive and dramatic that you are laughing from scene to scene and deeply disturbed. If the film had remained only documentary with this premise In the beginning, this picture would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a signature from Scott, who died for the daughter of a senile patient. The patient has killed people in the hospital. Here, the credibility of the image is tense. The romantic dialogue scenes add nothing to the picture, and the mental doctor, posing as a doctor, I found absolutely unbelievable. A simple safety call and a review of the records should prevent the elderly from completing the killings. It takes almost the entire movie before security guards are brought into the movie to bring the patient out of the hospital. I could not see that ONE PERSON did so much damage, even though the hospital is so corrupt. <br /> <br /> Also, George C Scott's character is "overworked" (another pun intended) because the script happens to many things at once. For example, within a 20-minute period, you could have accused up to 20 different doctors who denied what they should have done or did not do. It's the same story with the nurses and the aids. Someone's chart was misread, someone got the wrong medication and died, the doctor treated the wrong patient, and another doctor did the same thing. He accused a third nurse who was not there because the second sister wanted to take her in. The patient was in her coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle, dark humor in which the same messages of incompetence and corruption are brought to the viewer. <br /> <br /> This repetition of medical disability is unforgettable. The murder subdivision, however, is more than a distraction for this film. If the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and the reaction of Scott, they will be glued to the canvas. But the conversations between Scott and the crazy patient's daughter force the film into a mysterious type of "Who Done It?" Scenario that seriously affects the quality of the movie. When the crazy patient reveals how he did the murders, I wondered this: Why did the producers need the crazy patient who found the killer? I think the only point Scott had with the daughter of the senile patient was to give him someone to communicate with. The hospital should have maintained its damning indictment of the medical profession by maintaining love interests and crazy patient scenes. She should focus more often on the incompetent B.S within his walls. At a time when this film could be phenomenal, the negotiation stories make the film very good, rather than the great masterpiece that it could have been.
