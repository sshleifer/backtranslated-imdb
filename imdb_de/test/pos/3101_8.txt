The further adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly pick up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles, a new writing team and a new director will be presented. Leonard Goldstein, Associate Producer of The Egg and Me, was the producer of The Further Adventures by Ma and Pa Kettle. For many characters played by the same actors and actresses, the focus from MacDonalds to Kettles works very well. There is an indication that Ma Birdie Hicks will beat for the first prize at the show for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and me. The prize money from the quilting competition was to be used to send Tom Kettle to school. In this film, Tom returns home as a graduate. <br /> <br /> There are two actions in this movie. One is the comedy of the simple mountain family, which moves into a modern house of modernity. The other is a slight morality game about how the environment affects children when they grow up. Pa Kettle (Percy Kilbride) wanted a free tobacco pouch for participation in a contest and eventually won a home. His disappointment about not getting the free tobacco pouch is pretty laughable. When Pa plays with dynamite, he is unaware of the explosion. Kilbride never flinched in the scene as the debris of the explosion fell around him. He played the role perfectly. In his autobiography, Jack Benny mentioned how impressed he was with Percy Kilbride's deadpan delivery. Kilbride brought this comedic instrument to perfection. Ma (Marjorie Main) and Pa move into the new house, with modern conveniences that confuse Ma and Pa almost as much as they help them. Ma adapts much faster than Pa. Modern amenities include a TV, a brand new home appliance from 1949. Movable walls, hidden beds and plumbing are used as comic props, but attention is paid to Ma and Pa, never the props themselves. <br /> <br /> Tom Kettle (Richard Long) meets Kim Parker (Meg Randall), a journal author who believes that hygiene and the environment are essential for children to succeed as adults. Tom is a smart, self-built man who disagrees with the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment. This topic will be briefly discussed in some scenes, but lessened. It was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise bizarre movie. <br /> <br /> Watching the cauldrons pull out of their rundown old house and move to a new house would be almost a disaster if that were not the case. Characters stay true to themselves. Ma was the practical, just as she had been in The Egg and I. Pa was the fish out of the water that delivered the best comedy. He never felt at home in the new house, but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never interest him.
