I recently saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between the figure of Jacqueline Bisset and the figure of Michael Brandon. The rented version did not have this scene. Did I imagine that? <br /> <br /> Or is this part of the "cleaning up" of films, in which some have been changed to exclude parts that some people do not consider "appropriate"? <br /> <br /> I love this movie - it's just like the friendship between a friend and me and we've been friends for 25 years and have seen it together. Her husband thought it was us too. Thank you, Joan
