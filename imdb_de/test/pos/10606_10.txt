If you're looking for a movie that does not take you seriously ... then Haggard is for you. Before I write anything, I have to say that if you have not seen any of the CKY videos (Camp Kill Yourself), the movie will most likely not be so funny. My advice is to watch some clips from these videos that Bam and his friends have made. Haggard does not take himself seriously, and that was never the purpose. Throughout the film, you have random moments that have nothing to do with the storyline, which can be annoying, but nothing that does not get out of hand. Despite everything, the plot remains focused and the story of Ryan Dunn's character unfolds quite well. This plot is based on a true story (mostly) of Ryan Dunn's ex-girlfriend. Brandon Dicamillo is by far the best character in the movie. He has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh. He stole the movie if you ask me. Overall, I love this movie for its simplicity and straightforward craze. It's a Bam movie, people will not be normal. Haggard is full of hilarious quotes that my friends and I have been using ever since the first time we saw it. I saw the movie 6-7 times and always find something new. The soundtrack is just as good. Everything from Gnar Kill to New Order and some techno. Just do not go into the movie with high expectations, let it unfold and judge it for what it is.
