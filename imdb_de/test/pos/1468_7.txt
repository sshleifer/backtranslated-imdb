This British documentary was recently released on Comedy Central during their "Best of ??" Week and also featured on the second season DVD of South Park. I remember seeing a lot of commercials for the DVD that showed snippets of this documentary, most of which are in Matt Stone, Trey Parker and another guy in a hot tub. It was funny when I saw it in the commercials, but I was used to seeing it when I saw the actual documentary. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Goin 'Down to South Park" is a pretty funnier and interesting look at the emergence of South Park episodes and the series's history, which goes back as Matt and Trey in college came up with the idea. However, the tone of this documentary was a bit depressing. It's not as fast, fast and lively as the actual South Park episodes. Instead, it has a slow, dry mind that can be funny sometimes, but most of the time you're just waiting for something to happen. If you get the chance to look at it, be sure to go after that, but I do not think you'll really miss much if you never see it. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 7/10
