I looked at the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen. It took 219 minutes and yet only an hour seemed to have passed. The characters were very believable and entertaining and the photography was excellent. The story attracted me and caught my attention. I'll definitely see that again and again. This true story tells of its best side ... not in Hollywood's usual cheap thrill and glamorous skin. I've seen quite a few reviews of this movie. Most people seem to wave the movie or give it a faint praise. Basically, it's a great movie that received unfairly sharp reviews. Look at it with an open mind. If you like western, historical pieces, though historically inaccurate, you will enjoy the movie. Outstanding!!! 10/10
