A good documentary examining the background of our oil craving, the problem of our current energy use, and, finally, the impact of the coming energy deficit arising from the problem of oil production at the top. <br /> <br /> This film should be taught to all students as part of their education. Show it to your children, parents, relatives and friends. They will thank you. <br /> <br /> After reviewing the content of this documentary and comparing those sources, I would say that the facts in this film are scientifically well supported.
