This movie was excellent from beginning to end. I was fascinated by the action, the black humor and the unbelievable bad luck that our hero encountered at every turn. Thomas Jane is a great actor and I hope to see him in many more movies. While reading other people's comments, I have to admit that I never thought of Tarrantino when I saw "Thursday," but now that I think about it, I think there are some similarities. I do not think I spend a lot of time on everything else. The rape scene between Porizkova and Thomas Jane is one of the record books - sexiest scene ever.
