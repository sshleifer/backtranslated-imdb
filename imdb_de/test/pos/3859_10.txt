As a mother of a 3-year-old and a 2-year-old, I adore AristoCats. It's a film that does not contain duplicative approaches, cursing words like crap or damnation, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crunching or bloating jokes that are so prevalent even today in the "best" children's films. The story is cute and interesting. The music is great. The love story is pretty romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the other characters are unique and eye-catching. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. The characters are also pretty well staffed. I love to hear Eva Gabor's velvety voice, and there are so many others who are known from childhood and also fit with the characters. It's really a movie about love, tolerance, good manners and loyalty. Who does not want his children to be exposed to these values? It's a movie that I do not mind watching over and over again, unlike Happy Feet, where I could not even look at it because it was so irritating. I wish the production companies would make films like this.
