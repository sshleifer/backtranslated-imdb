This movie, Blade Master, may be cheap and awkward, sometimes too, but it shares his thoughts on problems that extend far beyond the era of this film. Ator is the chosen one, who must protect the earth from a terrible protection weapon that is compared to the atomic weapon in an unforgettable and unpredictable way. He walks through obstacles as a funny character that is more than just muscle power, although he has quite a bit. I would say that this aspect of the movie makes him outperform a movie like Conan the Barbarian. That's the least I can say, pretty brainless. The great adventure movie Conan is in no way diminished, but Ator gives him the health he does not share with the barbarian. For a movie on a lower budget, this movie is good in terms of setting and the fights are mostly credible. Zor, the villain, has prisoners throughout the movie, one of the most interesting psychological confrontations that puts tension on the film, even though Ator seems far too appropriate for the job. <br /> <br /> What adds a little extra to this film are scenes that look quirky but worth mentioning. The fight with the serpent god, although he is a gigantic puppet, is well handled, as the snake with good flashes remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. The film reaches its climax in an unusual way, quite anachronistic, but breathtaking: the delta-plane sequence. The scene itself is not introduced properly, not read at all, where did Ator get this machine from, it's pretty convincing, but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful sequence in the air that stands alone, is the highlight of the movie and increases Ator a place where few human fantasy heroes were. <br /> <br /> If Blade Master is not one of the great awesome movies of all time, this is not surprising given its shortcomings. This is a bigger surprise when you imagine the philosophical way it chooses the confrontation between good and evil, the truth speaks and the heart shows that this movie is so unbounded. I recommend it to every fan of the genre and try to take it seriously as a smart movie that's more serious than it seems.
