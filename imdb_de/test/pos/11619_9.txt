First of all - this movie will not be for everyone. There are scenes of extreme violence and "disturbing" images that naturally shut down many potential viewers. Obviously from the reviews on this board - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY has shared those who have seen it. I am one of those who found it very good for a variety of reasons. I think that this was a very ambitious (and fairly professional) business for a group of 18-19 year olds with no budget and little experience. I think that every aspect of the film - the direction, the acting (although the performances of the character are more akin to a stage or freeform performance due to the nature of the film ...), the production, the FX, the score / sound design - all are far superior to many of the films I've seen and exceed that kid's budget. To be honest, I was not so impressed with an art-house-style horror movie since Nacho Cerda's GENESIS ... First of all - I will not pretend to understand and / or understand everything graphic content of this film - but I did not know that this movie is not a straightforward narrative film, and I was not disappointed with how it developed. SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY consists of 4 relatively short vignettes, all around the right-brain / left brain / rage / psychosis theory. Restrain / compassion / "normality" turn. To briefly summarize each "chapter": <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL basically has only one naked girl with an eyeball cut out of her stomach. I'm sure it stands for something - I do not think I've had so much attention at this point and this one is working pretty fast here. <br /> <br /> The next "episode" - HUMAN LARVAE - is a nihilistic, horrible, really scary story of a man who falls in love with both his pregnant sister and her, and gives up his growing psychosis as a shocking one Completion of this particular chapter. HUMAN LARVAE is the best of my book and will probably get under your skin. The narrative dialogue with dead winkers emphasizes the growing tension, knowing that something terrible will happen - but you are not quite sure what it is. Do yourself a favor and if you are interested in this movie, do not research too much about it. Come in with an open mind and iron belly, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised, especially with this episode. <br/> <br/> REBIRTH has a lot of people in a field drilling through the ground and blowing trees and so on. Apparently an "artistic" interpretation of the rape of the earth or something in this regard. Not bad, but this is also pretty short and I missed the point ... <br /> <br /> And RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy and has to do with HUMAN LARVAE too Some of the "hardest" pics / news of the whole feature ... OVARIAN EYEBALL is nothing to write home about, mainly because of its very short duration, but makes a decent change of madness is coming ... and REBIRTH is also short and not quite as thoughtful, but HUMAN LARVAE (especially) and RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM are so unconventional and well done that they more than make up for other parts. I think the main reason why I liked this one so much is that it's considered "shocking", "repugnant", "violent" and "excessive" as it's also very beautiful and you can tell it's one real worker was. Love from the participants. Nothing about the film feels cheap or rushed, and even if the content can not be completely decoded, it is undeniably original - and that alone is a few of the points in my book. Not that every "funny art house" movie that has an incomprehensible plot should be praised for its "originality", but SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is the kind of movie that I think I'll see a few more times in the near future Which other interpretations can I draw from this? This movie is not for everyone - with VERY extreme scenes of blood, murder, rape, incest, sacrilegious imagery, etc. ... that's definitely to shock the viewer, to watch this movie more closely. I have to say that it worked for me, and I am looking forward to the cooperation between Hussain and Cerda, which should come next. Check this if you have the stomach for it - 9.5 / 10
