haggard does not even have to be graded because it was never designed to be named as an Oscar-winning movie, and it was never intended to win an Oscar (obviously). If you just look at some of the things that Bam and Bran have tried, like the time-lapse shots, it looks like a movie that's more than just Cky or Jackass (though they're cool). For the pure pleasure, I definitely give this movie a 10; Almost every scene made me laugh until my sides hurt, like Falcones Trail movie. If you have not seen it yet, see it and buy it. Personally, my favorite character is brandon (falcone), he's so smooth and natural and arbitrary that he's weird, he's freestyles great (with the action figures) and the funniest stuff is - a diamond mountain bike? haggard is definitely a movie that in general humor only competes with Anchorman and Napoleon Dynamite.
