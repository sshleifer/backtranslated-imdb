I've been waiting for this movie for a long time and finally! As soon as I heard the title, I knew that this movie would be my favorite movie, and when I saw it, I thought I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie had everything to dance, love and Patrick Swayze! There was so much in it and it dealt with important issues (like back then, 1960s), such as abortion. <br /> <br /> The dancing in this movie was fantastic, just like the acting! Swayze was as brilliant as Gray! <br /> <br /> Although this movie was absolutely fantastic, you can not say you saw it if you did not see the last scene. It really takes your breath away, as the entire choreography of the last dance was brilliant, letting you dance at the end of the movie and it would not really surprise me if it had influenced people to start dancing! <br /> <br /> Overall, Dirty Dancing is a movie you should NOT miss, and even if half of the actors are in the cinema, "Where are they now?" During this time, the actors will always have this great movie in their careers!
