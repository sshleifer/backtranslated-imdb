"What Alice Found" is the greatest movie that nobody has ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard about it, and I thought it was all about sex, not conspiracy and just really stupid, but in fact it was really good. They say all indie movies are shit, but these and "Napoleon Dynamite" did not suck. I asked my girlfriend, who had seen it earlier, and she said that Alice has all three options, and you see all this nudity. The movie had a point, and he taught me not to trust a hitchhiker. I liked that at the end, they gave Alice a little dolphin. In the end, she was on her way to Flordia. I suggest watching this movie.
