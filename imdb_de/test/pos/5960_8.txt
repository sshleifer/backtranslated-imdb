This is probably one of the best French films I've seen in a long time! This "pastiche" or parody of spy films is very well done and will make you laugh from start to finish. Some references to the world today are very subtle. The entire Moroccan context of the film must be understood against the background of today's French culture / environment. However, all jokes and - seemingly - shocking utterances that would have been understood as such because of this context are allowed and accepted because this is a parody. <br /> <br /> I was told by my sisters, who had already seen this movie, that I should go as well, and assured myself that I would have a great time, and so did I. If you like the old 007 films with Sean Connery and also like movies like Airplane or Hot Shots, you'll be thrilled. I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the US ... Wait and see.
