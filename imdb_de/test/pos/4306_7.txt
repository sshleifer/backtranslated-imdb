This columbo is unique in that we know the exact result only at the end. Our favorite Dark Horse detective suspects that two twin brothers killed their rich uncle. Everyone points a finger at his brother. In a crime series showing the crime at the beginning of the drama, this phrase could only be used once or twice, and this was Columbus' time. Apart from this fold, this episode fits in well with other series in the series. It has a brighter tone than some, with a very funny performance by Jeanette Nolan as a demanding and loyal housekeeper, which Columbo immediately rejects.
