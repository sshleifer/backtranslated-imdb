When visiting Rendition, I expected an exciting film on a controversial topic with well-known actors. I did not expect a movie that was so exciting, exciting, poetic, and sad that it picked me up right from the beginning and did not let me go, even after I left the theater. A piece of advice to anyone who has not seen it yet. Do not let your politics get in the way of enjoying (or not enjoying) this movie. Take it for what it is. I saw this with my conservative Jewish family (I am the black sheep, the pseudo-liberal student) and thought that they would copy it off as "liberal propaganda". Instead, they said it was a great movie with great performances (they like film critics). <br /> <br /> It's sad that a movie like this one has to be marketed by its Oscar-affiliated actors the ever-undervalued Sarsgaard as well as new talents like the really outstanding Metwally. The entire cast performed well, with a few more prominent than others; My only problem with that was that there was a lot going on, which did not mean too much screen time for each character. I actually felt that the "negotiation" with Fatima and Khalid on the screen was as prominent as Anwar's part of the story. The characters all have the potential to get into stereotypes, but the actors do well enough to give them depth with the low screen time. Streep is really great, as a heartless senator, and as much as I do not want to see the actress in such a horrible role, it's impossible not to believe her. Gyllenhaal, who is likely to be one of the Oscar nods for this film, sometimes seems a little uncertain in his role. He tries to express his inner conflict, but usually comes over as if he had either forgotten his lines or he does not know how to feel. Sarsgaard showed an excellent performance; His unforgettable engagement with Streep is undoubtedly one of the best parts of the film. Once again it was great and I hope to see him in more mainstream movies. It's a shame that Gyllenhaal is likely to be nominated before him. Yigal Naor, as shown on IMDb, already has some movies, but he's a novice in my eyes. Together with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach he did a great job. <br /> <br /> The story of Fatima and Khalid was not recognized in advertising, but it does bring a sad humanity to the story. The narrative was interesting as I tried to really connect the two stories until it was clearly told to us in the end. I've read some comments here that say the love story was useless, but I do not agree. I think it definitely shows another side of the controversial topic and humanity in general. Khalid was the real terrorist, but he did it to avenge his brother, and although he is responsible for the attack, Fatima sees a humane side in the story. I do not think we should feel bad for real terrorists, but I think the theme "We are all human" was definitely relevant. <br /> <br /> Whatever your feelings about terrorism, politics, etc., let it be theatrical. The bottom line is an interesting story with a message that we all need to hear.
