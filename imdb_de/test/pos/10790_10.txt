I've never seen an Oliver Stone movie and no movies with Eric Bogosian. I did not know what to expect from this movie. After I had thought of buying it for a while, I finally got it for free as a Sunday newspaper supplement and was very impressed host, who can be incredibly rude to his callers by putting them in their place before they recognize what's going on. Although this has made him a popular radio show, he has also brought him numerous enemies. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film was very impressive as not a single Dud performer was present. Eric Bogosian is brilliant as Barry Champlain, the disturbed talk radio host, in which Alec Baldwin ran as Barry's boss Dan a strong performance. It also contains the voice and performance of Michael Wincott (my reason why I wanted to see that). <br /> <br /> The story was really well written, because despite his arrogance for Barry, she becomes more aware of his troubled life, and you see how vulnerable he really is. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone as it is fascinating and, more importantly, on numerous levels, two of which are inspired by the life of a true talk radio host and the fact that They actually get radio show hosts and callers like those featured in the movie, in reality. <br /> <br /> High recommendation and 10/10. <br /> <br /> Aye deins, Cat Squire
