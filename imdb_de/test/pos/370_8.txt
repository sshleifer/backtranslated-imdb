In my never-ending quest for as many quality movies as possible in my life, I stumbled across cables about this movie. I've tried Hitchcock three times, and I've never felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he'd received. I always felt that he was good, not great (from what I saw). This was the best of his films I've seen so far. Robert Walker is absolutely chilled, his performance takes the movie to where Hitchcock wanted it. Even an average performance here damages the overall product. My favorite scene was his obsession with getting the lighter out of the drain (how exactly does he get his arm down there?) Bruno is a pretty captivating character, but I also loved the idea of ​​Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara. The rest of the Morton family and Guy were a bit dry and boring, but she added a bit of flare to the movie as well as some of the better lines in the script. <br /> <br /> Finally in every thrilling movie you will live and die at the end. This one holds water, unlike some other Hitchcock movies I've seen. I was really not sure how it would end, which kept me on the edge while I watched and waited.
