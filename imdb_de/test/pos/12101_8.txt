Faith Akin has once again shown me how passionate I am for this city called Istanbul. As a city of cultural mosaics, Faith Akin has contributed to the mosaic music of the music performed in the film. The highlight of the film, in my opinion, is the scene in which Muzeyyen Senar (a Turkish music diva) sings at the age of 86, just as she did in her younger years, and the raki glass blows up without filling Drops, a traditional act in the raki culture. She is just wonderful. Sezen Aksu (a Turkish pop singer) with her mystical and meaningful looks at the end of her song, which gives the film its Turkish title, makes the scene no less than a climax. Last but not least, you can feel nostalgic through the wonderful backdrop of Istanbul when you are not there. Beware!
