The omission of Jazzy Jeff, the creator of the Chirp and the Transformers Scratch, raised a few eyebrows, but it's good to see he made it to the extras of the DVD anyway. Doug Pray, who had previously recorded the 1990s grunge phenomenon in HYPE (1996), made an excellent documentary film about the hip-hop DJ's world and the development of turntablism with SCRATCH. His latest documentary INFAMY (2005) deals with contemporary American graffiti culture. After some sightseeing four years ago, my DVD had become dusty ever since, but recently I've looked at it again. Besides the material, I was surprised how well this documentary was filmed. An incredibly entertaining soundtrack and not just talking heads, but lots of music, old school stuff, parties, break dancing, you name it. The best thing about the film is that it examines, above all, where the art of turntablism is today (in 2001), without forgetting the pioneers, of course. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
