After watching this short VHS tape with the Summer Stock feature, I just re-watched the TCM website every Sunday. It was the movie debut of 15-year-old Deanna Durbin and 14-year-old Judy Garland outside her two older sisters. These two teenagers show their musical talents with a solo by Deanna from "Il Bacio", then one by Judy from "Waltz with a Swing" before the climax of both with "Americana". The minor plot of this 11-minute film refers to the possible unemployment of Ednas (Durbin's first name, with whom she is referred to here), Opa's opera job in the park, because the number of visitors is too low. With the help of the two girls you can probably guess what is happening from there. Contrasts are not only characterized by the musical choice of Garland and Durbin, but also by height, posture and movement. Nevertheless, they are pretty good at the end and it is almost surprising that MGM chose Garland when Durbin was already signed to Universal, as this short was made short but was re-approved shortly after its debut (Three Smart Girls) The beginning was to prepare stages. Judy herself made her first feature film (Pigskin Parade) at 20th Century-Fox when MGM decided which movie she would play next. That would be Broadway Melody from 1938, where she got the show stop number "Dear Mr. Gable (You make me love you)". But back to this short film: Every Sunday offers a warm and wonderful view of two stars at the beginning of their legendary career, who do not know what the future holds ...
