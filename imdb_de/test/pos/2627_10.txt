I never forgot this movie. All these years and it has remained in my life. I searched this movie on so many websites and shops. If anyone reads this and has a copy, I'll pay you for a copy or let me know where I could find one. This is a movie that should be known as Classic Romance, as well as my other favorite movie, Somewhere in Time. It was really awesome. If the right actors would make this film new and give them the patience they need to be right, this could be a block buster. I remember how sad I was in the end and it was really a shock. I believe with all my heart that Johnny really loved the woman and she loved him. This was a terrific movie and it is a shame he is not available for us. Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - I would like to thank a wonderful woman who responded to my message almost a year later. She had a copy of the film and was kind enough to send it to me. She is a big fan of this movie the way I am. With their help, 3 happy ladies have received these DVDs. She is waiting for the book on which she is based. I check with my local library under the title 'Mrs Maitland's Affair' by Margarett Lynn. I'm sure it's great too. Many thanks to Julie for her kindness and friendship. I am always your friend, / Sharon
