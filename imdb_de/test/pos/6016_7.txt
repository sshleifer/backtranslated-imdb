Based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee, who painted a much more loving picture of her mother than her sister, the actress "Baby" June Havoc, in her autobiography "Early Havoc", based on the "You shoot horses, she did not? I saw Ethyl Merman in Gypsy's original Broadway production, and she was great as "Mama Rose," but certainly more than "Merman" as Rose. I was disappointed with Rosalind Russell's 1962 movie version excellent actress, Russell was a very wooden substitute for Merman, by contrast, Bette Midler was better and more credible than Merman, and I would definitely recommend her as a performer.
