Running Out of Time is probably as close to a perfect movie as you'll ever see from Hong Kong. All elements click: a terrific screenplay (by the French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud) that even suppresses the strange clich√©, a dependably resourceful directed by Johnnie To, and outstanding central performances by Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, the latter one Great comic timing with wonderful effect, without ever exceeding the limit in parody (especially in his angry reactions to the miserable negotiating skills of his supervisor). The understudy is fine, too, with Yo Yo Mung making a strong impression in a tiny role, and even the often histrionic orphan Lee (who looks remarkably and aptly like a bald Andy Lau) looks good. It is best not to know too much about the action that goes beyond the basic equipment. After only a few weeks, Lau lives in a criminal game with Wan's police, without having an obvious motive. and sit back and enjoy the ride: it's definitely worth it. It also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies and was played in just three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of filmmaking I've ever seen). There is also a good result from Raymond Wong. Most fun playing cat and mouse in the cinema for years.
