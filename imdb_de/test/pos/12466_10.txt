I do not understand why it's so underestimated on IMDb. This movie is just perfection. The better adaptation of all times of the myth of Tarzan! As a Frenchman, I can say that this is the better role of Christophe Lambert, ridiculous in many films, but absolutely wonderful, charismatic, unbelievable! The plot is great, well told, the story is great, the direction, the atmosphere, the music and everything is perfect! How to believe these sequences with the Elgar music, just perfect. <br /> <br /> Greystoke is truly an incredible movie that is underestimated here, I do not know exactly why but really appreciated
