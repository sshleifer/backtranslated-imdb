Here is a lesser known 1950s science fiction with a slightly different twist. A son of an atomic scientist is kidnapped and held for a ransom of the atomic secrets of the father. <br /> <br /> This is a close-knit atomic science-fiction thriller with high production values ​​and above-average impact, even from the child. In fact, The Atomic City has a cinematic feeling unlike many of the fifties science fiction of the time, which looked more like a television episode. <br /> <br /> The Atomic City was actually nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay - How Many Other '50s Sci-Fi Can Award an Oscar Nominee? <br /> <br /> Great speed, close management and some great shooting in the "real" Atomic City of Los Alamos, New Mexico is worth looking down here. The collector pressure in circulation is an above-average transfer and makes for a great dual function with the Atomic Man !! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
