I am amazed that Memento (which is a great movie) is considered as such in the Top 250 and does not even appear !! What the hell is that?? To be honest - when this movie ended, my reaction was a bit nervous: this movie is better than Memento. After the euphoria of the fabulous end subsided, I came to the conclusion that they are equal in excellency. I'm just confused why it's not one of the Top 50 along with Memento. I dare assume that (unfortunately) this is due to black and white or (again sad) that all characters have British accents ... unfortunately, because this is no reason not to appreciate a great movie like this one. <br /> <br /> I tell you, if you love Memento, you'll love following too. Brilliant!
