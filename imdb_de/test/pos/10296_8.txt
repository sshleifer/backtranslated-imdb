Forget the recent American remake that has damaged the reputation of the French original through the director's involvement on both sides. This is a skilful, romantic 90s noir with many twists. It works best as a Gallic ode to Hitchcock's Rear Window, for the term voyeurism is the constant theme that triggers the complicated script. The story is astonishingly realized like a Picasso painting, offers several perspectives on the same event and demands the participation of the viewer throughout. The settings, the music and the haunting film music are just as marvelous as the outstanding contributions of the cast. Look at it more than once.
