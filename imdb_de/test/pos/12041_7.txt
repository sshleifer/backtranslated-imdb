Darr was a superhit movie loved by many peoples. It tells the story of Shahrukh Khan's innocent obsession for Juhi, who loves Sunny Deol. Honestly, it was a fun movie, but if you look closely, it's not too realistic. Shah Rukh Khan keeps talking to Juhi and tells her he loves her too little. He gives an announcement in college that he loves her and gives her some surprises like beautiful photos of her. Instead of being flattered that a man loves her too little, she gets very scared. I personally know hundreds of people being stolen by someone, and these people like it because they play for a long time. Yash Chopra gives us a good movie, which is entertaining mainly because of Shah Rukh Khan's character. Sunny Deol is probably the lead actor, but Darr belongs to Shah Rukh Khan and delivers an outstanding performance. Shah Rukh Khan is literally the villain of the movie, but I would have been happy if he got the girl because he loves her so much. Sunny Deol shows a decent performance, but he beats all these guys alone and survives a brutal knife attack. Juhi Chawla is, as usual, sweet in a pretty good performance. Some good songs, including Tu mere samne, are the best.
