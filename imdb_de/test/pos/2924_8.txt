Few people know that, but there was world literature in antiquity before the Greeks came. In addition to the literary remains found in the "Old Testament" of the Jews, there were significant works from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The summit of the first was the religious poetry and "The Epic Of Gilgamesh". The Egyptians produced many poems, but the most important addition was the story of an adventure and a doctor called "The Story Of Sinuhe." From this work (actually a fragment of which we do not know the end) comes the novel "The Egyptian". <br /> <br /> The story is unique (just like the movie). "The Egyptian" was a bestseller in the early fifties, and Darryl Zanuck decided on a chance: Yes, he wanted a showcase for his girlfriend Bella Darvi as Nefer, as well as the rest of the cast (Victor Mature, Edmund) Purdom, Peter Ustinov Michael Wilding and Gene Tierney), but he knew that these films rarely made big box office. One can betray this as an example of Zanuck trying something different. <br /> <br /> The number of films dealing with ancient Egypt is very low. "Land of the Pharaohs", "The Egyptian", "The Ten Commandments" (both De Mille versions), "Moses", "Saint Moses", "Cleopatra", "The Mummy" (all versions), "The Scorpion King ". If there are 20 films about ancient Egypt, that's huge. But "The Egyptian" is unique. While in the second "Ten Commandments" Ramses the Great (Pharoah Ramses II - Yul Brynner) and his father Seti I (Cedric Hardwicke) and the films about Cleopatra negotiate with her, only a few names of ancient Egypt appear in the film. Egypt's greatest pharaoh was Thutmose III., Who owned most of the known Middle East of the 1470 BC. Conquered. or so. There has not been a film about him, nor about his usurping predecessor, the first great ruler of history, Hatshepsut. The only known pharaoh who sought a religious revolution that approached what the Jews (and later the Christians) aspired to - a sort of monotheism - is the theme of "The Egyptian." This is Pharoah Akhnaton. In fact, Akhnaton practiced a personal form of monotheism that was not intended for public consumption. But it annoyed the priestly class that worshiped Amon and not Aton. Because of our uncertain historical records (although the official notes of Akhnaton - the "Tel-el-Amana" letters - as far as they survive - are fairly complete), we do not know whether the pharaoh was killed in a palace coup or not. He died, however, followed by a young brother or son whose name is better remembered than any other pharaoh except Ramesses: Tutankhamon. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually pretty good as far as it goes. Wilding is a good-natured Akhnaton that is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer should be. Mature is good as the ambitious (and - outside the movie - ultimately successful future pharaoh) Horemheb. Tierney and Purdom are good in their main games and Ustinov is good as a friend of Purdom. Also good is Mrs. Darvi in ​​a big supporting part. In a wonderful cameo, John Carridine stands as a philosophical grave robber. The film is undoubtedly worth seeing, as one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of ancient Egypt.
