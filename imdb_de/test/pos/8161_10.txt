Undoubtedly the most impressive gay movie I have ever seen. C. Jay Cox hit a nail on the head. The way he dealt with the issues of faith, family and sexuality was very well done. Casting was perfect. Wes Ramsey did a fantastic job in taking down Christian's character, and Steve Sandvoss will put you off in the role of Aaron. Both brought incredible realism to the roles and impact these problems have on young gay men. As a gay man who grew up in a very religious environment (though not Mormon), identifying with Aaron's character was phenomenal for me. Mostly recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing how young gay men deal with family and friends in an often unfriendly world. By the way, the music rocks in this movie! Another great job of C. Jay Cox.
