Another black comedy that received an Oscar for Best Screenplay. With George C Scott, the phrase "tear a new hole" is redefined. In that case, America's Medicare and Grand Hospital systems are the target. Throughout the hospital, patients and doctors are dying because their name and their regulations are changing. Scott roars, screams and destroys his workers and bosses as they fail more and more. His comment on Dachau to one of his many bosses will surely make you laugh. He even beats a hippie three times and rapes him. This is one that has to be seen and heard, as the monologues and monologues are the main points of the film.
