This is considered my favorite movie of all time. It's the best parody of a science fiction movie of all time. The fact that it was a broadcast of Star Wars made it all the better. <br /> <br /> I love slapstick. Imagine this when the Marx brothers or the three stooges meet Star Wars. The writing is funny. The effects are a shout. The free association that goes on guarantees all sorts of things coming out of the left field. (I had almost moistened my pants when the Wookie Monster addressed the princess.) Space Balls was a much longer movie, but had only about 15 minutes of good material and I felt somehow torn off after buying a burgman who usually calls himself filler proved. Although it only takes about 15 minutes, Hardware Wars would be worth a feature price, IMO.
