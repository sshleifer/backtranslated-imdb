Maybe I'm biased because the F-16 is my favorite fighter plane - although the F-14 is probably the second or third - but I liked this movie. The sequels (Iron Eagle II and III) are not suitable for acting and acting, but the first - together with Top Gun - offers excellent flight and music skills as well as sensible acts and acting. II and III have significantly less "flight budget", but their main disadvantage is plot and action. I suspect that the relative fame and popularity of Iron Eagle over Top Gun is almost entirely a reflection of the fame and popularity of Jason Gedrick compared to Tom Cruise. Another plus point (for me) is an all too short appearance of Shawnee Smith. 10.7
