"French Cancan" is one of my favorite movies. It's an excellent movie. There's color, there's humor, there's music. It is a very good portrait of the so-called Belle Ã‰poque, although Jean Renoir's priority was always to show a creation, a fantasy. So the movie is not a historical movie. The last sequences in which the girls dance can be unforgettable pictures. It's a movie you should not miss.
