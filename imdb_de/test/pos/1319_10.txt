This is my favorite movie and I think it's perfect. Unlike virtually every other movie I can name, I never see this movie and I think it would have been better if he had changed this or that. Is that the definition of a work of art? I think so. Every brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and everything comes from the Schrader script. I've always liked Paul Schrader's work (you can not argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper), but even though his writing often borders on the bombastic, his directorial style is usually absent. I think that's intentional because his films are usually about finding salvation and playing in the real world; ugly and hard. His style suits his themes, as he presents his characters in a simple and realistic way and can show them the truth about the situation. Imagine if Schrader had brought Taxi Driver or Bringing The Dead instead of Scorsese. But like the protagonists of these two films, while Mishima the man was ideal Schrader material, right-wing extremist, vain and contradictory to society, his works were subtle and beautiful. In fact, he had a secondary career as a writer, bringing out what can be described as a romantic potboiler. So you can not really imagine that Schrader is the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty in the movie. I think the movie shows it was him. The script he helped fashion divide Mishima, the man, into three parts; his life, his death and his mind. His life is depicted in black and white, still camera and formal compositions. His death, which he will always remember best, is a documentary style of the hand. His mind is represented by the dramatized excerpts from his novels, each of which reveals the trains of thought of this complex man, who barely wrote a figure that was not a self-expression. These dramatizations are beautiful thanks to the remarkable production design by Eiko Ishioka and the inventive staging of Schrader. The play is outstanding in all parts, especially by Ken Ogata as Mishima, who captures the essential charm, arrogance and narcissism of the man. The photography is consistently excellent and contains images that the viewer will keep forever. After all, the music is just great and fits perfectly with the pictures, though it was written and recorded before recording, adapted during the editorial process, and then re-recorded. I do not know how much the music has influenced the shoot, but it blends perfectly with the image. I've seen many ideas of what different people think, what the theme of the film is, what Schrader is trying to say. You know, the big stuff about life, death, etc. But I do not think the movie says anything. Mishima has already said it, the film just repeats itself.
