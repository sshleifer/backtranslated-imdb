This is the thirteenth Falcon movie. Tom Conway has lost none of his humor and style and shows no signs of fatigue. The film has a very satisfying story with many red herrings, suspects and ladies. Madge Meredith is the good girl in the story, she plays it appropriately, but does not set the screen on fire. Myrna Dell is a bad girl, and she has an excellent face of stone with agate eyes, and you are just waiting for her to kill as many people as possible to cheer her up. Edward Brophy is back as Goldie the Buddy, but surprisingly he surprises that his manic dubbing has stopped and he's actually in control. This is a good tribute to the directorial skills of William A. Berke, who played so many westerns that he probably was not ready to take any nonsense out of a Brooklyn dummy. The result is that for the first time, possibly in his career, Brophy had weakened enough to add something to a movie instead of trying to be patient with the irritating behavior of a retarded but troubled six-year-old. Everything is going very well and is absolutely entertaining.
