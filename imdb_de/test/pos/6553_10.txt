Uzumaki has a very unique story and I will never look at spirals like that again. No really tingling horror, this movie has a dark morose, sour trip feeling. Was it just me or did you see visual whirlpools in certain places? The camera shots are interesting and the movie gives your imagination free rein. The bizarre supernatural feeling of this film attracts you as the title suggests. Acting is well done, and the city itself seems to be wrong at first. <br /> <br /> This may require some sightseeing in order to immerse yourself in it. A great trippy movie.
