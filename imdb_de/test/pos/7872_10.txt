I saw this in Sundance one of the first years I visited the festival - it blew me away ... <br /> <br /> It went by way too fast and I never could find it again. I thought it would pop up somewhere on a compilation, but still no joy. My memory is foggy in detail - I only remember that I was always surprised and at the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> Who reads this, has any hints? Online, DVD, Beat VHS Copy - I'd try to make it worthwhile for you ... <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've probably seen over 200 short films (formerly close to Aspen) where they have an incredible shorts party in April). This is definitely one of my favorites, and I hope to see it again! <br /> <br /> Thanks to everyone who has leads, as you can see :)
