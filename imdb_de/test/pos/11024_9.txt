Niagara, Niagara, is a stunning and heartrending story about the two outsiders Seth and Marcy. Robin Tunney performs fantastically as Marcy suffers from Tourettes Sydrome and gets sicker as the movie progresses. This movie is not very optimistic and very emotional, but at the same time very romantic. It's hard to explain, but see for yourself and find out. It's definitely worth it.
