... our grandfather's hour. <br /> <br /> More than the gangsters, it's a detailed account of an American family around 1930: The father is proud of his job, which worries about his son, who has dropped out of high school. the mother everyone would like to have, the daughter who forgets dinner in his arms, and the twins who are absolutely gracious ("Please do not sleep first, please!"). <br /> <br /> And there's the grandfather playing the Yankee Doodle on his flute. Did you notice that this piece plays the same role as Doris Day's "Que Sera Sera" in Hitchcock's "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1956)? And there this grandfather is finally the bravest person of the family. He does not even tell you his age that old, but is proud of his country and resists the hateful extortion of the gangster. <br /> <br /> A good movie from Wellman.
