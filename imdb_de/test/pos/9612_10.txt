This movie is the best kung fu movie of all time. While there's no wire-working and special effects used in Crouching Tiger, this ingenious film and creative camera work uses unforgettable fighting moments, and the combat scenes are well choreographed and tight. There is a lot of action in this movie with many great fighting scenes, but the story is also very good with lots of twists and turns. The characters are well rounded and have a real depth, as the motivations for their actions and personality are much more detailed than in most kung fu films. There is really great camera work in the movie. My favorite scene begins with the close-up of the hero face showing his reaction. Then she pulls back quickly to uncover the scene in front of him that is the cause of his look. Originally I bought the movie to hope to see some great fighting scenes, but on several visits I learned how great the acting and the story were. Overall, a great movie.
