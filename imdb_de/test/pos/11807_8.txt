There was nothing else on TV yesterday afternoon, so I thought, "Okay, let's see that." I did not know the plot and I had no expectations at all, I thought I would surf again in a few minutes or so. Then the story began to unfold, and the characters played the two boys wonderfully. The story had unrealistic parts and scenes, but overall it was a really good movie. Definitely worth seeing.
