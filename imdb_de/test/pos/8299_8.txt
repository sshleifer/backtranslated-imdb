Robust David Innes (solid Doug McClure) and lanky Dr. Abner Perry (a delightful Peter Cushing) dig into the earth's core with her chic mole machine. The duo discovers an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous, giant beasts and humans used by nasty telepathic pterodactyls both as food and as a slave. Director Kevin Conner, who is working on a stupid script by Milton Subotsky, is consistently consistent and treats the exceptionally stupid premise with astonishing seriousness. This gives this picture a certain awkward quality that is equally amusing and endearing. The lovable hokey (not so) special effects are pretty (unintentionally) funny. Above all, the cheesy selection of low-priced creatures is positively conspicuous: cruel guys who are obviously very ashamed, Pterodactyl men, as wild monkey humans, and a funny, ridiculous, fire-strong Froschwesen that blows really well. A special highlight is when McClure mixes it with a fat and awkward giant reptile. Another priceless scene shows a dinosaur holding a doll in its slave-like claws. In addition, we also get some rousing rough fist fights and an exciting slave rebellion. It's an absolute pleasure to see Cushing amuse him in a rare, broad comedy section and become an unlikely but enthusiastic action hero in the last third of the strip. The ever-luscious Caroline Munro looks positive when receiving Princess Dia. There are also nice supportive twists of Cy Grant as brave warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as the treacherous coward Hoojah. Mike Vickers's cleanly varied score changes between lighthearted orchestral music and insanely throbbing synthesizer stuff. Alan Hume's crisp cinematography gives the infectious insane processes a shimmering glow. A complete uprising.
