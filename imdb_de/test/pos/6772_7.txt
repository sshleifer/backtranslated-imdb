Good Lord ... How that ended up in our DVD player, I never know ... My wife thought it was a new release she somehow missed ... Nevermind, it's a couple of years old and in Danish ( She continued to search for the English soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> All in all ... the movie was not bad ... Good production values, better performances and a clever story not too far away from yourself for clean, dark-laughter food on the other side of the sea! The end will make you giggle ... in fact, the whole movie will be. Incredibly strange characters that we are really interested in make a movie that may be worthwhile. Without spoiling the plan, the title and the DVD cover of the movie give you a good idea of ​​where this thing is going.
