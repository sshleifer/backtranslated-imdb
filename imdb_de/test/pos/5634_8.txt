What gives this film its personality is the realization that everything is true. While it is a captivating and humorous documentary that borders on Mockumentary in some parts (are they staged or is it really humorous?), It seems towards the end to get a bit long. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun in places where it needs to be, and flows relatively well. Remember Christopher Guest's movies, if you liked them then I recommend that you look for these films. <br /> <br /> B +
