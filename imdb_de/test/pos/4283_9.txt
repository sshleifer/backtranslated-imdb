How can people give this movie a low rating? Incredible. The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so deserving that I can only imagine that these critics were deposed on blockbusters and pornography. (If that sounds bad, it's because I just wiped my original 400 Worder). I was so impressed with Tom Wilkinson. Everyone welcomes the guy. This is an achievement of considerable subtlety and massive skill. His development as an actor of The Full Monty to this masterpiece of a performance is amazing. One of the best things that has happened in filming in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson is a little less authoritative, because of her eyesight, which says, "Can you see me?" this naughty woman here? You can not guess what I'll do next, because I do not know! 'It seems to be something she can not help showing us in every role, but she is still an actress with great ability and presence. She is very sexy here, as it has to be, and it is fair for her to do so: this is a screen quality that I usually do not have in previous films. <br /> <br /> How You Could Expect Rupert Everett, who in the late '30s had to play something from the upper classes that could provide tutorial tutorials in How Not To Toss About Head To Hell. He's so thin here in the whole movie, but I'm worried about him. Linda Bassett's housekeeper is also excellent: a small role, but with a big conspiracy to target, she makes you think about how talented we are in the UK when it comes to acting. I want to see more of her. <br /> <br /> The narrative sheet is fine; It's an interesting plot, as no one in the film industry seems to be trying to convince Joe Public that there's nothing new under the sun, even though it's moving in the direction of the 40s melodrama on the last "roll". But no matter, that's an incredible 80 minutes for anyone with half a brain. Congratulations to Julian Fellowes on his first directorial work: How do we need more films with so much substance? He shows a great deal of skill in adapting the original novel and telling a story with a lot of effectiveness and subtlety. Congratulations too that he conjures up a huge depiction of the art of Tom Wilkinson's movie actor. What a kiss. <br /> <br /> T.
