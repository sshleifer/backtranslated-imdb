Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once outlaws, but now Scott is a sheriff and the young Ford is still putting out his gun. He is hired to take a banking job, but he comes to the city only delayed, and those who hired him pick someone else. This leads to all sorts of complications, much for a movie that does not even last 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Randy and Glenn got girls here. Claire Trevor plays her usual time with a golden heart. And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan, who falls in love with Ford for a long time without knowing who he is or why he came to the city where Scott is the sheriff. <br /> <br /> time and for Columbia Pictures the full Technicolor treatment was performed. The Desperados were the first Glenn Ford movie in Technicolor, a process reserved for some of the more expensive movies from larger studios. Harry Cohn was certainly not one who could think of it. And definitely not during the war. <br /> <br /> The storyline will be a bit muddled as both Ford and Scott are tested for friendliness and fitness. The plot also includes some high-class, sanctimonious skunks in Randy's town who are the real outlaws in terms of the movie. <br /> <br /> The four main roles do a good job, and the best support is Guinn Williams as Ford's loveable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick. The culmination of cattle raising and a shooting in the City Hall is one of the best ever made in a western movie. Fans of the four main and western fans will enjoy it.
