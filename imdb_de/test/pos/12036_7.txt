Okay, when it comes to action, this movie is anything but believable and a bit stupid as well. Despite the many shortcomings, the film manages to work - provided you turn off your brain and let yourself be convinced of the zaniness of the whole. If you can not, you probably will not like this movie. <br /> <br /> In one of the strangest acts of the 1930s, Robert Montgomery plays a man who lives near the Arctic Circle in New York wireless station. How exactly he came to such a remote outpost, is uncertain, but in this very lonely and isolated existence comes a steady chain of guests - even if he has seen no one for years as Eskimos. First come Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy when their plane crashes. They're supposed to be on their way to Montreal - how they've made it that far from the track is inconceivable! Reginald is a stuffy and boring guy who's really worried about Montgomery, because Robert has not seen a woman in a long time and Owen is in constant fear that Montgomery wants to steal Loy for himself. As for Montgomery, his plans are accurate! For the longest time, you never really understand why Loy is engaged to Owen - because he's about as appealing as sodden bread. <br /> <br /> Soon Loy and Montgomery fall in love, but that's all in vain Out of the blue, Montgomery's old fiancé arrives to announce that she's here to marry him !! Given that she had never written for over two years and refused to follow him, Montgomery, of course, assumed that the relationship was over - but the sudden arrival of the haggard and annoying fiancé is enough to upset Loy's plans and destroy Montgomery. </ Br> /> How all this is solved, you can just see for yourself. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is very stupid and invented - I can not defend that. BUT, it's also pretty funny and charming and I see this movie as a crazy comedy that's just a step or two under contemporary films like BRINGING UP BABY. Dumb, light but also very charming. It is worth seeing, although it is not particularly credible.
