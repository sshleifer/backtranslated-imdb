A great achievement from Clint Eastwood and especially John Malkovich, in my opinion his best performance so far. Malkovich had nailed this one to the ground, it's unbelievable. Eastwood is Agent Mike Horrigan, an aged and cynical intelligence agent who has ended his career of blasting counterfeiters and chasing routine tasks. But a task that seems to be a mill operation is initially complicated and dead serious. Horrigan and his new partner Al are being sent by a "Wacko" to threaten the president. As fate would have it, Horrigan did not stumble upon a mad nut, but about a professional lonely wolf who has a big bone in the White House. As Horrigan dives deeper into the world of "Booth", he attracts the unwanted attention and unrestrained admiration of the bad man for him. Horrigan was the top agent of JFK and was present in Dallas, Texas, when he was murdered and blamed for what happened. Now he feels that it is up to him to prevent the current head of state from joining the list of dead presidents. But this killer has turned Horrigan upside down, and now he is the hunted in a life or death cat and mouse game. Who will win? Who's going to die It's a race against time to save the Pres from a chameleon-like enemy that can reach anyone. My favorite Secret Service movie and just about everyone else.
