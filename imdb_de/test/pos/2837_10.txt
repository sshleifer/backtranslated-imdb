"Nurse Betty" is a kind of film that you can not describe on a poster or in a trailer or commercial. It's the kind of movie where you expect a riper "dumb and stupid" thing, doing a cross-field adventure with a temporarily insane waitress while avoiding crooks and killing them. This movie is a wonderful, heartwarming story about two people pursuing their dreams. The best thing about "Nurse Betty" is the unpredictability. Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to separate dreams from reality. Along with the touching drama and comic comedy, you can never tell what's going to happen next.
