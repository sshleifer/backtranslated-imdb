This movie was a pretty enjoyable watch for me, I mean, it was not great, but it was one of the better horror movies of late. It seems to have been low, almost the state budget size, but it has its charm like the pretty ladies. The atmosphere was good too (which is missing from many horror films today). Acting was a typical low-budget affair of the 80s. If you do not know that it is "Dud". But that's what Lucio Fulci's films were full of, they had an atmosphere that lacked action and money. They more than made up for the horror & gore & atmosphere for the film he made. <br /> It's just a low-budget horror movie that can be viewed. I watched it all the way and I love horror movies. I've seen movies where I just switch off or sit down in 10 to 20 minutes and speak up quickly when it comes to videos or skip scenes on the DVD. This film did not make me do this, I sat and watched it to the end, without wanting to skip parts. <br /> <br /> But I would have loved it if the zombie-type folk was around. It was a bit scary, as they were about as scary as Freddy Kreuger's like your babysitter. Seriously though, if they were a bit better, it might have been perfection on a low budget. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie was top notch and the ideal horror music. I have seen horror movies where the music is good or average, but it could have been better, thank goodness, though this movie did not contain no metal music. <br /> <br /> I've been a Die Hard Metal fan since 1990, but in horror movies metal music is spoiling it. The movie loses a lot of atmosphere when playing other music than a score. So I'm glad that there was no music in this movie except your typical score, which was pretty scary and well done. <br /> <br /> However, it could have used "Profane Grace - Epitaph Of Shattered Dreams". Because it's keyboard music, there are no guitars, nothing but "really" scary keyboard tracks. As with track 1 "Forever Sleep" you can hear the wind all the way through and some goose bumps that stimulate the ensuing keyboard music. Every track on this CD is the same, ideal horror music at its finest, it would have been a perfect fit for this movie. <br /> <br /> The only unattractive chick in the movie for me was the one who was killed chibbed / kill (or so we are led to believe) and hung as a scarecrow just to free us and flee later. Every other woman in the movie was indeed sexy, a big 9 out of 10 for everyone except the one mentioned above. I wish Hollywood (mainstream site) would give Romero money and the guy who made this movie. Because it's far better for movies to make a decision than to give it to a good-natured muppet named Paul Anderson of the "Resident Evil" mince. Well done guys, it's not bad, not bad I loved the part in the end credits when they showed clips of them making the movie (behind the scenes). Not many movies do that, which in my opinion has been added a bit to the movie as it has been shown. They have some outtakes and that's always a good thing if you ask me. <br /> <br /> rating for this film 8/10, rating for the lovely ladies in film 9/10, rating for the atmosphere in film 9/10, review of the score for the film 9,5 / 10.
