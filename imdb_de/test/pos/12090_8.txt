A European musician and composer sets out to capture the musical diversity of Istanbul. Alexander Hacke (from the German avant-garde band Einstürzende Neubauten) roams the streets of Istanbul with his mobile recording studio and "magic mike" to create an inspired portrait of Turkish music. His journey leads to the discovery of a wide spectrum of modern electronics, rock and hip-hop up to the classic "Arabesque". As he wanders through this seductive world, Alex collects impressions and tracks from artists such as the neo-psychedelic band Baba Zula, fusion DJs Orient Expressions, the rock groups Duman and Replika, the maverick rocker Erkin Koray, Ceza (Turkey's answer Public Enemy) and breakdance performers Istanbul Style Breakers, digital dervish Mercan Dede, renowned clarinettist Selim Sesler, Canadian folk singer Brenna MacCrimmon, street artist Siyasiyabend, Kurdish singer Aynur, "Elvis of Arabesque" Orhan Gencebay and the legendary Divas Müzeyyen Senar and Sezen Aksu.
