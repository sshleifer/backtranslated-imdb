Körkarlen (1921), a classic cult film among the silent films, directed by Victor Sjöstrøm, who also plays the male lead role, is based on a story by the Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf. The film tells the story of the brutal drinker David Holm, who beats up his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother to drink and is blind to the love of Nurse Edit (Astrid Holm). At the end of the year, David is sitting in the city park with his cocky buddies and tells the story of Phantom Chariot (Korkarlen): Anyone who dies last night before sunrise on New Year's Eve must serve for a year as the driver of death and free the dying souls their bodies. However, David gets into a fight with his buddies, suffers a bleeding and sinks dead to the ground. Meanwhile, the Phantom Carriage approaches. The driver is none other than David's late friend Georges, who seduced him into alcohol and died a year earlier. Since David refuses to get in the carriage, Georges forces him. Together they travel to the stations where people who live with David live. They visit the nurse Edit, whose love for David he could not recognize and which he has infected with tuberculosis, so that she dies now. But her unrestrained love for David will save his soul. Filled with their spirit, they come to David's wife and children. David can prevent his wife from killing herself and her children because she sees no way out of the misery into which David threw her. They also visit David's brother, who committed murder after being seduced by David to drink. David asks Georges to get back into his body because he finally sees that his way was wrong. Once Georges had seduced him to drink, David's wish is met, he gets a second chance, and Georges has to be a Phantom Carriage driver for another year to pay for his own sins. This movie is probably one of the strongest and most impressive films ever made. Unfortunately, it is still not available on international DVDs.
