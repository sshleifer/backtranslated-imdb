Years ago, I did not love and respect Jimmy Cagney's films as much as they do now. I noticed that many of Cagney's films shot with Warner Brothers in the 1930s had no realism and his acting style was far from subtle. The more I looked at these films, the more I found myself fascinated despite these aspects. In fact, I like and like them now! Fans of movies from old Hollywood times probably know what I'm saying - teens and other young nipples do not! Well, when it comes to entertainment, THE MAYOR OF HELL never lets up from start to finish. While the idea of ​​a shady character like Cagney, who has been in charge of running a reform school, is ridiculous, and even though all the changes he made were far-fetched, everything has somehow proven itself and provided good conversation. <br /> <br /> The gang of hard hitters were Pre-Dead End Kids and instead of people like Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and Billy Hallop, Frankie Darrow and Farina play similar roles. Yes, I said "Farina". This black actor was already famous for his roles in the Our Gang comedies and was one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood. All he had to give up was a bland name and behaved like a nice stereotypical "Negro". Here he was actually pretty good and the usual black stereotypes are a bit subdued than usual. However, some will wince in the very funny but horribly offensive court scene with Farina and his father Fred 'Snowflake' Toones. With terrible names like "Farina" and "Snowflake" you do not say I did not warn you. <br /> <br /> Apart from this little complaint and an action that is hard to believe, the movie is extraordinary and fun. The kids are doing a great job, as well as Cagney and Dudley Digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil guard. As an added bonus, you'll see long-time Warner actor Allen Jenkins in his first role in the studio.
