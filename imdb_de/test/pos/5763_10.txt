I have not written a review here for ages, but have re-watched all lower-level TV shows and live shows, and I felt like I needed to share my views on this movie! I think it's the perfect comedy movie. It lacks the loveable Dovey storylines (I would not really call wealth with Gina Carbonara as a caress, is it?) And he and Eddie go naked there ... and do not love It lacks the usual dilemma that you get in most must overcome other comedy films ... unless one counts the fact that they must poison the guests and the guests green vomit must escape as a dilemma that is similar to other comedy films ... This film starts and manages to one Thing and only one thing to do: make you laugh. What do you need from comedy movies? Laugh. This movie just piles up laughing after laughing, without stuffing the laughs with serious crap like other comedy movies! That's why I call it the only perfect comedy movie to date, and I'll never stop watching this beautiful movie. I applied Rick and Ade to such a fantastic genius!
