The basic plot of this film has already been described in detail in several comments, so I will not worry about it. First of all, I'd like to thank the producers, actors, directors, and crew for creating a wonderfully compelling film with a meager budget of $ 1 million, a small fraction of the usual Hollywood price that does not look cheap. These people feel the need to create something new and entertaining without spending a fortune on it. This is essentially art for the arts. I know, I know, some of you will decide that this is not art but something less and that's fine. I am glad that people like this will continue to use time and effort to our advantage without expecting big profits in the millions. <br /> <br /> Now for criticism. I believe that the scenario presented is, to a certain extent, credible. It's wonderful when everything works and the heroine saves the day and everything ends well. What I get is the obvious manipulation of events, so that blind luck is more than courage and strength responsible. When Lee was attacked but not badly injured, she somehow flushed on a muddy bench next to the dead leader. Miraculously, his loaded revolver is still in his holster and it actually works (after some brushing and fumbling). When Lee finally gets attacked on the mud bank and jumps into the water, the crocodile can not kill her anymore. She lands her hand in his (her?) Mouth and manages to repeatedly pull the trigger to eventually (literally) blow out the brain of the crocodile. <br /> <br /> I came to the conclusion that Lee's hand with the croc in his mouth was just a way to end the film in triumph with the human. Based on what I've seen, the Croc's attack will continue until the loot stops fighting. Croc's will turn around and drown the prey. That happened to the first three victims, but not Lee. She had tooth marks, but they were not deep. <br /> <br /> I think the end would have been better if the crocodile had won openly, demonstrating its dominance of the mangrove, its territory, for millions of years. But how many of us would have been upset or disappointed that the pretty girl had not come out alive?
