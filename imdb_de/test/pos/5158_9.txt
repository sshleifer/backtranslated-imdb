Roy Anderson's movie "You, The Living" features a series of about fifty sketches, snapshots and vignettes playing in a Swedish city. Some characters can only be seen on the screen for a few seconds, while others appear in numerous scenes and are sometimes seen in the background while another story unfolds. Many scenes have emerged from the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of the foreign but believable characters of this world. It is a fascinating approach: each of the scenes can be viewed in isolation, but together they contain a strong portrait of what it is to be human. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour or so, "You, The Living 'is wonderfully funny, and much of the humor revolves around the members of a brass band whose music practice rages the neighbors in their block of flats The comic highlight, however, is a dinner party track that goes terribly wrong, but after this fun introduction, the movie's mood darkens dramatically, and the dinner party dream becomes bleak as the unlucky protagonist is brought to justice for his entire life The rest of the film triggers a mixed tone of absurdity and despair In the following scenes the misfortune of The cast of the characters becomes more and more apparent.There is a world in which people can not get in touch with each other often Dreams, nightmares and fantasies go, but no one can be comforted, even when others support him - the desperate woman with the 'Nobody loves me' refrain and the young M Girls with the unexpected love for rock guitarist Micke are archetypal figures. <br /> <br /> The world of 'You, The Living' is also plagued by the world of selfishness. An elderly professor is called by the warmth of a huge banquet to answer a call from his impetuous, money-hungry son; a thief steals the purse of a reckless executive; An arrogant and impatient businessman insults a Muslim barber and receives his gift. At the darkest part of the film, a woman in the church tells the long list of human sins while her fellow students mix at the end. <br /> <br /> And yet, for all the dark moments in this movie, the common refrain of "Morning is another day" points to the ability of people to live on despite so much misery. The soundtrack provided by Benny Anderson (by ABBA Fame) seems at first sight inappropriately jovial, but makes more and more sense as the film recognizes this human ability to persevere. <br /> <br /> 'You, The Living' has an extraordinary visual appearance style. The same washed-out, pale green colors keep appearing, and there is no shadow in sight; This makes the characters look extremely pale and gives the feeling that human life is being exposed for investigation. Almost every scene is captured in a static camera image as if these photographs were brought to life. The few occasions when the camera moves are all the more extraordinary. The contrast between life and movement of the large banquet forms an astonishing contrast to the dead of the wardrobe scene. In the most intense moments of yearning and despair, the characters fix the viewer by pointing directly at the camera. They know they are under investigation and have a few moments to share their hearts with us, the audience. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, human movie.
