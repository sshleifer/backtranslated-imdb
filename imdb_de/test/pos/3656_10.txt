Between breathtaking, extraordinary scenes in a plethora of Indian locations and a Bollywood-inspired storyline rooted in reality, this moving film is a must for those who love good romance / adventure. And by that I mean "good", not Hollywood or Bollywood that ends up being simple and happy. East meets West in another version of the Buddy movie. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematographic epic and the plot entertaining, captivating and poignant, without a trace of Schmaltz or cheap back and forth at heart. HARI OM is a sweet movie that will not rot your teeth. See it!
