I would call myself a fan of Dean Koontz. I had read some of his novels and liked them all, but unfortunately I never got to read Watchers. So I have no choice but to rate this movie by its own merit, rather than compare it to the book I did not read. I agreed and expected something terrible, and although I was not getting a brilliant horror movie right now; I'm convinced fans of the book rate it badly because Watchers is a fun and original little horror movie. The plot obviously takes effect from Predator and starts with an explosion in a research lab. It does not take long for a rancher to be killed by a stranger, and the dead man's friend has found an ultra-intelligent, runaway dog. A secret government agency is soon in the thing as the murders continue. The boy is still fascinated by the intelligence of the dog, but it is somehow related to the murders, and the agency is soon on his tail as well. <br /> <br /> The script for this film was originally written by Paul Haggis, who has done so later denying it. I do not know why? Writing here is not nearly as ridiculous as his 2004 crash! Anyway, the main reason this movie works is without a doubt the dog who, in addition to being pretty sweet, is also the best actor in the movie. Corey Haim, hot on the success of The Lost Boys, is the human lead and actually has pretty good chemistry with the dog, though it's a bit ridiculous when he talks it all the way through the movie. The plot is quite complicated and therefore the movie is more than a little bit messy; but the ridiculousness of everything pulls it out in the nastier moments. Michael Ironside also appears in the film and is well suited as a 'bad policeman' of government agents. Of course the monster is one of the most interesting things in the movie and the way people are killed is always entertaining and bloody; Unfortunately, we do not see much of it and when we finally do, it's pretty disappointing - obviously the filmmakers Bigfoot and the Hendersons had seen! Still, this is a kind of movie that can easily be enjoyed despite the numerous issues, and I would recommend to any unrecognized viewer of the Eighties horror.
