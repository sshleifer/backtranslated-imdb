When I saw that this movie was aired on late-night TV, I decided to miss it first. I'm glad I started watching. Yes, the special effects are the same as in Gerry Andersen's puppet shows. Some of the actors / actresses come from his other productions, he later apparently used the same composer, since the cheesy soundtrack could only come from one of his productions and the action is as long as a wet weekend. Get it all and you have a movie that shows fascinating possibilities. Is there a planet on the other side of the sun? Is it a double earth? Is everything reversed, and if so, do they speak English conversely? I only love this dated SF for Gerry's wonderful model cars, planes, buildings and spaceships. Some of them are not as far-fetched as they seemed then. And did you see the logo of the European Space Center? Very reminiscent of today's Euro logo. Expose the faith and spend a few hours watching this. You'll be glad you did.
