When I saw Colleen Moore for the first time, it was in the excellent series about silent movies called "Hollywood." There she was in 1980, her hair as defiant as in the twenties, a sparkling, witty and charismatic elderly lady - the definition of "presence." Then I saw her fabulous silent comedy work in films like Ella Cinders and Orchids and Ermine. Then the disappointingly gloomy talkie "The Scarlet Letter". And now she's here in "The Power and the Glory," where she shows a stunning performance and works expertly with one of the best actors of speaking cinema - Spencer Tracy - story-wise, but Moore and Tracy give such brilliant performances that the History hardly seems to matter. Both actors age in the course of the film from youth to old age - and mostly only through actions with minimal make-up and hair change. Moore is barely recognizable as an elderly woman, and the scene she finds out that her husband sees a younger woman is one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen. She does most of the scene without dialogue, with her quiet acting experience even giving her an edge over Tracy. Compare this with her adorable comic, who plays in another dumb sequence when she's a young woman and Tracy has a hard time making her a suggestion. Amazing! What this film reveals more than anything else is how shaming it is that Hollywood let this remarkable actress slip through her fingers and spent most of her life in retirement.
