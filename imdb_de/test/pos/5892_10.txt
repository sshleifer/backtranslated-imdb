Best Years of Our Lives is a movie that has slipped under my radar for years-I've heard about it, but never had a chance to look at it. Thanks to TCM On Demand, I was able to view it uncut and free of advertising. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about this movie was how fast it was filmed after the war. The film deals openly with the people who were wounded both physically and psychologically during the war. It manages to capture almost all variants of the war experience in three characters. We have the Air Force officer who was a veteran of the early European bombing raids. Due to the terrible rate of wear and tear among the crews of the bombers, the Luftwaffe at that time had the reputation of evoking officers who were rapidly climbing the ranks. This was the case with this guy, who became a captain and bombardier of his B-17 in the civilian life of a vile Sodawackmann. He also suffers from PTSD, which was called "combat fatigue" at the time. <br /> <br /> We have the army non-comedy that served in the Pacific and suffered from the horrors of this campaign. His story is that of the Air Force Fellow as he switches from a respected banker's job to a vicious grunt in the army and becomes a sergeant. From the stripes on his sleeve, it's clear he's the highest sergeant, but he's still on the front line. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have the Navy Seaman, which belongs to the Faceless Support Team, generally referred to as REMFs (Rear Echelon MFers), by the scholarship holders of the line. Ironically, he suffers the worst physical wounds when working as a mechanic under the deck of a naval ship. His ship is believed to be hit by a kamikaze and sunk with 400 deaths. He is pulled out of the water, but his severely burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks. BYOOL tells the story of how these three meet on a transport plane that they have boarded for their homes and how they adapt to civil society. <br /> <br /> What impressed me most about this film is that, despite the obvious problems the three protagonists face, it never falls into a melodrama. The Navy kid, played by an amputee, gets put into situations we may regret, but the script never lets us feel that emotion. The army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and history points to it, but never dwells on it. The Air Force Captain struggles with the loss of status as he is forced to return to the drugstore where he (now bought up by a big chain) has invaded and takes a humiliating job to support his ungrateful and unfaithful wife. <br /> The script offers many opportunities for all these characters to reach a dramatic climax in their plight, but this avoids it in a decent way. However, for the overly dramatic score, the director has tried to take advantage of the obvious. In a scene that portrays the entire film well, the daughter of the Army sergeant (Frederic March) has a discussion with her father and mother regarding the Luftwaffe captain. Despite his marriage, they have fallen in love, and she is determined to break the marriage, which is obviously worried. Now we've seen thousands of typical scenes where the father rages furiously and the daughter runs down in tears, slamming the door and falling onto the bed. Later, mother shows up, comforts daughter and utters motherly wisdom, and all live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> In BYOOL, this scene looks completely different than the cliché described above. Sure, the conversation gets heated, but everyone involved is sensible, and there's a serious and timeless discussion about the kind of relationships that has some of the best dialogues I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, BYOOL is a high-profile, satisfying movie, with honest performances of the entire cast. Technically, the cut and the cinematography is well received, but never overlook the gripping narrative. Despite the clichés and exaggerated drama I give this film the highest rating, which he has clearly earned
