This movie is great! As a fan of "The Comic Strip Presents ..." I just knew that I would love this movie. And I love it. At the beginning of this year I was finally able to buy a copy of this film. However, I was upset that it was cut! So I will continue to focus on selling car boots for the original version. <br /> <br /> The film is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson) trying to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) a drug dealer. However, Dennis is overheard when he bragged and giggled at the bar one night! Dennis becomes a supergrass, but the problem is that he does not know anything and begins to lie and dig into an even deeper hole! The irony of all this is that drug trafficking takes place in Devon. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as funny as I expected, but it is still a really good movie with some good laughs and a great soundtrack. It also has the best scene ever in a British movie (Robbie Coltrane's walk across the pier was set to "Two Tribes" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood.) So if you're a fan of The Comic Strip Presents. .. ", by one of the cast members or a fan of British comedy as soon as possible !!!
