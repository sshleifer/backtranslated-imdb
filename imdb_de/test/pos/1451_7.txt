Instead of filming a realistic film about drug addiction in Windy City, director Otto Preminger decided to take the opposite route and make his film seem as artificial as possible, with Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann taking pictures all over the world , Nelson Algren, on whose novel the film is based, was taken as contemptible. What, you ask yourself, was Preminger like this and why did he do the film that way? <br /> <br /> The sets in the film are so minimal that they point to a Mr. Magoo cartoon. Louie, the Drug Driver, is so dressed up that he resembles the kind of gangster the Mad Magazine artists drew. Arnold Stang, a wonderful comedian he was, seems inappropriate in such a serious image, and his appearance, crowned by an over-the-top and oversized baseball cap, causes a laugh. Robert Strauss, another actor best known for humoristic roles, is also out of place, as his large, heavily speckled face and the Runyonesque lines seem more appropriate for a Jerry Lewis movie. The stars Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker have to work overtime to keep the audience from giggling. Sinatra is constantly nervous and manic, suggesting a man who does not feel well and therefore fully eligible for the role of a drug addict. Fraulein Novak, plant-like and confident, is personable and seems to be a product of the ornately scruffy slums she graces in the movie. Parker is pure Hollywood and very hard-working like the crippled and cunning Zosch. It is never convincing, but not the movie either. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic depiction of the life of drug addicts in America. The Caligari sets alone make it incredible. Preminger may have sought a dream effect, as the cardboard wallpapers give the processes the surreal feel of a nightmare operetta, perhaps due to Preminger's early days in Vienna.
