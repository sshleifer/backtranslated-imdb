I hired this obscure Australian relic a few years ago to show it to friends, and it was an instant hit. The classic story of the Wizard of Oz with a decidedly Australian twist of Cornball 70. Acting is not exactly Shakespeare's corporate material here, but later "Mad Max" star Bruce Spence is a beautifully understated surfer / scarecrow and there are some wonderful comic twists by Gary Wadell and Robin Ramsay as a delicious 70-year-old camp fairy godmother musical contribution by ex-daddy cool frontman Ross Wilson to the theme song. In a similar way to later Australian comedies like "Priscilla Queen of the Desert". Have fun.
