Wow, it's been quite a while since I saw anything as puzzling as it's portrayed. <br /> <br /> A detective story uses old-fashioned black-and-white images to portray a private detective who dresses in an old fashioned trench coat and hat. The theme of this animation is reminiscent of Sam Spayed, briefly mentioned by Ash. Housewives' espionage for his clients has given Ash the opportunity to track down a "computer hacker," which he thought was a worthwhile opportunity for a four-figure sum he could not refuse and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> The end was a bit bland, but still okay. For those who like old fashion stories, this is the one for you.
