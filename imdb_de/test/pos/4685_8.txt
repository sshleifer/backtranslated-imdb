A few years ago, I saw this remix of the 1960s classic with the Mini Coopers for the first time, and I remember that I loved it a lot. Now, about two years later, it was shown on TV and I just wanted to know if I would like it as much as if I had seen it in the cinema. Well, the answer is yes. <br /> <br /> The film is about a robber team that will do one last job in Venice (Italy). The plan is flawless and the execution is perfect. They flee and do not have to work for the rest of their lives. However, there is a problem they have not considered: Someone in his own ranks does not like splitting the loot, but he wants to keep everything to himself, even if it means killing the rest of the crew. But all but one survive and they want revenge. A year later, this time in Los Angeles, the surviving team members make a clever and deceitful plan to take back the gold and retaliate against the traitor. Not very original, as this is a remake of the original 1969 film, but it has many goodies too that will make you forget. This is a typical Heist / Action movie, but certainly one of the better of its kind. The action is very beautiful, the landscapes and Venice are a real eye-catcher, the story is fine and the special effects are stunning. Even acting is very good, something you will not often see in an action movie. I have to admit that I really enjoyed what I saw, and I give this movie a deserved 7.5 / 10.
