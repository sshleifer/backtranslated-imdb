Many have vilified Never Say Never Again because it's not an official Bond movie. However, it is obvious that the producers have stuck to the fertile bond formula. Although the film has no pre-credit sequence, it is clear that the training exercise at the beginning of the film should be the introductory scene. It would have been impossible for EON to prevent the producers from inserting a pre-credit and title sequence, albeit without the introduction of the gun barrel. Sean Connery is an immortal secret agent and this best-in-class movie is definitely better than dr. No, Thunderball, you only live twice and diamonds are forever. Although NSNA is intended as a remake of Thunderball, it's a huge improvement. 007 spends more time with Terra Firma, and the movie features a variety of exotic venues. <br /> <br /> There are some colorful spectacles in this film. Barbara Carrera is faultless like the bizarre Fatima Blush. One of the best scenes in the film is the blessing coup between Bond and Fatima in Nice, preceded by a dynamic motorbike hunt through the city. Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the psychotic Largo and Max Von Sydow is free from the melodrama that other actors who portray Blofeld have indulged. NSNA focuses on Connery rather than Bond. At the beginning it is determined that Bond is getting older and out of service. This seems to refer to the 12-year break in Connery's account of Bond. Bond promises "never again" to work in the Secret Service; an allusion to Connery's portrayal of Bond. It seems that manufacturers have tried to violate the official bond franchise. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this movie is definitely worth it. This is the last time Sean Connery played James Bond, but his performance convinced me that maybe he should never have said "never again."
