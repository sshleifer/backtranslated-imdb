We all seem to agree. It was an excellent show and let it die long before it's time. I've decided that if I really enjoy a show, that's often the kiss of death. I love the bizarre ensemble cast shows, and a great backdrop always helps. I had really expected to see many of these stars in other television productions, but apart from Mariska Hagartay, who played Fisher Stephens crazy girlfriend, I have not seen many, except in occasional cameo roles. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Key West, Northern Exposure, Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars ... all the big shows, all sadly gone before their time. <br /> <br /> Listen to us loud and clear, we want Key West on DVD ..... please.
