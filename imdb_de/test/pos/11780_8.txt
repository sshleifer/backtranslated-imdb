The thirteen-minute thirteen-minute budgeter happily parodies George Lucas's legendary 'sci-fi' blockbuster 'Star Wars' in a contagiously stupid way you can imagine. Author / director Ernie Fosselius delivers an award-winning mix of ridiculous sound effects, unrealistic staged action scenes and (far from) special effects (you just have to love the kitschy, scratched lasers, alufoil asteroids and household gadgets ... eer, I mean spaceships Wrapped on obvious wires, poorly named in the dialogue, shamelessly haunting drama, and Richard Wagner's rousing classic song "Ride of the Valkyries." The characters are presented in correspondingly broad strokes, my favorites being the tiny pennant Fluke Starbucker, the venerable Jedi - Knight Auggie "Ben" Doggie and the hated archbishop Darph Nader (who uttered nothing but incomprehensible chatter) In addition, 4-Q-3 is clearly based on the Tin Man of "The Wizard of Oz", while Artie Deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner The true masterpiece of this film is the casting of the legendary Hau ptdarstellers Paul Frees as narrator. Frees delicious, rich and clumsy Histrionic tones contribute significantly to the considerable stupidity, which triggers but also plump, funny hilarity (choice lines: "They will laugh! They will cry! They will kiss three dollars goodbye!"). A total scream.
