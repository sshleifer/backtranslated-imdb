I was fortunate that this movie was shown on TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It's pretty hard to find, though it's a classic from Hitchcock. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, which Hitchcock later repeated. First of all, the end is a bit too neat and "perfect". In the last scenes until the last five minutes there is an amazing tension; then the five minutes clarify everything perfectly ... very unsatisfactory. The end is also too dramatic for a Hitchcock movie. He is, has always been and will always be the master of suspense ... Why should he bend down to something like a cheap action sequence for the end? Apart from the few flaws, the movie is great. The plot is excellent; one of the best and most universal ever. The topic? Easy. You meet a stranger. A perfect stranger. He offers to kill someone for you ... you know, you have someone whom you want to have dead (unless otherwise unconsciously). The catch? He asks you to do the same for him ... do you accept this bizarre but ingenious arrangement? You have no suspicion, and so it is ... after all, none of you knew the victim. And you also do not know each other ... They are just "strangers on the train". Brilliant concept and one to which almost every human being can relate. The pace is good, you never lose interest or patience. The cinematography is good, but not nearly as good as in other, better Hitchcock movies. The spectacle is impeccable. The characters are well written, believable and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the elements he often uses. The dominant mother, the mother boy, etc. The film is very good, but it just feels a bit watered down. It was not the famous extra mile that made it great. It stopped before the border between the common and the courageous was crossed. This is the main reason that the movie is not great, but it stays mostly good, with the potential to be more. The end leaves you dissatisfied and disappointed. Anything that concludes, however, is very good, so the movie still earns an 8/10. Good, but not great Every fan of Hitchcock should see it, because it's one of his best ... a little further down the list, but still there. I recommend it to every fan of Hitchcock. 8.10
