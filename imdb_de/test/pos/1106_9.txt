This DVD was obtained from the ACCENT series, a label specializing in art house flics. They released Irreversible and a number of Bergman's Opus. <br /> <br /> What impressed me about Alex Fraune's weird title MODERN LOVE It's an impeccable movie that breathes with perfection and vision, a movie that puts us in the head of Mr. Joe Average and full of voices in the mind, visions and insanity. It is located in rural Redneck Australia, the movie trivializes or does not praise people like many Australian films. ie our films are full of "lovable villains" or people with "gold hearts" etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Not in this movie. The spirit of Stanley Kubrick is big here, he is not flawless, but he has a mesmerizing attention to detail, a romantic touch and a mood that fades away, if not embodied. <br /> <br /> Minor quibbles ... the transfer looks flawed - front loans were cut, they do not fit into the frame. <br /> <br /> One of the short films is also damaged, it stops halfway.
