Following up on "My Name Is Barbra" from 1965 and filmed in brilliant colors, "Color Me Barbra" brings La Streisand alternating nostalgia, clowning comedy, feminine romantic angst and beguiling sincerity for a crazy quiz-hour full of showbizz dazzle. She is a fragmentation and a femme fatale, a sprite and a riddle. She is also a chameleon with her Egyptian eye make-up and her ever-changing hairstyles. Her voice is rich and moving, although some of her songs are not ("One Kiss", "Yesterdays"). The circus sequence is not as intriguing as the museum visit (with Barbra, the paintings in the paintings become an idea that works better than you might think). The circus medley (built around songs with the word "face"!) Is girlishly sweet, without ever getting really adorable. Still, this is a lively, jazzy special - not as tempting as "My Name Is Barbra", but definitely a great second try.
