Another funny Warner strip. I really liked John Garfield, though I wonder why Cagney was not in the role. Maybe it was too similar to dirty-faced angels? I mean, it's a different story from Dead End Kids too, but I really appreciated them here, and this movie had a lot of nice comic accents and a good drama. The guys are working great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole "swimming" scene, which begins without worries, but gets too close to the disaster. As a detective, the good actor seemed as inappropriate as a nun in a whorehouse.
