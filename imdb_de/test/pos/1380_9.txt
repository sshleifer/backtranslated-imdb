I buy this for a dollar! <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for a dollar and I have seen much worse for much more !! <br /> <br /> This is a Scottish sci-fi movie by Mark Stirton and according to Making of (hysterically, by the way) the production cost only $ 8,000. Eight great !!! That would not pay for half a minute in Hollywood !! Nevertheless ---- This is the best movie that is fun. If you prefer it hard, then you will do something good for yourself. These are some rough characters with rough voices and harsh cursing. I do not mind, but my girlfriend did it !! The actors do a good job and it's interesting to see, people I've never heard of or seen before. It meant that I had no idea who would die first. <br /> <br /> Watch a movie with the latest visual effects and watch a Star Wars movie. The effects here are fine, but slightly weak in outer space. But the monsters are very well done if they are a bit predetermined. <br /> <br /> Stirton is doing a great job with not very much and I would like to see him see a real Hollywood movie. At least it was unpredictable and I almost fell off the chair when a guy blew his head off !!! OK, so it's a small derivative of other sci-fi devices, but for this budget it's an amazing try, and anyone who thinks you can make a sci-fi movie for 8 g is easy or just happens much about the film industry. <br /> <br /> Good grades for a good movie, extra scores for such hard work, extra scores for a really interesting making of. No ordinary cop here, all problems of production like Lost in Mancha are only made with a movie at the end. But why not a comment? KEEP YOURSELF!
