Is that a good movie? It's hard to say - but in 1953 it was a remarkably effective movie for many people, exciting, scary, and then surprisingly touching when "the old man" experienced his unfortunate death at the end of the film Labyrinth lurks, proves to be a surprise and funny to many people. But the basic idea (ontogenesis recapitulates phylogeny) was very real at the time the book was written and actually has a foundation. Not that it would ever lead to what we see in the movie, of course. <br /> <br /> But working on a very low budget, one of the biggest production designers - and the person for whom the term "production designer" was invented - created a very eerie mood that was strangely captivating. Of course, sometimes the movie is very stupid, but it has its moments.
