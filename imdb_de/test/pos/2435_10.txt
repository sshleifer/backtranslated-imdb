This amusing, sometimes poignant look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940s and 1950s shows Robert Sacci as an unnamed ex-retired police officer, using his life savings for plastic surgery to add his image to that of his idol Humphrey Bogart under the name "Sam Marlowe" found a business as a private eye. By the way, Robert Sacchi is one of the few Bogart impersonators who did the Lisp right; To put it in a nutshell: body and facial language are there. For a while, "Sam" is the only client of his landlady who wants him to find her undersized boyfriend, and his only amusement is his secretary, who is simply called "Dutchess" (Misty Rowe) and who, in his own words, "looked" like Marilyn Monroe and made about as much sense as Gracie Allen "and has a passion for banana splits. Then he meets Elsa (Olivia Hussey), the simple, sweet, virgin daughter of a retired master of requisite who was murdered for no apparent reason. In the investigation of the murder comes Sam shortly thereafter: The Gene Tierney -like daughter (Michelle Phillips) of Anastas, a stingy, obscenely wealthy Greek shipping tycoon (Victor Buono, who is in a recognized Sidney Greenstreet), second wife (Yvonne de Carlo, who manages to play various emotions without saying a word), his two grubby henchmen (Herbert Lom, channeling Peter Lorre and Jay Robinson, a reasonably accurate Lionel Atwill) and Anastas's devilish, amoral potentate in the Middle East (Franco Nero), who is endowed with a Glamourus and a mysterious, faithful mistress (Sybil Danning), who would give anything to acquire the "Eyes of Alexander", two huge, perfectly matched star sapphires. When Elsa is assassinated, Marlowe's interest in solving the case becomes personal, traveling through a labyrinth of landmarks in Los Angeles, including the Hollywood Bowl, the skating and esoteric attractions of Hollywood Boulevard, and the island of Santa Catalina follow. determined to get her in front of one of the two wealthy competitors. Throw in cameos by Mike Mazurki and others, the traditional dumb but sympathetic ally of the police, and a wealth of well-drawn characters that give dimensions to virtually all gamers, and despite an unfortunate title song you've got through in my opinion through a pleasurable movie experience.
