I loved this movie! Markie Post is really great. I've seen it during my lifetime, and it's in the same entertaining class as movies like 'The Betty Broderick Story', 'Locked Up: A Mother's Fury', etc., etc. Entertaining Movies!} It's an exaggerated drama about a single parent Mother trying to break away from her bourgeois, predictable personality. This movie is just pure entertainment! It does not have to be a realistic view of heroin addiction. But it shows how every "normal" middle-class person (and they do it!) Can become heroin addicts. Junkies are not just homeless uneducated people on the street. {By the way, when you see it, watch the kid whirling around his mother! Spoiled!} 8 out of 10 stars.
