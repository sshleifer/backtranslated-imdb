There is a Spartan, unsentimental edge in this film that leaves us plenty of room to take part in the action without giving us stylistic stresses of how we should feel. in 'Blue' everything was very sad (sure, powerful as hell, but still); In 'White' it was a great mood. However, there are no such emotional clues or hints in this regard. It's like he's finally letting the force of history unfold its own magic without baffling the ornamentation. I think that makes it the most puzzling of the three in the beginning, but ultimately the most transcendent and redeeming. Never was relentless, ruthless honesty so beautiful.
