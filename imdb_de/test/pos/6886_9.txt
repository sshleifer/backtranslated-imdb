I can not object anymore to those who say that this is a lousy movie. Me and my friend visited it during the Stockholm Film Festival and it was indeed one of my favorite films during the festival. Dolls used in horror movies are not new, but I did not see that many movies were as well executed as in this movie. The atmosphere, the setting, the actors, the camera work ... everything is just beautiful. And they work really well together. If you now expect this film to be a different grudge or ring, you probably will not like it. But if you decide on a good, stylized fear, it's perfect. Although it is quite predictable and sometimes ridiculous, I recommend it to anyone who likes horror movies. Look at it. Now.
