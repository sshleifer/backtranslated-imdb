The China Syndrome found the worst kind of publicity when it hit the theatrical release when the accident took place at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. I still remember that the attention of the entire country was directed to hourly communications from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And if you did not know, a scientist of China Syndrome describes the worst case scenario so that an area as big as the state of Pennsylvania becomes uninhabitable. Less than a decade later in Chernobyl in Ukraine In its last days, the Soviet Union dealt with a crisis that was not caught up in time. The China syndrome became again a relevant movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is more about cutting corners for safety than anti-nuclear power. Jack Lemmon is a man who has lived with nuclear power all his life as the captain of a nuclear submarine. What annoys him and leads to the confrontation that brings the film to a climax is the stupidity and greed of the managers of the energy company. But stupidity and greed are goods that you find every day. The problem with them is that there are places where it can be tolerated less in human society. Lemmon shares the star bill with some of Hollywood's well-known offspring, Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. Jane is a TV reporter who is constantly assigned to puff stories and happens to be in a nuclear power plant. The coverup by her own ward and her later meeting with Lemmon triggered the chain of events featured in The China Syndrome. <br /> <br /> However, Fonda's best scene, which I thought was a news anchor with Peter Donat at her station. Take a look at her expression as Donat fades the meaning of the story and patronizingly says that her beauty requires her to stick to puff pieces. Fonda knows that she has something and stays tuned. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays her iconoclastic cinematographer, which was typical for him then. In his TCM tribute to his father, Kirk Douglas, Michael said he had opted for roles with sensitivity. Nevertheless, I would have seen a young Kirk Douglas in this part. <br /> <br /> What about doing energy for industrial and post-industrialized countries, an annoying problem that will annoy our government for a few generations. This film shows what can happen with a dependence on nuclear power. Our current geopolitical problems in the world are partly based on dependence on fossil fuels, especially oil. Everything we use has unforeseen consequences. <br /> <br /> The true hero of the film, in my opinion, is Wilford Brimley, Lemmon's colleague at the nuclear plant. In the end, Brimley really hits the plate. <br /> <br /> See The China Syndrome to know what I'm talking about.
