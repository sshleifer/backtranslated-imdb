I loved this movie! Fantastic original and different! A solid, intense, hard and exciting movie that has exactly the right (dark?) Humor. If you've had enough of the typical, exaggerated, ridiculous Hollywood B.S. Films, how many big explosions and terrible and unreal shootings that offend your intelligence, we can take, then this movie is for you. Fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable, and solid performances of all the actors, no faint characters or performances in the movie. Skip Woods' film is a breath of fresh air and I welcome its originality and efforts. His movie feels like a mix of a Quentin Tarantino and a Cohen Brothers movie (in my opinion, not a bad mix). This film grabs you by the neck and will not let you go, there's nothing boring or gum on this movie. The only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it. Everyone I recommended thanked me and shared my opinion. This movie is a welcome change / alternative from the canned Hollywood mainstream garbage being produced today, even with its big actors, big explosions, special effects and big budgets. It's a terribly wild, intense, violent, graphic, humorous and raw one (I mean well, no fake Hollywood polish here). Many thanks to all who realized this movie. They did an incredible job!
