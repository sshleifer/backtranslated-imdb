Let's make it clear right from the start: I'm an asshole with the emotional sensitivity of Cubic Stone. That's why I look at dramas of people with disabilities, social stigma or other ailments they have and cry over it again and again as dumb films with a bad taste. I mean, if you have a message, you can say it without the help of sick or pathetic people. <br /> <br /> However, I liked this movie. It is about people with unbelievable unhappiness when personal health increases, but they do not cry, on the contrary, they try to live and people try to "protect" or "care" them by actively removing them from reality Life. The message is a living life to the fullest, even if the end is as sad as possible. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: When the dramas of the sick people go, this is a guardian. It is sad and yet hopeful. I like James McAvoy, even though he seems to always play the arrogant rebels. I also say that Steven Robertson played very well. Either that or he really has a partial paralysis. :)
