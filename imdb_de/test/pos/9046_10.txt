This is Classic Disney's best in its live action! Limping student Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell) develops a mysterious liquid invisibility formula that actually makes objects disappear and helps them save their barren college. Further experiments show that it works surprisingly well in humans! Riley's startling discovery needs some funny twists, as a group of crooks, led by the infamous A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) steals the formula and tries to use it for its non-legal activities. Dazzling special effects and a fast-paced story make this lively film a textbook for college comedy! I love this movie! This film has always filled me with a feeling of wonder and joy. A pleasant little comedy that the whole family can enjoy. Not much violence or sex and absolutely no cursing makes this movie a movie that parents can see with their kids. First of all, a series of Kurt Russell films playing at Medvale College. A pleasant little series playing terrorists in a healthy America, when people put more emphasis on integrity than money! I highly recommend this movie!
