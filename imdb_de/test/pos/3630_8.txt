The Duke is a very stupid movie - a dog that becomes a duke! But it is a very funny movie. There are some of those crazy tricks that many children's movies have, but (fortunately!) No physical jokes as so many animal films feel compelled to do so! Mostly dogs are only dogs and humans. , , Well, people. The "good guys" are personable and appealing. The "bad guys" are ridiculous and of course the pun of many jokes. But there is something worthy about this film, because even though it is stupid, it is not intended for any cheap laughter like "Home Alone" and others, and Tan Coonhound "Hubert", the Duke after his beloved owner, a real Duke becomes. Mostly they behave like dogs, no "talking" or human-like feelings and behaviors. But they make stereotypical poodles, and Hubert falls in love with them just because she's a poodle. Come on! These are dogs - they have a different view of the beauty !!! <br /> <br /> Overall charming, fun and enjoyable.
