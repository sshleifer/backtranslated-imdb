Extraordinary film that deals with a theme with large proportions and a very well-balanced orientation. Dmytrik was a very good director, at least from what I can read about this movie and Murder my Sweet, but he was seriously influenced by the HUAC as other film directors and actors. It's somewhat ironic that Crossfire did not get an Oscar because it's a great example of how to make a great low-budget movie. Everything about this film is extraordinary: a well-written script that uses extensive flashbacks, a great cast, great lighting that seems to tell the story more than the actual action. What more can you expect from a first-class film? May I add that Noir is used here for his elegance, and I could add financial benefits. But this proves once again that what was originally considered a B-movie can have more impact today than most A-films that have become persistent and have lost their audiences over time. This movie is not a noir film per se and this raises serious questions about what noir actually is. The style is definitely Noir in terms of the sets and especially the lights, but the theme surpasses the recipe of the "Noir genre". You can look at things from the opposite perspective, claiming that anti-Semitism is just a pretext for criminal investigations, with the mystery of murder at the center. This would be the case if Robert Ryan had not been in an outstanding performance. In any case, the film has a lot to offer, and it is a pity that the director had to suffer so much injustice for his former beliefs in a truly "noir" period of America
