I consider myself a random fan of Dario Argento. For every really good movie of his (like "Deep Red" and "Tenebre") there seems to be one who is equally uninspired (his output since "Opera" disappoints). However, there is no denying that there are only a few horror directors who can beat him. I consider "Opera" as the best work of Argento. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the movie where all of its trademarks are present. There are no well-developed characters and the story makes very little sense when you start questioning them. Imagine Argento as the European counterpart to Brian DePalma - style is all that matters, so much so that it becomes substance. Typically for Argento, there are some beautifully filmed murder sequences. Those who are unfamiliar with the work of the man may perceive this as a sadistic remark (in the face of often timeless misogyny), but it is truly true. Argento catches the eye with a complexity that highlights eye-catching details. He makes graphics violence into an art form. In addition, his directing and the appearance of his films are impeccable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, "Opera" is one of its most frightening products. Argento is the only director for whom I like booming rock music for horror sequences (if others try to break it down, it looks cheesy). Acting varies, with Cristina Marsillach playing a beautiful and somewhat sympathetic, but never particularly animated young opera artist. The rest of the actors are professional and do the work, but at Argento, acting is never the point. It's the beautiful colors, the terrifying violence and the general fever dream / nightmare atmosphere. (9/10)
