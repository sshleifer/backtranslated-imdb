... this film noire set piece suffers from bleak sound (at least shown inadequate at the Seattle and Maine film festivals) and bleak conspiracy, while Rickman suffers from an American accent, old tennis shoes, and flaking sweats. Nevertheless, he has ingenious moments of chewing, and the film offers eerie ambiguity from Norman Reedus, the pretty Polly Walker, and a startling ending (telescoped to frequent moviegoers) while miraculously viewing the physiography of Maine and Rickman. Due to a video release in March (after a cable broadcast). Not to be missed by a Rickman fan. Ignore the Amanita-Hooey.
