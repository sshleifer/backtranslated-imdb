When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping Samanosuke clan, loyal follower Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki) flees with his lord's eight-year-old son, Tadafumi, and his daughter Kozasa. They are guarded by the priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the god of the Hanabusa clan Majin, a vengeful spirit held in huge stature embedded in a mountain. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) seek revenge against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), however, are captured in the trial and sentenced to death. Prisoner Shinobu, desperately trying to rescue her master, threatens Samanosuke with the god's displeasure, only to beat her to death for her efforts. Samanosuke, a futile, cruel, close man, orders to destroy the statue of Majin to smash the last vestiges of hope among the remaining Hanabusa loyalists. But the god Majin, who has been relentlessly silent, has other ideas ... <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a rousing, timeless, deeply moving fairy tale. Lavishly produced with a decent budget, it is a film about values: the values ​​of the nobility, justice, decency, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and love. It is about hierarchy and domination, and the consequences if the responsibility associated with domination is not fulfilled. These things are not much talked about in our demotic time except by doodling of toads like William Bennet, but still relevant, and Daimajin shows us why. <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a perfect example of why Japanese cinema is so great. The values ​​listed above have a tangible relevance to those involved in the film, as is the case with many Japanese filmmakers. There is no lip service, no condescension, no irony here. Instead, there is an authentic effort to summon a world where these values ​​can be alive again, and to show what happens when they sink. Just compare Daimajin or the Lone Wolf and Cub series or any Kurosawa movie with Tarantino's nihilistic kill Bill b * llshit to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In a film whose talent is so uniquely excellent, I would just like to point out the majestic score of Master Akira Ifikuba, the talent and beauty of actors Jun Fujimaki, Yoshihiko Aoyama and Miwi Takada; and the breathtaking performance of Otome Tsukimiya. Her death scene is one of the most moving and meaningful I've ever seen.
