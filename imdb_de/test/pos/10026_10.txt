Warner Brothers significantly falsified American history in "Big Trail" director Raoul Walsh's top-notch Western "They Died With Their Boots," a somewhat inaccurate but totally exciting biography of cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer. The film tells Custer from the moment he arrives at the West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him at the Little Big Horn. This is one of Errol Flynn's signature scrolls and one of Raoul Walsh's greatest epics. Walsh and Flynn often joined afterwards, and "They died with their boots" rejoined Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's last romantic interest. They have been seen as a couple in seven previous films. This 140-minute, black and white Oater is brilliant with dynamic action sequences, humorous romantic scenes and fierce dramatic clashes between our hero and his opponents. One of the notorious errors concerns Colonel Philip Sheridan, who is shown as a commander at West Point before the Civil War. In fact, Sheridan was a lieutenant at the time. In fact, the commander was Robert E. Lee, as the former Flynn film "Santa Fe Trail" showed. Another historic decree concerns Lieutenant General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not the commander of the Union troops throughout the Civil War. Warner Brothers presented Custer as a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life Custer did not drink and smoke. These and other historical fools, however, do not negatively impact on a really great movie. <br /> <br /> "They died with their boots" as Custer rides into the West Point Military Academy, which is dressed in a costume uniform, an African American carrying his luggage and taking care of his dogs. After the Guard's sergeant realizes that he has become a guard of honor for a future pleve in lieu of a senior foreign general, Sergeant Custer hands over to a ranked cadet Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy of City for Conquest) takes the responsibility for him. Sharp plays a practical job with Custer by installing him in the quarters of Major Romulus Taipe (Stanley Ridge's "Task Force"), who runs Custer out of the race promptly. Of course, the volatile Custer Sharp attacks in a public brawl. General Phil Sheridan is ready to fire Custer from West Point. As it turns out, Sheridan can not identify Custer because Custer is not logged in. As soon as he enrolls, Custer builds a mediocre academic reputation that he willingly uses to defend himself and collect vast amounts of money. When the American Civil War breaks out, West Point closes cadets who have not yet completed their education and plunges them into battle. One of the last cadets to go to war is Custer. When he wants to go into combat, Custer meets his future wife, Elizabeth 'Libby' Bacon (Olivia de Havilland of "Santa Fe Trail"), and they pledge their allegiance to Mr. Bacon (Gene Lockhart of "Carousel") Sight of Custer abhors. It seems that Bacon encountered Custer in a saloon and verbally abused one of Custer's friends, and our hero accused Bacon. In the meantime, in Washington, Custer is desperately looking for a change to a regiment, but Major Taipe has him cool off his heels. Custer befriends Round Lieutenant General Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet of "The Maltese Falcon"), and they share the appetite for framed Bermuda onions that become a hallmark of Custer. Scott not only makes Taipe assign Custer to the Second Cavalry, but also makes Cipe get Taipe's horse to come to his command. During the Battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861, Custer contradicts the orders of none other than Sharp, striking his superior and holding a bridge so that the infantry can cross it. Wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital, Custer receives a medal instead of a court-martial. When Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the union army at the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked at the chance that the South will win. If a brigadier-general can not be found, Scott drives Taipe to carry the first available officer. A mistake is made and Custer is promoted. At first scary, Custer embraces the moment and suggests Stuart. After the war, Custer runs out and starts drinking with the boys in the local saloons. Sharp appears as a crooked railway company and tries to win with his father Custer as president of his railway, so they can get money. Finally, Libby intervened in his name with General Sheridan, who had commanded the army, and put him back into active service as commander of the 7th Cavalry. When he takes command, Custer finds the 7th Cavalry drunk and is not surprised that Sharp orders the liquor at the fort. In the meantime, Custer has driven in with Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn of "The Guns of Navarone") for the first time and arrests him. Of course, Crazy Horse runs away, becomes Custer's opponent and they fight. Once Custer has defeated Crazy Horse and the Indians, Sharp and Taipe conspire as government agents to sign a peace treaty with the Sioux and destroy other Indian nations. They also ensure that Custer is sued for allegations against Taipe in a saloon brawl. On his way to Washington, Custer discovers the perfidy of Sharp and Taipe, who have drummed a gold strike in the sacred Black Hills. Settlers romp and the Indians hit the warpath. Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at the Little Big Horn in a slam-bang showdown against 6000 redskins. "Glenn Stagecoach" lens Bert Glennon captures the sand and the glory. The foresight of the 7th Cavalry, leaving the fort at dawn, is spectacular. As an added foreshadowing of Custer's impending death, Libby dies after leaving his quarters for the Little Big Horn. "They died with their boots" benefited from a first-class Max Steiner score containing the regimental tune "Gary Owen".
