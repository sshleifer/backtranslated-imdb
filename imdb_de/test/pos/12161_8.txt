Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939, but by that time almost all of Europe was subject to the advance of the Nazi war machine. With the war Britain began practically from the beginning, with scarce supplies and an air force that was ten to one overwhelmed by Germany. The will of the British, however, was firm, encouraged by their new Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who declared, "We will never perish." On August 8, 1940, the Battle of Britain was in progress. For the first time since Hitler's declared position to conquer the world, he hit a wall. Although the British Air Force was massively defeated, she went on the offensive. In the twenty-eight days of September and October 1940, the German Air Force climbed to two thousand three hundred and seventy-five aircraft and crew. Hitler's anger boiled, but he had to take a short break. Later in the year Hitler reacted on Christmas Day in 1940 with a massive firebomb attack on London. If I say that there has never been a catastrophe film on fire with the real live recordings of London, that would be an understatement. Perhaps the most unreal effect of this chapter in the series "Why We Fight" would be when British citizens emerge from their underground shelters after the bombing to resume the remainder of life above the earth. Even if you watch, there is no way to understand the living horror that these people have had to go through, as the city of London was practically ruined. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the Nazis were baffled and weak. Everything Hitler wanted to believe in freedom and democracy was now turned upside down. Instead of being weak and strong-minded like the French, the British would not give up without a fight. And they fought, brought the Battle of Germany to Germany and responded with attacks on the German homeland in the form of natural disasters. It was a turning point that forced Hitler to reconsider his strategy.
