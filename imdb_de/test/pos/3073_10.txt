If you do not like Mel Brooks, you do not like this movie. That's a given. Why someone does not like his films is unknown to me, but for those who can not see the light, just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Everyone else: This is a classic. The entire cast is perfect: Carey Elwes is a dashing, clever British Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck acts appropriately as a Marion, Richard Lewis is his usual confused and annoyed self, Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of excitement and violence as the "Mervyn" Sheriff of Rottingham and Dave Chapelle, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield and the sadly understaffed Matthew Poretta are the perfect Merry Men. <br /> <br /> There are similarities with Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles ... and every other Mel Brooks movie. But why change his style if it works so damn well? The pop culture references in this film are old enough to be funny again ... at least from the perspective of a 16-year-old. It's a complete parody, every second a laugh. Some of them do not work, but most work fine. The fifth and sixth time I saw the movie, I discovered new jokes! <br /> <br /> If you're constantly involved in visual and verbal gags, that's not your style. This is not an Oscar winner, but Mel Brooks. You know what it is when you are dealing with it. If you want continuous laughter, surprisingly well-developed characters and slogans that last a lifetime, then look at that.
