Very good "Precoder" with Dick Barthelmess, who somehow reminded me of Hawk's "Only Angels Have Wings" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. Director was William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark of aviation. Silent picture "Wings". <br /> <br /> Barthelmess plays a devilish pilot who is blamed for an air accident. He then meets and falls in love with the pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an act on a wandering Air Circus; When Barthelmess's brother takes the stage, a triangular relationship develops. <br /> <br /> "Central Airport" has many exciting moments and some moving and moving scenes thanks to the great chemistry that develops between Barthelmess and Eilers (which, in my opinion, is very reminiscent of actress Dorothy Mackaill in this film ). Tom Brown is good as a brother of Barthelmess, fresh from his success in Wyler's "Tom Brown of Culver". <br /> <br /> Great special effects, good flying stunts, fast-paced movie; All in all, very entertaining. Do not miss it if TCM sends it again.
