When I saw this movie for the first time, I was a kid. I was ten years old when it was released, but since my family never went to the cinemas, I saw it on Network TV. I remember that I saw it alone and cried afterwards. It was just the second movie that banned this reaction (Rocky was the first) and there have not been many since. I can not say exactly why; Larry "Rain" Murphy does not deserve to win more than Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know, I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time. Stoic. He did not need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity. He ran because he could. He did not need another reason. Today I have the rule that when I see this movie on cable TV late at night (the only time it will come across), I have to look no matter what I have to do the next morning. Luckily, it does not often play like Shawshank Redemption or other favorites, so I'm still sleeping enough and I'm not getting tired of the story of a man who does not care about his personal victory.
