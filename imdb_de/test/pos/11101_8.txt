John Schelesinger's career as a film director was extraordinary. We had seen this movie when it first came out, but wanted to see it again when it was recently shown on cable. The film looks faded, as you can see it today, but it is still interesting because of the intense performances of the two main characters. If you have not seen it, please do not read on. <br /> <br /> Chris and Daulton were two childhood friends from the upper middle class. Chris went to a seminary, but gives up. Daulton became a small time drug and trafficker. The two lives seem to run in parallel as the couple becomes involved in an illegal activity that proves their nearsightedness. In fact, it shows how both young men misjudged their attempt to deceive the CIA and the Soviet Union. These two were, in a way, so naive in the thought that they could pull something that bigger and better equipped people could not even imagine what could be done. Chris's motivation is legitimate as he feels outraged at discovering the sneaky role of the agency he works with in dealing with other nations, in this case Australia, something he happens to find. If he involves Daulton, we know that the whole thing is doomed to failure because no one who uses drugs the way he is will ever achieve anything. In fact, Chris and Daulton had no idea of ​​the extent to which they try or what their consequences are. Timothy Hutton was an active actor at this time of his career. He had proven that he had talent for his work in other films, so choosing Schlesinger for him was a natural choice, a decision that pays off. Sean Penn was also a young actor who showed an intensity never before seen. At times, Mr. Penn reminded us of a young Robert Mitchum who was at it. The contribution of both actors to the film is unbelievable. You can not think who could have played this duo, but you. <br /> <br /> "The Falcon and the Snowman", while not comparable to other great films by John Schlesinger, is not an interesting sight for us.
