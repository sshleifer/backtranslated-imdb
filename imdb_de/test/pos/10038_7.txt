Of course, like everyone else, I was prepared to expect much Hollywood fantasy revisionism about the legend of Custer. Just wanting to play somebody like Errol Flynn with Custer is an indication that the legend in this production takes precedence over the truth. And my expectations were largely met (in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way). <br /> <br /> But even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the Custer story, I was impressed by a few. The points made in this film, which sometimes seemed subtle but still solid, seemed to reveal the typical stereotypes To resist the fate and unvarnished heroism common in early twentieth-century Westerns The film attempted to whitewash its hero, certain scenes still hinting at the more erroneous and foolish nature of the real custer: 1) its first entrance at the West Point Front Gate, where his arrogance and pompousie was a clear aspect of his character. His miserable record in West Point, which seems to owe Custer's ignorance of the needs of the military service as well as any other factor; There are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point, where he seems stupid. <br /> <br /> 3) Custer's promotion to general is portrayed not just as a ridiculous mistake, but as a slapstick comedy. I half expected to see the Marx brothers or Abbott and Costello in the scene. <br /> <br /> 4) Custer's stance against Jeb Stuart in Gettysburg is not a brilliant military tactical leadership, but is portrayed as reckless and reckless with very good luck. <br /> <br /> 5) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored. <br /> <br /> And though the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this movie were definitely reinforcements As the racist stereotype of the Ignorant Wild, it was still a surprise to me that the movie actually did A little detail went into why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who moved to their country, and blamed the fighting quite explicitly in the Black Hills right at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the play's clear-cut villain is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils claiming false gold in the Black Hills. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I did not expect it to be so unequivocally portrayed in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> And one more thing: Usually in these movies, the Indians are portrayed in masses as drunken animals, seemingly incapable of getting drunk on any alcoholic drink. In this film, it is actually the troops of the 7th Cavalry, not the Indians, who are portrayed in at least two scenes. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie slips the middle of the Hollywood bunk in surprising moments.
