Never Been Kissed gives Drew Barrymore the chance to do something that maybe 70% of us would like to do. Go back to high school and make the necessary corrections. Actually, the first time was bad enough for me and at my age I doubt I could do it the way Drew does. Of course, the reason might be that we leave school after graduation from Cocoon and we have to deal with the big unfriendly world out there. I have known some in my life who would go back and stay if they could. In fact, there is a Law and Order episode that explores the dark side of this situation. A girl who looks young enough to get through it goes through high school at least three times, killing the person who stumbles over her secret. <br /> <br /> With Drew it's a job. She is an editor of The Chicago Sun Times, who longs to be a reporter. The publisher Garry Marshall, who, like Donald Trump, has taken on the role of the Sun Times, gets this ingenious idea and sees Barrymore as a young-looking person who pervades the masquerade. <br /> <br /> High School was bad enough for the first time. Drew was not the most popular at the time and she does not feel better the second time around. That is, until brother David Arquette goes back to school and helps her with the rough spots. <br /> <br /> Of course this raises a whole range of problems for Drew, peer pressure, job and school peer pressure. What is a girl doing? <br /> <br /> Never Been Kissed is a light and charming comedy that exploits the chance of being crass and provides us with great entertainment. Drew is very funny and sweet and her performance in moments of stress for her character moves well in pathos. Michael Vartan, as their English teacher, wants more in education, and Leelee Sobieski and Jessica Alba play a pair of the cool, cool, cool kids that Drew so desperately contacts. <br /> <br However, it does not inspire me to return to Midwood High School.
