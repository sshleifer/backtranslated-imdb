Catherine Brreillat is a French director who loves to provoke her audience. She takes us to see how a film is filmed on location. The film in production seems to be based on itself, as Jeanne, a female director, is at the center of the story, much like Mrs. Breillat. Jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director. Jeanne gets into a dead end at the beginning of the filming. Not only did she choose the wrong time to photograph this film during a cold period, because it's beach resorts that are obviously too cold for actors and extras. Jeanne has problems with the two main characters, especially with the male lead actor who has trouble accepting the way the director has shown him in the film. The leading actress is not an angel either. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker, says Ms. Breillat, is a process like no other in a creative work of art. First, there is the writing period in which Jeanne wrote a screenplay in this case that reveals problems in the production that the author / director did not think about. There is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman in the story has her first sexual contact. What appeared smart on the written page is not necessarily translated into an easy time in front of the camera. The actor wears a fake penis and has many problems accepting the fact that a make-up has to touch him so that he never thought he would ever be touched by another man. <br /> <br /> The luminous Anne Parillaud is as Jeanne, the director, wonderful. She makes observations about the production, the actors and the crew, which fit well into the narrated story. Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play the main characters, with all the uncertainty that some actors bring to a movie set. Jeanne has to massage her ego to get what she wants in the end. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant. <br /> <br /> "Sex Is Comedy" allows Mrs. Breillet to give us her own view on movies in general. This is a great look at the way films are made in a typical Breillat style.
