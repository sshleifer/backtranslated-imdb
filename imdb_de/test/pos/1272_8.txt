The great British director Christopher Nolan (Momento, Insomnia) director of this strange film about a fighting writer obsessed by following people. This initially turned out to be harmless, but soon becomes dangerous after the game has gone a step further, after hitting a like-minded man who shows him the peculiarities of breaking and entering. The two men soon find themselves in a foreign world in which mafia and prostitution play a role. Jeremy Theobald plays the writer and Alex Haw the like-minded friend. Both are great achievements. This low-budget movie was shot entirely in guerrilla style, there were no permits for locations and no big stars, but it has what many huge budget films do not have, which is a skilful script and a creative direction. An impressive debut of one of the best directors of today. Good stuff!
