When will ART overcome racism? I think the Americans have grown up since this movie was made. Porgy consists of an excellent cast and music. This movie is a great adaptation of a great opera. Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, Les Miz is based on a classic book. Recently, an opera based on the film The Fly was released here in Los Angeles. AN OPERA!! So be it!! <br /> <br /> Disney is reluctant to release Song of the South. The NAACP has not competed in race questions, and we must not forget that Amos N Andy was a big success in the 1950's as a television series. Ethnicity is our heritage in the US, and we should consider all forms of ethnic artistic diversity. <br /> <br /> PLEASE DELETE 'PORGY' ON DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> j / hartz
