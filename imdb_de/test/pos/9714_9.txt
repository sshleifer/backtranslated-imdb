It seems everyone wants to jump on the train and say "Maha Go Go Go" ... The word is MACHA ........ Like "Mach" ..... Pronounced maa - ka "... <br /> <br /> I grew up here in LA on the late and VERY plaintive channel 56 with this series in the early 1970s ... Before, there was Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy), the 1963 old KHJ-dated TV : Astro Boy was the first TV example of anime we got here in the States ... I was anime as a kid and followed it until the late 80's until it became a series of badly animated "talking heads" was "a phenomenon that only got worse," Nuff said. <br /> <br /> As for "Speed ​​Racer," I've got the basics there, the POV shots, the cinematic aspects of the Skillfully incorporated live action into the animation ... That was pretty typical of most Japanese anime back then ... Notice how obviously the series by Stanley Kramers F ilm "Grand Prix" (1966) was inspired. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I have the original comics that make up the series, so I know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> What did we do animatedly alongside crap like Johnny Quest? ..... The same old stuff we've done since the 1920's ... Ho-hum! <br /> <br /> I guess the real problem I had with the way anime was shown on American TV is the Hatch job done with the scripts, credits, etc., for them to "rehabilitate" American audiences ... I will not go into other programs because we're talking speed here. <br /> <br /> Look at clowns like Peter Fernandez as one of the culprits here, as he was 99% responsible for re-releasing the series ... Not to mention the voice of Speed, Racer X and others ... Between him and the fools at Trans / Lux (Think Felix, the cat and the mighty Hercules - or ?!) They took a smooth, very sophisticated show and dropped them onto the plain of Sesame Street. "Cruncher Bloch "The" Forthebird Company "," Skull Duggery "... If I carry on, I'll puke. <br /> <br /> This series dates back about 40 years, but I've got The time, was sharp enough, to feel offended by muteing this and other Japanese programs ... I mean, it's obvious when someone is killed, but either removed or glossed over ... Pleeeeeze! <br /> <br /> Good Show - Unfortunately, all the newer incarnations of the series have made CRAPPY "made in Korea ", let alone" PC "content. Even the Japanese have outsourced their animation now. <br /> <br /> Try to watch the original Japanese opening on YouTube ... It shakes my spine ..... If only ...... Oh good. Robert
