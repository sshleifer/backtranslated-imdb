I enjoyed it, appreciated, will watch this movie again, because I'm sure there are subtleties that I've missed. Wonderfully busy, no exaggerated or clich√© performance or plot. Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple relationships, how people involved in each relationship are connected (or separated), how life is perceived, what position they take in relationship and life, and how they deal with confusion and joy To avoid injury and disappointment discover that things are not what they have perceived as. At first, I thought there was "observer" and "the observed," but that is not the case, we are all somehow connected, and our perceived separation is only marginal. I especially recommend the film to anyone, especially in the classroom, in social work, in religious counseling and all other people who breathe.
