Richard Norton really lights the screen in this masterpiece in Portland, Oregon. Norton, an Australian heartbreaker, plays the evil Mr. Milverstead, who runs a successful import / export business that handles both arms smuggling and female meat trafficking. Usually, the women are pulled out of their favorite club with the help of a group of thugs, of whom Bolo Yeung is the best-known player playing the role of ice. Milverstead struggles as a new policeman in town, John Kim (Britton Lee), avenges the murder of his dead associates through Milverstead's organization. If you can only see a martial arts movie this year, you should not miss this classic.
