President Harry S. Truman once said that the only thing new in the world is history that you do not know. <br /> <br /> Seven years before Richard Rhodes' outstanding Pulitzer Atomic Breathing Award, the BBC produced a seven-part mini-series, Oppenheimer, a character study of the people who designed and built the weapon that has ushered in the atomic age, and has permanently linked science and technology to the state (and especially the military), not just writing history, but forever changing the world. <br /> <br /> The production is impeccable Casting is nothing short of a miracle - not only the main characters, but also secondary characters have uncanny similarities to those depicted, notably Sam Waterston in the title role of the American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project, in the Los Alamos laboratory , New Mexico (the location he personally chose), Manning Redwood as General Leslie R. Groves, the entire Manhattan Engineering District (the official name of the project) supervised; David Suchet as a physicist and the ultimate opponent of Oppenheimer, Edward Teller (who whispered Ronald Reagan in almost 40 years later and brought us the Strategic Defense Initiative - "Star Wars") and Jana Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer. The attention to detail is consistently excellent. <br /> <br /> Part thriller, part love story - and ultimately a tragedy - this series is a chapter of world history - and that of science - that we must not forget. Highest recommendation. <br /> <br /> (NOTE: Viewers who like this series will also enjoy the 13-part series "The Ascent of Man" by Jacob Bronowski and the BBC film on Michael Frayn's play "Copenhagen.")
