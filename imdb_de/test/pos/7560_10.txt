This movie moved me so much in 1981 that I came back to the theater four times to see him again! Something I have never done for another movie. No movie makes you feel like you grew up in the 60s like Four Friends. That it brought my own experiences in the 60s so close, is probably shared by many. Jodi Thelen is radiantly beautiful and unforgettable! I will never know why she did not become a star afterwards. The acting of the entire cast is as flawless as that of Steve Tisch. I always wanted to know how much of the story is autobiographical. But unfortunately Steve is not here to answer that question. I have worn out almost all my VHS copy of this great movie! Highly recommended!
