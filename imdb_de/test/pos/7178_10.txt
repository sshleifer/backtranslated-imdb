A movie of high intelligence and activity. The film is not only a strong capsule of the time and personality of the 60s, but also a surprise in its forward-looking topics and the unique presentation of the power system in a group. William Greaves appoints himself to the significant role in the group. He asks his crew members to film and film and continue to film. First the two actors, then the crew that filmed the actors, then the entire set of spectators, policemen and finally a homeless man who has been living in the bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks. <br /> <br /> Greaves edits the movie (thousands of feet) together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting arc and motivations. Do not expect to be bored by this movie. Each crew provides dedicated conversationalists and often expresses the thoughts the viewer has watching this movie. Greaves works well with integrating multiple camera shots with synchronized three-in-one images and other attention shifting techniques. In the end, the movie will only be effective if that's what you're looking for: If you're looking for an abstract artistic film that feeds your own selfish ego without having a point, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a movie where you have to think long and think about the need for honesty and sincerity in the documented "reality" and the inevitable transparency, this is the perfect movie.
