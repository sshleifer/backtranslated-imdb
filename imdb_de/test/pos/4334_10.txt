The movie is incredible, it has a soundtrack that sets the tone for the movie. The lines in the movie are great, like "Nothings to good for out friends" and "His collection time." Charlie's collection time. I can watch this movie again and again and still laugh because the lines and the action are unique. I have the feeling that when I see this movie, I want to go out and film bad guys. "They killed the Giggler man, they killed the giggler." "They had no right to do that, but our turf does not care." The lines just go on in the movie. Deff. Go out and do not lend this movie.
