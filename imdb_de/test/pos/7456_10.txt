Perhaps the deepest cartoon of the US, "Duckman", shortens in four seasons on 70 episodes. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the often innocuous criticism in "The Simpsons" (a pretty good own show) and the rude humor in "South Park", every track in this series follows a plan. The criticism of US society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, has a lot more bite than any other animated series. <br /> <br /> The cultural references in "Duckman" also tend to be dark at times (all who surf) Fansites will find that most of them have not even been caught, unlike "The Simpsons "which usually uses pop culture rather than the stuff often hidden in 'Duckman.'" As other people write about it, they notice an increase in characters (Bernice, Duckman, and Cornfed), not just turning the protagonist into an insulting neurotic but actually to someone who is going through a personal tragedy (as in episodes like "The Once and Future Duck") becomes clear ("you will love them until the end of your days) ...") and in "Bev Takes a Holiday "(as he tells Beverly all the things he could not tell Beatrice), the series is anchored in the deep sense of reality. <br /> <br /> One can not help but stand up for him and his lucid madness sorry. <br /> <br /> All In my opinion, it's the best cartoon produced in the US, and one of the best series I've ever done. However, it will ever be released on DVD. Far too many things are much more useful today.
