The only thing I really can not forget about this movie is its beginning: classic comedy, brilliantly done. I love it. Convince yourself (no spoilers here!) :-). The sparring between DeVito and Crystal shines in this movie, where DeVito is the perfect suppressed son. One of my favourites. Highly recommended for fans of Crystal.
