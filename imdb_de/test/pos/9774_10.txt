This would be by far the biggest series I have ever seen. I vividly watched every Sunday night and bought the set as it became available. This is a timeless piece written by a fantastic Australian who can identify people of all ages, whether they are Australians or not, but for those of us who are Australian, the typical Australian icon is shown. A must see 10/10
