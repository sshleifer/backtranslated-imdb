An opera diva has an accident that leaves her the door open to take over the role. Betty (Marsillach) is now the star of Mac Beth, but someone who hides in the trenches has planned his own opera. He does his tricks to tie Betty, to pin down needles (so she can not close them), and to assassinate members of the opera society in front of her eyes. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is certainly one of Argento's more ambitious films, such as the blending with Shakesphere's Macbeth, are, of course, the fact that the opera Giuseppe Verdis played in the movie is Macbeth's version, as well as Argento's Shakespeare ravens used as a sign of death and misfortune. And as the ravens circling Dunsinane Castle announced the demise of the vanquished Macbeth, the ravens in OPERA play a key role in the downfall of the killer. As in the old play, the murderer also acts on the admonition of his beloved. However, I do not want to go that far and say that OPERA should be a remake of the Phantom of the Opera or Macbeth. The similarities are far too subtle. It's just a typical Argento masterpiece and gives this otherwise pretty simple thriller a vivid tone of Gothic mysticism. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is detrimental, the heavy metal soundtrack just does not fit in With this movie and the final scenes in this movie, it's a bit strange. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Opera" is something of a flawed masterpiece, but still good.
