After spending five years in prison, dr. Thomas Reed, played by the incomparable Vincent Ventresca, exiled himself to the Purgatory Flats and joined the bar. He soon meets the lush, angelic Sunny (Alexandra Holden). "You are totally crazy." He tells her. "You have no idea." She answers as she sips her Slo Comfortable Screw and hesitantly pulls on her Zig. Reed has fallen into the violent troubles of her family, and the story of the Femme Fatale unfolds against the desperation and despair of the oil-rich western city. Great achievements. Excellent entourage work. And some fun scenes that sizzle like the sun in the Purgatory.
