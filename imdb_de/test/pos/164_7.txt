Three children are born during a solar eclipse and turn into hideous, murderous little tykes who are suspected by everyone except Joyce (Lori Lethin) and her younger brother Timmy. That's the story in a nutshell. Acting in this is tolerable for the most part. Notable for MTV-J Julie Brown (not the 'Downtown'), who shows some skin, and a very early part (Albiet Small) for Michael Dudikoff. Not a great movie, but in the category "Killer Kids" it's a bit of a guilty pleasure. Eye Candy: Julie Brown shows T & A (so far the only film) to claim that honor); Sylvia Wright gets topless <br /> <br /> DVD extras (R1): 16-minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg (insulting director AND Canada, great stuff); Biography of Ed Hunt; and followers for "Kiss the Taratula", "Do not open the door" and a red ribbon for "homework" (with nudity) <br /> <br /> My Rating: B-
