I heard news about this movie from anime legend Hayao Miyazaki, and I really wanted to see it. But I was fortunate to see the movie online on YouTube. After watching the movie, I knew it was another classic from Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by my favorite fairy tale "The Little Mermaid", is a 5-year-old boy named Sosuke and his relationship with a goldfish princess whom he named Ponyo afterward longing to become human and to be with Sosuke. I do not give you any details anymore, you have to see the movie yourself. All in all one of the best animated films of all time with a lot of fantasy, adventure and humor ... I loved it!
