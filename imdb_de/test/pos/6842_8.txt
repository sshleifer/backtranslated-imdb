Recently came through this movie after hearing about it for so long. It's an excellent, non-pretentious movie for people who love film noir literature and movies. No "camp", but humorous. <br /> <br /> GREAT CAST! From the great Carla Gugino and Emma Thompson to the German superstar Til Schweiger, this film is a feast for the eyes. Alan Rickman is very funny as an antagonist of the gang. I'd like to see a spin-off movie with this character and Emma Thompson, who is constantly resolving cases and disputes between them (like Tracy and Hepburn, etc.). Smart story, nice twists and wide shot photography (don't watch, unless scope is because compositions are very rich. <br /> <br /> Sexy sexy sexy and very fun time. <br /> <br /> Best use Just Like Heaven by The Cure Ever (must see to believe!) <br /> <br /> ********
