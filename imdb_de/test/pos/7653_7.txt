I liked this movie in the end, but it was not the easiest way to go through it. What makes the movie great is the music and the scenery. The songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. A great job has been done to show different attitudes towards the people of Rome. <br /> <br /> The viewer, however, was not guided enough. A more in-depth history of the Roman people would have been nice. Only a fraction of the spoken words were provided with English subtitles. In addition, further explanations of attitudes and who her and some of her challenges were were greatly appreciated. It would have helped, even if a narrator would explain about customs, clothing and music.
