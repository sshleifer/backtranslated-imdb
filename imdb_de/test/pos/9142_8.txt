I have already submitted my commentary on this film under the name BruceV3. Now I want to add something under BruceV13! After a long time, I have seen many so-called heroic bloodshed titles! But not many come close to action in John Woo movies! That's why I find it strange after all these years that "China White" does not get the recognition it deserves! No matter which version you have seen! The action is first class! The landscape of China Town in Amsterdam is very unique. You have the impression that it is a big neighborhood. Having lived in Amsterdam myself, I know that it is only a small part of the Red Light District, home to many Chinese shops and restaurants. However, due to the way they made the film, it actually looks like a big and important area where people know they can not mess with triads (Chinese Mafia)! In addition to the action, "China White" is a captivating gangster drama with good acting! For that, I have to honor Russel Wong! Too bad we have not seen much of him lately because he has a lot of potential! Must see movie!
