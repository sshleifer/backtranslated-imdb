This is probably one of my favorites so far, although I have the first one and have seen Curse, Legacy and vs Demonic Toys. The only one better than this is PM vs. DT. Curse is the worst in the series, as the first and then his legacy. I recommend people to see this and against DT. Those who say that stench is so wrong, the story is well written and it's a sweet movie. This is a classic movie that younger children can watch and are not that scared of watching the others. Well, this is my review, you can call me Gipdac (it's easy to know where it came from: 101 Dalmatian series, you can see it on Toon Disney at 4:00 pm). Oh, and do not laugh, I'm a guy, you'll see more of my reviews in time. If you want to know why I see it? I'm 12! Advice: Eat a mental meal, arrrrroooooooooo! I also agree with you, Motter-1, but why people like the others are so is because they are more exciting than horror and because the puppets look more frightening. You can also call me Gipdac.
