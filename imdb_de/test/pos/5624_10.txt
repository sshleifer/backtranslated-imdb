Chris Smith's American Movie is a revealing exploration of the American dream. The film focuses on Mark Borchardt, an independent filmmaker from Wisconsin. Mark has dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had a Hi8 camera with no focus. The film follows Mark by his attempt to shoot his dream movie Northwestern. There are a number of funny scenes in the film, while Mark performs the preproduction of Northwestern and later his short film Coven (pronounced co-ven, the right pronunciation, says Mark "sounds too much like oven"), which he intends to use, to raise money to complete Northwestern. The insight and humor of this film are comparable to Roger and me, the great movie by Michael Moore. I first saw it in a chaotic Sundance Film Festival screening that expressed the spirit of the film - a huge air duct dropped from the ceiling at the beginning of the film, struck seven people, causing a delay of twenty-five minutes; Half of the film fluttered and the projector had to be stopped to fix it. In the last twenty minutes, the projector was stopped and the movie was on fire. Despite the delays, the audience remained in the film and gave it a standing ovation. American Movie also won the Jury Award for Documentary Films at the end of the festival. I highly recommend this beautiful movie.
