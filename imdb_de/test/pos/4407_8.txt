I saw "The Knowledge" at a Thames Television marathon at one of the local independent stations in Los Angeles when it was new. I really enjoyed it, along with the danger of UXB. <br /> <br /> That a movie that I saw more than twenty years ago should be remembered so well bears witness to its originality and the quality of the performers. <br /> <br /> I searched for a DVD copy here in the USA and found none. I finally played on Ebay and bought a UK DVD and was thrilled that there is no region code. Those of us who would like to see this little gem can get a copy.
