Here we have the inimitable Charlie Chaplin, who has left his slapstick behind to deal with the serious issue of anti-Semitism and intolerance in general. He portrays two characters - the sweet, innocent Jewish barber - a war veteran and the raging and ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel. The Jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long, depending on his mood that day or this week, due to the whims of Hynkel and his armed thugs routinely stirring up or leaving his people in peace. The barber is among them, but he's friends with his former commander Schultz (Reginald Gardner), who seems to hold still for a while until Hynkel condemns him to a concentration camp. He seeks refuge with the Jews in the ghetto, especially the barber, and with the young woman Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The premise will be: Who will be the one who puts his life on the line to get rid of Hynkel and his cronies? We do not have to guess too hard to know the answer; The barber is a dead bell to the dictator, and he is equipped in his picture, accompanied by Schultz, also in full military equipment. Hannah escapes with some of her ghetto friends to the land of Easter, where the cousin of Mr. Jaeckel (Maurice Moscovich) has a farm, and they can live peacefully for a while. At this time, Hynkel himself was arrested by his forces and considered him the notorious barber. The latter was meanwhile accompanied by Schultz on a podium to give a speech about the conquest of Easter. The following ten minutes are pure Chaplin himself. He speaks out of tolerance, love and freedom and rejects greed and hatred. Although Chaplin began producing the film in 1937, he can be forgiven for being naive. He was reportedly unaware of the severity of the persecution and hatred and said that if he had known the full extent, he would never have made the film because he most likely believed it would have trivialized the situation. He has a wonderful side cast: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, his aide, the always wonderful Billy Gilbert as a bumble-bee herring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie as dictator Napaloni, embittered European actors, among others David Gorcey (Leo's father), Maurice Moscovich. The scene he has choreographed with Globus, only with musical accompaniment, is sheer, brilliant inspiration and also luminous is Paulette Goddard at the end of the film and smiles through her tears. I have seen this movie before, but there is always something new for me. The last evening, when it was finished, I was in tears. I challenge everyone not to move.
