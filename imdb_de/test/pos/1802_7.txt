I am glad that Cage changed his name from Coppolla and got this part on his own. Carefree, no deep thought necessary, but a sweet piece about opposites attracts - even though their parents are still hippies ... Captures the voice of the early '80s - the whining of the valley and the funk of the other side. You can see the beginning of Cage's talent.
