My wife and children are a good and funny series that really shows the worries and problems that are most common in even the best families. Michael Kyle (daddy) is a man who always tries to stop his kids from doing teenage things like celebrating, drinking, loving or liaising. If they do something wrong, they are there to correct them (by the way they impose bad punishments). <br /> <br/> Janet 'Jay' Kyle (mother) has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband. She understands that her children are teenagers and loves to do "wrong" things, unlike Michael. Michael Kyle 'Jr' is a stupid guy who believes in everything that other people say. He's such a cool guy at the beginning of the series and tries to be like his dad, but lately, I do not know why, he's becoming a very stupid guy and he's becoming a problematic guy. At the end of the series, he falls in love with Vanessa and becomes a father, or, I should say, a dumb dad who does not do anything right. Kady Kyle is a typical teenager who enjoys celebrating, kisses and loves drinks. She has a lot of problems with her parents because of their privacy. She has a friend named Tony, who is Catholic and above all scared, so we can not understand why she goes out with him. I can remember an episode in which they are ready to have sex, but Michael Kyle is afraid that sex is very dangerous and deadly. He decides to protect himself until he is married. <br /> <br /> the best series of my life and I still watch them every day after three years, so I recommend them to everyone - mostly for teenagers.
