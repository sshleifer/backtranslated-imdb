David Cronenberg's "eXistenZ" well reflects the philosophy of existentialism. It deals with the problems of a culture bound to technologies that can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between organic and mechanical. The film shocks the audience with the replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolic. In this context, technology can be part of the human body. After the virtual reality game of 'eXistenZ', the real world feels like a game, and as a result, human behavior changes to use violent play instincts after the game. In eXistenZ, the technology of machines has evolved into biological organisms that connect directly to the human nervous system. an idea that reflects Marshall McLuhan's conviction that a well-known media theorist is that computers are extensions of human consciousness. Just as the telephone is an extension of the ear, television is an extension of the eye, the telegram an extension of the central nervous system. High-tech virtual reality is an extension of human consciousness. Technology is more biological in eXistenZ and thus more human than in our world. However, with the organic evolution of technology, people become more mechanical and therefore less free and can not resist their game drives. eXistenZ is a virtual real estate simulation of the existence of man. Jean Baudrillard describes in his book "Simulacra and Simulation" a mediated society in which all power has been transformed into action. The world has gone into a pure simulation of itself. In eXistenZ it is obvious to see Baudrillard's mediated society with the themes of invading the body, losing control and transforming the self into others. <br /> <br /> While in the eXistenZ, awareness is slowly being replaced by another identity, your role in the game, which reflects the real subconscious of each individual. As you step by step gain control of your hyperreal life, the aura of your real life vanishes. For Baudrillard, "simulations or simulacra" have become more than truly hyperreal. Our hyperreality, like the world of Cronenberg's computer simulation, "feels right now and is in every sense more real than what we call the real world." (Baudrillard) The purpose of the game, which can basically be called "experience," is quite metaphorical. Because you can not even know what experience is, if you do not experience it. As existentialists say, a life without an exact explanation is absurd, the game of eXistenZ is also absurd. Ironically, Cronenberg reflects the absurdity of our lives. For example, the other roles in the game simply stand still, unless you ask them a pre-programmed question. And when you put your aimless, weird-looking state into the portrayal of our lives, the exposed absurdity really shocks. <br /> <br /> The theme of the game is to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphorical question scares people who play eXistenZ. They have no doubt about their existence, but they do not know the underlying cause of their existence. The essence. <br /> <br /> The existentialists have found that humans have no fixed nature or essence, as is the case with other animals and plants. Everyone makes decisions that create their own nature. In the formulation of the French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre of the 20th century, the existence precedes the essence. The choice is therefore central to human existence and inevitable. Even the refusal to vote is a choice. Freedom of choice means commitment and responsibility. Since individuals can freely choose their own path, existentialists have argued they must take the risk and responsibility to follow their commitment to where it leads. 'Perhaps I should mention that' eXistenZ 'also deals with the concept of freedom of choice. You reach your final role in the game by making the right decisions. If you do not, the game will be ineffective and boring. So you begin to question the game, your existence, not your essence. You are suddenly alienated from the game and recognize your position outside of the game. As a last word, eXistenZ is a well-designed inverse simulation of life and thus of existentialism. <br /> <br />
