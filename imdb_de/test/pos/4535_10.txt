Holy Schnikey! This movie rocks! The duo of Chris Farley and David Spade is great. My favorite parts are "Fat Guy in a small coat, oh my god, room service and more scenes that will be remembered for years to come." This movie has a big cult, I wonder why, what that eleven years after Chris proves Farleys tragic death and he's still popular, he plays Tommy, who makes you laugh everytime you still look at him, he's a great comedian and is missing, Mr. Spade reminds me of Dan Akyroid, while Chris Farley reminds me reminiscent of John Belushi, they have made more than two films together, this film is a must and should be in the Snl fan collection.
