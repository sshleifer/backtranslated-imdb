Dan Dailey, as a great Dizzy Dean, gives a sincere and colorful performance. His handling of the character is very lifelike and captures the taste of Dean's background and limited education. The film, of course, revolves around Dizzy Deans, who decided to fame and his sudden trip to the sidelines with an injury he ignored to his regret. His wife is excellently portrayed by Joanna Dru, who gives a very down-to-earth quality to the woman who loved and supported the ballplayer, who quickly achieved "dizzying heights". The portrayal of Dizzy's later career as a sports reporter is honest and unyielding, reflecting his problems due to his poor training and colorful speech both in and out of the air. Dizzy was quite a character and Daily breathed life into his story with admirable skill. If you liked this movie, I recommend the comedy "Kid from Left Field" (1953), in which Daily plays a run-down and defeated by his little son (Billy Chapin) ball player. The ball player is daily again completely satisfactory designed. I wholeheartedly recommend Pride of St. Louis to all baseball fans.
