Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are great at this depiction of a Vietnamese veterinarian from the war who is still persecuted. Bates plays an unsuspecting mother who just wants the family to be a "family." Sheen is fantastic as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through, but is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize. The setting is Thanksgiving Day and the relatives come for dinner. Estevez, who plays the returning veterinarian, does not want to know about the family tradition and insists on wearing his combat suits for dinner. The disputes and family arguments are invaluable, especially the "peanut crisis crisis", but the end is gripping and frightening. It has to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Overall one of the best movies I have ever seen.
