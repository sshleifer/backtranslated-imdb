The filming of 1978 had all the ingredients of a possibly wonderful movie. It is based on an absolutely charming book by Charles Kingsley. It's a really talented cast of James Mason, Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson, not to mention the vocal talents of David Jason and Jon Pertwee. There's also Lionel Jeffries, the director of wonderful classics like The Railway Children and The Amazing Mr Blunden, and although the movie is mostly good, he was also a bit disappointing. I had no problems with the performances, especially those of Mason and Tomblinson as Grimes and Sir John Harriet. Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are believable like Tom and Ellie. Praiseworthy is also the voice cast, especially Jon Pertwee, who expresses charming characters. I also liked the random music that is so haunting and beautiful, and the script was pretty faithful and generally well written, especially at the beginning. The characters, especially the water babies, are very charming, and the bad guys are scary and funny at the same time. I loved the fun of Tom and his friends who helped the water babies to escape. However, I'll say that the movie looks outdated, especially the animation sequences, the live action parts were not so bad if you forgive the rather dark camera work. The animation of the characters was rather flat and the backgrounds were sometimes boring, although there were some nice moments, like the scene with the Krakon and of course the first meeting with the water babies. I also had mixed feelings about the songs, the song of the Water Babies was beautiful, but I found the first song memorable when Tom landed underwater. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of a song that is like Marmite, either you love it or hate it. I do not know what to do with this song. It was fun to listen to it first, but once it's in your head, it may be annoying. As much as I like Lionel Jeffries and his films, he was lacking in miracles and magic in his direction. All in all, certainly not a terrible movie, but could have been better artistically. Bethany Cox.
