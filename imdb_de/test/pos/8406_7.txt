I grew up with GWTW and have avoided both the successor book "Scarlett" and the mini-series so far. When I first saw the video for the first time, I was amazed at how much I enjoyed watching Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Rhett Butler and Joanne Walley-Kilmers as a scarlet. I think "Scarlet" should be judged on its own merits, rather than trying to compare it to the venerable Selznick masterpiece GWTW. While the story "Scarlet" and some dialogues suffered from lack of inspired writing, I found it all to be a worthwhile dramatization of what might have been between Scarlett and Rhett.
