Anand is one of those low budget movies, but well received. It's a "cup of coffee" - entertainment, without violence, blood or excitement that most Telugu films have. However, it does have some of its own massala. Roopa is a wayward and down to earth young woman who is not afraid to face a situation, even if she is the offending mother-in-law for her. She even retires from the wedding because her fianc√© does not stand up for her. However, her self-confidence and independence are enough to make Anand, a wealthy urban gentleman, become her new husband. His father accidentally kills her parents in a car accident. So why not pay back? But Roopa is not the type who will fall in love with charming smiles and polite behavior. She leads him through a series of situations that are still rude and painful. Only when he stands up for her and saves her life does she understand that she loves him too. But complications follow?
