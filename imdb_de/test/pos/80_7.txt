The "good news" is that the circus is in town. The "bad news" is right about Bugs Bunny's subway home. He wakes up as his place shakes like an earthquake as workers push into the ground and stomp elephants. <br /> <br /> To be more specific, the lion cage is placed just above bugs. Hole. The lion sniffs at food and by extinguishing he realizes that it is a rabbit. Bugs, curious what the whole racket is all about, meander through the tunnel and snake into the mouth of Leo's cartoon for at least 30 seconds. When he comes to his senses, he runs like mad and we get a lion-against-a-rabbit fight the rest of the way. Again, Bugs faces a foolish adversary, one he calls "Nero," but Leo is ferocious, and bugs will need all his brains and a little false bravado to fend off this beast, and the other half funny, but always fast-paced, colorful and good enough to recommend. I mean, it's not commonplace for you to see a lion on a harness or do a hula dance!
