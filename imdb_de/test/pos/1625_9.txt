As a fan of the book, this work is fantastically adapted; remain true to the source material and show an honest respect for the literary work. The intrigues are well translated into films thanks to Ron Howard's keen eye for detail and dedication to authenticity. <br /> <br /> I like Hanks as Robert Langdon. His portrayal is sincere and earthy, with only the slightest glow of the kip we all knew and loved, back in "the day". He is a good dramatic actor, and although I miss his comedic efforts, I enjoy his more serious performances. <br /> <br /> The topic is no less controversial than the DaVinci code, and the Vatican never seems to learn anything about its lesson. As with the aforementioned film, the Holy See made a vile censure and called for a worldwide Catholic boycott of the film, which of course generated millions of ticket sales. <br /> <br /> Although the story of the "God Particle" was dramatically downplayed, and science was written from this piece of science fiction, the fiction that remained was entertaining and extremely well done, but the truth is It is well known that people who have not read the book will not notice a missing or lesser element of the story, since the screen version wears well the main story itself. <br /> <br /> Actually It is not necessary to have the first installment of this franchise to have seen this second, which in all honesty should have been a trailblazer, though this does not diminish the effectiveness nor interfere with the continuity or flow of this second work. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is good for a Friday / Saturday evening, although the run for the little ones may be a bit rough. <br /> <br /> It rates a 8.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br / > the Fiend :.
