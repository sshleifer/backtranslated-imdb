Although not Hal Hartley's best work (my personal favorite is "Surviving Desire"), there is still much to like about this film, especially for fans of Hartley's dialogues. Even for Hartley newbies, I would definitely recommend this movie to Dogma. This movie is smarter, more authentic for the source material (the Bible) and more fun than any other pre-Millennium Apocalypse films (2000 Par Vu) series, as such it may even be a movie with one While the need for simple scenes shot with a digital camera is understandable in this context, the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of the blurry / jittery effect. I would be happy to see this effect in Never to see a movie again, especially in the beginning it makes the movie almost unsurpassable, but overlook this mistake and you will be treated to a good movie, notably Magdalena (played by PJ Harvey), in which he tells how Jesus saved her from death to death - a short scene that I found surprisingly moving (despite the fact that this was NOT Mar Magdalena was, this was the case; the woman in the Bible was not named.) <br /> <br />
