I could see this movie ALL DAY! I love it. Probably my favorite movies of all time. By the way, "Badger1970", there are some parts with bad language, not too bad, but it is not exactly G. Great movie !!!!! I recommend it to anyone. Anyway, I type in 10 lines of text, so I keep typing until I can post that comment. Okay ... I'm still writing ... It's going to be annoying. Pooh. I have four more. Anyway, watch this movie! Even if you have already seen it. I'm not interested! Was it already 10 lines? Nope. Only 2 lines left. I do not even know why I want that. I think I'm done. Wait a minute, I'm NOT finished, I'm sorry, folks. I know it's torture to listen to me. I think you MUST NOT read this comment ... But you should, because I wrote it. I'm probably ready now. Bye bye.
