A breathtaking view of the sea and the life in it. <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is beautifully done. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see all the different animals that I could never have imagined. David Attenborough has the perfect voice of the narrator. Nobody could have done better. <br /> <br /> The Bath: <br /> <br /> There were one or two different times when it was related that the earth was 1 million years old (I think that's another belief ). <br /> <br /> Overall, a television series can be enjoyed by anyone. I highly recommend it. 10/10 stars.
