I love this movie! It has everything! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job writing, directing, and starring in this movie. David Duchovny is just hot. and Minnie Driver is as sweet as ever. Combine this talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson and Jim Belushi. You have an Oscar-worthy movie! I'm surprised they did not get one. If you have not seen it, borrow the DVD, watch the DVD once and put the commentary from the directors ... Bonnie Hunt is fabulous!
