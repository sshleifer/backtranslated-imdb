Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you would see in a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it is a bit too short. Nevertheless, it is very gratifying to see Colin Dunne. It is an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progress of the show is obvious, changes from the original Dublin production are obvious. <br /> <br /> "Trading Taps" is in my opinion the highlight of the video. Tarik Winston is incredible, as is his partner in the play. <br /> <br /> I think the audio in this version was better than the original video production (1995). In Dolby 5.1 on DVD it is excellent. Despite the faulty videography, it is a must for Riverdance fans.
