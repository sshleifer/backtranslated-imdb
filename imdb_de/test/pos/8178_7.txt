The tempo of the movie is sometimes cumbersome, but if you can adjust to the slow speed and the long silence, this is a satisfying piece of courtly intrigue. The story of the first emperor of China, the love of his childhood and the personal costs of power. The film is very atmospheric, the extremely polite and polite ceremony and the ritual contrast with sudden brutal violence. Filmed in a way reminiscent of shadows and cold rooms. Fighting scenes are rare and short, with the focus on the struggle within the individual, which is right, and whether the ends justify the means. The emperor's journey from the idealistic peacemaker to the merciless tyrant is said to be subtle, but gives little background or convincing insight into the Emperor's motivation. In fact, his actions and goals do not really change; The most interesting performances are Gong Li and the Titular Assassin, when they reconsider when they fight, when they retire, when they kill. The most expensive film shot in China at the time, emperors and assassins, does not rely on hysterical emotions or big battles, but rather on a brooding atmosphere of threat and inevitability. Gong Li fans will not be surprised to hear that it is so breathtakingly beautiful it has never been before, and offers unobtrusive performance.
