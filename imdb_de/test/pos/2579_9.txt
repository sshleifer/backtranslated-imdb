Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, as shown in his film. Forget about the Black at the action "White Girl". It happens, but it's not Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly, this film is about the values ​​and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How to Deal with Divorce, Abandonment, Sexual Abuse and Mental Disorders. While millions are shrinking in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the city minister, who also deals with his own problems, becomes a consultant and mediator. It is an interesting concept and one that can not be reconciled with everyone. Brewer shows us the region where he grew up. Yes, it is still fraught with racial issues, although there are even worse problems in many major cities. This is in the subtext, not the main story. People live a simpler lifestyle, but life is still complex and distressing. <br /> <br /> Jackson and Ricci are doing a fantastic job in this movie. Jackson, the aging blues guitarist looking for a livelihood on his small farm. His 12-year-old leaves him for his brother, causing him depression. Meanwhile, Ricci and Justin Timberlake have one last wild sexually charged night before he embarks on the army. Ricci suffers from a childhood sexual abuse, but this is revealed later. Their torment can only be erased by sexual rambles with different boys (Black and White) in the city. When Ricci is beaten and dead on the road near Jackson's farm, he finds her and nurses her healthily. He believes it is divine intervention that this half-naked white girl remains in his care. He reaches for his Bible and prays for guidance. He rejects her sexual advances and instead treats them with dignity, respect and care. Something few men have ever done in their lives. <br /> <br /> She sees Jackson as a man of honor and morality over time, but he also carries his own pain. He plays guitar and sings to her. Yes, it's the blues and damn good. As the minister advises her, she slowly begins to understand how to deal with sexual abuse in her childhood. Through Ricci's transformation, Jackson realizes that he needs to heal his own pain. Justin Timberlake returns, dismissed for "anxiety issues". While searching for Ricci, who lived with Jackson during his recovery, he learns that she was disloyal and unfaithful to him. <br /> <br /> He finds her and Jackson in a bar where Jackson has decided (as part of his healing process) to retire and play the blues again. Timberlake follows them home and confronts Jackson and Ricci. <br /> <br /> You have to watch the movie to get the rest of the story. If you choose this film, remember to look at it from the perspective of a foreign or independent film. It is a piece of life from a particular region of America that few of us see. It is interesting and enlightening. It also shows us that, regardless of the color of the skin, we have similar problems that can be solved with similar solutions.
