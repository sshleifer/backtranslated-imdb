John Huston has made many remarkable and memorable films. Those most frequently and easily remembered were released long before his death in 1987. This year, however, we were reminded that Huston was still at the top of his game, as shown by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's haunted novella, "The Dead." "<br /> <br /> A long time ago, a very wise man called Doc asked me," Does not The Dead seem remarkably livelier and brighter than any of the other stories in Dublin? "I tend to think that way The story and the film contain some of Joyce 's social commentary and criticisms, but usually paint a warm and affectionate portrait of an Ireland that Joyce herself has often berated and would soon go back to. <br /> <br / > Huston's approach to the protagonist Gabriel Conroy, who sees the world as he sees it as nothing more than an illusion, is simply noteworthy, claiming that the film lacks the plot means missing out on the point Dubliner of Joyce does not focus on the storyline - though most likely - Plot is just a tool to convey the epiphany of the protagonist, except for a seeming lack of action in Jo yce's short story apparently little dialogue on which the director can rely. Huston's ability to translate what Joyce puts into words is perhaps the film's biggest triumph. Emotions, thoughts ... Gabriel's discomfort during the dance ... all these immaterial goods come to life and come within the reach of the viewer in Huston's portrayal. <br /> <br /> Claiming that Huston has softened his writer's critique of society is failing. While "The Dead" can be painted with a cheerful hue, the complacency and appearance of the characters in the film is just a commentary on society on a smaller scale: we are the toddling old aunts; the embarrassing drunk; the tenor with sore throat; the woman with the sad, rain-soaked secret; even the deceived middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> But "The Dead" denies its title. It is not a dark story. It's not that dark either. Forget for a moment the snow that falls on the living and the dead, and the inherent symbolism; Forget the chaos of a life that Gabriel awakens at the end of the movie: Only with the destruction of the illusions that Gabriel has of himself and his world can he really move forward. This is the central point of the movie. This is the central point of our lives.
