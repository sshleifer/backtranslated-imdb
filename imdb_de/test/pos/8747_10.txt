I was disappointed with the recent American remake (2000) of this English miniseries. Although it followed the plot very closely, it seemed to skip the heart and soul of the original. Not to mention the addition of flat, preacher "messages" ... So my advice is to skip the modern remake and stick to the original. It is much longer, but captivating and absolutely well done. Interesting, complex and structured, without the preachy self-righteousness ... and it's also shot beautifully. <br /> <br /> I find it annoying that these heartless remakes of great overseas movies get so much Hollywood fanfare on stage Oscars (Although I liked Benicio Del Torro, who deserved praise ...)
