I must confess that I have been a big fan of almighty David "the Hoff" Hasselhoff ever since he starred in the hit 80's television hit "Knight Rider." Whether it's his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilarious "Revenge of the Cheerleaders" or his brilliant portrayal of a dashing prince in the jazzy sci-fi gem "Starcrash", the Hoff keeps coming back He is a terrific (and shamefully underrated) actor. The Hoff characterizes himself as Gary, a cynical and skeptical photographer who, along with his repressed, virgin writer Leslie (attractive brunette Leslie Cummings) examines a run-down, run-down hotel on a remote island off the coast of Massachussetts. They have been researching witchcraft for a long time and the last owner of the hotel was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts. There is also a family on the property visiting the hotel. Pretty soon, various people are repelled in various, cruel ways by the mysterious Lady in Black (an ineffectually sinister Hildegard Knef). Admittedly, the rest of the cast gives the Hoff a fight for its money: The always lively Linda Blair projects her usual charming flair as a spunky pregnant woman who is finally obsessed (natch!), and the legendary jazz singer Annie Ross vilifies her with happy Aplomb like an old old bat (poor Annie gets burned) alive after she has her lips sewn up and she's hung upside down in a chimney, and the beautiful blonde Catherine Hickland shines out of everyone Outstanding pore a significant sex appeal as a lustful slut. Fabrizio Laurenti's competent direction, a corresponding spooky atmosphere, the smooth, brilliant cinematography of Gianlorenzo Battaglia (the flowing Steadicam tracking shows are particularly beautiful), the gaudy special effects, Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Miller's spirited Shuddery'n'spooky score and the Gory sadistic violence is all equivalent. But in the end, it is the enormously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only Hoff that turns this selection into a tasty piece of sticky Italian horror cheese: he takes off his shirt (hubba hubba!), Gets splashed with blood and - - WARNING: Major * SPOILER * ahead - even meets a pleasingly cruel, untimely end. Produced by none other than Joe D'Amato, this picture is rated overall as a good, dirty fun.
