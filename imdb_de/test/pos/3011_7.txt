I had no expectations when I started watching this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie that will give your mind a good workout! It's not easy If you only want to enjoy films from the Police Academy, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex movie with influences from movies such as Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man as well as many completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story make this movie one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! Be open minded and you will love it!
