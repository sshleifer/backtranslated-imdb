I've always believed that a movie that's a plot centered around a virtual reality video game never sounds like it's special, but eXistenZ has proved that I could not go wrong. This movie is unbelievable and, although entertaining, offers much more. From beginning to end, this film has been designed to give you so many ideas that you can not draw a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has a talent for doing so many things. EXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; The way it is written and the direction in which it is directed is very unique to its style, and that can only be a good thing. Cronenberg has set a clear goal with this film. The goal was to guess the audience, which he did with apparent ease. His preference for the grotesque is not as prevalent in this film as in The Fly or Naked Lunch, but there are still some elements like the game pods and how they are made that can make the audience falter. In terms of his earlier work, eXistenZ is more a combination of videodromes and less violent scanners, a pretty great combination. The setting of the film in the not-too-distant future was a really good decision, as Cronenberg was extremely imaginative about the film's environment and could also visualize more concepts, so that the writing was less obstructed. It was important that the movie did not get too confusing, and Cronenberg avoided that very well, keeping things relatively simple. If he wanted to make an unsurpassed movie, he would also know a lot better than this one. EXistenZ has an extremely talented cast of character actors who all perform very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives the outstanding performance as a game designer who spends more time out of reality than in it. Leigh is sexy and dominant in her role as Allegra, and she really gets into the role. The emotional range she shows in the movie is particularly impressive and makes her absolutely believable (if you can believe something). Jude Law is also good and convinced by his implantation fears. The chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film a special touch. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are just two of the big supporting actors who give the film more depth with very colorful performances. The cast of the film is not huge, but eXistenZ definitely has the ethic "Quality is better than quantity," which works very well. <br /> <br /> In addition to being entertaining and thought provoking, eXistenZ touches upon social issues such as self-control and loss. This further demonstrates the film as an intellectual vessel and could also explain why it was not a big Hollywood hit. eXistenZ has so much to offer, and although it's not for everyone, those who like Cronenberg's work or like science fiction will almost certainly like the movie. It's one of those films that needs to be considered open-minded, but it's really something special.
