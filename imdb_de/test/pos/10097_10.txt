I'll just say it - I love the horror genre so much that I see every single one I can get my hands on (except for really bad B-movie horrors that I could do without) and lately I did not know that a Korean horror surpasses my list and heavyweights like the Japanese Ringu (or the American Ring) or even high quality US films like the Sixth Sense and the Others and The acclaimed Hong movie defeats Kong Horror 'The Eye'. <br /> Before 'The Ring' had been my favorite horror before, but it seems to me that every day I prefer the beauty of 'The Tale of Two Sisters' - the story is extraordinary and more open to interpretation that repeated visits are possible, although there is a chance you would like to watch this again and again just because the film was filmed so masterfully ... The story is probably one of the best in the genre so far. Acting is also top-notch in the cast and the fear that they come has the potential to rattle you like anything in the ring - I've stuck myself where I can not avert my eyes. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I'm glad I did not come back later to track Sadako / Samara from the ring. After all, such feelings are unpleasant and the tale of the two sisters leaves an uncomfortable feeling. But one that hopefully will not leave you without sleep, but will make you happy to have seen something very special. But remember, if you do not understand the plot after the first look, it is more than advisable to look at it again. Personally, I did not have time for it because it was late, so I flipped through several scenes on the DVD many times until I had a good summary in mind and after looking at the net, it seemed like it had the generally accepted interpretation pretty nailed. And the satisfaction of solving such a puzzle is wonderful. <br /> <br /> All in all - a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to be the same "level" remake (bought by Dreamworks) solely because of the Korean content and everyone is advised to do so in theaters or on Watch DVDs as long as they can ... it's one of the best you'll get. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the film, there is no way to talk about history without a spoiler. Therefore, it is best to do what I have done. Look at it without knowing anything, unless it's a story of two sisters! And prepare for something that is unlikely for some time.
