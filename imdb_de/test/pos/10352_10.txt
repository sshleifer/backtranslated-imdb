When I saw this on TV, I was nervous ... what if they messed up? Millions of families like mine who live with a brain-damaged man, in my case my father, would be disappointed. I saw it with my mother and we both cried, it was so accurate and captured how the family feels as good as the person who suffered the brain injury. The actors were all wonderful and I had no complaints, my mothers told me she could not stop thinking about it. I hope this program has made many people aware of what it's like to live with brain damage and how it is for families. Other programs like this should be done, I was surprised how good it was and it really shocked me emotionally.
