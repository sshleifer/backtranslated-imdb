I agree that this movie was spectacular. The way Jamie held Foxx has not only made the impression of Ray Charles, but also the essence of Ray Charles. His life has made a great story and it is good that it is finally being told. I also found a great interview with Jamie Foxx about this role of Ernie Manouse of InnerVIEWS on KUHT, Houston Channel 8. The link is http://video.google.com/videoplay?did=300837218936089620 & q = innerviews + jamie + foxx & hl = DE. I'd like to encourage everyone to take a closer look, as it gives a detailed insight into his role and personal feelings about Ray Charles. The only problem I could mention with the movie is that the shooting style was sometimes quite boring, but in the end I think he made the story more realistic and focused on the person, Ray Charles, rather than the movie Ray has directed.
