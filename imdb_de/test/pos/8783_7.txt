Screenwriters Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and (just) Dorothy Parker allow director Alfred Hitchcock to explain what may have been his favorite subject in the film: The innocent man, who was fingered for being wrong, takes it on stage. Hitchcock, who contributed the story with some merit, put a lot of tension into the conspiracy over a warehouse worker who was blamed for the blast that killed his best friend. He sets out to find the true guilty party. Great excitement on a grand scale, with mostly colorless actors (Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Alan Baxter) doing amazingly good work. Even the ever-complacent Robert Cummings comes in the right spirit! *** from ****
