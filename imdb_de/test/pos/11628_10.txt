I saw this show when I was younger. It's a really good show. It is very educational for children from 1 to 8 years. Barney is definitely a great DE Duper. B. J. is pretty funny. Babie Bop is very cute. The kids are also very cool. This show is about learning numbers, such as Sesame Street, but other types of shows and characters like Barney, the purple dinosaur, BJ, the yellow dinosaur with a baseball cap on his head, and Baby Bop, the cute one green dinosaur with pink bow. The first one that started was a very old Barney and Friends show. But the second was different than a new episode. The last one in 2000 was a new scene in Barneys Park. They also have a Barney show at Universal Studios in Florida, where they have Barney, B.J. and see Baby Bop. When the show is over, you can play, shop and meet Barney. It is a very good show. Watch this show as you learn many things that will please you in the movie and live show at Universal Studios Florida.
