This series has recently been dug up and clippings can be seen at least in the UK via http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html. Presumably there is some hope that the series will eventually become more widely available. The problem is that this series was followed by the series THE WARS OF THE ROSES, which had a similar outstanding cast and was available for cable television or at least pushed the market. <br /> <br /> The two series differ a lot in the dramaturgy; THE WARS consolidates the pieces by extensively rewriting and moving scenes; An era of kings follows Shakespeare more closely. Both series benefit from the Integralguss.
