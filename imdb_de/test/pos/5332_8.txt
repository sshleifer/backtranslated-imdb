Just an enjoyable Claymation feature by Nick Park and companies that feature movie greats like "King Kong" and "The Wolf Man" have made Wallace and Gromit a heavyweight rabbits' rabble, solving a big problem in their village tastes wasteful the vegetable cultures of the citizens! The worse is that the big vegetable festival begins and the citizens have dutifully prepared to win the prize. What makes the situation even worse is that Wallace is the reason for the whole herbivorous rampage run. He tested a new brainwave invention when he tried to brainwash the trapped rabbits. What happens is catastrophic as it creates a kind of hybrid rabbit. And it has more to do with Wallace than he could ever imagine. It is up to his faithful (and surprisingly intelligent) and fast-thinking dog Gromit to save the day. <br /> <br /> This is a clever and resourceful effort by the crew behind other Oscar-winning Claymation features with Wallace and Gromit. It's refreshing to see good old-fashioned sound engineering before the CGI boom, which has been lacking in recent lows as the industry spits out more and more mediocre products. Here we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts with wonderful animations, not to mention good-natured sight-gags.
