As a retired medical / health worker, "toiler in the vinyard," I never tire of seeing this movie. Paddy Chayefsky was a friend of my College Comp Comp Teacher and visited him and us in 1958 in several classes. His writing skills have been proven and the "Hospital" is as fresh as in 1971. I can see it every week & find something new. So many of the supporting cast members went on to bigger and better roles in TV & Film. George Scott has just made a few comedies, but his timing and patter are as good as Jackie Gleason and Steve Msrtin. Mental humor instead of physical / slapstick wins every time in my book. And still a family movie with only one word of four letters throughout the movie
