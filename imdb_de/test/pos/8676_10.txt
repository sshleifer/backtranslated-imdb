I heard an interview with the lead actor who said the movie should not be a horror movie, but he himself would call it a mental horror. I sign that strongly. <br /> <br /> It is not clear why he travels to this place, but everything there is monotonous, no bright colors, no honest smile, nothing personal. Everything is organized and everyone seems to be content to lead such a life. However, our "hero" seems misplaced right from the start and feels it for himself. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so important and so good is its remarkable resemblance to living in many big cities or countries. They must work, they should not tell your colleague where your weaknesses are, you show your wealth, your car, etc., and above all, you lack the true love of life that children have. Of course you do not see children or old people in this film - they just do not fit into a society of strong workers. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone - and make sure this utopia does not come true!
