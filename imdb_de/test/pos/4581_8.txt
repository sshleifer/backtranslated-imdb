You can not help but admire Mike Judge for "experiencing it". With "Office Space", almost anyone doing a job could connect with the characters. "Idiocracy" has exactly the same feeling. One can easily appreciate the experience of our heroes 505 years later, because the director has once again tried to put things on a very human level. Somewhat similar to Woody Allen's "Sleeper," this movie is very funny. Do not miss the deleted scenes, because the "Museum Of Fart" is a classic. Resourceful comedy is a rarity, and "Idiocracy" is incredibly resourceful, extremely funny and a solid 8.0 movie experience. - MERK
