The movie is a very good movie. One of the best of Yash Raj films. The direction is incredible. The script is brilliant. The story is excellent. She tells of Rahul being cut off by Kiran, his college friend. He is a full-fledged movie Psycho does something like talking to his mother (at least she died 15 years ago), etc.Kiran is engaged to Sunil. Rahul does everything so he can get her. He even tries to kill Sunil, but he survives. He even goes to the place they go to the honeymoon. The movie is every pleasure. Shahrukh is great, Juhi is pretty good, Sunny is average, Anupham is okay and Tanvi is good too. The film belongs to Srk The dialogues are brilliant (those by Shahrukh and many, if not the overacting and the comedy). "Jaadu Teri Nazar" and "Tu Mere Samne" are absolutely melodic tracks.
