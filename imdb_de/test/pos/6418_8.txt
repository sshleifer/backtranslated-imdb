OK ... the end of it could be a bit of a disappointment after what came before ... And Klaus Kinski should have had his 10 second appearance cut off really wonderful atmospheric Euro thriller ... I can not believe that I've never seen it before ... It's good to know that there are films that are still worth tracking down ... and that's really ... Stunning images ... haunting ... and creates an amazing atmosphere ... Florinda Balkan is perfect as our heroine ... And the scene with Nicoletta Elmi on the beach is one of the most relaxed and perfect spectacles that you could see ... Lilac Kedrova is just the place to visit The city, which may not be what it looks like ... If you miss the hay-time of the Euro-Cinema, chase it out ... There's a decent widescreen print ... and please get that in a restored DVD out ... you have it with the Re made "Fifth Cord" ... and that's a much better movie
