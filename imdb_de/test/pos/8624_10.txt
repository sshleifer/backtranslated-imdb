With what they had John and Carolyn were very private, so the authors had to put together what they could. I liked Portia de Rossi very well as Carolyn, but Jacqueline Bisset's voice rubbed my nerves. She should have used her normal voice. I would have preferred the entire movie to focus on John and Carolyn instead of reheating things we already know about John.
