This movie is actually one of my favorites of all time. I'm not a Renny-Harlin fan because most of his films are shit, but TLKG keeps coming back. TLKG is about a woman named Samantha Cain (Davis), who suffers from amnesia. She is married to a child and asks, "I am a damn member of the PTA." and then their world crumbles as the pieces assemble over their former identity. Samuel Jackson plays a con-artist cop performing PI gigs and is carried away by her to find out her identity and get money for his work. On the way we learn that Samantha really is Charlie Baltimore, a secret spy who was dead years ago. The plot is great and makes this story real, and Jackson does a great job as a second fiddle for Davis (who always does a great acting job). The explosions are endless, the action is linked to one memorable scene after another. visually quite impressive, although in the end the kid got on his nerves (watch out of the cars!). I'm tired of little kids messing up a movie to be rescued, but it's still worth it as the boy adds the movie. This movie is really good, I never understood why he did not deserve to be at the box office, but if it was a man who starred in the movie, I would certainly have earned a hundred million. The good news is that over the years more and more people are discovering this movie and giving it good grades, as the average of this movie on this site has increased over the years. I hope it goes up, as this is a great action movie. and I love action movies
