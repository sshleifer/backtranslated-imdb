This is a modest, humble traditional western with a formal conspiracy against resistance between ranchers and crop farmers in the city of Liberal, Kansas. The story is essentially routine and includes a number of classic Western conflicts. There is the peasant against the cattleman; There is the conflict between cultivated land and "civilizing" tendencies on the one hand and the ethos of the wilderness / border on the other. What this ultimately represents is the resistance of two value systems - democratic and communal values ​​that stand against rugged individualism. <br /> Randolph Scott plays the legendary lawyer Bat Masterton, who rides Liberal at the request of a land agent (Robert Ryan) to help him sort out the bad guys who are the hard-drinking, argumentative cattlemen. The two men argue again to tackle the annoying elements in the city. <br /> <br /> The script is a cliché, but the action is strongly encouraged by director Ray Enright and there are solid performances and. Alongside rugged performances of the male lead roles, there's a comic relief provided by George Gabby Hayes, an oily villain nicely played by Steve Brodie, and attractive contributions by Maggie Meredith as a primary and genuine Easterner, Ryan and Anne Jeffreys As a salon being courted singer If you do not value originality, this is a good, robust entertainment for western lovers
