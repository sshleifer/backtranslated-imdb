There are too many people on this board who have obviously missed the subtle joke of this series. <br /> <br /> This show is great because it's a funny parody of itself. Guys who are self proclaimed stallions have a fair chance of convincing us of their seduction skills until they "hit" the field just to uncover their utter lack of "play" on national television. It's absolutely funny and the guys who are really talented are extremely captivating as they effortlessly seduce the discerning women visiting these trendy nightclubs. <br /> <br /> It celebrates unique charisma when it's earned, and silly jokes douchebag when it's earned. Either way, it's always entertaining, because unlike other dating shows, it captures the authentic awkwardness and excitement of a "pickup" perfectly. I highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor.
