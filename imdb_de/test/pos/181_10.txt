While Boris (Aleksey Batalov) fights for his mother Russia in the war against the Germans, his beloved Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) marries his cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin) shortly after the death of her parents in an air raid on Moscow due to various court cases and treason Veronika, no matter how long it takes, a word or a letter from Boris and hopes that he will return to her. <br /> <br /> The powerful piece of filmmaking simply offers incredible photographic work by cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky. Some of the many superbly framed, moving shots include the scene where the camera follows Veronika through a crowd of loved ones who say goodbye to each other as she rushes through the crowd of bodies to say goodbye to Boris ... and he does not quite reach him as we watch Boris look impatiently into the swarm. The sequence after the air raid in which Veronika pulled up the standing staircase that pulled up the ruined building, called her once at home and the scene in which Mark moves relish on Veronika, as another air raid takes place right in front of the building while the wind the curtains and lightning rushes light radiates inside. These are just two of MANY examples in which Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius in designing pictures that will forever remain on film. But without the power and tragedy of history, as war can forever stamp the fate of a couple who deeply and deeply falls in love with each other, this film can not compete with the beauty of the visual alone. Together, however, there remains an amazing film ... a haunting masterpiece from the Soviet Union, after Stalin had breathed his last breath. I'm honored to have just seen such a great movie.
