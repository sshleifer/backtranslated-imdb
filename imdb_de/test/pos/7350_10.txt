I love this show. Whether you say it's because I'm crazy in the brain or not. I find this show very funny and entertaining, even though Bams uncle Vito sometimes scares me. All in all, I give the show a perfect retrospective. And so I think, if you are interested in the kind of "omg .. what an idiot", this show is for you. It's really funny to see what the faces of the string people look like and there are many musical guests coming to Bams house. Buy this thing because it rocks! You should buy it. Yes. And Bams brother is in the band CKY and they are really good and sometimes come on the show. <br /> <br /> Conclusion .. please have a look at the show.
