Here's one of the pleasingly scuzzy '70s Blaxploitation Grindhouse; It's a thoroughly affordable Pimp Opus that looks like a sloppy version of The Mack. John Daniels, the passionate hairdressing hero Mr. Jonathan in the immortal "Black Shampoo", gives an excellent steel portrayal of the baron, a reckless, enterprising, forever world-renowned butcher who adds to his horror Strip prevail bitter, brutal Italian rivals. Unless you're completing with other crooks with horns, or doing your best not to get knocked down by the local vice police, Daniels leads an average average existence as a standard genus for the suburban family in the garden (complete with a caring wife and loving children !) in a typical humdrum town in California. <br /> <br /> The strikingly absurd premise alone promises first-class, trashy size of a decidedly untidy grade B -lock image variety (George Theakos deserves Kudos for his witty, ridiculous script). Matt Cimber's praiseworthy tactless and tasteless direction delivers the junk product through the slimy bucket and makes this film a very pleasant dose of celluloid dirt. Among the various squalida delicacies to be tasted here are plenty of gratuitous female nudity, rough dialogues, nicely gaudy me decade threads (halternecks, felt hats, sparkling day-glo jewelry, loud seersucker suits), a slightly funky R & D Smoke's B-score, some hopelessly pathetic acting (the little old lady who lives next to Daniel's is tantalizingly shrill), a memorable twist on Patrick Wright's sadistic idiot, some cool action-set tunes (the Baroque mass-sliced ​​slow-motion massacre cooks more seriously), more Luride travel reports on the Sunset Strip, where you can shake a feather boa (to the movies that supposedly contain "the real hookers and blades of the Sunset Strip in Hollywood"), effective Dark'n'dingy cinematography of Ken Gibb, a couple of sexual nausea fetish tableaus, some raw explicit violence (a prostitute has cut off one of the breasts!) And entertaining supportive e performances by the well-known Schlock perennials Richard Kennedy and George "Buck" Flower as a pair of racist, corrupt, boisterous police detectives. Sure, this movie is not art, but it's artless enough to qualify as a delicious, grungy piece of entertaining, filthy movie swimmer.
