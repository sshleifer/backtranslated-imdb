This is a cherished movie from my childhood !! I can still hum the title song with a hat !! I remember having to stay up late to watch this movie with my dad, usually two or three times a year. We have always called it a "giant robot". Although the effects in this film are crude compared to today's standards, they were perfect for the genre of this film. I'm also a big fan of Japanese "monster" movies, so this movie is just right for the others. It's been years since I saw this movie and I'd like to get a copy of it to share with my 8-year-old daughter.
