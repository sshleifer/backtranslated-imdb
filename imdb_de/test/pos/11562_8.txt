I have not seen this movie since it came out in the mid-70s, but I remember it was a very realistic account of the music business (topped with Paul Simon's "One Trick Pony"). Another heavily undervalued film IMO) <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel does an excellent job as a producer caught between the music he believes in and the commercial "tripe" that the record company "fits in" with "Since I've spent my entire career as a composer / arranger / producer in the music business, I can really vouch for the truthfulness of this film. <br /> <br /> If it ever appears uncut on DVD, I would buy it!
