This crazy movie rivals Ghost and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Knott's best movie performances. Knotts is an accountant for a Podunker Town Hall, which can cheat citizens. They fire the "three competent accountants and keep the stupid" (Knotts is of course the stupid one). When his garbage collection accidentally empties the wrong trash can, Knotts finds himself in a bizarre trap that the city council has set up for him. One of the fun moments in the movie is the bowling alley restroom scene, and the cemetery scene is absolutely hilarious. Typically Knotts, the nervous Ninny act is well used, and as usual it is surrounded by many crazy character actors from the sixties. Actors like Frank Welker and Pitt Herbert contribute to the chaos. You can expect Knotts to be armed with a big car, a pretty girl, and no real clue to what he's doing. Fun for everyone, especially nostalgic fans, but almost everyone will love it.
