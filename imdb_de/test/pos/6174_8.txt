I missed it in the cinema and borrowed on DVD. If you have the chance, I would recommend it, as it is better than almost everything that I have seen this year in the cinema or on DVd. That does not mean it's one of the best movies ever or nothing, it's just that I've seen a lot of garbage was said beyond 8/10
