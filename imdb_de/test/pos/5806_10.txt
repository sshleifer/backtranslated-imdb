This concert is the kind of concert that takes place only about every twenty years. Madonna's confessions on a dance floor will surely be remembered as one of the highlights of her career. She is 48 years old and just looks divine, she keeps up with the dancers, who are nearly twenty years younger. I'm also very happy to report that all the songs were sung live, which is good because it actually sounds better. Every song was so unique, the visuals were breathtaking. The performance of 'Live To Tell' was fantastic and overwhelmed me, 'Isaac' was exotic and beautiful and was rich in political symbols, the Arabian Horn, the American eagle that became free. I especially liked the rocking performance of "I Love New York", I almost got up in my living room and cheered when she told her critics to suck George Bushes ****. And then I was again impressed by the inspired music of the 70s (Inferno Remix). This spectacular, discreet concert made me a fan. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Highly recommended with a Capital H.
