In Hong Kong in the 1960s, a man and a woman move with their spouses into adjacent apartments on the same day. Soon they suspect that their absent spouses have an affair with each other. A strange bond between a man and a woman arises when they deal with their grief by alternately playing the spouse of the other player before a more complex connection arises ... <br /> <br /> No summary can do justice to Hong Kong author Wong Kar-Wai's "In the Mood for Love" is a miracle. A story about sadness that is touching and sometimes funny. A romance that never feels like coercion or forgery. There is no doubt that the director's method has much to do with it. <br /> <br /> From an inexperienced script (though the concept comes largely from a Japanese short story), which favors improvisation, the movie immediately gets the freshness of its performance. The whole movie revolves around it and the rest is pure improvement. At the heart of the film are two characters that will thrive in your heart and stay long after the credits roll: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are just stunning and no language barrier undermines a single fragment of immediacy and truth. The extra material is also top notch: the films are great to watch (in part by "hero" Christopher Doyle) and the music is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Everybody must see this, if only because it is by far the heartiest, most mature and most authentic "love story". Not to be missed
