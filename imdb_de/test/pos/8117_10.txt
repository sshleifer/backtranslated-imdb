I saw this movie last night at the Boston International Festival of Women's Cinema and was saddened when Ms. Troche told us in her questions and answers after the show that she does not expect her to see too much US distribution because of her perseverance so-called "gay content". It was an AMAZING entertaining comedy, and it just seems to me that the American audience could enjoy it just like "The Full Monty," so it's really unfortunate and somehow ridiculous that a couple of kisses from two boys keep it away from mainstream Theaters. Wonderful cast, awesome script and of course the direction of Rose Troche make this movie one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
