**Warning! Slight plot spoiler ahead! ** "The Italian Job" is not the best movie you'll see all year, or probably even this summer. But it is worth two hours, because it colors within the lines, knows the limits and does not try to cross them. <br /> <br /> What the movie is about is the work of the cast. In a film about a crew of thieves, the people must have a good contact with each other. Without this cohesive feeling, the audience does not believe in the characters together or individually and the film has no chance. But from the first scenes in which the men joke each other and infiltrate a Venetian palace, the right chemistry is present. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are nothing new. You are your basic group of criminals, comprising about half a dozen players, each with a specific and defining ability. But every actor brings the right goods to the table for his part. Mark Wahlberg's unobtrusive acting and humor go well with his role as a thought leader. Edward Norton gives posture and whirls his mustache well in his dark role. Donald Sutherland is the father figure of the crew, and he looks like the role of the polite and old-fashioned thief, who is still mentally dizzy. Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Mos Def not only surpass their character's abilities, but they nail each one of them. Statham as the smooth running driver; Green like the tech fan with a chip on his shoulder; and Def as the demolition man. Charlize Theron fits in well with a part that does not ask too much of her. She is mainly asked to drive fast and look good. She does. None of the characters is so deep or three-dimensional, but in this known type of film, only two dimensions are required. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, the film has a European feel, such as "The Bourne Identity", also because it was filmed on location in Venice, along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. The rhythm of the rhythmic, hopping music adds to the Euro flair, which reinforces the excitement of the band and complements the rapport of the cast. The look of the film also fits perfectly. The bright colors of all venues enhance the mood and increase the attitude. The minis not only offer a fun variation of the chase, but also work as a necessary plotter. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less straightforward. There are a few surprises, but they're more of a quick and gentle change than a drop-your-pine hairpin. Even with those the movie is running. As soon as the foundation stone is laid through the first act, everything goes on continuously. Fortunately, there are no breaks in the action for a romance, something that the film avoids wisely. There are not even breaks for the "real life". History has its purpose and proceeds without distraction. The lack of character depth prevents "The Italian Job" being more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of raid planning, such excesses would have affected the tempo and quality of the strip. <br /> There are a number of implausibilities, to whom I thought during and after viewing. But the movie is so enjoyable that I did not care. In the real world, most films probably would not have been so clean. However, "The Italian Job" does not take place in the real world. It comes in a stylish and carefree criminal world that appeals to the rebels in all of us. <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job" is a movie in the truest sense of the word. It is not eligible for Oscar and does not contain a deep moral message. It offers pure escapism entertainment and does it quite well. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Maybe the best popcorn movie of the year. 7 out of 10.
