I will not go over it, but I will do it only briefly. Basically for those who do not know how Prue actually died ........... the first time the demon assassin died, Piper and Prue hit with an energy ball that they fly everywhere through the wall , phoebe the third sister comes down the stairs, says the magic that sends him away but not defeated. (NEEDS THE POWER OF THREE) Leo comes, heals both of them, and so on. They are exposed along the line, and the only way to save them is for a demon named Tempus to turn back time. He can only do that if he stays in the underworld. she agrees, Tempus turns back time. it starts now at 7:00 in the morning again. demon comes piper and prue with energieball. They fly back through the wall. But this time, Phoebe is not there to speak the spell to ward off the demon. Demon kills doctor. Doctor is flying through window. he's dead. Demon goes into a kind of whirl-wing type and glass shatters on the doors, which is a great effect, by the way, and it gives a breezy sound. That's where it ends. NOW .......... what the whole world does not know, if she does not pay attention to the next episode. although what I am about to say has not been shown what happens, trust me ................ because this time phoebe was no longer called for leo, he arrives later. Piper survives because her injuries were not as deadly as Prue and Leo heal her first, before Prue, so Prue is already dead by then, since the puzzle is solved. ps, who call to Prue with a spell, should have worked !!! and she should have made a surprise appearance in the last episode
