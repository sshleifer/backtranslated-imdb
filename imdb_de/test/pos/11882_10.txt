This movie would have worked a lot better if this was the first Critters movie. This is a low budget movie with only two (2) critters on the screen. Why this looks like a mistake is because this is the last Critters movie and the budget is so low that the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money. I liked this movie, however, I usually compare it to the third movie (which was bad). Critters 4 have a more serious tone, the first half of the movie (even without having seen a critter), you have a scary feeling when you see it, too bad they did not "milk" the Critters, I mean, too If only with two (2) dolls you could have used them much more on the screen. The Critters also have different deaths in this movie, which made it especially special at the end with the frozen critter. Ug has a promotion in this part and differs in this movie, which surprised me. In the end, I liked this series because it also has some kind of inference for the series, so at least we will not see critters anymore. Oh, one last thing, I missed a scene in this movie. We never see a critter shoot a thorn from behind, maybe those dolls did not have that function, but I was very disappointed not to see that (in Critters 3 we see that.) A lot of spike shoot, that was the only good thing on this movie.
