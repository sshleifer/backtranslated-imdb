Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse is the first fully dubbed sound cartoon to celebrate its feature film debut with the exceptionally entertaining cartoon theme "Steamboat Willie." Mickey is a worker on a steamer under the supervision of Captain Peg Leg Pete (or Pete, as he was later called). Mickey gets on the train with his longtime companion Minnie Mouse as they frolic as Mickey tries to impress Minnie. This short film was incredibly funny and entertaining. The animators Ubbe Iwerks, Rudolph Ising and Hugh Harman assisted Walt in creating the shorts. "Steamboat Willie" essentially marks the beginning of the success of the Walt Disney Company.
