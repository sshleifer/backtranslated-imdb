Honore De Balzac's truly bizarre short story, on which it loosely based, becomes a disturbing, if breathtaking, filmed treatment, as a kind of forbidden love blossom between humans and animals at the beginning of the 19th century. The thin and very blonde English actor Ben Daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the Napoleonic wars, who gets lost in escorting a French painter who is being exiled (?) Into the rugged, dangerous landscape of the Gobi Desert , After literally walking around in a circle, the two men stop reaching civilization again and again, and everyone (contrary to a better judgment) decides to go their separate ways, promising to return both to the same place and when whether a water source is present is actually found. In this way, Daniel's character meets the creature (a wild and untamed female leopard) and forms a seemingly indestructible bond or love that saves his life and almost destroys it through the end of the movie. The exquisite cinematography, the minimalist dialogue and the somewhat crazy story, which points to possible bestiality in about three scenes, ultimately lead to professional critics calling the film a presumptuous and extravagant garbage. Although this is a movie that is not for everyone, I find it a subtle, if decidedly, mix of fantasy with a surreal and lush atmosphere that emphasizes more than half. The actor Ben Daniels is forced to face himself a wild beast (four leopards were opposed to just one), which is a crazy and very difficult task because of common sense and little knowledge of theatrics that he has managed to get through quite brilliantly if you ask me! All in all, I think "Passion in the Desert" takes a while to warm up, but if you're a patient person willing to give it some time, it actually has a unique spell over you, after all ; And unlike most platonic narratives between humans and animals, it does not take a talking pig, a monkey or a shaggy dog ​​to protect your interest. (***** out *****)
