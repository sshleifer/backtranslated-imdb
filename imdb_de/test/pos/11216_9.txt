In this episode, Locke and Eko are looking for the "?" Symbol we saw when locking a previous episode. Michael, after shooting Ana Lucia and Libby, struggles with his actions as Libby is inches closer to death. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this episode (I think). Is during the commercial break. Locke and Eko find a hatch underneath the plane that killed Boone in the first season, and a new training video ends with "Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989". (a planted commercial), and the advertised website (www.sublymonal.com) takes the visitor through a world full of information about life outside the plot of LOST. A must for all fans!
