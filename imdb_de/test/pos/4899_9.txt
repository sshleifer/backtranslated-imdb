The film apparently comes from an idea that a writer had when he "saw" one of his creations in a supermarket. The inhabitants of Royston Vasey go into "our" world to convince the authors not to write about them anymore and thus to destroy their world. <br /> <br /> If that sounds a bit too serious, do not be put off. Within the first few minutes we get: Bernice (the vile vicar), who makes an unfortunate penitent break during the confession; Chinnery (the veterinarian accidentally destroying every animal he touches) trying to collect seeds from a giraffe; Mickey (fat, unbelievable): ah, fat; and Tubbs (inbred sister and local shopkeeper) are cute as always - but still disgusting. <br /> <br /> Some of the regular characters are missing, but a new idea from the Gents introduces some of the characters of the 16th century - and we have the men themselves in action. If you're new to The League of Gentlemen, this is an easy introduction and a lot of fun. If you're a longtime fan, this has everything you've ever expected, including the joys of Jeremy Dyson's discovery. All in all, it has the same, slightly surreal humor that is the hallmark of the series as well as some moments of touching introspection. For example, Mr. Lipp has a gentle dignity when he learns that he is considered by his creators to be a "one-wit" character. While most characters stay as they are, some develop unexpectedly, which is natural when they happen. <br /> <br /> This movie is a "swan song" for Royston Vasey, but also a showcase for the gentlemen who prove they can (gasp!) write other stuff - and it can be very funny. (But you knew that anyway.)
