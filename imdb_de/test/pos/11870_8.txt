Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Yes, it is hard to keep you from this enchanting beauty (which provides a radiantly perfect image performance) because it simply has tongues. "One Night at McCool's" is a bizarre and raunchy black comedy with old-fashioned sunglasses paired with their familiar but cleverly crafted and chaotic narrative. Three men crave a wife and she milks them to their advantage. If you see Tyler, no wonder why they are in anesthetic and would do anything? This is all to see "their" happy and living "dreams." Like Tyler, there is something touching about this feature, including Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (who is great), and Michael Douglas (who is great) hired assassin with cool ease, but questionable hairstyle plays) - really a good time with their roles.The seductive storyline reveals the three main characters (Dillon, Goodman and Reiser) in which they tell their story about how they respond to this divine presence There is an unpredictable chain of events (from fruity to sensual) in which everything comes together with a certain ironic (snowball) twist of fate for the characters (They see that they leave their reserved comfort zone to meet this girl.) The direction of Howard Zwart is colorful and fluent, balancing the script's quick-fire gags and frenetically fun in complicated situations. One of the best under-the-radar comedies of the last decade, where you stand under Tyler's thumb.
