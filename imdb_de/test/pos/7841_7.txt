"The Beguiled" is a curious work under Clint Eastwood's oeuvre. Until 1971 he was known as a star of action movies, not only Western (the genre in which he made his name), but also war films (such as "Where Eagles Dare") and cop-thriller (like "Coogan's Bluff") " Although "The Beguiled" takes place during the war (the American Civil War) and was done by Don Siegel, who had previously directed Eastwood in "Coogan's Bluff" and directed "Dirty Harry" later that year, it's not an action movie In the traditional sense, Eastwood had played an active role in most of his previous films, but his role here is largely passive - his character, Sergeant John McBurney, is a wounded refugee who has to rely on women's charity to survive Even if he served with his unit, McBurney played no active role in the conflict, being a Quaker whose religious principles forbade him from wearing weapons, and served as a medic in the Union forces. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in Louisiana towards the end of the war. He begins with the injured McBurney, who is discovered by a young girl named Amy and returned to her boarding school. The school is small and has only two teachers and a handful of girls. Although some of the girls are passionate supporters of the Confederacy and want to hand him over to the authorities, headmistress Martha Farnsworth decides to protect him and fears that his injuries may prove fatal to one of the Confederate's notoriously tough detention centers. <br /> <br /> Although McBurney conscientiously adheres to the teachings of his religion regarding pacifism, he is not so conscientious in following his teachings on the sin of fornication and as he begins to recover Taking full advantage of his opportunity to exert his charm on both the employees and the older girls, he wins the affection for them, including Miss Farnsworth, her assistant Edwina, and Carol, one of the older girls. Even twelve-year-old Amy seems to have a kind of childish infatuation with him. In the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all-female school, his presence evokes jealousy and hatred, and Miss Farnsworth, who has been turned down in favor of sloppy Carol, is planning a terrible revenge. (Interestingly, the only woman to resist McBurney's bafflement is Hallie, Miss Farnsworth's black slave, though she tries to win her round by pointing out that he's fighting to free people like her). <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled" was described as an anti-war movie, but this seems to me to be a misunderstanding. The film does not really talk about the rights and grievances of civil war or war in general. The only acts of violence we see are committed by non-combatants, and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge, not zeal for the cause of the Confederacy. It would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the particular circumstances of the war. <br /> <br /> At first, the school, housed in a beautiful old Antebellum mansion, seems like an island of peace in the midst of war. The building is classical in style, with order, harmony and restraint, but the history that unfolds within its walls is a disorder, passion and violence associated with the gothic writing school that was common in the 19th century as if the antithesis of classicism applied. You can see that the film falls into the so-called "Southern Gothic" tradition of American film and literature. <br /> <br /> The movie was not a big hit at the box office, possibly because Eastwood was so against type. It may not be his best movie, but it turned out that he was able to expand his offer and play something other than action hero. (In "Play Misty for Me", his first film as a director, which was filmed the following year, he should again play a "passive" character who is in danger from a vengeful woman). There are some very good performances from the female members of the cast, especially Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth, outwardly a respectable middle-aged philistine but inwardly a woman of strong passions. (There are indications that she may have had an affair with a man whom she has given as her brother). There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as a shy, oppressed Edwina, who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of ​​revenge and Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy. (Amy is an animal lover - a key moment in the movie comes when McBurney kills her pet turtle - so it's interesting that Ferdin later became an animal rights activist). The only character I was less interested in was Jo Ann Harris' Carol, which seemed too modern, like a floating chick from the seventies, dating back to the 1860s. The film is characterized by the emotionally intense "greenhouse atmosphere" that Siegel brings to it. This will not be a movie everyone likes. Some will find it overworked and melodramatic, others have found it misogynistic. (Judith Crist called it a movie for "women haters and sadists"). Others, however, find it a compelling psychological drama. 10.7
