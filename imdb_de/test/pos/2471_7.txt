The strengths of the film were clear for the beginning and the middle part of the film. It showed how a very violent, reactive authority can react to resistance. Filmed like a documentary, the director records what would have happened if the United States had issued martial law. If you voluntarily volunteer for the "Strafpark", a practice site for cops where you are bullied and harassed, this terrible scenario might become clear to you. It alternates between the trials for the defendants, those who are in the park who are missing the attention of the police, the training of officials who are preparing to deal with these prisoners, the judges in their spare time and many other things. It was a very strong, deeply moving movie. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I had was realism. Officers are often seen holding their guns as if they were seven years old, with a plastic toy (ie, a 90-degree elbow when they put a gun in someone's eyes, or the way a cop does it looks like it would be hard to kick somebody, if he gets in his way, etc., etc.). It begins with an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of political affairs. At the end of the film the viewer is reminded again and again of the prejudices of the director and the producers. The antagonistic characters in the story begin as real, real people and then eventually develop into "stereotypical, objectifiable forces of evil". The mistakes they make are stupid, the violence they prove is unreal, and unlike the way real police acts, the judges are made stupid and unreal mistakes during this trial. <br /> <br /> The Reality The film began to fall apart when it turned out to be just another attempt to get the government to make the government look bad. And that comes from an anarchist. The scenes at the end were hokey, unreal and a thousand times overdramatic. For the first part, however, it promises a very moving action.
