Looking at Imaginary Heroes, it occurred to me that any scriptwriter trying to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing one or two children in the opening role to make his characters open and to show oneself. There must be something to this plot, because it seems as if any other family drama that comes down the pike using this device in any form ("Paradise" and "Moonlight Mile") are just two of the more recent examples that spring straight away Consider, though, to a golden oldie like "Who's Fear of Virginia Woolf?" could return to say the same thing. It's not that the death of a child is an inadmissible subject for serious films. Far from it. It's just that, like any other topic, it can be so overused that it becomes another film cliché, a practical short form to get the ball rolling and give the characters something to do with the rest of the time You can spend your time with them. <br /> <br /> The latest work of this kind is "Imaginary Heroes," a movie that builds on one of the earliest and perhaps most famous examples of the "family that can cope with death." a child "genre, the Oscar winner" Ordinary People. "Like the characters in this earlier film, the Travises on the surface seem to be the ideal suburban family, until on a fateful day their eldest son Matt, the" golden boy "athlete and thus the apple of his father's eye, kills himself without explanation (One small difference is that the son dies in "Ordinary People" as a result of an accident, not as suicide.) It's Matt's younger brother, Tim, who finds the body and takes on the role of the protagonist in the film, each of the remaining family members Matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, is becoming increasingly alienated from the father, who has practically ignored him all his life, turning himself into drugs for fear of drugs. is swallowed up in feelings of regret and guilt and turns away from his job and his family.His wife Sandy is the most complex character in the film, a freedisti He is a child of the 60s, who feels strangely displaced in the role of mother and wife, as she lives through a fundamentally loveless marriage in sterile suburbs. Most of the time she spends after the tragedy trying to connect with her smoking past. <br /> <br /> As written and directed by Dan Harris, "Imaginary Heroes" appears as a totally uneven movie. For any scene that feels genuine and authentic, there is another that seems arbitrary and spurious. You sometimes get the feeling that Harris wants to put every possible life situation that he can imagine in his screenplay, an admirable goal that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic. Instead of identifying with the characters and being trapped in their plight, we often think, "Oh, come on, what's next?" For teens, suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to hot-button themes in this movie. The screenplay also touches on drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life-threatening illnesses and even inadvertent gay incest. It is this "anything but the kitchen sink" mentality in Scripture that deprives the film of much of the credibility it really needs to make. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that "Imaginary Heroes" is a bad or uninteresting movie. Much of the 21st century's family relationships and values ​​are enlightening, original, sharp and profound. The success of the film goes above and beyond to the actors Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, who deliver haunting, sensitive performances in their respective roles. It is they who triumph over narrative excesses to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts. In addition, Harris achieves a thoroughly melancholy tone in his direction, but is often reinforced by some much-needed flashes of bold dark comedy. <br /> <br /> "Imaginary Heroes" may look unfocused and distracted, but the good performances and the subtle mood shifts make it a worth seeing movie.
