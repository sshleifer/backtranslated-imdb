I've seen this movie over and over again - every time it makes me laugh, think and cry. Robin Tuney does an incredible job of portraying Marcy (and I'm kind of glad that Kate Winslet and the other lady have declined her role). It's just one of those roles that you know no one else could have compared. > <br /> It's a beautiful love story of these two very different people in crappy situations, joining forces. They are in any case side by side, even if they are in a strange situation and in crazy ways. <br /> <br /> I'm telling you now, it's not for everyone - from everyone I've shown it I would say the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you'll love it and it want to share with others! 10 stars all the way!
