My dad had this movie as an 8mm roll. I loved it when he pulled out the projector, stuck a sheet to the wall, and played Gerald McBoing Boing. The thought of a child communicating through sounds fascinated me. Nine years ago, my son was diagnosed as autistic. The doctors asked me questions about my son, such as "How does he communicate with you?" I would answer, "Have you ever seen the cartoon, Gerald McBoing Boing?" I would like to have a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his teacher. That's how my son sees his world. Recently, I talked to a specialist in digital transfer, who indicated that most personal 8mm movies contained sound only in the mid-70s. I guess I was lucky when I saw the sights and sounds of Gerald McBoing Boing in 1972.
