I recently saw that at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2007. The title of the film and indeed much of the outline of the film comes from the Robert Graves poem "Beauty in Trouble". Jan Hrebejk conducts a script by Petr Jrchovský from a story by Hrebejk and Jrchovský. The story begins in 2002, when Prague was hit by one of those devastating 100-year floods affecting the household of Marcela (Ana Ceislerová) and Jarda (Roman Luknár) and their two children Cuba (Adam Misik) and Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) destroyed. Cuba's asthma is life-threatening because of the moldy conditions under which they now live. Marcela works and Jarda operates a shop in the garage where they live. Jardas dubious crew kidnaps him into law and one of his thieving victims falls in love with Marcela. Evzen Benes (Josef Abrhám) is a wealthy businessman who spends his time between Italy and the Czech Republic, helping Marcela and her two children. Jana Brejchová is the mother of Marcella, who lives with her husband Uncle Richie, who is played by Jirí Schmitzer in probably the best role of the film. This outstanding cast is rounded off by Emília Vasaryova as Jardas mentally fragile mother who gives all the money she gives the local religious charlatan. There's a lot going on for a little movie and it's a good story with a great script and a lot of comic relief. Ales Brezina supplies the music with additional music by the Czech singer Raduza and the Irish singer Glen Hansard. There's a lot to like about this movie and I would give it a 8.0 out of 10 and recommend it.
