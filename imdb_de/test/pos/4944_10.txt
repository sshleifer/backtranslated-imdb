Soul Calibur has always been my favorite fight game series of all time. And SCIII is my favorite from the series. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very well done. Much greater improvement over the choppy Soul Edge / Soul Blade polygons. The characters have a facial expression, hair blowing in the wind and they even blink. <br /> <br /> Soul Calibur has always been known for his interesting actions and characters, and SCIII is no exception. Each character has his background story, which is detailed and well done. My favorite character is Chai Xianghua. She is cute, she is funny and she is a strong female figure. Yes, I know that she wears pink and has a boyfriend (who eventually rescues BTW), but it seems to be more than that. Xianghua, like all other characters, has shortcomings and benefits for her personality, so no character is perfect once the good guys. It sounds neither cheeky (the vampire series) nor does it sound like old-school porn (Mortal Kombat). The characters have their own themes, and many of the themes are adapted to the culture of that particular part of the world. I do not think there's a song on this soundtrack that I do not like. <br /> <br /> Another cool thing in this game is to create your own anime-like character (Create a Soul). You could make him look pretty or sexy or even ugly if you want. However, if you've found a character customization that suits you, take notes or you will not remember how you created this character. I was very addicted to CaS. Overall, I think Soul Calibur is my number one fight series ever. It has everything I asked for. What can I want more?
