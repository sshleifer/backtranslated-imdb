Did you like "Dead man do not wear a check"? What about Top Secret and A Chorus Line? Well, MÃ¼ller's office is a fantastic blend of all three, as it seems unlikely. Very funny "tongue in cheek" Movie Noir homage with breathtaking songs and great dancing. You have to be a bit weird for this movie, but it's worth it to see it. I chose a nine. If the ending were a bit more logical, it would have gotten a ten. So good is this movie.
