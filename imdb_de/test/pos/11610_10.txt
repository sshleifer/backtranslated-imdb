I have seen this piece of perfection :-) during the fantasy film festival in Berlin and when I went out of the cinema, I felt like "drug use"! I've seen a lot of movies, but there are only a few that I would call perfect, like Koyaanisqatsi or fighting club subconsciousness. Half of the people went out of screening in Berlin and I can absolutely understand them! This is not a movie for "normal" people with dreams and illusions! A person who lives day by day in their dreams and does not want to see all the horrors in our lives and on our planet is shocked by this movie! if anyone reads that s.c. and thinks it's great: just contact me - so far I've never met anyone who shares my opinion - it would be cool !!! This movie deserves 10 out of 10 !!! finally i am sorry for my bad english - i am not a student !!! (and that's good too * g *)
