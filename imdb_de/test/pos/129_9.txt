This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study of the way people react to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkner's novels). <br /> <br /> All characters feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are supposed to take on and are looking for a way to live within those roles instead of throwing them off altogether. But as the story unfolds, the two wives, trapped in loveless marriages, pull together. Because of their friendship and love, they give each other the courage to give up their roles. They have found that life in their traditions is not a life, but a kind of living death: without passion, without true connection to others, without fulfillment. Although they know that there will be a price to pay for their rebellion and freedom, this is a price that is worth far less than the sacrifice that requires a comfortable, predictable existence. The script is wonderfully wonderful. Almost perfect!
