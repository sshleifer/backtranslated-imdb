A brilliant, animated piece that was far ahead of its time and was certainly far ahead of what was released in mass production at the same time. The impact of this work on Tim Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas" is obvious. One can only imagine how Starewicz has pierced each beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> There were only a few animated films of this caliber. It's a shame that more people have not seen this gem. <br /> <br /> Apparently, IMdB now requires comments to be at least ten lines long, so this is the tenth line. This must be something new - but I really have nothing else to say!
