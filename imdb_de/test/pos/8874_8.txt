You will not see the meaning of the title until much later, but in the first few minutes you have the meaning. This directorial debut from Golden Globe (for actors) Danny DeVito, who also plays Owen / Ned 'Little Ned' Lift, is a terrific Hitchcock-like film about a man's hatred for his wife's book (she stole his book) and the A man for his mother Basically, Owen wants to be a good writer, like his teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), and he was inspired by murder stories. Larry suggests watching a Hitchcock movie, rather ironically. At this point, Owen has the idea to kill Larry's ex-wife Margaret (Kate Mulgrew of Star Trek Voyager). Owen is inspired by "Strangers on a Train" and exchanges murders. Larry has to kill Owens terrible momma (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated for Anne Ramsey). Larry was convinced that Owen had killed Margaret and also that he had / wanted to kill Owens Momma, but it ends happily when both Larry and Owen published books months later. Of course Momma died and they went on vacation with Beth Ryan (Kim Greist) with Rob Reiner as Joel and Oprah Winfrey. With witty moments, a great director / actor and his support, this is an indispensable comedy. Really really good!
