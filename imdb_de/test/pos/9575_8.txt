You know, this movie reminded me so much of so many people I know. I think that's why I loved this movie so much. I was on the ground right now, laughing because it had such a serious and documentary feel, but the dialogue is so funny that you can not help but talk. Basically, the movie is about these crazy dog ​​owners who attend a big dog show to see who's the best of the best. If it seems that it's the dogs that take this contest seriously, it turns out the owners are just as crazy. Megan, one of the dog owners, is almost a serial killer with the hotel manager because she can not find the special bee toy for her dog, this complete nerd and attractive woman who is just so adorable. At the beginning of the film, Gerry describes how many friends Cookie had. Throughout the movie, her "lovers" see her and even beat her in front of Gerry! It was just great and it was fun to see Gerry's looks. This whole movie is just a shout and you can not stop with the recognizable faces that crop up over and over again. It's a great movie that's just fun, I highly recommend it! Well, I have to find a nice way to show this to my friends, who are like these couples, to see the reflection of themselves. : D. <br /> <br /> 8/10
