A few days ago, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents was attacked in Rome and tortured to death when a medieval woman came home after a shopping afternoon. A Romanian girl who had seen everything reported what had happened. Therefore, a debate began over the excessive flow of Romanian immigrants who randomly generalized them as criminals. <Br /> <br /> I'm only 15 years old, but I thought: what idea of ​​wealth is Italy giving these poor people? How do you see us as the land of abundance? Last night I finally saw NUOVOMONDO and my question had an answer. If you have only one donkey and a few goats, this propaganda postcard, which shows the US as a country with milk flows and huge vegetables, makes such an impression. <br/> <br /> NUOVOMONDO is really a must-see movie. It balances out an ethereal symbolism (milk flows, glances, hard and rocky mountains, name and character Lucy / Luce) and a cruel realism (mass of hopeful people on the ship, the procedures on Ellis Island). There is a mixed cast ranging from the angelic Charlotte Gainsbourg to the realistic Vincenzo Amato until a bitter and destructive Aurora Quattrocchi is used as a mother. Was it really that hard to enter the New World?
