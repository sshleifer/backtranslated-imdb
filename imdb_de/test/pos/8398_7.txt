I see this movie without much expectations, I think everyone should do it. It's a great TV show and of course we could not compare it to Gone With the Wind, but it's still nice to watch. It's also weird to see another Scarlett. Joanne Whalley does not play Scarlett with passion and fire like Vivien Leigh, but I think Scarlett changed as she got older. Do not expect too much, but do not look like: I think that would be terrible.
