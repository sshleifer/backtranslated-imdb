One of the genres that flourished in the 1830's was the variation of the thrillers known as "the murder mystery," as the addition of sound to films has contributed to what the audience saw in the original, to make theater more audacious. And since horror movies were very popular in those years, the crime thrillers, by improving the horror elements of the plot, enjoyed a popularity almost like that of the previous decade (in which the first films of this genre were produced). Upcoming playwright Charles Belden saw this renewed interest in murder secrets as a chance to make a name for himself after Warner Bros. had selected his three-act play "The Wax Works" for the horror film "Mystery of the Wax" of 1933 Belden joined freelance filmmaker Frank R. Strayer to continue making films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of his finest. <br /> <br /> John plays in The Ghost Walks Miljan Prescott Ames, a young playwright, wants to impress a famous Broadway producer named Herman Wood (Richard Carle) with his new play Ames brings Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) to his country house to read his play but his car Stuck in the mud during a terrible storm, the three men ask for refugee in an old mansion that happens to be owned by an old friend of Ames's. In the house, Wood and Homer witness the strange relationship between Ames and the homeowners. However, this is a plan that should impress Wood: Everyone in the house is an actor who plays a role in his murder mystery. Unfortunately, the murder committed is indeed done, and though Wood and Homer fake it for everything (after discovering Ames original plan), the performers know that someone in the house is a real killer. <br /> <br /> Charles Belden's screenplay for The Ghost Walks is expected to contain the classic elements of the murder mystery stories of his time as we host the stormy night in an old dark house, the obligatory group of Suspects and the touch of the comedy. What's interesting is how Belden turns the movie into a real spoof of the genre with all the twists he puts into his story to play with the clichés of crime thrillers. The dialogues are excellent, full of wit and light-hearted charm, and while the storyline certainly loses a lot of steam in the end (following the murder mystery routine), its smart twists and particularly interesting and entertaining make it its quirky characters. Interestingly, there is an obvious gay subtext that is stereotypical but never denatured and sometimes really weird. <br /> <br /> In 1934, director Frank R. Strayer was already an experienced craftsman in the poverty category of the film industry. But his partnership with writer Charles Belden would give him some of his most interesting films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of them. Although Strayer has apparently worked with the least budget and typical production values ​​of independent films of his time, he manages to use his set and makes an atmospheric film that fits well with the mood and tone of the story. The tempo is sometimes a bit too slow, but Strayer knew that the power of his film was on Belden's screenplay, and made the most of it by getting his actors out of their characters with great results. The execution is certainly a bit typical and unoriginal, but Strayer makes in this film an effective, albeit restrained work. <br /> <br /> As written above, the script is full of great lines that make the whimsical characters shine, and thankfully, most of the cast play to their advantage. Experienced character actor Richard Carle is remarkably funny as cranky producer Herman Wood and adds a touch of charm to his character, especially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur playing the extravagant secretary Homer. Arthur is the one who gets the best scenes, and he does a witty job as a cowardly but witty assistant. John Miljan is as effective as Presocott Ames, nothing amazing, but nothing really bad. The same could be said about June Collyer as Gloria Shaw (the obligatory love interest) who is doing well. But Donald Kirke is really fun as a vicious Terry Shaw, and it's a shame he does not have more time on the screen. <br /> <br /> As is usual with Frank R. Strayer movies, the low budget is a big hit on the movie. While Strayer does the best he can, the movie sometimes feels a bit simple. The main problem, however, is the very slow tempo, because even if the film is filled with sparkling moments of witty dialogue, it moves at a pace so slow that it can become boring and boring for moments. It must also be said that while Miljan and Collyer are effective in their roles, they are rather boring and average compared to Arthur and Carle, and one wishes the film would have focused more on the comedic couple they do than on the main pair. The end, as written above, is a bit weak and does not meet the high standards of the first and middle parts, though Belden must see to it that the creative conspiracies pervade the end. One could say that Charles Belden is an unsung hero of the Murder mystery is that among the many horror and mystery films released in the B-movie studios called "The Poverty Row", "The Ghost Walks" is easily one of the best (despite the previous movie "The Vmapire Bat") And even though it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre, it's a nice way to spend a night mocking its own origins as a murder mystery movie - a highly recommended movie if you like the genre 7/10
