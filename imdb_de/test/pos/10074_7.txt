I saw this movie the day it opened in New York at Ziegfield. At the time, Madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now. She had some hits, was very good at "Desparately Seeking Susan" and I had tickets for a concert at Giants Stadium. <br /> <br /> "Who is the girl?" Madonna gives a real role to play, which is not just a variation of her own personality. It does the crazy / heroic routine better than you might think. Griffin Dunne is a very good actor who testifies to all these phenomena. <br /> <br /> The story is about a giant cat named Murray, a future bride who slept with every taxi driver in New York, father-in-law and a key. There are many chases and cops following their way. All elements of a screwball comedy are intact. <br /> <br /> Sir John Mills is briefly on view. He shares a glass of champagne with the leads and has the largest apartment on the Upper West Side, complete with rainforest and all that goes with it. <br /> <br /> Compared to most Madonna movies (which I could endure anyway), this is fantastic. By itself it is not so bad. 10.6. <br /> <br /> PS The concert was bad.
