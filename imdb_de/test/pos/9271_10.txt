So unique and entertaining! Another great Canadian invention. A regular "Joe" (Dan) and a bunch of culprits (aka Puppets) all share a halfway house. It is Dan's job to keep an eye on four "threats to society" and help them with rehabilitation. Bill, the murderous fool, Rocko, the cigarette smoker, buttons, the nympho teddy bear and cuddles, the comfort doll. The five of them are in all kinds of strange circumstances. Despite their murderous and often blatantly perverse sexual affections, finding them lovable is not easy. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this show a 10/10 just because it offers great entertainment without spending a big budget and radiating a Canadian flair that makes me proud.
