I can honestly tell you that this movie is the greatest movie ever! If you fancy a comedy, I can only recommend this movie! So here is the summary. There is this girl (Nikki), who is fourteen and a half years old, and she is on holiday with her father (Andre), whom she has not seen for two years. She expects the holiday to be totally boring until she meets this boy (Ben) who is much older than she. To try to impress him, she says that she is not on holiday with her father, but with her lover. This is a hysterical movie from beginning to end, and I highly recommend it. So rent and enjoy!
