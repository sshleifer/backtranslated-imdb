A fantastic cinematic experience. I really enjoyed seeing this really great movie in the cinema when it came out. There is nothing to add except that this is a terrible shame that Mr. Albert Finney is still not accepted by the AMPAS (American Academy). After roles in such films as Tom Jones, Murder on the Orient Express, Under the Volcano (just to name a few - for which he was nominated for an Oscar), The Dresser is probably his highlight, but ... <br /> < I know Oscars are just popularity contests, but when Americans like British actors and actresses ("and the Oscar goes to" Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson, etc.) - and they all deserve the award !), why you always left Sir Finney empty-handed? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, they gave him John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in cousin Vinny). I do not know if I should laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the two main roles in The Dresser, you will not forget the art of acting. Watch and enjoy this movie! I recommend it to anyone who loves art. <br /> <br /> I give 9/10 for this excellent movie (1 point is missing for non-cinematic material, after all, it's "only" a theater) <br /> <br /> Note: My criterion is at IMDb much stronger than that (10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should / could last forever).
