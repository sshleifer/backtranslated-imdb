Me and a Coupla circle of friends form the University - Alberto Lopez, Dave Hall, Celina Alcock (in 1997 we graduated from Uea, Norwich, UK). Meet again and watch B-movies once a month. <br /> <br /> Experts in the art of bad filmmaking, and this movie quickly became one of the top 10 horrible / brilliant films. <br /> <br /> So if you have beer and weeds and need a movie to laugh like a drain, DROID GUNNER aka PHOENIX 2 is the movie for you! Marc Singer is fully aware that he is here in Turkey and milks him for everything he can! Matthius Hues is sublime in his wooden theatrical and muscular moronity (is that a word ??) when he grunts "But I want my 20 thousand!" Pure Shlock Gold! If you liked it, you will also see: TRANCERS, THE RUNESTONE, DOLLMAN and anything from Charles Band or Fred Olen Ray ..... (But be warned: some of their films are totally and absolutely without merit and you will scream for it those lost hours of your life !!!?!).
