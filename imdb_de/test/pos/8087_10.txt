I have just seen this film at the children's program of the Berlin Film Festival and killed me (and pretty much all in the audience)! And do not make a mistake, this movie belongs in the All-Time-250! Let me tell you that I do not associate in any way with the creators of this film if you believe you are reading it. No, but that's actually IT! Nonetheless, the label "Kinderfilm" is on it, "Klatretösen" is almost always a classic (as in "biblical")! The story is about twelve-year-old Ida (magnetic: Julie Zangenberg), who is devastated when she learns of her father's deadly illness. A special operation in the US would cost 1.5 million, and of course nobody can afford it. Ida and her friends Jonas and Sebastian do what every good kid would do - and slow down a bank! Sounds trite? Do not forget, this is not America and "Klatretösen" is by no means the raging Robin Williams Multiplex plat du jour, which no one is taking seriously anyway. Director Fabian Wullenweber set about making a big-budget action comedy for kids and, boy, he was successful! Let me put it this way: This movie rocks like no children's movie and few others before. And there is much more than just the "action". After about 20 minutes of by-the-number exposure (well, of course) it accelerates to a monster that effortlessly shames: "mission mission" (the numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and look really expensive - take that, mummy! ) <br /> <br /> - Dwarfs almost every other movie exciting (no easy ones, they're just kids antics here) <br /> <br /> - easily laces up a dense story with enough laughter to look after Jim Carrey Looking for career opportunities <br /> <br /> - both Damon Runyon and Karate Kid nods in the same seconds <br /> <br /> - so much evil humor comes from this side of the PC From here I can hear that the American rating board gets their pants wet <br /> <br /> - actually manages to be tender and reputable and sexy at the same time (ohmygod, what am I saying?) They are kids! they are children! - do not forget to check out the last scene!) <br /> <br /> - Stars Stafan Pagels Anderson, who has been "miracle" for the last few years, is the favorite kid actor of all <br /> <br /> riding !
