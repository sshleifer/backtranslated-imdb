This is the essence of the early eighties! The malls, the credit card machines, the food, the punk hair color, the soundtrack ... I'm in love with this movie. This cute, intelligent teen movie by Romeo & Julia is instantly addictive. <br /> <br /> Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. She's really busy with her actors, like John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so take a look at -Joy of Sex and Real Genius. The soundtracks for -Valley Girl- are great. If you can find a copy of the movie, buy it! It is out of print and very hard to get.
