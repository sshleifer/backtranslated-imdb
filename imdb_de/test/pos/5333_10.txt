After the great successes of Nick Park and the Aardman team with the short animations of Wallace and Gromit, we now have the first (hopefully many) feature with the clay figures that so many love. The DVD of the film has by far proved to be the toughest and best used of many Christmas gifts of my two children. The plot of the movie is simple enough, but for me the beauty of W & G films is the background gag. There are many front gags and slapstick for kids and adults, but the background is the killer for me. All in a classic addition to an already classic filmography for Nick Park etal and I would recommend fans and new viewers to watch this movie often.
