What can one say about another Wilder movie than that it is about the most humane and real stories about people and what drives them, bothers them and persecutes them. Billy created images like paintings that forever reflect the human condition. He paints the good and the evil in all of us. He also paints with love. I can not imagine anyone having a list of the best movies without a Wilder movie. They will last because they are true. I first saw this movie on television in the 60s when I was a kid, and I had to leave the room because the tears came to my mind and I was embarrassed. Now I am an old man and still feel tears, but do not leave the room. I knew these people and loved them and grew up with them. Billy has preserved them in this film, not a "greatest generation," but a very realistic one that preserves the power of the human mind.
