I rented this gem several times! It's a small, yet far-reaching masterpiece that takes the viewer from Manhattan to the beauty of the Greek islands. John Cassavete's marriage on screen with his real wife Gena Rowlands is on the rocks. He finds his meaning in a fly with the lint-free Susan Sarandon, whom he finds in Greece, while her daughter, who played in her earliest movie role of the pubescent Molly Ringwood, falls in love with the son of the Greek ship magnate, who her mother on a yacht sails neighboring waters. Meanwhile, the immensely talented Raul Julia plays a goatherd who lives in a cave with his Sony Trinitron. He has the "Hots" for Molly Ringwald's character until he is confronted by John Cassavetes. Everything comes at the end in a classic final scene in which everything is reconciled. Raul Julia, the goatherd, is seen dancing with his goat. This film is full of mysticism, beauty, young and old love, humor, sexiness and more. See it!
