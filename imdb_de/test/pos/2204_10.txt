Even if you are not a theatrical person, I strongly recommend that you see this. Based on a homonymous play by Christopher Bond (which in turn was based on an old London legend) succeeded Sondheim to bring it to the stage of the musical. The score is simply incredible - by far the best of Sondheim and probably one of the best scores ever written for a musical. The show was very well attended. My only complaint was that Betsy represented Joscelyn Johanna. It's good, mind you, and she's a very versatile actress, but she just does not sing "Greenfinch and Linnet Bird" so well. But apart from that, it's all phenomenal - Angela Lansbury * played the role of Mrs. Lovette, and she just does it so well. George Hearn was a good substitute for Len Cariou in the title role, and Ken Jennings does a great job as Tobias. The end gives you a shiver. Top marks for a wonderful show.
