Well, I can say for sure that I'm human, Wong. And I did not vomit. I laughed. And laughed. If this movie made you puke, then something is wrong with you. But this movie is incredible. I bought it four days ago and have already viewed it 5 times. The animal cruelty brings my heart, but not long enough to be guilty. The film is shocking, disgusting and vulgar. The spectacle is terrible. What else do you want from a movie? I am an inveterate cult movie madness. Pink flamingos is great. It makes Rocky Horror, as someone said, like the Teletubbies.
