This is a pretty good documentary. I'm not a skateboarder, I do not like skateboarding or skateboarding especially. But somehow this movie has interested me for about 2 hours for the topic. <br /> <br /> I would not call it the most intriguing movie of all time, but for some reason, when the guys talked about how they started skating their skateboarding clubs and skating in those empty Southern California pools, I was interested , <br /> <br /> I should also add that the music in this movie was pretty good as well. I do not sit around and long to hear more 70's rock bands, but it seemed appropriate for what they were talking about.
