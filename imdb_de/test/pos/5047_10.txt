Not much to say, except it's just a masterpiece. This film contains a multitude of messages that should all be taken to heart. Especially women do not suppress your husband's dreams - honestly - that's why you loved him! Those who plan death will live in the grave. Those who suffer will arouse those who live in fear. Even our Lord spoke of it, as he chastised the one who had buried his talent in the fear that he might make a mistake and displease the Master. Take a risk, get out of the boat and you go on water. Life is a journey that does not end in the grave, but in our mind and soul.
