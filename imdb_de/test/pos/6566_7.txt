I've seen quite a few films from the Far East lately. Some were excellent (Battle Royale, Infernal Affairs, the Eye) and some were not that great (Versus, The Triple Cross). Then there are those like Uzumaki and Returner, which I still perceived as flawed. <br /> <br /> The basic assumption involves the mysterious and terrible effects that a growing obsession with spirals has on a community. Sounds stupid? Yes, that was thought to me. First, the good stuff. The direction was first class, certainly a little over the top, but still interesting and stylish. Secondly, the story was original and as other authors very lovingly commented ... it was interesting. What reminded me most of all was the early Cronenberg; Films like Shivers and Videodrome. <br /> <br /> The acting was not great, but not too terrible. To be honest, I actually got bored a few times ... I found the pace a bit slow at first, in the beginning. My main problem was that it was too stupid and funny to be real horror, yet not enough to be considered a comedy. * SPOILERS * below. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * Some good scenes (washing machine =)) and I liked the final recording / voiceover. At first I thought it ended way too abrupt, but about 20 seconds later I realized the meaning and liked the end. However, because of the lack of seriousness in the story, combined with exaggerated scenes, like the newscast at school, I did not particularly care about the characters at the end. The last scene, which might be a bit moving, while I really could not care for the girl or her boyfriend. * SPOILERS END * <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked this movie somehow, but it frustrated me, and I think there was real potential besides some good scenes. A few other points, the main girl is pretty pretty and cute, and the song that plays in the end is good too. I rated it 7/10. <br /> <br />
