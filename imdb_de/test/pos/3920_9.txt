Probably the best horror movie in 5 years. There were lame remakes, attempts to scare you (if you just left the theater), and movies that should not have been made. but that's worth it. The only reason I did not award 10 is that Paris Hilton is in it (but their death scene makes up for it, believe me). <br /> <br /> ..so here they are .. the SPOILERS of all death scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> 1. my dearest death scene ever - Paris Hilton! After finding her boyfriend Blake lying on the ground with a knife from his neck, Paige runs away. Well, the Speedwalk is more decent. She thinks it's like a garage with all those cars in it. then (one of) the killer cuts her ankle from below (she holds a HUGE metal spike all the time) so she drops him and runs behind the car and hides. The killer picks it up and as she looks through the window, he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead. I've never been so excited or laughed so hard in my life. <br /> <br /> 2. Paige's friend Blake gets a knife stabbed in the neck and the killer comes to him (while he's on the floor) and steps on it, pushing him further down his throat. Then he dies. <br /> <br /> 3. Elisha Cuthbert (Carly) (one of the hottest girls ever) does not die PHEW, but her lips are glued together super, slapped in the face and part of her index finger is chopped off (yes, I felt like lifting) 4. Carly's twin brother Nick survives as well, but not without kicking his ass and injuring his leg. <br /> <br /> 5. Nick's best friend Dalton is thrown down a staircase and then beheaded. his body is pulled away and we see his eyes blink. Then he is covered with wax. <br /> <br /> 6. Wade (Carly's friend) gets his Achilles tendon cut by a pair of massive scissors and is then attacked by the same pair of scissors. he does not die, but he is covered in wax, and on two occasions his skin is accidentally removed, revealing his evil, bloody flesh. YUMMY. <br /> <br /> ..so there it is. Definitely worth your money.
