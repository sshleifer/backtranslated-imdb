(r # 88) Brilliant, entertaining show with spectacular effects. Any fan of these prehistoric reptiles needs to see that. The CGI fits in very well with the environment and it's just fun to watch this giant as casually as on the Discovery Channel. This show was a stroke of genius and blows its followers "Walking with beasts" and "The future is wild" out of the water. <br /> <br /> The biggest episode was definitely the last one we could watch The last days of the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the meteorite attack that became their fate. This stuff is almost too awesome for watching TV. How about a theatrical release? I would pay everything to see these dinosaurs in the cinema. <br /> <br /> If you fancy a show that is spectacular, engaging and educational at the same time, this is for you. Dinosaurs have never been cooler.
