This educational show focused on emotions, interactions and relationships. It was produced by the Detroit ABC subsidiary and syndicated across 90 markets nationwide. Last week, Detroit Public TV had a 1/2 hour clip show as part of its promises. Wow, the memories that have surfaced! While I remembered the show, there were segments I forgot, but as soon as they started ("Hot Fudge HOLY MOLEY!", Detective Tomato and the cakes in his face). <br /> <br /> For more information about the Public Television special, see "Hot Fudge Comin 'Atcha Concert".
