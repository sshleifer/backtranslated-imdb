Originally shot in 1999 as a TV pilot, "Mulholland Dr." was declined. The following year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes so that the movie could be shown in theaters. He did so - and developed one of the greatest, most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made. <br /> <br /> The film has no main characters, but if there are main characters, it would be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a naughty blonde who stays in her aunt's apartment as she plays in movies. She finds Rita in her aunt's home and decides to help her. Look, Rita has lost her memory. She has no idea who she is. It has its name Rita from a "Gilda" poster in the bathroom. So they both wanted to find out who Rita really is. David Lynch is known for making some weird movies, but this movie is the definition of weird. It is bizarre, nightmarish and absolutely indescribable. It's like a dream captured in the movie. After 100 minutes, the movie is extremely confusing - but if you look closely, that makes perfect sense. After watching the movie and then reading an article on the internet that points to things in the movie, I now fully understand the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Watt is terrific. Justin Theroux is a very good Hollywood director who has problems with the local mob. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of his best grades. And the director - hah! David Lynch is such a masterful filmmaker as never before. <br /> <br /> Is this your kind of movie? Well, that depends. You should probably see more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You need to be patient with the movie and probably look a second time to gather the many clues Lynch has left throughout the movie. For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true. <br /> <br /> "Mulholland Dr." is a masterpiece. It is brilliant, enigmatic and masterfully filmed. I love it.
