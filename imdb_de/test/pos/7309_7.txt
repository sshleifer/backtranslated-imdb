The movie begins with a sombre housewife (Norma Shearer) who finds out that her husband (Rod La Rocque) has cheated on her. Three years passed and apparently they had been divorced in these years because of the infidelity. Oddly enough, La Rocque saw neither Shearer nor his two children during this time when Shearer brought them to Paris. Marie Dressler is a wealthy socialite and she has a new and improved Norma invited to her house for the weekend - supposedly to help Marie break an emerging romance between her daughter and La Rocque! Apparently Norma is now a super-vamp and with her magical sex appeal she can break the romance - and nobody seems to realize that she and La Rocque were married. Some others are there for the weekend and right now Norma is a hit with her gay, carefree, sexy ways - and almost all men (including La Rocque) are fascinated by her. Nobody tells anyone that they were married, but it's obvious that she wants the new and improved Norma back! This film is a sophisticated comedy of morals under the upper crust - similar to Jean Renoir's THE RULES OF THE GAME. Strangely, despite the severity of the depression, such films have been quite popular among rather wealthy people, though many of them nowadays will undoubtedly find them a bit too funny. Fortunately, LET US BE GAY has many nice and funny moments (especially towards the end when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). Although it's not a great movie, it's certainly a good one and more than just another time traveler. My only regret is that I did not love the end. You just have to see it for yourself - maybe you're coming to an end, maybe not, but I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this clever movie.
