I went to this movie and had no idea what to expect. I actually had a date in the cinemas when it first came out. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to talk to about it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie only if you appreciate non-mainstream movies. It's not as disjointed as Liquid Sky or as fanciful as Forbidden Zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There is a lot of subtle humor. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot if you are completely lost: A government with a big brother persecutes everyone in the society. Suddenly a new person appears and there is no data about him (he appears crazy). He may or may not be the second coming of Christ. The over-cautious government gets into a frenzy to find it and discover its true motivations. The ruler is also obsessed with immortality. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are hectic, while others are very reserved. We follow the main character as he encounters all kinds of people in society. <br /> <br /> I did not need my awareness to enjoy the movie, but I know that some of my friends found this helpful. <br /> Split was also filmed in Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
