"Just before dawn" is one of the best Slasher movies. It is very realistic and atmospheric. It reminds me of Tobe Hooper's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Liberation" creepy and dark movie. "Just before dawn" is beautifully photographed and the soundtrack is very disturbing. I never felt like Slasher movies or Gore except with this one.
