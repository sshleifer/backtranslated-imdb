I took a group of young people who were the same age as the protagonists, and it touched us all. I agree with the other post, the Wilson-type has processed a thankless script for a great side character. It's good to have a movie for a specific age group (too old for PG, too young for R). It also shows how they think and maneuver in middle school. They had to love how well Jimmy Buffet worked as a cool teacher. He kept us adults awake. The interview level of the children was kept reasonable. Their motives were specific and not like some A.D.D. Rebel. The environment and the music were beautiful. Overall, if you've enjoyed holes, this is very similar.
