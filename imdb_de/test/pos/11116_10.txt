This movie has become a legendary stand-in for the great America. <br /> <br /> Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several outstanding actors, singers and dancers, including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara * and the outstanding Gene Anthony Ray. <br /> <br /> The plot is not the movie. It follows an interesting format ... but it all ends in a kind of mush. Where Parker succeeds is to drive this movie into a real overdrive - with the most poignant, sometimes beautiful and almost downright Campy music score & performances. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is a song dance party of musicians, dancers and film music by Christopher Gore. A miracle to look at. <br /> <br /> * An interesting note about the great and talented Anne Meara ... sometimes talent must be alive in the genes ... Ms. Meara is married to a Jerry Stiller and is the mother of Ben Stiller. ..
