Okay, I admit, if I had no children, I would never have seen this movie and never seen it. Considering all the lazy children's movies I've seen (like SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG IN THE CITY), this is a definite improvement. And it was enough that I was not totally bored or thinking of suicide (something I did in the other two movies over and over again). Sure, the performances are quite broad and the plot is kind of stupid - but it's a kids movie. And compared to other films of the genre, this is definitely better than the average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines actually seem to have talent and will probably make a career after puberty - at least for infomercials or voice-overs. See with your children, you could certainly do a lot worse!
