A touching love story reminiscent of "In the Mood for Love". The story is strongly related to Chinese poetry and how it is used by people in the East to communicate feelings. At the heart of the story is a teacher who wants to be so much a pattern teacher as well as a good husband and father. An older student is very attracted to him. As the story unfolds, we see the emotions beneath the surface in his 20-year marriage and how he deals with the moral dilemma he faces. A beautiful and moving story.
