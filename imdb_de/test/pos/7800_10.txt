This is my favorite Native American movie of all time. It's a funny genius. Salman Khan is funny. But Amir Khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. Karisma Kapoor's outfits tell their own story. You wonder if the stylist purposely made her wear some clothes just to make the movie funnier (at some point she looks like she's wearing a diaper). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie that makes me laugh from beginning to end. There is no boring moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will make you laugh. I especially loved the scene where Amar (Amir Khan) "regains his memory". I've seen this movie so many times that I lost the count. And I'm so happy to say that Bollywood, as far as I know, this time wears the honor for this fantastic movie. A.A.A.A it is not a replica of a Hollywood movie (THANKS GOD). Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindi / Urdu and loves good comedy. <br /> <br /> Look, you will love it !!!!!
