I remember coming home from school to take care, and this was the story of a black family going from the gheto to a high-class community. The family's name was Wilson Frank Wilson, a man with his own construction business They had 3 teenage kids, Kevin Valerie and Marcus. That was a very good show. It was instructive to be without a preacher. The show was well written. This show gave us a look at a successful African American before the Cosby Show. This show featured a black actor, from Ester Role to David Hubberd to Stonnie Jackson, to name but a few. If you can find this show on DVD, you should get it for your whole family
