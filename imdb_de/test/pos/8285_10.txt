AWWWW, I just love this movie to pieces. Me and my cousins ​​enjoy this movie very much and I'm just such a HUGE fan! I hope they bring the TV series on DVD soon. Come to mention it, I have not seen the TV show in a long time. Such gait times! Where do I come from Australia? The Chipmunk adventure is only known to people who are in their late teenage and adult years, which is somehow sad because the young kids do not know what's missing there. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are Ace the ones I love, most Rock'n'roll Boys / Girls, Diamond Dolls, and the song that wants to make you want to cry My Mother. <br /> <br /> This film will thrill both young and young people Get the CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE TODAY !!! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie.
