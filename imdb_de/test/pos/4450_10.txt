I've seen this movie five times and never get tired. This shows traces of the genre "Giallo", but also in a living Italian landscape, in which ignorance and superstition are deadlier than any serial killer. With its superb location (sometimes reminiscent of Fellini, sometimes reminiscent of the Taviani brothers), good characterization and some of the best genre performers (including the great Tomas Milian and Ida Lupino in an unforgettable role), this is no euro garbage, just a masterpiece that should be discovered generation after generation (recently it was very well received at the Paris Cinematheque in a double film to Lucio Fulci)
