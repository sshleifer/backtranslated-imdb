I still remember seeing Satya for the first time. I was totally blown away. Here was a movie that was very different from the other gangster movies I saw. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so credible. Although "Company" (which was a very good effort) and "Vaastav" (closer to the protagonist's journey) came close, no underworld movie could ever do Satya justice. <br /> <br /> When I saw Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said, "Indian cops now have their own" Satya. "Nietzsche's quote itself tells you in the beginning that this is not an ordinary movie What you notice about the "encounter" at the beginning of the film is the relaxed way it is performed, it's a cold and frightening feeling because you know it's part of their routine not the story of an honest policeman or a corrupt policeman, but a police officer willing to do what is necessary to get rid of the criminals when all legal means have been exhausted, and director Shimit Amin succeeds with simple adjustments and camera angles, the essence To capture the characters and to give the film a realistic and rough feel.The editing does not seem to exist and therefore effective.The music is also impressive and haunting and will last long after leaving the cinema. <br /> <br /> But for me the dialogues and the superlatives of each character are really the cake. Sandeep Srivastava has done an excellent job as a dialogue writer. Unfortunately, when I start listing my favorite dialogues, I will rewrite the entire script of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film offers some outstanding services. Yashpal Sharma is abhorrent as Under-Inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and Jeeva as Joint Commissioner Suchak. Revathi, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have little roles that they play perfectly. Nakul Vaid as a freshman Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene in which he has to shoot the wounded gangster hesitantly? Oh dear God! He learns under the guidance of Sadhu Aghashe and firmly believes in him. <br /> <br /> Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are real gems of the dialogue. Never before in Indian cinema has a film produced such a wonderful relationship between a police officer and a gangster. Not that I was not a fan of Nana Patekar before this movie, but this movie has driven me out of a movie fan to a devotee. Nana as Inspector Sadhu Agashe offers the power of a life and one of the best I've ever seen in Hindi cinema. The way he talks to his facial expressions, the way he taps his cigarette, or how he sips his tea? It's almost as if Nana could not go wrong. He is at his best in every scene, especially when he teaches Jatin how the police work. His cool and relaxed way of doing things is sometimes scary. His dialogue and body language have convinced me that he is one of the best actors in the country. It's a shame that he has not won any popular prizes for this award. <br /> <br /> Finally, Shimit Amin does a great job of bringing all this talent together and using it. Design a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry accustomed to raising stories from here and there, Amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment. I just hope he continues the great work and does not indulge in Bollywood-isation! If he can, I'm sure he'll be a force to reckon with in the years to come.
