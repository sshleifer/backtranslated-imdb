OMG, it's really the best show in the world. It rocks harder than Jackass and CKY and is so funny and entertaining. I love the show. All 5 seasons are awesome, but for a quick summary: Season 1: - Great when you're planning a scavenger hunt, watching the house pull apart and enjoying Philip's hunger. <br /> <br /> Season 2: - Great If you want them to buy Castle Bam, see a butcher's concert, see the wonder of Mardi Gras and the fun of seeing a demo derby and actually a tree top casino open and open. <br /> <br /> Season 3: - Great if you probably want to see the first Drivepark Skatepark, a Civil War, Johnny Knoxville, a pirate ship, and Don Vito, who actually wins one of Bam's reindeer games. <br /> <br /> Season 4: - Great, if you want to see them in Europe, they get jobs, building a state and a Bayou and The Dudesons Season 5: - Great if you want to see them in Brazil , Apes birthday, Mike Vallely, The Metal Mulisha, Bams Lambo disappears, Bams lobster is destroyed, a Playboy party in the Bams pool and the last Viva La Bam :(
