I found parts of this movie rather slow, especially the first part; The second part seemed to run much faster, but I do not fully understand why one part was faster than the other. I somehow managed to find it pleasant. The acting was good, the writing was good (still vulgar). There was another good side: it was easier to understand than the godfather films. They knew who was on which page, and so on. All in all, the movie was not half bad.
