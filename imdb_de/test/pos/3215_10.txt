Impressive! All I have to say is that this show is super cool! I fell in love with the show right from the start! The idea of ​​the show is very original and very reassuring! It is also a pleasure to see the performance of the two beautiful leading actresses Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! They are just wonderful! I am especially a great admirer of Lauren Graham! She is not only a pretty face, she is also a "monster" of an actress! I'm not saying that Alexis is not a wonderful actress. I just like Lauren better. Nevertheless, it is a real pleasure to see them on screen and to be "economical" with words! in the words of the immortal Jim Carrey "B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
