This film was very different from the previous films and I had to ask myself, "Where is Ralph Macchio?" He may have been involved somewhere as Myiagi's old friend, teaching Julie what he already knows. Then Myiagi can come and add something else! Macchio could have been the love interest for Julie in this movie! No matter! <br /> <br /> On a serious level, I loved this movie because it taught a teenager how to play karate, and her feelings are very different from those of Daniel. Julie is much wilder than Daniel was and must be tamed, something that Myiagi finds very challenging; She is a rather restless girl and a rude, disgusting brat! <br /> <br /> It was very satisfying to see the transformation in Julie as she warms to Myiagi and learns more about karate and her life in general. We can all learn a thing or two from Myiagi's jokes!
