Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top-notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion, and great cinematography for a movie and definitely makes you want more. The story is about two bitter Mississippi brothers, one of whom is only a child and the other is old enough to join the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, brilliantly played by newcomer Jonathan Furr, does not want to let his older brother go, and he sets out to find himself in the army. Ron Perlman gives a harsh but touching impression as Colonel of the Army deciding to help the child. <br /> <br /> As it takes only 39 minutes, this gem will be hard to find (most likely limited to) the festival chain for now), but remember the name Aaron Schneider - this image marks him as a director.
