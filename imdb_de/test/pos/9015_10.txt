I had the privilege of attending a regional premiere. This is one of the funniest British films of all time. The storyline is awesome and focuses on a young girl who inadvertently turns into a perfect man at a computer fair while making a copy of herself, who falls in love with him, the movie is full of jokes, both visually and acoustically, and he has a bright and fresh feeling, and the acting is of great quality and was released on July 2nd in the UK must see !!!
