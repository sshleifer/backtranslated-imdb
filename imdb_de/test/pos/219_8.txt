The creative team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker had their roots in the improvisational theater in Madison, Wisconsin, I believe. They had a group called "Kentucky Fried Theater" (or something similar). They put a number of their set pieces on celluloid as "KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE" (1977), which was long, disrespectful, sophomoric and really funny. > <br /> They followed the very popular PLANE! (1980), which really brought her to the map. In it, they took with them some well-known veterans from Robert Stack and (especially) Leslie Nielsen, who introduced them to prominent roles, parodying every clich√© of aviation film since the days of John Wayne's (Batjac) Production of THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (1954). Bags filled with money and now noticed, the trio has negotiated a contract with Pramount Television and the American television broadcaster TV Broadcasting Company to make a half-hour comedy parody of the almost uncountable Police Crime drama show over the course of Come on our TV screens and gone. He remembered the good job Mr. Leslie Nielsen had at AIRPLANE! Had given up. He was cast in the lead role. As Sgt / Lt. / Captain Frank Drebbin (the rank designation switch was one of her comics) bits, he presided over a series of consecutive puns, sight shifters, non-improvers and exaggerated police / criminal stereotypes. In addition, there is a too dramatic opening speech that contradicts information that conflicts with visual printed information. They always used this to name the title of episode titles where voice and printed titles never matched. <br /> <br /> They had a great musical score, which, though a bit over the top, had as its theme and side effect music in a straight drama. The score, opening titles, and format of subdividing the episodes in Act I, Act II, Epilogue, etc. were all part of the obvious but loving ribbing of QM (Quinn Martin) productions. (They even had the same announcer as the real QM.) <br /> <br /> One thing this far too short series did not have was a technically amplified audience laughter. And, boy, they certainly did not need false tracts. The nature of the parody was such that the viewer was demanded close, almost undivided attention, and this proved to be the ultimate reason for the demise of POLICE SQUAD. <br /> <br /> Regarding the series cancellation, an ABC boss explained the episodes "... demanded too much attention from the viewer". Is not that what you want? <br /> <br /> So, after just 6 wonderfully crazy, witty episodes, it went to the death of POLICE SQUAD!'s series cancellation, just to be reborn in THE NAKED GUN trilogy, made for the big screen in cinemas. Once again, they did well in the box office. Well, TVs loss is the benefit of Cinema, thanks to you Mr. Idiot TV Exec! <br /> * THE HIGH AND MIGHTY was produced by the Batjac Productions of the Duke and released by Warner Brothers. It was unavailable for several years, and eventually Wayne Wayne's family arranged for them to be released on television and on video.
