I just saw The Dresser that evening after seeing it only once, just a dozen years ago. <br /> <br /> It's not a "big movie" and does not try to make a big leap, but my God, the brilliance of the two leads makes me almost speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are no less than amazing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), a kind of valet during the Blitz of London during World War II, a production of King Lear. These are two men, each relying on the other: Sir is almost helpless without the help of Norman to make Cajole, to whistle and make him come on stage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously by sir. Without Sir needing him, he is nothing or believes it anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a character-driven movie; The plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and therefore requires high-profile actors to bring them to life. Finney, only 47 years old, is absolutely believable as a very old, very sick, irritable, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. He hisses and steams his fellow actor, even if they bow down! And Courtenay is no less convincing than the crusher that sometimes functions as a mother rather than a valet for his older employer. However, the employer is the wrong term. For though technically the relationship between employer and employee is one, Sir and Norman spend most of their time behaving like an old couple. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are others in the cast of this film, but it is beyond question that the true stars are Finney, Courtenay and the wonderful screenplay by Ronald Harwood. That does not mean that there are no other good performances, especially Eileen Atkins as long-time stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets and what might have been. <br /> <br /> Although these days are not talked about, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Oscars: Best Actor nominations for Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Adapted Screenplay. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a good movie, but I was not prepared to be as intrigued as I was from start to finish. If you want to see an example of what the drama is all about, and if you are entertained the whole time, I suggest you visit The Dresser.
