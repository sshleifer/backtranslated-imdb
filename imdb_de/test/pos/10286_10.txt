A lot has already been written about the film itself, so I want to contribute not only to the sounds, but just a few words to the two actresses In a sense, the spectacular Monica Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer brings it to a sensational end. A movie with Monica Bellucci, in which I fall in love with the other girl? That should not happen. <br /> <br /> It has been said a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci is the saddest figure in modern cinema. I have never seen such innate sadness. She would not be out of place to break Lon Chaney's heart.
