When I found the premise and read the reviews, and as an angel fan, I saw this movie. It's sexy and original and pretty entertaining. David Boreanaz is Keith. He's a crazy, married man who stays home, Dad, and he feels a bit inadequate in his marriage. He makes the mistake of invading a narrow circle of young girls who are intrigued by the idea of ​​dealing with an older man. They do everything to get into his bed, including begging, lying and blackmail, but they mostly try to press the buttons. The madness that results from this makes Keith dizzy and pushes friendships to the edge. David Boreanaz shows a bit of skin in this - and he looks hot. Yes, he plays a dirty cheater - but he shows enough susceptibility and tenderness towards the stupid teenagers who cheer for him in the end. One more thing, if someone "oh yeah, oh..oh..YEAH !!" groans, it is hard to see them as victims of a rape.
