Above all, this is a good, exciting story with well-developed characters. But all the other details are well made and lead to a wonderful movie. Do not let the Disney label believe that this is a fool or just for kids - it has a lot to offer all ages, whether you play golf or not. It is impressive that the film makes a game of golf look really exciting. And if you're one of many who can not stand golf on TV, that's no small matter. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film manages to set out the basic figures with their motives and backgrounds enough that you like all the major competitors as soon as the crucial game begins in half. Sure, you became Ouimet's character the whole time, but his main opponents are personable and interesting in and of themselves. The background level is important as golf becomes a game that uses both heads and golf clubs, as you gain a good understanding of each person's strengths and weaknesses as the game progresses, but they help the story more often as not. The director has a lot of clever golf strokes, and the historic costumes and sets are really top notch. <br /> <br /> There are a few little things - many of the smaller characters seem a little too stereotypical from the movie class warfare, but that's forgivable in the well-drawn protagonists. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBoeuf plays with Francis Ouimet as always Callow and sympathetic. But the real standout is Steven Dillane, who plays Harry Vardon. He rarely moves his face, but his intense, often sad eyes and small expressions say so much. Ouimet's Caddy Eddie Lowery, played by Josh Flitter, steals the scenes he's in. Watch the movie, Google, to find the actual photo of Ouimet and Lowery at the tournament for an even better assessment of how unbelievable this is Game really was.
