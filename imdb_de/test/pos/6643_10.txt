Shame is rather unique as a war movie (or rather as an anti-war movie), as it does not focus solely on the soldiers involved or the politics (there is politics, but not the way in which he would see the movie) It deals with its two main themes as the only two beings that may possibly be nurtured in this brutal, decaying society in which they live. Ingmar Bergman, in the midst of his heyday, and after two other psychologically pronounced films, Persona and Hour of the Wolf, are much more interested in seeing what the effects of the war on ordinary civilized beings are, that he brings the worst in himself and it also reminds us in a cathartic way, what is really crucial for life. His two main characters are frequent collaborators and friends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman (like the Rosenbergs in a weird way) who are musicians who live on a farm on an island (not unlike 'Wolf', if you think about it). <Br /> <br /> You see the tanks roll by, and a few old friends are already worn down, but they're not trying too hard; There is a sweet scene in which the couple only speaks honestly but with heart (all a shot as it is repeated throughout the movie to perhaps create a provoked feeling) ... Then comes the trouble, including a fake propaganda film At gunpoint with the Rosenbergs, the psychological chaos of POWs and the horror of a "friend" in the military (one of Gunnar Bjornstrand's most subtle works with Bergman). It is needless to say that this is not one of the lighter films that Bergman's filmography goes through, but for some it is one of his more accessible works. His religious themes are very restrained this time, though the idea of ​​preserving some kind of faith permeates the atmosphere of the film. If there are acts of war, it is shot in an unconventional, fast way (via the great Amigo Sven Nykvist). <br /> <br /> And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eve successfully matches the background of a chaotic war - where the lines are never taken too safely. In a sense, this film, filmed just at the height of the worst times in Vietnam, is even more relevant today; I could not help but see the horrifying, uncompromising coincidences between Iraq and other countries with some scenes of Jan and Eve with the fighters or the "people in charge". Incidentally, the very last scene is one of Bergman's best, all around (acting, directing, lighting). It's not the kind of war picture (or antiwar again, I can not find much of John Wayne's ghost in this Svensk production) that I would recommend anything to Saving Private Ryan to my friends right from the beginning - it has a bit more kinship with Paths of Glory, considering the effects of the hypocrisy of war. But in fact, Bergman, like any "genre" movie, is on his own, even though he's a bunch for the Art House fans.
