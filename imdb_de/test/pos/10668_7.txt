Written by science fiction veterans Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. This space fantasy is aptly conducted by Robert Parrish. Experienced American astronaut Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) agrees to a manned flight to the other side of the sun. The mission will be controlled by Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark), and John Kane (Ian Hendry), scientist of the Euro Sec Space Agency, will accompany Ross. The two of them will explore a newly discovered planet that is in the same orbit as Earth ... only it is always hidden on the other side of the sun. Ross is the only one who makes it back to Earth and has an incredible story to tell. Special effects may be better than the story. Still fun to see. The cast also includes: Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl, George Sewell and Herbert Lom.
