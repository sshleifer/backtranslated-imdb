This off-beat horror movie seems to get just bad reviews. My question is; Why? I think this movie is pretty good. Dee Snider did his first (and only) directorial work very well. He also plays the antagonist Captain Howdy (Carelton Hendriks). This movie seems to have a view of the future. Although it came out in 1998, it seems to be about modern issues. Internet robbers seem to be the underlying plot here. Although taken to another level, this is a problem we still face today. I admit, the story was a bit short, but that does not make the movie bad at all. Robert Englund is even in this movie, that automatically makes it better. The acting was not bad, the characters were pretty good as well. I think Hendriks was a pretty good opponent. I give this off-beat horror a 7/10. For fans of Saw recommend.
