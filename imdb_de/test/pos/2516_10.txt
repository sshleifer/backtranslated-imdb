Cool action - yes the premise was made - but not so - that's the trick. Hey guys - SHOCK - it's an X file. <br /> <br /> For me - it's cool that Scully / Mulder has almost no scenes together - they need to adapt and rely on each other's intrinsic feelings - and each other's adaptive abilities. They read each other's movements and did the work ... (somehow). Oh yes - really good acting - are these people getting paid for it? Or a slow day when the convenience store does not call them to work. (hey - Duchovny - where is the one-day donuts? Malcolm - go to school ...)
