It may be a bit squeaky now and certainly can never have the impact it once had, but this is still an exciting reminder of what Michael Jackson once did. When I look back at it for the first time since its first publicity, I did not notice the horror stories - weird but funny - and Vincent Price has never been so honest, unrestrained (sic?) Menacing - as his absorption the horror movie that Jackson allows to give a bravely enlightening portrait of male sexuality behind genre and make-up. <br /> <br /> Since THRILLER is not really about horror, horror is not really about horror: it's about this ancient topic, the sexual awakening of a young woman. The film opens in a movie theater in which Jackson's girlfriend does not feel comfortable with the pictures and the aggressive gender reaction. Of course she's on a date and she's less afraid of the movie than her boyfriend expects. <br /> <br /> The mainstream images of the film they see all point to the group atmosphere's social expectations. Not only does this make her disgusted with the body - hence all decaying ghouls; The loss of her virginity is considered a kind of death - but the sexual rite is not just about her boyfriend, but about her peers, about her society, so her portrayal is a gang violation. <br /> <br /> This is awesome, disturbing stuff, the best that director Landis has ever done. Jackson, the most popular artist in the world, was still ready to show that the fixed image of a star contained a multitude of people who were not all reassuring. The song itself has performed remarkably well, the creepy, tenacious bass rhythms, the exceptionally grumpy lyrics, the gorgeous seventies disco ecstasy that dominates the chorus, shaking the timelessness and revealing the milky craving behind the fear.
