There is nothing boring about this film, which is held together by completely realized characters with some depth. Even the torturers have body language. Jannings' performance is brilliant, everyone becomes, wants and must. A Henry VIII. How he must have been. Henny Porten may be nobler and purer than Anne Boleyn, but she plays the role as written: A victim trapped in the throat of a large (giant) baby. Sparkuhl's Cinematography is great in restoring the sounds sensually. Lubitsch lets these characters breathe and testifies to their corruption to the smallest nastiness. He takes his time, which may be the patience of an audience accustomed to being carried away by action, but the time is worth it. Slow down your heartbeat and watch this little wonder of German silent film.
