Naked City: JWAB does a pretty good job of offsetting both of his A - B stories, though I do not like to like multiple plots. Scott Glen and Courtney B. Vance are outstanding on the dual screen. However, I'm not sure what kind of message a movie sends, if two flat-footed country girls can get out with murder and big theft, and win a free flight home (not less in first grade). - At least the look of her clothes anyway). Gosh, I think the blue wall of silence is still more likely to be thought! <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
