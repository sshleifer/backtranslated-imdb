In "Everything Is Lit," Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American looking for the woman who saved his grandfather in World War II. In a sense, the woman who saved his whole family. <br /> <br /> This is a heartfelt story about someone on a seemingly hopeless journey. A stranger in a foreign land, so to speak. Jonathan is not quite prepared for this adventure, he stands out in the Ukraine like a big thumb (he would probably stand out everywhere like a stupid thumb). What he discovers, however, is much more than he expected. This movie will make you laugh and make you cry. Elijah Wood is really good in this movie, based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. <br /> <br /> Somebody I talked to is a bit different from the book. A book I collect is really good. Still, this is a good movie, there is something for everyone and I really enjoyed it. Can someone say Oscar?
