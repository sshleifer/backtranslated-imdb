Best Fan Boy movie I've ever seen save "Free Enterprise". <br /> <br /> In a way, it reminded me of an early Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> If you make any films In this RPG, this movie often laughs at its insatiable fun. Do not expect a big budget here, acting is sometimes questionable, but it really adds to the fun of the atmosphere they create. The script is really funny and contains many funny moments that are worth experiencing. <br /> <br /> The Bard, who is getting killed, got me started. The sexually confused player also made me smile a little. But in the end ... It was just a great movie that showed some better moments in the lives of some geeks who had a great RPG time playing this is a good distraction. A real surprise.
