As noted in other reviews, some videos are missing from this collection, but what's on this CD is overwhelming. There are two separate soundtracks, an original recording and a completely revised new performance version. Any new music from the Residents is welcome, and I think for the first time listeners, the new version is more suitable for the ear, but I prefer the original recordings (probably just because they are "the originals.") The production of this DVD is amazing, new and old videos are all interesting, and live performance videos are probably the least interesting of what's on offer (though the snippets of live footage hidden as easter eggs are extremely welcome.) This is not a renter, but rather own collection. Enjoy.
