This is one of those games where you love to hack it or hate it to pieces. Even as a hardcore Mario fan you can not like this game. You can hate it because it is short and a bit boring and easy. Or you can love it. It's because it's a mix of amazing graphics (not a big fuss for a Nintendo fan) music or game. I know many people who say it's amazing and others who think it's the worst Mario ever. I personally love this game and I think it's the best Wii game, but you should decide it yourself , I think you should definitely get it if you're the right Nintendo fan. But if you love the classic too much, you may not like it. Try it yourself.
