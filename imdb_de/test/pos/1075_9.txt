I saw this movie 2 days ago. A very interesting view of the people and our world through the world of wine. I have no particular interest in wine, and yet I found that very enlightening. The director has given me the impression that he can show people the way they are. While uncovering many things that are beneath the surface, he manages not to assert himself and leave it to the beholder. He shows a lot of compassion for people (and dogs) and compassion and lets people tell their story while exposing what they do not want to tell. <br /> <br /> The film shows us where our world is What is the benefit and what is the high price we pay. It is a film about the love of wine and the love to make it big, personal and global, character and formula. <br /> <br /> The real people's stars to me are the older winegrowers with their sobering look at the world and themselves. <br /> <br /> It takes some time to adapt to the hectic camera shots and that Get used to editing, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
