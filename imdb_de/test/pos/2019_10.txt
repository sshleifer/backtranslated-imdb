Well, let me put it that way - I've always been one of the "hardcore brothers"; I've always loved rock music and especially heavy metal !! That's why this movie is like a gift from God! I think this movie is one of the best movies ever (well, except for Neverending Story and of course Star Wars ...). It's great to hear all the classics like "Long Live Rock and Roll" (DIO), "Stranglehold" (Ted Nugent), songs by Jon Bon Jovie, Deep Purple, AC / DC, Zakk Wylde and other legendary rock bands! Absolutely great! WONDERFUL !!! I hope they will make more films like this (otherwise it's just crap movies like "AC in the USA" or what they call it, and "8 miles." Bulls ***!) Well, I recommend that definitely! All I miss is a few Stratovarius songs! But apart from that, it's one of the best movies ever! Ten out of ten!
