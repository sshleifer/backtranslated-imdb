Roopa (Kamalinee Mukherjee) loses her parents and other family members in a cruel car accident. She begins to live alone as an independent woman without the help of her relatives. She has a friend named Rahul (Anuj) and is about to marry him, but retires because of her future mother-in-law's behavior and lack of trust from her boyfriend. Anand (Raja) joins her neighborhood. And he starts to feel well and safe Roopa. The rest of the story is about why Anand - MD of AP's richest corporate house - chose Roopa as a neighbor, and what follows next. <br /> <br /> This film has a freshness that we rarely see in Indian movies. Although the story is slow, you become familiar with it. Kudos to director Shekhar Kammula for such a great direction! Brilliant music and background music, composed by K.M. Radhakrishnan contributes to the quality. Kamalini mukherjee as Rupa has shown a wonderful performance. I think she was the best choice for this role because of her non glamorous appearance and her amazing histrionics. Anand as Raja has also done well. I've seen this movie three times now and I loved it every time. It's a class apart from the daily action movies we get here. Highly recommended!!
