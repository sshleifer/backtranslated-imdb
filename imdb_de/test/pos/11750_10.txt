I just sat through this movie again and can only wonder if we'll see such films anymore? The timeless music, the tender voices of William Holden and Jennifer Jones make this adult man cry through joyful, romantic scenes, and I do not cry often in life. Where have our William Holden gone and will they still make these moving, wonderful films? It's sad to know that they probably will not do it, but do not think about it, but try to block it from the head. Nevertheless, Holden will not be there and he will appear only once on this hill. You can only enjoy and watch this movie again.
