I SELL THE DEAD (2009) 1/2 Dominic Monaghan, Larry Fessenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scrimm, John Speredakos, Eileen Colgan and Brenda Cooney. Uneven mix of horror and comedy that serves as a valentine for the 70s horror movies of Roger Corman and Hammer Studios. Two criminal grave robbers (Monaghan and Fessenden) are finally punished for their crimes by the guillotine. Occultes can be retrieved in flashbacks. Amusing and some well-sprayed thrusts, but really a mess of a B-movie trying to be a cult classic, largely due to the cast of veteran veterans Perlman and Scrimm without success; a good rent for Halloween. (Director: Glenn McQuaid)
