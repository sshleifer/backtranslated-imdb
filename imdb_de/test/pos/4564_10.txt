Imagine, folks - "DK3" is more sophisticated, innovative and cleverer than its predecessor. Challenging - its level is ridiculously difficult for a considerable amount of time. A particularly difficult stage is called "Lightning Lookout", where you can be struck by lightning at any time. Innovative - it opened many doors. It is a pity that the SNES did not die out long after this title. And clever - the names of the levels range from branded games ("Lake Orangatanga") to witty clues that will not make the target audience of the game for years to come ("Bleak's House") What makes me most critics of this game irritated, is mainly due to two words: Kiddy Kong. He is a worthy follower of "Little Buddy" in Diddy Kong and does not deserve to be called "that backward ape". "DK3" will remain a classic until the end of time.
