The SF premise is not unique (though it was quite a lot back then), but the focus is completely different than other artificial reality films. Especially in the first part is a complex crime scene, which tells based on the SF premise of an unusual crime story in which the obsessive detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of the disappearance of characters and helpful witnesses who do not have to lie not helpful Instead of an unreliable narrator, we have an unreliable world. In Part Two, we follow the main character's struggle for sanity, and it becomes more of a psychological exploration of a character in an extreme situation. He knows that his existence is nothing but electrical impulses, how does he deal with this knowledge? He knows that there is a world more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, in a world where no one can understand. To think the problem of knowing something essential about the world that no one else knows or wants to believe is a very real one that many of us can identify with. For me, the film transports this hopelessness very well with its drab, artificial atmosphere, which also supports the factual artificiality of the film world. <br /> <br /> Apart from "The Matrix" or "The Thirteenth Floor", this is not very worrisome. It awakens reverence for its artificial reality plot and rather focuses on the psychological aspects. Philosophy is interesting only insofar as certain philosophical concepts are essential in shaping and changing the perception of the character of the world. It's probably longer than it needs to be (which does not matter) problem if you're as intrigued as I am) and Part 2 is pretty weak.
