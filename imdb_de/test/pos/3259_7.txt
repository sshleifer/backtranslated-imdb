I had never heard of this movie, but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The story sounded interesting, so I thought I'd give it a try. I found it very pleasant. Heath Ledger plays a 19-year-old who's a crappy job and wants to seriously dough. So he goes to gangster Bryan Brown. I'm not going to go into details, but Ledger is in a bad way and is in big trouble with Bryan Brown. The movie is getting better, with a scene where Ledger joins a pair of bank robbers. And not forgetting the beautiful Rose Byrne who plays Ledger's love interest. I would definitely recommend this movie.
