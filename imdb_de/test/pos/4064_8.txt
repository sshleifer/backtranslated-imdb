I will not go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There were no funny scenes that I can remember, but there were moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy has a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was fine in the film, there were no complaints. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they did not explain much. The first was the buddy of Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy) in the gym of Ken Campbell. I suspected that he was only a friend of Trey, but I wanted to know more about him. The other character I liked was Mitch Preston's (Robert De Niro's) colleague / partner of Nestor Serrano. I think he was just another policeman working with Mitch Preston, but I wanted to know if he was his partner or not. I think maybe I'm thinking too much about a movie, I mean, it's a comedy ... who cares about the characters? I think I do that. I was really pleased to see that this was led by Tom Dey, who also ran Shanghai Noon. Since I saw this movie, I was looking forward to his next work. I think he did a pretty good job with this movie, and I'm looking forward to his next work. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good movie, but I would not recommend paying the full price for it. A ticket, unless you are a hard-working Robert De Niro / Eddie Murphy / Rene Russo. Fan. It was worth seeing in the theater, but not for the full price. I would recommend seeing it at the Matinee Award. <br /> <br /> Here you will also find some little things about the movie. The man who played the cameraman who is played by Judah Friedlander is the man in the music video "Everyday" by Dave Matthews Band. He was also the employee of "Meet The Parents" with Robert De Niro. ... and he also played Derek Zoolander's brother in "Zoolander" (both Zoolander and Meet the Parents star Ben Stiller). Only a few useless little things for you. <br /> <br /> I hope you like the movie. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
