Bears a similar resemblance to Dean Koontz's novel as Jessica Simpson does to a rocket scientist. If you've read the book, I suggest that you forget it as much as possible before you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Observers Are Your Typical Boy Meets Dog In a smart laboratory experiment for the government, the dog and boy are tracked by super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monsters created by the same lab, and, oh yeah, I have Mention the dodgy government agents tracking the monster that haunts the dog? "<br /> <br /> Corey Haim is the boy, Barbara Williams is his mother, Michael Ironside is one of the evil government boys, and Sandy, the dog, is the dog (called Furface here; Einstein in the book). < br /> <br /> The monster effects are ridiculously cheesy, much of the dialogue is ridiculous, the script rarely makes sense or is credible - a good example is Haim's undisputed acceptance of the dog's intelligence, as if every Fido on the street Can enter messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no! Hmm, it must be the puppy food, right? Haim's performance is enthusiastic, but shaky, because he performs the stupid dialogue with the least skill Ironside was the highlight of many bad movies, and this is no exception, it easily gives the best performance of the movie, though I must be forced to add that the dog (who is himself a pretty good actor t!) comes in the immediate vicinity. All in all, a horrible dumb movie experience and yet. , , And yet I have seen it three times within a week. And yet I can not resist liking it. Hey, what can I say, I have a penchant for garbage - and Michael Ironside (not that I've ever tried Michael Ironside - I'm sure there are laws against it). But any movie that can make me laugh so much (yes, even unintentionally), can not be all bad. Chalk it to a guilty pleasure, a "Yes, I know, it is insultingly stupid, but I still like it" - movie. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to evaluate this. On a normal scale, I'm forced to give him a D, but on my personal cheese scale it collapses into an A-. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know. I'm so funny.
