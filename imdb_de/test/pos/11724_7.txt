Burt Reynolds's backlash against Clint Eastwood, who used his orangutan comedies to cover his Redneck comedy, was turning his own Dirty Harry into a Chicago thriller, Sharky's Machine. Originally conceived for John Boorman, but ultimately run by the star itself, it's a thoroughly commercial package where Reynolds is a narcissist who relocates to the Vice Squad (literally - they're in the basement) - and himself on the way makes a mysterious crime lord who supports Earl Holliman as the next governor. You can guess the rest, but while Reynolds sometimes loses sight of the story, he has a good eye for individual scenes and almost gets a performance from Rachel Ward as a top-notch hooker he falls in love with. The romantic subplot is unusually well developed, with some good action scenes and a few nice details, such as Vittorio Gassman's villain being a reflection of the hero or Reynolds and a murderer, both staking a witness from neighboring apartments in the same apartment Building. One of the better movies of the star from his glorious time. It's not a classic, but it's an extremely efficient Saturday night special.
