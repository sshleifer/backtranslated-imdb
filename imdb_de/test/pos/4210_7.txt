This is an airy, highly entertaining drama with an outstanding cast. Garfield is well suited as a boxer hiding from the police with this colorful crew, the Dead End Kids. Most notable of these is the beautiful Billy Halop, who has some very moving moments. Gloria Dickson, who died very early in a house fire in real life, is strong and very attractive as Halop's sister, and in the early scenes, Ann Sheridan, who is on the cusp of star, is a knock-out. As a crazy old granny, May Robson is very funny as a crazy old grandma, but Claude Rains proves that even a great actor can go down in flames if he's mistaken (who would have thought of him as a tough New York cop?). Busby Berkeley proves he's one good director with or without music number was. The movie moves at an incredible pace and the water tower sequence is very exciting and well photographed. The end is imaginative, and the plot is not amazing or original, but I still found it very enjoyable.
