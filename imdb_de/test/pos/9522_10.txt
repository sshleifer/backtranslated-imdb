I've always loved French movies because I think they're filled with a lot more emotion and meaning than the Americans. This movie is a gem. <br /> <br /> Starting with the wedding, which is so fun that you just want to get involved, and at the end, where the little family kids tell us who's with who's who's extremely funny. Catherine Deneuve is simply hot and so good that it is quite possible that a young man falls in love with her, and Vincen Lindon is perfect for this role. The best scene (except for the wedding party) takes place at the family reunion, where Antoine got angry and Lea screams in front of the family. It's a shame that I could only buy this movie from French and not from English (so I have to study in French to see it) !!
