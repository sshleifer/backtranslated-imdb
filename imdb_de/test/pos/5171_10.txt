It was nice to see John Denver again, though he died a few years ago. I found this movie very heartwarming and a great movie to sit by the fire on a cold winter night and remember what Christmas is all about. The scenes from Georgetown, Colorado, were great and let you go there instantly. When I was sitting here in my own mountain in California, I loved the story and the conspiracy. I hope that everyone who sees this slightly older movie will enjoy it as much as my mother and I. Merry Christmas! A great movie for the whole family. Enoy and tell others. Thanks for the reminder. We need more movies like these from Hollywood.
