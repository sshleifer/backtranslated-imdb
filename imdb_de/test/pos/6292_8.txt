I love it! I love Pauly Shore. It seems that some people do not agree. It's humor and he's not like everyone else. The movie is great. I love the story and most people in the movie. It's funny from the first time she meets him at school. I like the fact that she chooses him over the man at home. I like the Tiffani Theissan is not a bad girl in the end. All secrets are let out. Only the people you want to see are left in the end. (Except for those of you who do not like Pauly Shore.) Even if you dislike him, there are funny roles and her family torments him throughout the movie. She is a wild country girl and must be heard. She finally manages. It has just the right amount of love and romance. I give 8 out of 10 points.
