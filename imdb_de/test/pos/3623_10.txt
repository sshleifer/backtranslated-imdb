I saw the movie at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London, England. I really enjoyed it. Although the crow and the Chinese policeman do not show up and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the author (writer / director) voiced by Lord Richard Attenborough works very well. The rumor is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Film for just a pint of beer.) Spike was shown the movie on video before he died, and he has it all reportedly very much enjoyed.
