I happened to come across this movie. I mean, how else could I find out? It was not hyped up by the studios at all, and I also did not hear from my normally infected friends that it was released. After I threw away all my money for so many bad movies this year, I wish I had seen this in the cinemas, unlike DVD. Mike Judge is the master of disguising deliciously intelligent humor in a low-brow package. Just see "King of the Hill" for a while ... it's supposedly redneck humor, but it's a very subtle jab at Rednecks, while at the same time being very personable. I read the slogan for this movie and immediately ordered it from the internet. I really do not understand where these negative reviews come from, except perhaps from Carl's Jr. This movie is not only funny, but also balanced. Moments of recklessness are interspersed in our current superstar / corporate culture between funny visual gags and jabs. Sure, there is a bit of fart humor, but it's just for ridicule. The premise is only half-plausible, but since when does it really matter? I do not see any people who despise "Futurama" because the premise is very similar. Just look at this movie. If you do not laugh, something is really wrong with you. Maybe your father works for Gatorade or something, and the movie really offended him. Maybe you are an idiot. Probably the latter.
