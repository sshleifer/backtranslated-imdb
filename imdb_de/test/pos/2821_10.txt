I filmed this movie. I am very proud of the movie. It was a great experience that showed up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an outstanding person who had a vision and was able to record the film exactly as we had imagined during the film's preparation. The sets are fantastic and well made for every character. John York and his team built sets that did not just suit the characters, they worked well to make the movie so we could move seamlessly through walls and from set to set. Each character has an amazing bow that makes for a great story. I feel like all the actors have done a great job. I disagree with some other comments that say the show was not good. Take a look at it and decide for yourself.
