"The Mayor of Hell" has the feel of an early Dead End Kids movie, but with a much harder edge and fewer points of light ahead of the Dead Deed's first appearance by four years. James Cagney has a full screen opening credit, although technically the "mayor" of the film is portrayed by Frankie Darro, one of several boys sent to Reform School during the opening scenes. Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a young hero who is friends with 'Patsy' Gargan (Cagney) and is elected to the position when Gargan uses the opportunity to humanize the conditions at a state reform agency. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers Many of these types of films try to create a certain conscience at a time when the effects of crime and poverty are all too well known. This film is rather gloomy, with no excuse for ethnic stereotyping, such as the submissive attitude of a black father in court or the way a Jewish child runs a candy store in the Reform School. The rules of the Reformation are simple enough: work hard and shut up. step out of line and you personally answer Warden Thompson (Dudley Digges). Cagney's role in the story seems a bit ambiguous, as he is seriously trying to improve the conditions within the Reformation outside he still nominally has control over a criminal thug. The movie's attempt to juggle this dichotomy is, in my estimation, too short, and the finale tries to put things together in a neat package as Gargan awaits the outcome of an almost deadly shot from one of his followers. Not exactly the kind of role model you would look for in a movie like this. Warner Brothers cleaned up some elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled "Crime School," starring Humphrey Bogart in the series, the Cagney Role, and Billy Halop in the Frankie Darro section. If you're one of the dead-end kids, you'll probably like the last movie better, as it also features familiar faces like Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. The end, however, is somewhat blurred in this case too, as Bogart's guardian character is involved in the cover-up of a jailbreak. Both movies offer a romantic interest for the main characters, in "Mayor" Madge Evans is a reformist nurse who falls into Cagney's character. Interestingly enough, many of James Cagney's early films are not commercially available, so you'll need to keep your eyes open for a performance at Turner Classics or purchase the film from a private collector. Personally, I can not get enough of it and find interesting films in the films of all genres of the thirties and forties.
