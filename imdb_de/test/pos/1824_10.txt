It was 1983 and I was 13 years old. I saw Valley Girl at HBO one night when my parents worked. After the end, I wanted to talk to someone about it immediately. It turned out that my best friend saw it too and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that we saw it until we could recite it. We woke up her parents late at night and laughed hysterically. We started to worship the main character Julie, who was played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I'm not saying that this is a great classic. Although it is personal to me. And I understand that the whole Talettgespr√§ch is annoying, but those were the 80s. But deep in the heart of the movie - it's a love story and a familiar but good one. Girl meets boys and there are sparks from both sides, an instant connection. Julie's friends do not like him - he does not fit in, does not go to school, has no money. They like her better with her ex-boyfriend, the footballer, though he's an idiot. She brings the ultimate sacrifice - her own happiness for the happiness of her friends. And she has these really cool supportive hippie parents. It's one of Nicholas Cage's first films and his first starring role. One minute he is totally funny and the next incredibly touching and romantic. His friend Fred is also pretty funny. If you were a teenager in the 80s, you will love this movie or at least awaken memories. It's not my favorite movie anymore, but it's still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. I'm really looking forward to it being released on DVD if it's ever released. You can sign a petition on Deborah Foreman's website to be released on DVD. There are two soundtracks from the movie that are a must if you like 80s music.
