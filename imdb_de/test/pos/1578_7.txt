Kazuo Komizu strikes again with "Entrails of a beautiful woman", the sequel to "Entrails of a virgin". This time, the story revolves around a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to stand up to the Yakuza to avenge the suicide of a dumped and raped patient who ends up at her door one day. When she sits down over her head and the Yakuza captures her, she learns how she insidiously mobs girls and sells them into slavery. It seems to end badly if it is overdosed by cocaine. But she soon merges with another body to be disposed of to become dum, dum, dum. "Super Slime Hermaphrodite Zord"! This he, she = it makes minced meat from the yakuza and does not really save the day. <br /> <br /> Well, it's better than Entrails of a Virgin, but not much. The biggest part of the movie (full 67 minutes) consists of rape and sex with nebulas and the usual bumble-bee stuff. Almost towards the end, we finally get some cool sequences (like an alien-inspired penis monster through the stomach scene and a dizzying sense of suffocation), but it still suffers from an extremely low budget that is fun but can not do it from Z-grade soft horror core fare.
