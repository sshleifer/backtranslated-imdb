I just had to add my comment to increase the average to this one. Paul Giamatti leaves everything in this area and is a shout. He would probably say it was easy, but he's really doing a great job and should have had something to gain. We have had the DVD for several years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch it over and over again, and the humor is grown enough that I do not mind hearing them in the background ( and I'm running to the TV for the really funny part). Simple moral messages, lots of decent action and slapstick, "bad" adults who look stupid to take advantage, minimal bad language and minimal pots make it hard for a family standard to beat.
