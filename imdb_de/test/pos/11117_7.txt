This film and subsequent TV series became the legendary stand-in for what's great about America. <br /> <br /> Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several outstanding points, including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara * and the outstanding Gene Anthony Ray. The latter, who plays a walk-in dancer with no academic or other "street" credentials, is an amazing personality, and it pays to pay attention to what is essentially self-expression. A miracle, as a king used to say. <br /> <br /> The plot follows an interesting format - sometimes chronological, at other times genre, in some cases personalities ... but everything really ends in a kind of mush. <br /> <br /> Where Parker manages to make this movie into a real overdrive - with the most poignant and sometimes beautiful and down-to-earth music that goes with the performers step by step. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie is a highlight for all time. And, thankfully, this climactic cast of talented musicians and dancers as well as music is repeated throughout the credits. These are a series of credits that are worth persevering ... an achievement for eternity. The music of Christopher Gore is a gift to watch.
