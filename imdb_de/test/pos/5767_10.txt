This is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen - from beginning to end it was perfect in terms of timing, atmosphere, punchlines, background music, combat sequences and all sorts of other aspects you can imagine. To be honest, I find this movie as funny as its (Rik & Ade) sitcom "Bottom" - maybe even funnier. I've been laughing all the time throughout the movie and can only recommend seeing this movie ... But if you look at the kind of comedy that Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson did before, without knowing (or liking), You may not find everyone funny - but I really can not understand those who do not like it - THAT'S HUMOR FOLKS !!! (People are hit with frying pans, the boys walk around in red rubber underwear, the green vomit fills the corridors, the boys are kicked in the butt and get candlesticks in the eyes - HOW can not that be funny?) 10/10
