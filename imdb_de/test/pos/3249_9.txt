Two Hands has restored my confidence in Australian films. It took an old condition and made it fresh. I enjoyed this movie without end. I recommend it to people who like Guy Ritchie movies. Bryan Brown was fantastic and almost perfect in a tailor-made role. Ledger was pretty stupid and his performance anchored a very satisfying movie for me.
