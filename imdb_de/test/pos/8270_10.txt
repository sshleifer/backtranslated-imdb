Hello, I'm John and I want to tell you everything that my dog ​​was on the bait screen in this movie. He was the pit like one who would bite the man. My dog's name was Colin and he stayed for one week filming this movie. He was also in other things like Crime Watch UK and some other small parts. He won some dog shows, but he's deceased now, I miss him. He was a great, faithful dog and we had some great times together but he got cancer that could not be treated The worst day of my life, I hope that gives you something to watch out for in the movie if you still have it take a look. <br /> <br /> Thank you
