For the comedies on television, it is known today, whether sketch, sitcom or animated cartoon, it's nice to see something really refreshing. The Chaser must be the best comedy of the decade, with Seinfeld being the last triumph of the last. It follows the hosts' urban crusades to resolve situations, carry out ad-road tests, and try to keep the facts of our politicians in the old-fashioned way. <br /> <br /> Although it is sometimes very controversial, it shows excellent quality From the well done and really funny intro to the sketch style studies (sketch style only in time, they are not scripted, at least not at the other end of the page) Joke), is certainly worth a look. Even the most cynical and intellectual spectator will not be disappointed, and the show earns ten stars. All in all, the ABC is well done for its showing and I highly recommend it.
