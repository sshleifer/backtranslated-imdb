I really liked this movie about love between two adults in the UK. The high standard of BBC TV is evident in the production and outstanding leading actors (Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland) make this an uplifting experience. Bloom and Ackland have previously worked together in the theater, and their chemistry and interaction is great. I recommend this version of Shadowlands over the movie version of 1993.
