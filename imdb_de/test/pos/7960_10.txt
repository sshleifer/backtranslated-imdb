A photographer in the small town of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he suffers from a deadly disease, but the severity of his family and friends is downplayed. We never figure out what the disease looks like, but the focus of Hur Jin-ho's first film "Christmas in August" is not his illness. It is the grace in which he leads his life - his ability to accept what life has no regrets. Unfortunately, it was the last film the cinematographer Yoo Young-Kil made before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. <br /> <br /> The photographer Jung-won is played by Han Suk-kyu. at one time, Korea's most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with a contagious laugh. He is so warm and full of vitality that it's hard to imagine him nearing the end of his life. Jung-won owns a small photo shop and lives at home with his deaf-mate father (Goo Shin) and his sister (Oh Ji-hye). He teaches his father how to play movies on the VCR and writes instructions to take over his business if he dies. While Jung-won is taking care of the day-to-day business of fixing his affairs, the meter reader Dar-im (Shim Eun-ha) comes into his shop with an urgent request for photographic enlargements. <BR /> <br /> He abruptly and impatiently treats her with contempt, but apologizes later and becomes a regular. Without an obvious expression of romantic feelings, their relationship with a growing intimacy develops. Love is not what they say or do. It is their reason of being, the place from which they come. To protect Dar-im from suffering, Jung-won does not say that he has only a short time to live, but that does not make it any easier for her. His increasing absence from the store inevitably makes her feel betrayed and frustrated until she throws a stone through the shop window. Although Jung's decision to deny his illness is unanswered, the question remains open, but he feels organically in the character of the film and is not simply used as a tool or apology for the character, "to keep his life full To live trains ". through games. <br /> <br /> One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to her studio to take a souvenir photo of herself. Jung-won makes sure that the picture is an accurate reflection, knowing that he will soon be recording his own memory. Christmas in August is an unpretentious movie that never resorts to the melodrama to make its statement. It's about enjoying ordinary moments: cycling, sharing jokes, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story in which love means that you are sorry. Although there were many films to die for, in August, Christmas is taking the genre in a new direction, offering an unforgettable commentary on the human situation. This movie about death is an experience of utmost joy.
