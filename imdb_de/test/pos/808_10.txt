David Suchet (Poirot), "FoolProof," '03, performed excellently as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. If he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to dab the excess on his mouth with incredible perfection! They could only see the expressions on the detective's face and find that he never missed an important point in the suspects' behavior. The beautiful Falls Colors through the English countryside were just breathtaking. Megan Dodds, "Bait", 2000 did a great job as a very sexy, wild woman who could keep very important secrets from Mr. Poirot. A very entertaining movie, if you really like the acting of David Suchet as Mr. Poirot!
