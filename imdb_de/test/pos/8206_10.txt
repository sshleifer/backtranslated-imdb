Impressive! In my opinion, THE NET is an excellent, crisp techno-thriller, where you will feel completely comfortable. When I saw it for the first time, I felt good for days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought, "This is a really nice place for the holidays." From the moment Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) hunted her, I thought to myself, "Do not let anything bad happen to her!" I took a few deep breaths to stop yelling On the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious, and at the end I give this excellent, crisp techno-thriller four stars.
