Tromeo and Juliet may be the best Shakespearean modernization I've ever seen, not that there's much competition, but still ... All in all, Tromeo and Julia are definitely one of Troma's better Filming, one of them hiding the little beads in a huge pile of dung. It's a fun, action-packed, bloody approach to the greatest love story in the world, but he still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as possible, except for this kind of movie. Well, until the end, when Tromeo and Juliet kill Juliet's abusive father and live happily together in a sunny suburb with their viciously mutated children for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> THIS is the movie high School Literature lessons should be shown instead of poor students reading hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare's scripts. Thumbs up!
