In addition to being a clever and well-marketed version of the now-hugely popular horror genre and a great formula for potential new fans, over the decades I've always considered "Supernatural" to be a huge hommage to the genre , While not always conspicuous to younger viewers and / or individuals interested in more recent horror movies, each episode has some obvious and subtle references to classic and influential titles. From this point of view, it was only a matter of time before the authors of the films of the "scary vehicle without a driver" and in particular the milestones of the 70s "duel" (Steven Spielberg celebrated debut) and "the car". As an avid fan of these two films, I enjoyed the "Route 666" despite their shortcomings and shortcomings. The episode opens tense and atmospheric on a remote Missouri road where a black man is chased and eventually killed by a menacing monster truck with apparently no driver behind the wheel. The daughter of the victim, Cassie, happens to be Dean's ex-girlfriend, and she calls the Winchester brothers for help. The brothers can not prevent two similar "accidents" before they find out that the ghost truck's sudden presence dates back to a 1960s race dispute involving both Cassie's parents and several prominent residents of the small town. Some of my reviewers tend to refer to "Route 666" as one of the weaker submissions in the first season, mainly because the script is preachable in terms of racial issues and shows another and more emotional side of Dean's character. He is usually the strong silent type, while confronted with unfinished romantic things from the past. To some extent, I agree with the racism debate, but that did not really bother me. The writers eventually had to explain the presence of the ghost truck, and race conflicts are acceptable to me. With respect to Dean's emotional vulnerability, all I can say is that it is admirable to see the authors constantly trying to give the main characters depth and detail. Dean's attitude towards Cassie throws a completely new light on him. What really counts in this episode is the incredibly weird truck and its virulent attacks. It is an impressive and overwhelming vehicle that produces dazzling lights and gruesome engine sounds. If you've adored the ingenious "duel," you'll definitely enjoy the compelling chase sequences depicted in "Route 666."
