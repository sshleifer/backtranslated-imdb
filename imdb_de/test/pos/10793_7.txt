I tend to tend to films about people who choose to cross the boundaries of censorship and express what they really want to express. Eric Bogosian's character of Barry is like Howard Stern, but much smarter. The character itself is very fascinating. As an Oliver Stone movie I probably expected more. The movie sinks down a bit during the third act. And it's pretty obvious that "Talk Radio" is based on one piece, with long dialogue scenes. But overall, the movie works. Bogosian is great in the lead role, and the fact that he also wrote the piece the movie is based on has probably helped him. If you want to see one of Stone's larger films, you should try "JFK" or "Salvador". This is not his best work, but still a good movie.
