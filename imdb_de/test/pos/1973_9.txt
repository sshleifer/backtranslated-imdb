I loved this movie, but then again I'm a big Cronenberg fan. If you have not seen a movie by David Cronenberg, this is not a good start. Scanners, The Fly, Rabid would be a place to start and then work on Videodromes before you look at this. This is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive game phenomena a step further. <br /> <br /> In this game, players put a biotech gamepad through a socket into the spinal cord and enter the game directly through their nervous system. It is very hard to tell you more without revealing the story and the plot, but it is enough to say that this is a game that you will not forget. It's full of Cronenberg's slimy Bodyworks, dark, predictive landscapes that are all populated by a great cast like Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law and Willem Dafoe. These people will do anything to find out and then win the game. Like his other films, there is no lack of fantasy or parts to sink into the chair, but like a car accident you do not look away. If you liked any of the above movies, be sure to go out and get them.
