This movie was an excellent feature film, an excellent director, and had a great story overall. I had real experiences with a boy like 'Radio'. Every year at the football program in my city, Weve had a mentally handicapped boy who was training, traveling and having fun with the football team. This movie is really true and I can identify with it 100%. A boy like "Radio" just needs to feel like he belongs to something. They have to feel that their life is worth living. That's how "Radio" feels and that's why this kind of program is being set up at my high school. This is a very touching film that I brought to the big screen. My dad and I loved it and I will always remember that I am a movie that tells a fascinating story about the goodness and kindness of man!
