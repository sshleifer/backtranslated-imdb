"Murder Over New York" is an entertaining introduction to the Charlie Chan movie series, but if you watch out, there are plenty of action holes for the watchful eye. During an annual police conference to New York City, Chan (Sidney Toler) met former Scotland Yard investigator Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock) on the same flight. Drake is now on military intelligence and is following Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant, who is suspected of sabotage around the world. Drake believes that by contacting Narvo's elusive wife, he will be able to clarify the whereabouts of the master criminal. <br /> <br /> As Drake lands dead in the library of George Kirby, president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation Charlie believes he was killed by a recently discovered toxic gas called "tetrogen" administered via a glass pellet which releases the poison in case of a break. Chan and Police Inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) ask Kirby to bring all the guests to his dinner party together and question those present as one of the murderers could be the killer. Among them was Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), an Oxford Oxford student, actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), who was unknown to Drake but was invited by him to attend, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), chief designer of the aircraft company Kirby. and Keith Jeffrey, Kirby Stockbroker. Kirby Butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) # 2 caught him with an open cable gram whose contents concern Boggs himself. <br /> <br /> There are a few other smartly planted characters in the process as well. Mrs. Narvo appears as Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver), and contrary to Drake's suspicion she might lead him to Narvo, she is on the run from her former husband and a devastating marriage. She is involved in David Elliott (Robert Lowery), the director of a chemical research firm and a suspect in the tetrogen sector. As with many Chan films, racist comments must be included in the process. This offers two crass. When Kirby's black servant is brought in for questioning, he explains that he does not know about Drake's murder, that he is completely "in the dark". Chan's answer: "Condition seems contagious". Later, after Inspector Vance gave the order to rally all the Hindus in New York, Jimmy Chan comments on their arrival: "They all look the same to me." In fact, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the film, as Shemp Howard embodies the Hindu mystic "The Great Rashid," but is actually discovered by the police to be the artist Shorty McCoy. <br /> <br /> Before the film is over, two more victims fall to the wise Narvo - his Confederate Ramullah and the aircraft magnate Kirby. To uncover the killer, Chan, along with Elliott, arranges a test flight aboard a newly developed TR4 bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule the day before that was planted by mechanics on the plane. Before he can let go of his deadly poison, the Brit Fenton catches the falling capsule in the middle of the air and reveals that he knew about the plant. Chan is arrested and taken to the interview. Fenton is not Narvo. The real Narvo reveals himself as he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous Fenton, who seeks to keep Narvo's secret. But Chan was smart enough to guard against such an attempt, revealing the true killer - Narvo, who is modeled after stockbroker Jeffrey after undergoing reconstructive operations after a car accident. Now for conspiracy holes. In the first investigation into the murder of Hugh Drake, the police claimed that fingerprints found in the library did not match those of dinner guests. At the dinner party, however, Jeffrey / Narvo was present. It had already been established that Drake had a non-party visitor in the library, chemist Elliott. If the fingerprints really did not belong to Narvo, there was no point in making them a problem. <br /> <br /> Also at the end of the film, when Narvo Fenton offered the poisoned water, how would he have thought he would get away with it all as witnesses? But even better, how would a saboteur of the world like Narvo have the time to establish himself as a New York stockbroker? It just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> There are a few more points for Trivia fans. In Movie Number 2 Son Jimmy is a student studying chemistry while seeking "pops" to help solve the case. In the previous Chan movie - "Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum" - Jimmy was a law student. The poison gas formula would be revised in a later Chan film, this time by Monogram at Roland Winters in the Chan role in "Docks of New Orleans". In this story, similarly, poison gas is released from shattered radio tubes to claim its victims.
