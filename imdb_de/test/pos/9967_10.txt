William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice is about a Jewish money lender and his affiliation to take a pound of meat from the wealthy merchant Antonio, the debtor of a debt. Of course, the Jewish money lender is Shylock and he is performed so impressively by Al Pacino that even outstanding actors like Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynne Collins take a back seat. The film is set in 16th century Venice. Director Michael Radford focuses on setting, mood and realism to tell his story, dispensing with elaborate costumes from the past or a modern ambience with rock music to appeal to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Radford cuts the three hours of play to a manageable two hours and eight minutes and also provides a historical background. In the opening speech he tells us how Jews came to England, who were subjected to increasing persecution and eventually expelled from England. They were forbidden to own property, could only make profits by lending interest, and had to live in a Venetian "geto," a forerunner of darker events. In the film, the dealer spits out Antonio (Jeremy Irons) Shylock in public, but is not ashamed if he wants to go to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and lover, Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) Portia (Lynne Collins) neatly manages the court. a rich heiress. Although Shylock has been insulted by Antonio, he agrees to borrow the money without interest for three months, on the condition that the cancellation of the bond gives him the right to demand one pound of meat from Antonio's heart. The game is first and foremost a drama of hate and revenge, but like many of Shakespeare's works, there is also a broad comedy. The comedy includes three lovers: Bassanio and Portia, Gratiano, Bassanio's friend and Nerissa, and Lorenzo, another friend of Bassanio, and Jessica, Shylock's daughter. Portia has offered herself to the person who can choose the right treasure from one of three boxes of gold, silver and lead. The Prince of Morocco chooses gold, the Prince of Aragon silver, and both are disappointed. However, Bassanio loves her and opens the leaden coffin to find the portrait in it. Radford's adaptation gives a remarkable sense of time and place. Portia's residence in Belmont proposes one of those sumptuous summerhouses with immaculate gardens and art treasures hanging in every room. It stands in contrast to Shyock's city with its dank streets. <br /> <br /> When this becomes clear Antonio can not repay the debts, Bassanio returns to Venice and leaves Portia behind. When he arrives, the loan is in default and Shylock demands his pound of meat. Even if Bassanio, supported by Portia's wealth, offers a multiple of the repayment amount, Shylock is aiming for revenge not only for the loss of money, but also for a life as an outsider. The Duke, who is in court, will not intervene because Portia acts as a lawyer to defend Antonio. Here the film reaches a dramatic climax as all parties come to court to reach a final resolution. The merchant of Venice acts not only of an unpaid debt, but also of the alienation of the Jews from Christian society and their desire for belonging. It was one of Shakespeare's most controversial plays, and analysts have long debated whether it is an anti-Semitic piece or simply an anti-Semitism that reflects the prevailing view of Christian society in Elizabethan England. Although Shylock is definitely a caricature, he is an ambiguous figure, and there is much evidence that Shakespeare sees his mistakes as human error, not as Jewish. The Duke realizes that he is simply a man who does not follow the compassionate language of the Torah. <br /> <br /> In the monologue: "I am a Jew, does not a Jew have eyes?" If you stabbed us, would not we bleed? If you tickle us, are not we laughing? If you poison us, will not we die? And if you do us wrong, are not we taking revenge? "Shylock shows a universal humanity that expresses equality of all men, and although we are appalled at the punishment that he seeks to execute, we can feel his pain accumulating over the years." Pacino's performance brings new ones Power in the text and his often exaggerated personality is replaced by a gentler, more restrained attitude that brings understanding to his cause.In an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival last September, Radford said of Pacino: "If you work with a brilliant actor, do you have a great machine. It's a bit like driving a strong car. You have to dare. "He dared and we are all beneficiaries.
