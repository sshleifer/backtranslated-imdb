This movie marked the end of the "serious" Universal Monsters era (Abbott and Costello later hit the monsters in "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankentstein"). It was a somewhat desperate but entertaining attempt to revive the classic monsters of the Wolfman, Frankenstein's Monster and Dracula for a "last time". I say desperately, because in Frankenstein's previous movie "House" both Dracula and the Wolfman are killed, depending on how the legends of the vampire and the werewolf say they should be (Dracula in sunlight and the Wolfman in a silver bullet But somehow they return home with no explanation in House of Dracula, which could have been played as a sort of prelude to House of Frankenstein if the Frankenstein monster plan were not chronologically continued in House of Dracula by the House of Frankenstein and the Wolfman was not Then there would be no action holes, but since this is not the case, the actions of Dracula and the Wolfman make no sense. <br /> <br /> If ignored, House of Dracula is a classic atmospheric one It has a lot of highlights, especially to see how the wolf man gets healed, I know, I just made a word of it That this should not be included, but it was nice to see how he was cured after all this time. And the scene with the lady playing "Moonlight Senada" on the piano suddenly played a haunting tune as she was very scary under Dracula's spell. Dr. Edlemans transformation into the character "Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde" was also very well done. <br /> <br /> And it's great to see Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman together, a "last one". Time. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
