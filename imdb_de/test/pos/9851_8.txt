Well-made documentary about two Sudanese refugees being resettled in the United States. It's your basic story from the water with a non-fiction twist. I found it fascinating to see how Peter and Santino lived before they arrived in America and how they adapted well when they arrived here (in Houston, Texas) well in the States. They go from hopeful idealists to more realistic skeptics. Wherever they go, they encounter bureaucrats with paper paths that are commonplace to most citizens. They are annoyed that they are blacker than the African Americans and therefore do not feel accepted. One of the "Lost Boys" manages to leave Houston to go to Olathe, Kansas, where he finds the conditions a little better but still not ideal. There are people who try to help them and hurt them in this movie. Not shown, but talked about, are those who turned on and robbed a gun, causing a Lost Boy to negatively comment that "all black people in America are not good." I also found it interesting that they arrived in Houston in August 2001, a month before the World Trade Center was attacked by terrorists. I had hoped to see her reaction to this tragedy, but she is not mentioned at all. All in all, a really successful documentary without narration. Nobody is really needed. The Lost Boys do a good job explaining the events around them without any help. Many Thanks.
