Since I'm a big diehard Monkey Island fan, I thought it would be awful, since Ron Gilbert did not make it. Boy, I was surprised! Although it's still not as good as the first two, it has the comedy I wanted. I was a bit nervous about the new graphics, the new SCUMM engine, and the fact that she was on a CD. But it all came together and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. I especially liked that SWORD FIGHTING had returned. And the whole story about finding the big, unbroken ring was just unbelievable. Try this two-CD adventure. And now we're looking forward to seeing Monkey Island 4: Escape from Monkey Island REALLY REALLY Coming Soon! This autumn!
