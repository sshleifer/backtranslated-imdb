Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were one of the best buddies ever to work together. They've done a lot of movies together, I think both are fantastic when working together in a movie. Out to sea is a fantastic comedy movie that I think I'm watching. I give the movie 10 out of 10 points. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau will be remembered when the films they shot together are shown on television. You will be sadly missed. God bless you both.
