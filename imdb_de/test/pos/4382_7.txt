After seeing the highly acclaimed fargo and thinking that he was no more than average, I strayed if it was a good idea to rent another Coen masterpiece. This time I was much less disappointed than Fargo, and I have to say that this is mainly due to the good jokes and the good demeanor of George Clooney. Well done, Mr. Clooney, make more and less "Perfect Stormish" movies. You can trade and you have shown it here. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 points
