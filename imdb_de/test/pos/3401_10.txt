I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best pieces of civil war I have seen, telling a story of friendship shared by the war. The costumes are great, the storylines are great, I love how the story leaps from character to character to guess what's going to happen next in your life. There is a great balance between good and evil. Some of the characters I think are evil are too good not to look at. Every time something horrible happens, I curse the TV as if they can hear me. I love how I feel in love with her drama in this miniseries. However, I would advise NOT to watch the third movie in the DVD series. Compared to the first two films, it is a flop, and most of the original characters do not return. I do not want to remember how the third movie ended, I prefer living with the thoughts of the end in the second movie. It makes me happy.
