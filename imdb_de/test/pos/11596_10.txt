Much more eloquent reviews than that have described the rather spectacular acting, casting and styling of this film. It seems that the only negative critiques focus on a perceived imbalance in dealing with the film's core moral issue (euthanasia). <br /> <br /> This film is meticulous, apart from the final scenes, when he emphasizes Ramon's belief that he is not. One has to say something big, but only that for him a life without dignity is a life, that is not worth living. We as viewers see a tremendous amount of dignity in their lives - we see family and friends and culture and, apart from the physical limitations, a life that is fully lived. For the tragedy of this film, it is crucial that only one person really thinks that Ramon's life is not worth living - and he is. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie and saying that the only counter-argument comes from visiting a grumpy priest is a nonsense. The visit of the priest is pure farce, a direct attack on the simplicity of the response of the Spanish Catholic Church to the question of euthanasia. However, sister's words of farewell to the priest instantly reveal the powerful 'pro-life' feelings that quietly support the entire movie. We are always encouraged to see the hope and beauty of a life lived with love. As the film progresses, we are gradually encouraged to understand Ramon's reasoning, but we are never consistent with his decision. <br /> <br /> I can not remember a movie that moved and provoked me so much.
