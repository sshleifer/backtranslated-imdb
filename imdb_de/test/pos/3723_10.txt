A poetic investigation of the human condition without dialogue. The anti-hero The Man builds a device to escape a group of marauders, from the desert of a former civilization, to the ruins of the city to survive. There he crosses paths with The Brute, brilliantly played by Jean Reno, from "The Professional" and "Mission: Impossible". The man is rescued by a crazy old genius living in a fortress of his own design. With their minds, the man and the old genius can keep the breed and its people in check, but they realize that it's only a matter of time before their defense is compromised, so they take a break. This is a starkly understated story of the desperate struggle for life with excellent action scenes and smart humor. Of all the films of this kind, such as "Road Warrior", "Omega Man" and even "Ultimate Warrior" (with Yul Brenner as Buff knife fighter), "Le Dernier Combat" is the most elaborate craft. Copies of the video are hard to find, I would give my left eye for one. If your local art house ever revives this film, I heartily recommend that you break any engagement to see it big.
