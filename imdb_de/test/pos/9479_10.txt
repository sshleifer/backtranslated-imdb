If you like Cagney, you will like this movie. It has the appearance of American integrity at any cost, be it personal or social. Cagney plays the head of weights and dimensions in NYC. Cagney turns against crooked politicians, the criminal underground, a prominent philanthropist, and simple grocers adding a few ounces to the price of a chicken. The chicken scene is hilarious as Cagney finds a weight in the bird's cave from an unsuspecting butcher. The chicken is thrown around the store in a funny scene about who controls the "evidence". If you like old phones, there are interesting scenes with voting machines, telephones and even bizarre telephone cables. Compared to many films being made today, this is pure entertainment and includes a mystery with comedy and the message that honesty should above all be the guiding principle of humanity. Made in simpler times, it reflects a world we can not find today. The fashion (especially hats) outwear and automobiles play an important role in defining this little movie.
