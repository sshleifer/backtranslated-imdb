Hollywood is one of the best and nicest things that have happened in my life. I admire and am very fascinated by how Hollywood generates and implements ideas. I wonder about the extent of the human brain. I've seen Flatliners a long time ago, but the story, the direction, the cast, and the acting are still fresh in my mind. The story begins with our lead actor Sutherland, who says during sunrise: "What a beautiful day to die". For all of us it is a story that shows emotions that are sometimes held back in our heads throughout our lives. I can never understand a few things in life. It shows us to be motivated and to improve our quality of life. However, I suggest everyone to have a look.
