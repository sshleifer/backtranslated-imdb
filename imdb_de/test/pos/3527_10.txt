This totally forgotten Slasher movie is one of the best horror movies ever made. Sometimes it reminds me very darkly of the famous thriller "Deliverance". Director Jeff Lieberman creates a terrifying atmosphere of fear and despair. All actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable. So if you are looking for something spooky try to find this little treasure. My personal Rating: 10 out of 10.PS This is even more terrifying than "Halloween".
