I must confess, I was surprised how good this movie was when I saw it for the first time. I had planned to see it in the cinemas in the summer, but uncomfortably realized that it was already gone. So I expected it to be removed from cinemas because it was bad. Then I rented, saw and enjoyed it today. The speed with which events occurred was questionable, it could have taken a little longer. I found it very fitting for the book, but some important parts were omitted: Mullet Fingers real name, etc. I felt like I had not read the book. I did not really understand what was going on. The acting was pretty good, another thing that I expected to be bad. The policeman, sorry, I can not remember the actor's name, could have done something better. All in all, I found this movie very entertaining and would recommend it to any audience!
