"Opera" is a great movie with wonderful, imaginative images. An opera singer (Cristina Marsillach) is chased by a murderer who forces her to watch him murder anyone who knows her, by pinching her and taping needles under her eyes. This idea of ​​the needles comes from the fact that Argento does not like it when people hide their eyes while watching his films. "I've been annoyed for years when people cover their eyes during the gorier moments in my movies, and I film these images because I want people to see them and avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away I wonder, 'How would it be possible to accomplish this and force someone to watch the most gruesome murder and make sure he can not avert his eyes?' The answer I came up with is at the core of what it is at "Opera" goes. " - says Argento. Lots of excitement, wonderful cinematography and brutal, bloody murders. A guy is stabbed in the neck with a knife, causing a gush Wound, Daria Nicolodi is shot in the eye while I look through the peephole, etc. For anyone who has not yet caught, give it a try. We recommend.
