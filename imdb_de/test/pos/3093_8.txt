Werner Herzog, undoubtedly one of the most interesting filmmakers of the past fifty years, may have crossed the boundaries of cinema more than any other commercial filmmaker. I have been familiar with the Duke for several decades and was not impressed by either the man or his work. Last year I was with Rescue Dawn and was a bit surprised how relatively mainstream the movie was. Nevertheless, I could not imagine that Duke brought his actors and his crew into the real jungle, not only to shoot the film, but also to live. No other filmmaker is so crazy about the purity of the film-making process and subsequent productions of such productions when Fitzcarraldo became a film legend. Today I have sat down to Fata Morgana, a Duke from 1969, film that could be termed an allegorical cinematic postcard. Without exploring the actual locations, I assume that it was shot somewhere in Africa, both on the coast and in the desert, a region that would once have been the birthplace of infancy, children's culture and infant life on earth can. It is these origins, the biblical idea of ​​the Garden of Eden, and the Apocalypse Duke deals with, as the narrative distributed during the 79-minute term expresses. I could not help watching FM, but I feel like a passenger on a deep journey. In the opening sequence, the title translates to "Mirage," and Herzog contrasts this translation with several commercial jet reps landing on a runway. These images are perverted, their 3-dimensionality is flattened by a long lens, foaming flue layers, heat waves and light deviations on top of each other. The effect made me conclude: Things are not what they seem. <br /> <br /> FM is divided into 3 very different chapters: 1) Creation, 2) Paradise and 3) The Golden Age. Chapter One opens with countless weary images, in which gloomy, barren landscapes roll past, dead animals rot, broken shells of crashed airplanes and abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in the desert sun. The people who populate this inhospitable landscape are confused, without smiles and apparent prisoners of the desert. The narrative speaks of a time before life, a time when the canvas of the earth was empty and everything that existed was heaven. While the narrative belongs to a simpler, purer era, a portrait of a young man holding a fox-like creature in the throat evokes a frightening account of the man's cruel, reckless attempt to gain control over nature. <br /> <br /> In the next chapter, we'll get to know more about the same thing, but the images and people are more vivid and seem to be steeped in a measure of life and vitality. We listen to a biologist with glasses talking about the difficulty that a monitor lizard looks for prey in such a lifeless environment. As he holds the writhing monitor and flicks his tongue, he also describes how difficult it is to trap those creatures in the scorching 140-degree heat. The parallels are duly noted, and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated, candid portraits of persons affected by the sun, the desert, and the arduous efforts in this hard area. He also urges the issue that when man is not in control, he controls his environment and not always in the most comfortable way. <br /> <br /> The last chapter takes us out of the blaze of the desert and into the more famous Duke territory with eccentrics and absurd behavior. No one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the weird orbs of the world than Duke - perhaps he feels most at home here. Similar to Errol Morris, Herzog chooses his camera in a seemingly objective position before letting the film roll. The ensuing flirtation that Herzog has with his theme is the result of being able to shoot far beyond the point where most directors would have called the cut. This extended role, like Morris, pushes past the "on" moment that subjects are committed to, and their façade gives something real to their unease of being pushed into overtime. The most humorous portrait in this chapter is the 2-person band, which plays a strange, polka-like song that Herzog reuses in this chapter. The drummer of the band wears the same glasses as the biologist. Another guy doing a magic trick and asking the question: what about the glasses? They definitely give the film some lightness, but you have to wonder if they have a deeper meaning or meaning, or is this just another example of Duke's joy in playing. <br /> <br /> Aside from the narrative, Herzog uses folk and blues music as the soundtrack of the experimental documentary. Leonard Cohen has most of the screen time, two of his beautifully melancholic songs "So Long Marianne" and "Suzanne". Accompany the scrolling landscapes perfectly and make sure we really come along. At the end of the journey, Herzog returns to one of the many shots that repeat throughout the film: the distant frame of a lone vehicle that traverses the endless desert, surrounded by a water level that fills the horizon. Despite the general weakness of FM, the crescendo of the film and the Fata Morgana motif leave you with a hopeful spirit and the conviction that life will endure and possibly even thrive despite adversity I referred FM to discovering Duke it shot dead just weeks after a bloody coup in Sahara-Cameroon. According to his legend, Herzog and his crew were arrested, beaten and imprisoned. During his imprisonment, Herzog contracted schistosomiasis, a blood parasite. It's really hard not to love a hypnotic and rigorous movie like Fata Morgana; Knowing that the filmmaker was ready to die to finish him makes you even more respectful. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
