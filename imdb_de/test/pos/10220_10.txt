The movie 'Nightbreed' is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Overall, I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but there's something about this movie that is more atmospheric and different from any other horror movie I've ever seen. I've enjoyed watching a lot of horror movies I've seen, but because they're based on horror, I know the stories are unreal because they're fictional, so I can not take them all seriously. On the other hand, Nightbeed is a unique horror genre because it gives a realistic feel that I've seen in a few other horror movies. <br /> <br /> This film describes how a man is murdered and ends living with the undead in an underground cemetery seat with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreaming nightmare, because this is a very unique and original plot. Most of the horror movies I've ever seen are all fake, but because Nightbreed was so incredibly refined and ingenious with great acting, especially directed by Craig Sheffer (Aaron Boone), amazing special effects, great lighting and fantastic dialogues, I found this one Film a sense of depth and maturity without stupid false horror parody, as is the case with many other horror films. Nightbreed is not only horror, but also elements of thriller, romance and action in one. If you have not seen this movie, I recommend you to watch it as I rate it at 10/10.
