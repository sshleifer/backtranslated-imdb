If I look hard enough, you can find flaws in this movie, mainly with the script. I did not find the character of Wolf quite convincing. These were my only "complaints". When this movie started at Cable, I just wanted to record it and watch it later. But from the beginning, when the weird music and Cameron Diaz danced their 60s dance, I was fascinated. I never got up until the movie was over. It seemed like I would never blink. <br /> <br /> The show of Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster was excellent. The scenes were beautiful, the girls were beautiful and the music was haunting and very touching. The story was quite unique and sometimes had a surreal quality. The viewer would rather like the picture if he had a good understanding of the state of mind of young people in the 60s and 70s, especially in America. In many scenes, it has essentially been possible to show something of this time that is difficult to describe. It was a bit more complicated than the simplistic statement that they wanted to change the world and end up disillusioned, though this might be the most obvious aspect. Phoebe learns more and more about it as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> One aspect that other reviewers might not mention is the way the two daughters drift through life after their father's death. They had both worshiped him, and his presence had been a stabilizing factor in their lives, and obviously he had loved them very much. Today we have read so much about boys who lose their fathers too soon, just to lose themselves. This film covers the effects of the loss of the father on the backward daughters, first to the older sister Faith and then to her younger sister. Her mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents. This type of dynamic is rarely found in any other film, especially in so many different levels of plot and subplot. Phoebe's inner reality struggles against perceptions are gradually peeled off like an onion layer. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Plot, this movie should be higher than here. I've always been waiting for a big conspiracy because of the death of the faith. How the problem solved surprised me, even though others guessed it earlier. <br /> <br /> Maybe not for everyone, but I could often watch this movie.
