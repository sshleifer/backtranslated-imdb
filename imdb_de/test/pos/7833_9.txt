The slogan on the box reads: "100 PASSENGERS ... 3,000 VENOMOUS VIPERS!" You almost have to admire that degree of "no chance in hell we'll ever meet to keep that promise." I could admire The Asylum 'hucksterism more if they made films that were good or at least worth a damn. Haha, and I like those movies. They are garbage. You put them in a toilet and then you rinse. It's worth the price if you're a fan of kitschy movies. It is a cult classic among many fans. The Gore scenes are effective, I can not say much, it's a Z-strip parodying the new movie with Samuel L. Jackson, damn it, maybe it's better, who knows!
