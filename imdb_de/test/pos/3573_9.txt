I actually saw this movie with low expectations as it was the only one that suited my schedule. And amazingly, I found it really original. I have already commented on other Colombian films, and I agree that Colombian films have a similar scheme and always try to refer to the average citizen, especially when trying to joke from the constant cursing. But let's face it, the language in this movie is not over the top. Unfortunately, real people speak that way. The plot and tempo are brilliant and could be transferred to any country in the world. The acting was great and the script is for me one of the best ever produced on Colombian soil. I think everyone around the globe can have a good hour and a half of entertainment with a beautiful black humor comedy. It somehow reminded me of movies like Snatch and others of this kind. I highly recommend it and hope it can be seen by more people as the Colombian films have been more international since last year.
