Dolemite is a blaxploitation film about Dolemite and his army of kung fu killer women, led by Queen Bee. He struggles to bring back Willie Green's The Total Experience club, using their kung fu skills and devotion to him. I liked this movie because of the witty dialogue and ability of Rudy Ray Moore to preach to his brothers in rhyme.
