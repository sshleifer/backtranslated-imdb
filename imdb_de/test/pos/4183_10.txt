This film, like much of his music, is either underestimated or unnoticed by the occasional viewer. It's great and in many ways ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> The pictures are funny, disturbing and at least appealing. <br /> <br /> The music is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is not the "candy pop" sound that they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt. Only HEAD should bring The Monkees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can someone tell me why these people are not there?
