Writers and directors take a step back from their plot and show insights into characters and situations. Here Huston and Joyce have left a larger frame behind to give us the ultimate view of what it means to be human. Until the very end, the film does not seem to be much about anything, about typical circumstances that fill everyday life. Only at the end of the last scene do we realize that it really is about everything. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to see this last scene without feeling both compassion and deep affection for yourself and the rest of your fellow human beings.
