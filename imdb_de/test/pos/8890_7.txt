A deliciously nasty black comedy about a middle-aged dude (Danny DeVito) who wants to bump his mother and hatch a plan with a fierce divorce that wants to bump his ex-wife. In its cynicism, the film is completely unsightly and does not appeal to us, but for once, it works in favor of the film and not as a distraction. Anne Ramsey, as DeVito's ax-mother, steals the show in a grotesquely witty performance. Although she's a horror, in the end you're rooting for her because it looks as if she could kick both DeVitos and Crystal in the ass while both hands are tied behind her back. Note: B +
