This is a finely crafted film with moving sequences, humor and above all a love story. Anthony Quinn is wonderfully well-to-do, and after seeing some of his films, he has to be considered one of Zorba's best performances. The movie really lets you know if it was filmed in Romania, which does not seem to be the case. It is safe to deceive even native Romanians with their authentic-looking landscape, their costumes and their way of life. According to IMDb, it is actually filmed in France and Yugoslavia, hmmm. The story is captivating, so you want to watch the entire movie to see if you've missed something. It has made me think to see if this is a truth-based film, but to my disappointment, it's a novel-based film that seems to be a fiction. It seems a bit far-fetched to really have happened, but you never know ... The problem with this movie is that it does not seem like a Romanian actor and it's a film about a Romanian character. In the beginning, there are probably many Romanian fill-ins, but maybe not, it will be shot elsewhere. The author of the book was Romanian, at least that's all well and good - overall a masterpiece of cinematography.
