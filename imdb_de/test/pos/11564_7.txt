Dakota Incident is a curiosity for several reasons. It is clear from the beginning that it was done long before anyone thought of political correctness. Although the Ward Bond figure may marginalize with "maybe we can communicate with them, even if they are human," the dialogue is a bit milder. His part is side by side with the preacher who tries to communicate with the Martians in the War of the Worlds. In fact, it is scary. The title is also curious. The use of the word "incident" gives the film a meaning and sophistication that Boxoffice has probably not violated. The fictional collection of characters and Linda Darnell's costume and hat are wonderful, vintage accents that make Dakota Incident a cool Western artifact from the fifties.
