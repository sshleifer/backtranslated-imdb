Burt Reynolds Direct's and stars in this great cop movie, Reynold's drama is the Sharkey of the title, who's a tough cop as he works in a covert drug junk that goes bad and is degraded to vice. <br/> <br /> The machine of the title refers to the colorful crew of Reynold to overthrow a crooked governor involved in first-class prostitution. Cocaine and contract killing, <br /> <br /> The colorful crew is played by Brian Keith, Blackploitaion favorite Bernie Casey. Richard Libertini (as weird as an ace-man man) Charle's Durning, the boss, The Beautiful English, rose as Rachael Ward's Dominoe, a $ 1,000-a-night hooker whom Reynolds came across as protection and ultimately an apartment he uses the governor. <br /> <br /> Italian actor Vittorio Gassman, the pimp of the High Stakes, who has a deadly gang of triads, and Henry DeSilva, his psychotic brother, beats a man who is on prescription painkillers gel Dust, <br /> <br /> The action-packed finale is the remaining member of the "Machine". With Desilva in a deadly shoot-out that ends in one of Celluloid's most spectacular stunts, Alas Hollywood has no more ideas and is considering a remake of Sharky's Machine! Why a DVD to the 25th Anniversary Special Edition disturbs, is not a stupid remake.
