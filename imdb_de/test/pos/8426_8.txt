Here is one of Jane Austen's films that I found very adorable. I read the book first and listened to it on CD. I was intrigued by how to convince a young Victorian girl to marry the man she loved because he had no fortune or education. The joy of knowing that Anne is obviously reunited with a lost love. The fact that her godmother tries to marry her for a good for nothing is a cousin who only wants money. A look at the snobbery of the upper classes and how class differences can separate couples from their hearts. Captain Wentworth realizes he still loves Anne after seven years. His final understanding that Anne's love was constant all the time, and she would not allow her family to meddle in her true happiness and later marriage with one she truly loved.
