Honestly, I loved Michael. even though it "give me a pillow, I need a nap," it was cool. I think everyone has done a great job in this film. and nora ephron is in my "ok" list of directors. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see John Travolta as a chubby angel. It's not very often that I see one in a movie. Some people may call this a boring movie, but I liked it for myself. Angel and everything.
