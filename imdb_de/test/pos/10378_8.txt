Do not expect a classic military comedy claiming to make fun of the military and only improve the militaristic perspective. Instead, the elements are deconstructed, turning the military into a murderous machine. A kind of DDR version of "Buffalo Soldiers". <br /> <br /> "NVA" works on a meta-level that sympathizes with heroes' escape attempts to flee the army in every possible way. It's not about loud laughter, but a long-lasting smile. Utopian of course (in one scene you are shown the harsh reality), but very thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Just to fill in the required 10 lines: Do not go into this movie if you've been an army officer and liked your job.
