Following the release of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937), Walt Disney Productions continued to produce high-quality animated feature films for children, many of which I still can not see. "The AristoCats (1970)" by Wolfgang Reitherman was the twentieth film in Disney's official canon and is a romantic musical comedy about a family of aristocratic cats that lived in Paris, France, in 1910. In the villa of the elderly Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (voiced by Hermione Baddeley), her loving cats? including Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens? are the main inhabitants. When the hulking butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) learns that the cats inherit the entire fortune of the old lady, he sets out to dispose of the pets and throw them into the countryside away from the big city. Lost and confused, Duchess and her children meet Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who says good things to them, and agrees to show them the way home. <br /> <br /> "The AristoCats" is not particularly remarkable, with much earlier Disney films like "Snow White". and "Fantasia (1940)", which demonstrates a similar or even superior visual style. The story, however, is interesting and exciting. I will bet, especially for younger spectators? and the musical numbers that I wish were more numerous are terrific. For the sake of simplicity, I call my two favorite songs "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and "Ev'rybody Wants to a Cat". The latter is a psychedelic relapse into the late '60s with a swing jazz band and flashing colors, led by a trendy cat called Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers). The family's journey to Paris is varied and adventurous. We meet such friendly characters as Amelia and Abigail Gabble (two talkative geese), Uncle Waldo (the couple's drunken relative), Georges Hautecourt (Madam Bonfamille's ancient, sparkling lawyer), and Napoleon and Lafayette {two pale-hunted hounds hungry for the butt of the Butlers}.
