The Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so much of the young Audrey Hepburn and the camera in THE CRANES ARE FLYING seems to love her as well. It is the center of a bittersweet war romanticism against the background of the Second World War in Moscow. <br /> <br /> The film is in its magnificent B & W cinematography, which was the main reason for the first movie, almost poetic place, since I had never heard of it and decided to give it a try than it did on TCM was broadcast. <br /> <br /> It is a very moving love story about the deep love of a girl for a man who is suddenly carried away his role as a soldier was designed in Russia during the war. She can not forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him, but inexplicably marries another person who has forced herself on her, a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes. Her marriage is difficult because she can not let go of her memory of a happier time with her soldier treasure. <br /> <br /> At the end of the story, she accepts the idea that he will never come back and is able to face reality and cope with the situation. There is an extremely poignant closing scene at a train station where arriving soldiers greet their loved ones, and the whiny girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving flowers to the happy families from their bouquet of flowers Stylish and striking camera work wears the film as well as the honestly played History. <br /> <br /> Tastefully done, but maybe the English subtitles did not tell the whole story, as some elements of the storyline seemed a bit blurry for me, as if they had been whitewashed. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's easy to see why it won prizes at the Cannes Film Festival. Stylistically reminded me of another great Russian movie, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.
