This must be one of my 3 favorite episodes from the original TV series. <br /> <br /> What makes it great is the quarrel between The Romulan Commander and Kirk, and the stellar drama of Mark Lenard, who later played Spock's dad in other TV episodes and films. This is a case where people have risen to the level of talent around them, and Shatner, Nimoy, and the entire cast in this episode are performing outstandingly well. and I love the direct approach that shows us the characters, the feelings and thoughts of these characters, and how open they are expressed by the actors. <br /> <br /> This very entertaining episode ranks at 10 out of 10. FANTASTIC! Desert Buddha
