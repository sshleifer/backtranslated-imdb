It belongs to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films and is a stylistic and very intimate installation. The most striking element of the film is its silence; nobody is speaking. I do not think Besson, though it's obvious in most of his later work, meant it was a kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that everyone, without any other kind of communication, has to read each other based on intuition and emotion, no matter how small. Although I did not stick to the screen, I find myself thinking that this is a very touching and sensitive perspective on human nature. His vehicle is the stylized science fiction film. Part of his reflection on the nature of the human world is that not every person is played as a perfect human being: the hero, a lonely drifter in the desolate new world, is taken in by an older recluse who refuses to keep his or her part of the food exchange between him and a raucous, brutal character played by Jean Reno, so Reno tries everything he can, mostly with brutal force, to get what he wants. The antagonist is right, even though he is not a good person, and the protagonist and his sympathetic slide are both wrong, even though they are both good people. <br /> <br /> It is shot in a clear and crisp black and white picture. edited and taken in an unobtrusive but erratic and small-scale approach, and its actors are very real. How can they not be? They have, like their characters, the bare minimum in communication. This is one of the few really good movies that Luc Besson wrote. His earlier work is almost always better than the fluff he's throwing out now.
