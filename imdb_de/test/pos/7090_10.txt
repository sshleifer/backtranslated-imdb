Meryl Streep as Kate, a woman who dies of cancer, plays her role admirably. No wonder she wanted an Oscar. In the part, she proves that caring for housewives is just as important as her sisters in the business world. And the lesson that she teaches about the expectations of life and their lack of fulfillment with growing relationships is the most important thing she teaches her daughter. We can expect too much from our colleagues. Realize that there are many slip-ups and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life. This is a dark movie and the end, though sad, shows the reconciliation between father and daughter. I give this one ten.
