This film has broken much ground and receives less credit than it is due. It touches upon a theme that is omnipresent in our daily lives, but which is seen as a phenomenon so common that it needs no discussion. This phenomenon affects caregivers (doctors or whether Broken Promise is a senior social worker) who abuse their position to harm those whose protection they have accused of harming. In Broken Promise, Patty Clawson and her family are let down by her parents; however, they will soon be picked up by local law enforcement agencies. Given the prospect of foster care, Patty asks a young social worker to keep her and her brothers and sisters together. This social worker turns to a senior member of another department, but his application is rejected. The children are deported to separate apartments, following the prevailing opinions of the day and ensuring a "clean break". But it is this event, the "broken promise" that gives the film its name, which causes the dramatic tension that continues throughout the movie. Annoyed by the apparent betrayal of the young social worker, Patty Clawson runs from the nursing home she was sent to. <br /> <br /> Given the daunting task of finding her family in a climate in which the ideal seems to be a complete separation from the past; She does the only thing she can to determine her whereabouts and breaks into the Senior Social Worker's office to steal the Kasefile. <br /> <br /> Taken to a dangerous enemy soon after their discovery. Angry at the embarrassment this little girl has caused for him and his department, the social worker decides to use his power and authority to destroy her. Something he can do lawfully. <br /> <br /> --------------- <br /> <br /> This topic concerns the damage of caregivers customers, is relatively taboo. In films, this has certainly been very little touched, since only a few directors want to follow the path that suggests that the caregivers cause damage. <br /> <br /> I think this film plays a very important role in making the public more aware of such things. The case presented is not only plausible, it has probably happened to many other children around the world. This film is critical to transforming public opinion to eliminate laws designed to protect malicious individuals, such as the Senior Social Worker in Broken Promise. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend Broken Promise. It is particularly suitable for aspiring social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors and other nursing professionals. It is a lesson in avoidance that should be taken to heart. <br /> <br /> ----------- <br /> <br /> Regarding acting in "Broken Promise." Melissa Michaelsen plays a great role as Patty Clawson. Credibility is crucial in such films. If the viewer does not identify with the character of Patty, the entire message of the film would be compromised. It is unfortunate that Melissa is no longer playing in movies today, as her performance in "Broken Promise" shows she had extraordinary talent.
