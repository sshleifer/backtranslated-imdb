Yes, Barney is nonsense now, but when I was a kid it made perfect sense. <br /> <br /> I did not get any smarter, but I enjoyed it. As a kid, I was ridiculed because nobody could say my name, so I changed it. Since I was 4 years old, I went by the name of Tina von Barney, because I could identify with her from a different culture. I'm 17 now and Barney is a big part of my life. ... my name came from it ... I can not see the show I grew up with, no matter how stupid it seems to say. You should not do at least 10 lines because some people just do not have much to say. OK done
