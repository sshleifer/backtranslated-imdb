A beautiful film cleverly crafted for wartime details and minimal violence (considering it plays in World War II). A small cast represents an emotional journey through the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the separation from the relatives, while the pilots leave for England (separation from the Spaniel will touch the hearts), Spitfire scenes, love, friendship and betrayal. The subject of treachery runs deep through the film, from the betrayal of love to the betrayal of friendship to the betrayal that the communist regime showed to former RAF pilots after the war. A desperately sad movie all the more because it is so factually accurate. I would recommend it to everyone.
