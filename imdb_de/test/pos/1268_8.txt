In this movie, I noticed two things. (This is not a spoiler, just a mistake in storytelling.) When Cole brings Bill to his first B & E, he finds the "box". As soon as Cole finds it, he says, "The box, everyone has a box." A minute later, just before he puts the contents on the floor, he says, "We are really happy, you do not see them very often." <br /> <br /> Observation # 2 (Spoiler Alert!) <br /> I had to watch the thing three times, I could not figure out a few things. Then I looked at the chronological version and found that during the time change from the latter to the previous one. In some places, we actually looked at three different times in about 1 minute of wall time. <br /> <br /> That was a good thing because I do not know how many times I could see it before I returned it to Netflix. <br /> <br /> Color me obsessively.
