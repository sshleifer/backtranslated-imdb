I saw that when I was twelve. It was the movie that made me understand what a good mystery really was. I had read Happy Hollister's entire mystery series and it was a family of nannies that always had their husband. But we, the readers, have not been able to solve the puzzle with them. This film has shown me that a good mystery is what makes the viewer / reader say in the end, "OH !!!!!!!!!"
