Turner and his friends come to HBO first place among the TV producers. This is a nice, contemplative thriller. William Macy is as always a star, and Adam Arkin offers one of his better performances. Slightly livelier than the classic Hitchcock, but not as straightforward as typical films of this kind. A Slight Case of Murder makes getting started easier and never lets go. (Note: I saw a preview copy, which means I did not have to wait through commercials, these breaks may break the tempo, but you know that will eventually be available on video
