William H. Macy is brilliant as Everyman is in a desperate situation. Start with a bang and never let up. Surprises and surprises are fresh and unpredictable. The use of film noir clips as well as frequent quotes and references to the '30s and' 40s films make this a delightful "must" for movie fans.
