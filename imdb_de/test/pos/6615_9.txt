This is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen with "Dark Days". I've skated an hour or so all my life, and I still love this movie. Peralta and his outstanding editor have captured the feel and atmosphere perfectly, sometimes with incredible archive footage. Tony Alva is one of the coolest people around. I love those knee-high striped sports socks, you rock Tony! <br /> <br /> Not only is this movie a visual celebration, but the soundtrack must be one of the best in history, if you love the rock of the 70s. Buy the DVD, you will not regret it.
