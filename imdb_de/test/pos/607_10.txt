This film is about the aging geisha in post-war Tokyo. Okin, played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara, lends money to two other ex-geisha, Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki). Tamae has a son, Otomi, a daughter who announces her departure during the film, while Okin, never a mother, receives a visit from two men in her past who, it turns out, only want money from her. It's a compelling story about what choices you make, what you do to get through life, who you are responsible to and to whom you are committed. Haruko Sugimara has always been one of the greatest character actresses ever to come from a country, and she plays the most relentless, less compassionate Okin with a sense of superiority she dislikes, but she almost envies. At a time when, among other things, major films were shot by Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita, and Kurosawa, Mr. Naruse is right up there with him. If you have a Region-Free DVD player, try to find the two Naruse box sets released in England. I think this movie was a great study of women in danger of being irrelevant. That they really are not, makes this movie a true masterpiece.
