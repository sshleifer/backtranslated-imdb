"Pink Flamingos" is a cult classic. The plot of this film revolves around the challenge in which Divine is survived as the dirtiest man. "Pink Flamingos" contains some repugnant scenes like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where Divine eats fresh dog feces. Yes, the movie is both shocking and funny, but the biggest laugh comes from the actors' lines. Take a special look at this line from Divine: "Kill everyone now! Done murder in the first degree!" Favors cannibalism! Eat s ***! Filth is my politics! Filth is my life! ". On the whole, I liked this movie very much. Nevertheless, the slogan "An exercise in bad taste" should be taken to heart and even those who are used to films can find this gem today hard to stomach. We recommend.
