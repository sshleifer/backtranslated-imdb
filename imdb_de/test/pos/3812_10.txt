Let's start at this point: This is not a movie intended for the general public. Extremely bizarre, somehow incomprehensible, totally unpredictable, it just keeps you stoned on screen and trying to figure out what's going to happen next. If you do not agree that this is an excellent movie, go back to your "family" movies and forget about MOTORAMA. It has material to be considered a cult movie, it can be placed in the same category as films awarded at Cannes or other intellectual film festivals, but unfortunately Hollywood is already forgotten, simply because it is not commercial. The performance of young Jordan Christopher Michael may not be an Oscar material, but he gives the story the right note. Even the genre is hard to describe; It's not a comedy in the true sense of the word, you do not know if you should laugh at the strange situations in which Gus is involved. It's more of an impossible adventure that some kids might want, but do not let it take a look ... it's not a children's movie. So, if you like Disney movies or are looking for a "home alone" style, this one is definitely not for you. But if you like reading Edgar Alan Poe or the works of Tim Burton, you'll love Motorama. So, jump into your red Mustang, have a tattoo tagged "Tora" and ride Gus through the Strangelands. I would like that...
