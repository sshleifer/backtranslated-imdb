If "Madame" decides that her cats will inherit her, it will mean trouble. The snobbish butler Edgar, who will inherit the next, decides to get rid of the cats. This can start the story and the cats can experience an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that will allow you to meet the charming but untrustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> The power of this film lies in its humor and music. Edgar is just funny as the offended butler who wants to settle the score, and of course he makes himself serious punches. In one of the best scenes he is followed by the two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon. The score is great and like in the "Jungle Book" there are scenes that are almost "musical" in the sense that the story does not progress and the focus is on the protagonists expressing themselves through the dance. And of course we like that the score is pretty jazzy. <br /> <br /> And of course it's not just me, but also my kids who love this game. <br /> <br /> Greetings Simon
