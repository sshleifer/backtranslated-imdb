Undoubtedly one of the best episodes of all time. Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well-executed suspense with intelligent parallels from the real world (the title refers to a situation that is very similar to the situation between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War)), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. <br /> <br /> After receiving an emergency call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone, which, if exceeded, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, though no one would has ever seen the meat close by. Soon a Romulan ship will appear with a new weapon and cloaking device, making defeat almost impossible. In the face of impending destruction, Kirk must enter into a joke battle with the Romulan commander (Mark Lenard) to ensure the survival of his crew. Unfortunately, the task becomes more difficult when one of the men accuses Spock of having physical similarities between Romulans and volcanoes, two races in covenant with the enemy, two races that are indeed far away (a fact that is rather ironic In retrospect, Lenard played Spock's father, Sarek, starting with season two. <br /> <br /> Always very critical when it comes to war, Star Trek enjoys one of its finest hours with its most thrilling hours and tense take Although the Romulans are not actually based on the Soviets (the name actually comes from Romulus, the founder of Rome), the scenario is evidently inspired by the very vivid anxiety that American and Russian citizens had at that time to destroy the other with nuclear weapons (out of this fear arose the title term "balance of terror"), but even without a subtext this remains an essential element This episode is largely due to the intellectual struggle between the two opponents, which is reflected in an exciting duel between Shatner and Lenard. No need to say who wins ...
