The pictures of Blind Spot are great. The action pulls you in completely, even if the movie is a bit long. Until the credits, you can only imagine the positive highlights of the film. The leading actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heartbreaking. The film music is pretty understated. Move in his own powerful way. Not the usual melodramatic cue. Trance-like moments give poetic resonance to the gripping narrative and the magnificent visual compositions. I hope you get a chance to see this movie. It enters a dark area, but you come out of the tunnel and see only white light.
