I loved this movie! It has a great heart and great bones. I came across it by chance and had no idea about this movie from promos, reviews or word of mouth. I remember reading many years ago a journalist who commented on the value of seeing movies without being contaminated by the bias of reviews or the fake promos. And this seems to be the most common source of critics' negative reaction to the film: he has not lived up to expectations that this is a comedy or a piece of life or a character-driven person. I had no expectation of the movie, so it was funny - but I just laughed once or twice - without being a comedy; it was about a person, but so eccentric that it was not a piece of life; it was about a character, but the character was so smartly optimistic and trusted her instinct that it was not the fear-driven sentimental melodrama that is so typical of the American "serious" movie - as I wrote, that the director Lisa Krueger has managed to make fun of the husband's American sentimentality! And very smart! And Kreuger was able to maintain the pleasantly sentimental end of the screen as the wayward, not wasteful husband returned with a tail shrunken between his legs. Bravo, Mrs. Krueger, Bravo! (Now I'll see this movie again as it keeps getting better as I think about it.) <br /> <br /> Graham's performance as Joline is brilliant. I loved how subtly, but completely, she was able to appreciate, portray and convey intelligent awareness of her obliging engagement, words and actions - she knew when she talked to a band, friends or husband , made a fool of himself and / or disappointment in a world that was unable to appreciate commitment as much as it could. But despite this power, she was fully connected with humanity and fully committed to her frailty and failures. The character of Joline was amazingly well played, and I left the film in surprise that I could not remember price nominations. Okay, not so surprised, as American awards tend to go to women in "serious" roles, full of fear and the right amount of nudity this movie did not have. What it was was far better. It was the heart of this woman to discover herself with the help of new friends and a self-deprecating shaman. <br /> <br /> I admit to be a bit soft for eccentric characters who master their peculiarities while remaining honest and true to themselves as they navigate the minefield of "right" social behavior and "acceptable" behavior "move interpersonal discourse. So if people have to adapt to the normalcy in your world, you will not like this movie. And that was apparently one of the common threads in the criticism. <br /> <br /> And I'm always a good fan of words when it raises questions of human behavior and ethical / philosophical values. Until this film, I had not made the emotional connection between commitment (for a cause or honesty or something) and commitment (for a madhouse). At what point does the commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life become a ticket to madness? That sounds like a simple question or one that is easily dismissed as rhetorical. But is it? And few of the critics - I think maybe two - commented on this aspect of the film either directly or indirectly. <br /> <br /> A lovely movie. 8.10. <br /> <br />
