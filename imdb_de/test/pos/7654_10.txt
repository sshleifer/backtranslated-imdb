This is a tapestry, a series of portraits of Rome interwoven by music. It is a very musical film because the spoken dialogue is deficient - and what is dialogue is not important to the structure of the narrative. Some expect a National Geographic story of "manners, clothes and music" or an action that orbits some key characters - do not look for it here. <br /> <br /> This is because a portrait is painted to a family of peoples rather than telling a story of individuals. The plot is the story through the space (India to Andalusia) and / or / time (which we can not tell) of a people. It needs no narrative. You get a feeling of happy people, closely associated with small communities where social interaction is very important. And a great sense of sadness in parts, in their rejection by society. <br /> <br /> So it's an occasion for the culture of Rome, shot very nicely, with a wide range of Rome music and a thorn in the tail that is the oppression that these people have faced and still face always confronted.
