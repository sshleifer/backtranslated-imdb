I was really looking forward to seeing this documentary about some of the most entertaining movies I have ever done. Growing up in LA in the 1960s, many of these old black-and-white films were screened at local stations. I even remember a Friday show called "Strange Tales of Science Fiction," which featured a different sci-fi movie every week. This documentary, however, spent far too much time with the opinions of the four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic films of the genre and how they used them as inspiration for their films. I was hoping for this documentary. It could really have been a comprehensive study of the decade rather than briefly highlighting the most famous films of the epoch. Anyone who has studied these films or has been interested in these films is familiar with such standouts as War of the Worlds, Forbidden Planet, The Thing, The Day, when the earth stopped, etc. Perhaps some interviews with people attending Creating these films were involved. I have to admit that the documentary was too much focused on Spielberg's opinions and was a kind of commercial for his new release of War of the Worlds.
