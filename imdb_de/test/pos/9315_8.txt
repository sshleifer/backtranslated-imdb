I've heard a lot about porno holocaust and its double-filmed erotic nights of the living dead. Both films are interchangeable and shot simultaneously in the same location, with the same actors changing (and decreasing) their clothes for each film. If you expect the D'Amato genius shown in films like Buio Omega or Death Smiles on Murder, you will not find it here. Nonetheless, this film has a charm that can not be resisted by exploitation fans. Where else is hardcore sex mixed with a zombie / monster and his huge penis strangling women to death and suffocating them? Only from D'Amato. There is a lot of blood in which many men are beaten to death. The movie is set on a beautiful tropical island. As far as I know, there is no subtitle version. So if you do not speak Italian, you do not know what's going on ... but who cares? To be honest, Gore fans are likely to move forward through hardcore sex. And if someone actually observes this only for sex, it is immediately offended. I can only imagine that modern porn fans trace back through D'Amato's production and encounter this cruelty! Of the two, I find erotic nights far superior to the living dead. But do not worry if they are cut. Porn Holocaust is extremely low as expected. Even the monster does not look as good as George Eastman's character in Anthropophagus. The movie is worth laughing at and completing your D'Amato film quest.
