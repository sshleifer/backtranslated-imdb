Not the movie to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated. If you want to have fun in the theater, this is the right one. Many biting skirmishes (and some really cheesy skirmishes) Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny as comic relief. Exciting and creative raids and chases. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron (sexy) are appealing leads. And Donald Sutherland!
