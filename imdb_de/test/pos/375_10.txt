When Alfred Hitchcock made "STRANGERS ON A TRAIN," this was a harbinger for much of the film, which went public, that he was back to the top in his form. From 1946 to 1950, his films were not box office successes, and his contract with David O. Selznick ended because of this. Actually, he made some really good movies in the time, including NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, UNDER CAPRICORN, ROPE and (in my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. While NOTORIOUS and SPELLBOUND were popular, Hitch's experimentation turned off the audience: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable, as was the situation among the psychiatrists. But the ROPE long-shot experiment has puzzled the public (ignoring the film's merits), and Hitch's willingness to trick the audience into a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was not welcomed - much less did it deserve - to be in STAGESTRUCK. A bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was just released when its scandal starred Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it seem like a failure (which it was not). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in his favor. <br /> <br /> With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in recent films. Instead, he focused on his favorite subjects of common guilt and false identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the story was told of how Guy Haines, a professional tennis player, meets a fan of his - Bruno Anthony, a playboy - who is at the same time as the athlete on a cross country train. Bruno is talkative and amazed, and Guy sees him as one of the typical fans he met ... albeit a bit eccentric, with his talk of wanting to fly into space on the first rocket. But Bruno knows everything about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam and in love with Anne Morton, daughter of a senator. Bruno knows that Miriam does not divorce her successful husband. Bruno mentions how he can empathize - he hates his stepfather, who constantly criticizes him. Then Bruno (a sort of cuff) mentions an idea of ​​two men - technically alien - who exchanged murders and then committed two perfect, unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees that it's an interesting idea. The train reaches the goal of Guy and his last comment is like a confirmation of the idea. He just does not realize that the "eccentric" Bruno is a sociopath, and thinks Guy has just agreed that they killed each other. <br /> <br /> It's actually a wonderfully simple story. Bruno of course kills Miriam, but he fully expects Guy to honor the murder contract and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrified - and worse, he's the main suspect in the police department. When Bruno, to encourage Guy, mentions having the latter's lighter (he put it on the train) and can attach it to the murder site, Guy gets into deeper trouble - how to avoid the police and how to control them (if possible)) the insane Bruno? Hitch has always carefully planned the footage of his film, so we both meet "heroes" from the beginning on their fateful encounter on the train. In the film, constant cross-contacts are used to show how the two men are pulled into each other's orbits. It's like fate is contracting them. But both have their own personality - and with a typical twist, Hitch actually turns crazy Bruno into an attractive character. His plan may be vicious (he'll kill two people if he succeeds, and he'll make Guy comply with the agreement, no matter what), but he has a zest for life. It is believed that Guy once had one too, but the failure of his marriage, coupled with his wife now associated with a socially prominent woman, has made him a more conscientious and boring experience than he was. <br /> <br /> The cast is good too. Robert Walker probably had his best role in this film (just a year before his death). It was a long way from the neighbor of the same name, SINCE YOU WAY or THE CLOCK. His lithe figure looked quite elegant in stories in some scenes. Guy Farley behaves like a cousin of his fellow murderer in ROPE, especially as circumstances make him increasingly suspicious (as his previous role increasingly made Jimmy Stewart nervous about his behavior). As far as the ladies are concerned, Kasie Rogers, like Miriam, is pretty squishy - so the audience can prepare for its downfall (in a famous sequence shot in the mirroring of their glasses) so that it actually cheers Bruno up in his act of evil , Patricia Hitchcock appears as a younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman), which is very similar to Miriam and Bruno accidentally breaks up for a social occasion. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman supports Granger well, but her role is limited because she is well-established in her background and a little reserved. Other supporting performers, Leo G. Caroll as Senator, Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno's mother, and Norma Varden as the unexpected perpetrator of Walker, are all the best-all in the hands of a master.
