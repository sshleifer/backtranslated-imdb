"Subspecies", like many other horror movies, gets a bad deal on IMDb. The majority of movie watchers have a heartfelt contempt for the horror, and if they occasionally rent horror movies, they either want to laugh about it or scare themselves into overly bloody scenes. Unfortunately, "Subspecies" is not particularly ridiculous and not so bloody, so it gets a bad rating. That's too bad. <br /> <br /> Of course there is much to criticize here. The non-actors are flat, the subspecies are a weak special effect, and the night scenes are too bright. But what do you expect? For a horror film movie, Subspecies delivers decent production values ​​and more integrity than you might expect. The Romanian backdrop of the film is virtually unique (I think it was the first American film made after communism), and the locations both inside and out are beautiful. The script has moments of intelligence, especially if it dips into local folklore (all wrong, I'm sure). Somehow, filming locations and fancy script work well together - "Subspecies" has its own world. Risking low praise ... it could be a fool. <br /> <br /> Fans of the cruel aspects of horror will undoubtedly get a nudge from the bloody vampire rogue Radu. He's pretty effective in this movie - powerful with a catchy, scratchy voice - but I like him better in the sequels when actor Anders Hove offers a more self-parody, campy performance. A totally sincere Radu is a bit stupid. Other stupid aspects are unbiased nudity and the subspecies itself, which are clearly seen only in the film, because the producer Charles Band has a fetish for evil little creatures (see also Puppetmaster and Demonic Toys) much to the flaws of the film. For what it is - straight to the video vampire horror - "Subspecies" is perfectly fine. The sequels are characterized by better production values, more violence, and more thoughtful storylines, so I recommend them even higher. Still, this is not a bad start for the series.
