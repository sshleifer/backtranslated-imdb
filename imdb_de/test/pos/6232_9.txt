Maybe one of the first Slasher movies to come out after Halloween (although it was made by Irwin Yabalans for Halloween), I have to say that I've found "Tourist Trap" to be honest, to be more scary and funner. "Tourist Trap" is one of the notable tidbits that you will find from time to time and leave with the most pleasant feeling of surprise. It was fate, I'll tell you, but one night I was at my local blockbuster (a month or two before it went out of business) and had nothing to get. Then I stumble across this movie, I think it seems like a ridiculous B-movie, I rented it and brought it home, boy I was for a good fear. "Tourist Trap" is a bad movie, it definitely has cheesy moments, but in the end you have too much fun with it to really care about it. <br /> <br /> The things that have absolutely impressed me most, and the things that have made this movie one of the scariest I've ever seen, is the number one hiring. A horror movie without a good backdrop is not fun here. I love love, love the location, it feels like we can connect with it, it almost feels like we've been there before. That makes it weirder. Next are the characters, none of them is really stereotypical and they all have a real personality. For example, they are not stoners, alcoholics or even sex-obsessed people, they feel like normal young adults. Besides, they look realistic enough, and then it's Chuck Connors. Who gives a great performance as Mr. Slausen, whom we all love right away, because he is so real again, he feels like that nice guy we love so much. The last and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is the way in which we (the audience) jump half out of the right seats and turn on the right. For example, in horror movies we mostly jump only because of a sudden change in pitch, but in "Tourist Trap" you get ready, that's not the case. With perfect use of lighting, mannequins and craziness, you feel completely crippled. Besides, I love it, even though they are a bit over the top with a few things and still feel like this could happen. That's exactly what a horror movie should do that looks at such a ridiculous premise, and that means we (the audience) feel insecure and scared, just that it's strange, sometimes it can get a bit too funny. In the end, however, "Tourist Trap" has a place that is close to my heart, because I'm one of the few horror movies where I light the lights and feel insecure when traveling.
