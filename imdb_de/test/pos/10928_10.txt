I had the pleasure to see this short film at the Miami Film Festival last Saturday. It was the only movie from the entire program that I loved. It's beautifully filmed, composed, edited, played and written. After the screening, I saw the director at a party and asked him what he would do next. He said he is working to find funding for the feature version of the Short. He described some scenes to me. It sounded like the first movie to introduce the big ones to the industry. If you ever have the opportunity to see this short performance, I strongly recommend that you take it. Hats off to cross the stars.
