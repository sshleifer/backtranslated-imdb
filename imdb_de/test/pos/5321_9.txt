I noted that the official review of the IMDb refers to Leland as a sociopath. I believe that this diagnosis is obvious and profoundly incorrect. <br /> <br /> This is a film about grief and the ability of a particular teenager to see grief in their daily lives, as he is on the lookout for the unfolding of the lives on which he is working. A sociopath is a person who can not empathize with others and understands the difference between right and wrong, but does not care about that difference. A sociopath is a subject who puts himself at the center of the subject's universe and completely ignores the effects of the subject's actions on his or her environment. One of the defining characteristics of a sociopath is that a true sociopath does not have the capacity to feel empathy - he does not have the ability to feel what others feel and does not correlate with changes in the moods of others as a result of the sociopath's actions these actions. A sociopath CAN NOT feel the pain of others or understand that the pain of others is the result of the sociopath's own actions. A sociopath is a person who is not fully trained. An essential part is lacking in the psychological and emotional composition of a true sociopath, which makes the sociopath immune to "talk therapy" and other modalities of treatment involving human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings. Sociopathy is devastating, even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment that aims to limit the harm that the sociopath can inflict on other people. Many sociopaths function more or less normally and never beat the criminal justice radar, though they tend to leave emotional debris behind. <br /> <br /> Leland Fitzgerald is not a sociopath. He is a person blessed (or cursed) with the ability to foresee what he considers the inevitable consequences and outcomes of human interactions. Leland literally sees the sadness written in the eyes and faces of the people around him as he slowly sets the philosophy and internalizes that life is about loss and that people are slowly succumbing to the inevitable and relentless fact that for reasons a better metaphor that things fall apart. People who fall in love and kiss and cuddle today become "miserable" older couples. The electricity in the eyes of Leland's "mother" (a wealthy New York society that loves Leland and invites him into the house she shares with her family when he arrives in New York City, alone and determined to live in the city When she explains to him on her recent visit to New York City that she has learned that her husband has been cheating all along, that she has divorced and that her heart has broken, everyone fades and this loss is an inevitable part of growing up. Her eyes still reflect light, but the electricity she once lit has disappeared. This scene - this explanation comes late - is crucial to understanding why Leland commits a seemingly savage, pointless crime (killing the retarded younger brother of his ex-girlfriend). Leland knows what lies ahead for this little boy - a lifetime of unattainable goals, just learning words that threaten to never know another person's love, never feel such love and never connect with another person , This little boy, more than any other character in this film, embodies everything that makes Leland inevitable and terrible for the world. Leland's act of killing this little boy is for Leland an act of mercy committed because he could CREATE this in a world where action can not change the outcome. While a true sociopath knows that actions can and do change outcomes, but do not care about the harm done to others through these actions, Leland takes care of it. What most people consider barbaric and terrible is in Leland's eyes the only decent thing he can do to relieve the suffering of one person. <br /> <br /> It would be reassuring to present oneself This is an explanation for Leland's behavior - reassuring but incomplete. Because in the end, "blame" on Leland's behavior elsewhere. As so often, there are no simple explanations and no balm for the indignant soul. Why did not Leland learn something that even the most pessimistic people would normally admit - that sometimes people just fall in love and relationships and even the saddest life is transformed? For Leland, there is no middle ground, no inner core, to which he can retire and regroup. There is only pain and sadness. One is tempted to blame his arrogant and thoroughly unpleasant father-the brilliant writer (played by Kevin Spacey) -that he was not present during Leland's development in critical times, but given this man's bad behavior, this was possibly a blessing. <br /> In the end, this viewer was moved by a tremendous sense of sadness. Why was Leland condemned to see the world through a veil of pessimism and depression? There is a maturity for Leland's character - the present, for example, when he repeatedly insists that no one was to blame for his girlfriend breaking up with him - that's both stoical and heartbreaking. Stoic, in that it is absolutely genuine, despite the heated denunciations of Leland's teacher. But heartbreaking, insofar as it is not so much supported by understanding as despair. Leland's indifference to his fate reflects only the absolute certainty of his belief that nothing is really important. Nothing he does can change his fate. <br /> <br /> This is not sociopathy. This is, if anything, its polar opposite ......
