When Precious Bane aired in America, I was fascinated by this beautiful story. All the actors were brilliant. Clive Owen really understood the character he played. I immediately went to a bookstore and ordered the original novel, which was even nicer, and was sold out right after the book was purchased - though I've seen it online a few times now. I had also hoped that with the Oscar won by Janet McTeer and the enormous popularity of Clive Owen, the BBC, this beautiful production would of course be on DVD ... I can not believe we will not have a DVD all those years later. It must be the only production ever produced by the BBC that is NOT for sale. Come on BBC - you have money to make us fans here. Get it on DVD please!
