When I was a kid, my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with her. I admired Dorothy Dandridge so much and wanted to be like her. I fell in love with Sidney Poitier. Pearl Bailey made me laugh. And Sammy Davis Jr. was as great as Sportin Life. The music was just breathtaking. When I had my first son and the movie came on TV, I let him see, and to this day he has never forgotten this movie. He loved it. I will always remember Porgy and Bess. It has a special place in my heart then and now. I really wish they would restore this movie because it was one of the greatest movies ever with an All Star "Black Cast".
