*** SPOILERS *** Well made and interesting film about the alienated American youth in the 1950s. At that time, many parents had been busy making money and living in suspense, forgetting that their children, especially teenagers, needed much more than a car and considerable allowance to feel part of the family. They also needed love and attention for their growing up problems, which 16-year-old Hal Ditmar, James MacArthur, never got from his successful film producer father Tom Ditmar, James Daly. Never Really connecting with his father, Hal is getting further and further away from him and his caring mother Helen Ditmar, Kim Hunter, as well as from society. After his father squeezed Hal for renting his car, a late luxury sedan, he and his friend Jerry, Jeffery Silver, head to the local Treater in neck-rolled and rolled Jalopy from the 1930s to see the latest western movie. <br /> <br /> Feel like a blow to the world. Hal looks like a real first-class jerk who puts his smelly feet almost in the faces of a couple, Eddie Ryder & Jean Corbett sitting in front of him, and Jerry trying to see the movie. The result is that Hal and his friend Jerry are not only thrown out of the theater, but that he creates the theater manager, Mr. Grebbs, Whit Bissell. It turned out that at least Hal was ready to leave the theater without getting his money back, but when Grebbs tried to grab him, Hal turned around and strapped him straight into the kiss. Hal in it really hot water, he's charged with attacks and batteries, puts his "James Dean" action on the local police station and makes him either too cool or just stupid to realize what he has done; Grebbs almost knocked out his teeth. It is when Sgt.Shipley, James Gergory, tells Hal that his father will pick him up when he finally insults what he has done. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie Hal tried to try Align yourself, but can not, because his dad has little appreciation. To ask his father to understand that what he was doing when he turned Mr. Grebbs over was self-defense, Hals's father pretended to be there in the theater and saw the whole incident involving his son Hal like a mugger instead of a young man who's being grabbed and shoved without provocation. <br /> <br /> Not to apologize, which Hal did when he interpreted Mr. Grebbs, he was actually willing to admit his behavior to a hooligan, but he wanted both Mr. Grebbs and his dad should at least have him with one Treat iota of consideration; Gebbs in the fact that he made Hal and Mr. Ditmas not even to hear him, to hear him! Feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone, but his mother to really turn, loses Hal slowly to have both Sgt later. Shipley and Mr. Grabbs agree to drop the offensive charge. One might think that Hal's has learned his lesson by now, but the real lesson, more than a distance behind bars that Hal so badly needed, was a lesson that his father completely ignored! Being there when his son needed him the most, failing Mr. Ditmar with flying colors. <br /> <br /> Things are going to be in the movie for everyone in the movie after Mr. Grebbs goes to his knees and ends up with a butte of a shiner, again from Hal, who, when he returns to the Grebbs Theater, Trying to get him to call his father and tell him Hal's only defending himself when he cursed him for the first time, not the second time. In the end, Hal learned a real lesson to get along with people and not let his problems become the problems of others. Most importantly, Mr. Ditmar, Hal's father, had the most valuable lesson to understand and be like a father to his frustrated and alienated son, rather than a jail-warmer combination device and a sugar boy. As the song says "All you need s love" to get things on the right track, and it was both love and understanding for his son Hal that Mr. Ditmar was missing the most by the end of the movie.
