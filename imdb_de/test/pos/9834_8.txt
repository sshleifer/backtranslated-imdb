There are some mistakes for those who want to find them. They are not important. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this movie is how experienced, experienced actors do their craft. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays well the role of a strong woman who was injured. The same goes for Harrison Ford, who is just as beautiful for the ladies as Kristin is for us guys. <br /> <br /> Her grief pain makes her uncomfortable, but one in which she finds support. How they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity on screen is why they are so wanted. The viewer can not help but feel what he feels, and you can not help but cheer him up together. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt police officers For the music lover, Dave Grusin has an outstanding jazz background with trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Like the actors, Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought-after musical consultants in the film business. Blanchard shows why he is one of the first trumpeters on the scene. <br /> <br /> No movie for lovers of courage, blood and blood. But for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, look at a beautiful English actress with big expressive blue eyes like Harrison Ford for the endless soothing accompaniment courtesy of Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard Move with someone you love. Preferably in bed. <br /> <br /> I thought it deserved at least an 8.
