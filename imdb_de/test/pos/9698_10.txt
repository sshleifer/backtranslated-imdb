Everything you could ever hope for for a Jackass fan. As always, Knoxville and his crew only risk our television entertainment. If you are a fan of the series & the first movie, you will not be disappointed, as is the case with most sequels. The jokes they pull together are twice as funny, cruel and raw as ever. The stunts and braves are twice as crude as any Jackass episode you've ever seen. If your fan does not waste time, have a look, because for Jackaass standards, this movie is a simple 10 out of 10, just for the opening credits. See it to believe it.
