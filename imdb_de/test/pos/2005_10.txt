Eve is an eye-opener, because of the great scenery and the technique - no music in the backgrounds we hear. This film shows a good aspect that the human body is God's creation and when you think about it, the viewer can better respect the legendary story of Adam and Eve (depending on what we believe or it's just a fairy tale) watching this movie , Actress / Model Inger Ebeltoft's imitation of Eve is so good that there is no good word to describe her performance, and I can not imagine Eve being another actress. This film is very handy for the therapy of stress relief. We have never been so relaxed when watching this movie. This movie is a masterpiece, God wanted this movie to be made at all! <br /> <br /> Mr. Razbin!
