Quai des Orfevres takes too long, and Clouzot is so excited about his backstage milieu that he's almost in danger of forgetting history. But once this is the case, Clouzot is at his best. Bertrand Blier (father of Bertrand Blier and co-star of his buffet-Froid) is the world-famous pianist who has married among themselves and wants to kill the clumsy studio mogul with motives of his wife, only to find out that someone beat him with it. Not only that, but his carefully planned but awkwardly executed alibi falls apart, not least when a thief steals his car at the murder site. <br /> <br /> The film gets really alive with the arrival of Luis Jouvet Police Inspector, a pretty wonderful creation of half Alistair Sim in Green for Danger and the half-world weary Maigret with better dialogue. In a neat ongoing gag, his investigation is constantly being carried out against chaos and noise, whether it be the loud typewriters of the police station or a loud rehearsal. The police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation, full of chaotic and insightful little details that make Steve Bocchco's once-revolutionary US police shows of the 1980s look like outdated museum pieces. <br /> <br /> If Suzy Delair is a rather unconvincing femme fatale, the supportive cast is more than made up for, with the lovely Simone Renant playing a prominent role as the lesbian photographer remotely enters her is in love and constantly confused with Blier's lover of Delair and other interested parties (only Jouvet, who is also unhappy with women, understands and is truly compassionate). With great black and white photographs by Armand Thirard, this is a fantastic little thriller with a nice turn and a beautiful scene where a taxi driver unwillingly identifies Renant in a police station. (Note from Trivia: Pierre Larquey, who has played the playful philosophical Dr. Vorzet in Le Corbeau, appears in smaller roles as a taxi driver in both Quai and Les Espions.) <br /> <br /> The Criterion DVD is very good - excellent picture quality as well as a revealing excerpt from a French TV show with interviews with Clouzot, Blier and Renant.
