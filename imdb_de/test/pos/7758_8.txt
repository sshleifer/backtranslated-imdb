At first glance, this is another high school anime with many excuses for "fan service," but there's a lot more going on. The 'fan service' is part of the plot, the main character is a tired cynic (uncommon), and most of all, there is a clever plot that connects all the episodes together and poses some interesting questions. The episodes are deliberately non-chronological, and it's certainly worth revisiting the series in chronological order. <br /> <br /> The series is worth a look, as there are many casual hints that advance and explain things, plus a whole series of jokes about other series, anime and more.
