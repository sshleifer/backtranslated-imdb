I've seen Love Jones over thirty times. It's one of the rare films that show a love story about people who happen to be African Americans. The dialogue was written realistically and conducted honestly. It was so nice to see a movie that focused on the story of young African Americans. This is practically an unused market. Love Jones was also visually arresting. The chemistry between Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring back memories of the love of the past and present. The feeling of the film is jazz and blues and expresses the sensuality of a warm, creamy hot chocolate with a dash of kahlua and butterscotch. If you had not thought, I loved it!
