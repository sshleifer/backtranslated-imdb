Pretty decent for his early work and without Kokaku Kidotai without, and gets 2 points more for the Easter eggs. For Shirow definitely a rung in the ladder. I'm biased as a Shirow fan, but this was a big step from Dirty Pair, which I knew from him. Huge fun with a porn soundtrack! You can not help but notice that. I know people appreciate him for Ghost in the Shell, but all of the deep spiritual undertones were treated in Appleseed. ESWAT killed terrorists, the fight for humans to survive, as bioroids dump them, and Deunan remains thin despite their intake of junk food. In any case, the characters even like the traitors..and I do not know why.
