I saw this movie on HBO last night and did not expect it to be addictive - usually I fall asleep watching HBO. But it happened and you will do it too. It's a tragic documentary (Oscar winner, 2002) about a murder of an elderly tourist in Jacksonville, Florida, and the subsequent investigation, arrest, and trial of a 15-year-old boy, a sense of how we've progressed as a society. This movie has earned a much esteemed Oscar - you are moved to tears.
