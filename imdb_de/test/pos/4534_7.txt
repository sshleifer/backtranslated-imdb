I think I do not have to add too much. I still found the comedy funny after more than ten years after it came out. <br /> <br /> The only thing that struck me was that the music was distracting during the dialogue and often made the movie very choppy. It should have been. The use of songs is fine throughout the movie, but the orchestral background is too busy and too elaborate. If the movie was ever edited for a DVD, I would seriously recommend reducing the background music to an almost inaudible level. It has cheapened the overall feel for the entire film, and I can unconsciously see why many people have given up on it. <br /> <br /> The film had many levels focused on script, plot and comedy. It's too bad that the producer and the director had the feeling that needed a musical punch to improve the mood. Now that I know that, I find it hard to watch, and I curse silently whoever had to do with the musical editing of the film. It had the fineness of a jackhammer.
