This era was not only the beginning of the sound in cartoons, but also a cartoon character who would go down in history as the most famous mouse in the world. Yes, Mickey debuts here in this happy story of life aboard a steamer. The animation is good for the time and the plot is - albeit somewhat simple - quite funny. A true classic, and if you ever manage to get it on video, you will not regret it.
