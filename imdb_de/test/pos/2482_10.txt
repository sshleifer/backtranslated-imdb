It enters your stomach. There are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic story and perhaps even deeper in terms of political views. However, most of them are not headed by Peter Watkins. Watkins is perhaps the only genius artist in British film to emerge from the 1960s. He has made a lot of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the aesthetic world - the world of political progress, social issues, and state solutions. Therefore, his work is probably less "cinematic" than political, which some call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality. But why should not art commit itself to getting involved? Watkins dares. And it succeeds. You will not feel well with this. You will not feel happy. Actually, the movie does not really like it; it is uncompromising, honest, direct, irresponsible; in short, a slap in the face. You can not get angry, you can not resist being touched by the things you see. That's what makes Watkins' films so worthwhile.
