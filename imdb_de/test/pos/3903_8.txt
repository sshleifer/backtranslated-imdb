After learning that her sister Susan is considering a divorce, Kate decides to travel to the retired country house of the desperate woman and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, Susan is nowhere to be seen. Because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to find out where her sister could have gone and puts her own life at risk ... The killer is still on the site! Elizabeth Montgomery shows a solid dramatic performance in her first vehicle after BEWITCHED. Merwin Gerard's TV play is based on a short story by McKnight Malmar. Malmar's narration was first brought to television in 1962 as a result of the anthology series THRILLER by Boris Karloff. THRILLER was very close to the story, which is a pity, because she needed a bit of a punch on the head. Granted Malmar wrote a moderately spooky number, but Gerard (creator of the ONE STEP BEYOND show) adds some clever ingredients that increase the tension and suspense.
