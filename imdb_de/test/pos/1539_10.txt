This movie hits the heart with a reality I have not seen before. It shows what we take for granted in a democratic society and exactly what we fortunately are not allowed to experience. The acting in the film is great, sometimes you have to remember that the film is a dramatization and not a real life. Mr. Rickman wonders with his role (as with all roles) that make the interrogator fully dimensioned and human. The set is incredible. It conveys the feeling of "in the round" theater. What the emotions of the action does not add or take away. This film wants to open the eyes of the beholder and I would say they have made this goal successful.
