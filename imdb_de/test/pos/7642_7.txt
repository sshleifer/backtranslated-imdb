Like a winding country road, "Tough Luck" takes the viewer on a journey. There is nothing wrong with plot curves as long as credibility does not fly out of the window. Unfortunately, the film ultimately puts the credibility of the audience in question. Nevertheless, it is easy to forgive this mistake due to superior acting, character development and the wonderful carnival atmosphere. Do not expect that you like one of the characters. Armand Asante, Norman Redus and Dagmara Dominczyk play dodgy con-artists. The double crosses come quickly and furiously and the last cross is a bit long. Recommended. - MERK
