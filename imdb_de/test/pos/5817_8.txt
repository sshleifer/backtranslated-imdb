Minnie and Moskowitz is the most miserable and unobtrusive love story I've ever seen. Between Minnie, a disillusioned museum curator whose abusive, married boyfriend dumps her and leaves her even more confused and confused than she already was, and Seymour Moskowitz, a park attendant so desperately looking for attention that he spends his nights in bars and restaurants spends to aggravate people, there is a chaotic and disenchanted game from the beginning. Just like so many pairings we see every day. <br /> <br /> In almost every love story there is a man and a woman. The man is confident, funny, either classically hot or attractive in his own way. whose faults are enchanting, and the woman is a wounded soul, who could have any man who chooses this man because he has only something in it. In these films, everyone feels so good because the characters represent what every man and woman wants to be, not what they are. Minnie and Moskowitz, instead of indulging in fantasies in the realm of romance, show people who may be more common than attractive, confident people with so much in-game experience. What is the story behind the love affairs of the ugly, frighteningly awkward man with no life and no job we all encounter, or the woman so insecure it's hard to talk to? <br /> <br /> This film is not as intriguing as the faces of Cassavetes or the Opening Night, but it has the intriguing quality that Cassavetes has always fought so hard, an unbridled portrayal of people under the ego hiding in almost all other movies. Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, who bring amazingly deplorable people, are hardly sympathetic. Moskowitz almost drives us crazy, let alone Minnie. He's so energetic in his life, the dates are a blast of our inner voices, the screaming uneasy restlessness on dates we all were, rejections we all swallowed, and arguments we all had, Responding that we know were our own mistakes. I admire a movie like Minnie and Moskowitz because the trademark is in the films that Cassavetes shot and identify with us 100% in honesty. Our egos play no role in society with their characters, so a tremendous performance per actor's performance.
