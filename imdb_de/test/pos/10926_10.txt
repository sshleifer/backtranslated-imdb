I saw a lot of short films in my time. Often I find them either too compressed (too much information in the short time they have to walk), too "artistic" or without a clear vision. I can not say anything about Starcrossed. In this review, I will do my best to avoid dramatic spoilers, but I also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is fraternal incest. <br /> <br /> As with any short film, the story is pretty simple, straightforward and easy to digest. It is clear that the film tries to highlight a light, one of the most deeply held taboos of modern society. This movie is successful in every way. In the fifteen minutes of the run, I felt a series of emotions. With just a little dialogue, the viewer is quickly drawn into the most personal moments and thoughts of these star-crossed brothers. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene in her early childhood, one can see the very close relationship the brothers have. When the film in the next scene progresses to this day, the excellent acting and honest, heartfelt performances remind the viewer because love can come in an unexpected and harsh way. As the relationship progresses, any disgust that the viewer initially feels is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress, as the viewer suddenly realizes that there is only one possible solution. And the consequences of this resolution are heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is open minded will enjoy watching this movie and absorbing its message. At the very least, it bravely and honestly challenges the viewer to check some of our deepest beliefs for the incestuous and mysterious taboo of incest. Although the film is only fifteen minutes long, it resonates long after the credits role in the audience. This may be my favorite movie I've ever seen. I can not recommend it enough.
