In my opinion, this is the best video game ever created! I played this game with my friends for the first time years ago, and the next day I went out and got my own. Since that day almost seven years ago I have not stopped playing. I can not help it, I just can not get bored. I was addicted to other games on other, much newer systems, but I keep coming back to Goldeneye. Every mission is incredibly funny and challenging, the multiplayer mode was unique. I hope you can be as happy as I was playing in multiplayer mode with four players, as I had brothers and friends who constantly come together and play this game.
