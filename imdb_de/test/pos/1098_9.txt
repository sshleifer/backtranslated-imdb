This was a random rental in the video store. But I was impressed from the beginning. Wooden Camera is a jewel of a second feature of a dedicated director. The film captures deeply insightful moments and some often frustrating and complicated social interactions that young interracial friends would experience in a modern South Africa after apartheid. The young actors are pretty good and goal-oriented in terms of the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visuals and offers a frame-by-frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic clichés and clichés. The film music of the film adds body to the film without being obtrusive. After watching it for the second time, I found the DVD on Amazon and have been happy ever since.
