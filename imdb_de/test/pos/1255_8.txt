When the first trailer of this film was seen by myself, I was curious as to what perspective the plot would take. After all the plot to bring one's childhood back into the present, there are many possibilities. Bruce Willis, however, does an excellent job in his role. I was surprised to see how well he was able to act in this part. This is also a good career move, as many others have said, but after seeing it, I agree with it now. The main purpose of this film is to remember the child you once were and to realize that you are not the adult you have planned. This is a wonderful story and a gripping story that makes us all think. Usually we despise on "what if ..." movies. For example, Waterworld tried to answer the question, "What if the world was covered in water and ...?" But honestly, nobody cared. However, this movie affects everyone in the theater. While it is true that young children can not understand the idea of ​​growing up and all your dreams are dwindling away, it does make a big impact on the adults and parents of these children. This movie is definitely worth seeing. However, the second time it will be better because you will not think about it that much (how the child got there and why and all that). Just relax and have fun. And take something with you when you leave the cinema. Take the piece of your childhood that you forgot and enjoy it.
