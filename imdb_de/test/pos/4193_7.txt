The Beatles had just done "Magical Mystery Tour". There was a general feeling that performance, peace and drugs were naturally linked. LA had a subculture that knew something was going on. Nicholson was in several of these gangs. Before he decided to become a serious actor before "Easy Rider" took place before "Pink Flamingos" before "Night After Day", there were several experiments with what to do about it. An important one is "Zaragoza manuscript". This is another. <br /> <br /> Jack writes. He plays with a circular narrative, self-reference, film reference, performance self-hatred, the pain of creation, all on the verge of a safe kid's pop player. You have to see that, if you only want to know something about Jack. <br /> <br /> Certain actors act by digging into themselves. It is a common technique. Some dig deep, but after a while they get bored because they are incredibly flat. Not only is there enough material for a career. Think of DeNiro and Hackman. <br /> <br /> Others are pretty interesting people who become more interesting over time. When they dig into the barrel, they put things back because of the pain of digging. Think of Sean Penn and Jack. At the end of Jack's run, he spins at the end of the thread, as the basis of each character is this experimental, risky author / filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Who cares if it's a bad movie? It's bad because it's taken risks. Watch Annette wipe a tear from the cheek by the director. It's a loving moron in all the brando thing, something I heard Marlon laugh about. This is one of the richest moments in Hollywood's film history. <br /> <br /> There's another reason to see this. Music in the film has a strong root in the dance. The revolution in film is often dependent on music. So whole cultures are carried away. <br /> <br /> Toni Basil is an unsung giantess who invented how billions now dance. She was as influential in pop choreography as the Beatles in music. She was already good at her career when she was asked to work on it. However, this is one of her first appearances on the screen. They can see their work everywhere, and even in the pretty cool "Daddy's Girl" segment, about one of Nilsson's better songs. (Followed by Frank Zappa's cameo.) McCartney would refer to this scene later in his TeeVee Special. <br /> <br /> A third reason for watching is the early (about 6 1/2 minutes) movie: a character named 'Lady Pleasure' kisses each monkey in a long uninterrupted setting and then goes away dismissively. She is referred to as I.J. Jefferson, but is really Mimi Manchu, Nicholson's lover and LSD partner. Red hair, psychedelic behavior. Nice. This scene tells me everything about how Jack feels about the boys. <br /> <br /> Teds rating - 3 of 3: Worth seeing.
