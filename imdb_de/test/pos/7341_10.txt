Thank you for making such a wonderful escape. That's what I love about movies. I'm so impressed with the Aireals, the way they were shot, and the timing was so dynamic that the music was perfect. Being a dancer myself, and since I was part of many dance films, the choreography is mostly chopped, diced and sometimes not the beat ..... "Showgirls" the movie. The relationship between the ladies was so present in the movement. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the last one when she gets run over. I've seen the movie before, another version. And I did not like the husband last time. This time I felt sorry for him. It changes, as I feel with the female love birds. It's all so magical.
