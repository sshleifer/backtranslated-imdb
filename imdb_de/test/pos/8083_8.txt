"The Vicious Circle" is a very unknown British mystery story. Like many Hitchcock movies, it's about a man being charged with a crime he did not commit and doing everything he can to prove it. This time it's a Dr. Latimer (John Mills), who finds a murdered German actress in his room. As an honest man, the doctor calls Scotland Yard, which turns out to be a big mistake ... <br /> <br /> In this little movie, there is really nothing special. However, watching the movie is a fun way to pass the time. I enjoyed watching the development of the plot. Good actors are a plus.
