This movie promises a lot, but brings little. The basic problem has to do with the inclusion of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character in this film. Immigrants from Sicily did not need a red-haired Anglo - the movie might have needed them, but new citizens did not. In my opinion, the decision to record them destroys the continuity of the film. This is particularly worrying as it seems that not only the characters in the film but also the history of immigration itself is affected. The immigrants themselves were heroic figures who could get along without having to satisfy the satisfied picture of the "white burden". I wonder if anyone is going to shoot a movie with Irish immigrants that includes a Sicilian woman as the main character. The Left Elbow Index addresses seven aspects of film - drama, production sets, dialogue, artistry, film continuity, plot, and character development - on a scale of 10 for excellent, 5 for average, and 1 for need help. Both the film continuity and the plot are a low of 1. The continuity discussed above is further affected by the surrealistic end. Does not a film of such significant historical importance deserve more than a conclusion reminiscent of Marc Chagall? The plot is simple enough to get caught up in the old country with too much time, too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the end. The acting and character development is average, as all the characters are fixed throughout the film and the inclusion of Anglo-Saxon speaking perfect English almost turns the movie into a satire. Where is Groucho when you need him? The production sets, the dialogue and the craftsmanship are very good and each have a rating of 10. The sets in Sicily, on the ship and on Ellis Island are as good as you can find. The dialogue is wonderful and the ethical singing is excellent. I agree with Scorsese that it is a pleasure to hear the Sicilian dialect. Note that the immigrants speak of "America", not of the "United States" - the ideal of the political reality. There are many good artistic scenes, with dreams of America, gold coins and huge vegetables. The average left elbow index is 5.25 and is increased to 7.0 when equated to the IMDb scale. Another idea seems to pervade the experience of Ellis Island: the suffering of passport immigrants was exhausting. Later, in 2006, all you had to do was pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of the night, without asking questions! The movie is worth seeing, but it seems that what you see is problematic.
