The A-Team was a one-hour special shown last year on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom and moderated by moderator and comedian Justin Lee Collins. The show tried to find the other members of the A team together and reunite them for the first time on television. This is something that has never been tried by anyone. Well, no one I know is. Justin is a great presenter, and his eccentric personality and humorous banter shone throughout the program. The attempts to capture the performers are incredibly funny, but he was also very persistent and anxious to fulfill this task as well, which I would like to tell him. Still, he's great on television anyway - be it with a show like this or the Friday Night project with co-host Alan Carr. <br /> <br /> There were performances and interviews with Dirk Benedict - the Faceman himself, Dwight Schultz - aka Howling Mad Murdock, Marla Heasley, the Tawnia Baker, Jack Ging aka General 'Bull' Full Bright, the creator of the A Teams, Stephen J Cannell and the big man himself, Mr. T al BA Baracus. They were simply mesmerizing to see and hear what they had to say about the program, which became a worldwide success in the '80s, while recalling the good and bad moments of the show, both during and behind the show scenes. No George Peppard, of course, but of course he's already in heaven, understandably and strangely no Melinda Amy played. I just did not understand why she was not on the show. Okay, she was beaten after three seasons or so, but she was the first and original female team on the A team. She was only replaced by Marla's Tawnia, and it would have been nice to see and hear her side to the A-Team. Team history, in addition to the other cast members. All in all, the A team was a great documentary show style. Maybe that could have spread more, which could be a six-part documentary. Still, this was a big JLC effort. Recommended
