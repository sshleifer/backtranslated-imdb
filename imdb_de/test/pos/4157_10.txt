This film is an impressionistic, poetic interpretation of immigrant experience, a reflective look at the uproar and the anxiety that might accompany emigration. These are aspects that are considered in films about emigration to America in particular and not in any country more generally. The film vividly and convincingly shows the nervousness and enthusiasm when ignoring the poor, illiterate people from Sicily awaiting their emigration to the United States United States. <br /> <br /> You have fantastic, unrealistic ideas about the United States being spread throughout the journey. On the one hand, the rivers run with milk, a picture that has a poetic-impressionistic effect in the film. The film is toneless and the silence seems to reflect the discomfort of ignorance that locals have about American life, or, if not ignorance of it, a vision of superstition and fantasy. That said, the film features jerky realism, the boat trip to the United States, and the process of entry the arrival at Ellis Island had to go through. The boat trip is thought to be rather boring, which was certainly most of the time. The quarters where the incoming residents sleep are depicted as extremely crowded with beds four or five inches apart and lacking much light, which was certainly the case below deck. <br /> <br /> Again, the movie is not supplemented with excessive music or excessively bright lighting, and the effect is to create a fairly realistic idea of ​​what it really was like for people emigrating to the United States. The villagers are not secular, but they are quite reasonable, and the interaction with the oldest emigrant, Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and the immigration official, who insists on certain results, is quite bittersweet, since they do not dilute or soften the advantage of one syrupy conclusion and one sees the fusion of the realism of Sicily with the extensive regulations that determine the life in the United States. <br /> <br /> The immigrants and their history are very interesting and the combination of the patterned realism and the magical fantasy of the imagination of man leaves a convincing view on the convictions of the Sicilians or a people with little formal education in the United States too. The action is similar to barebones; it is not demonstrative or conspicuous at all, but seems to be more realistic. That is, all the leading actors, especially Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), the clear leader of the group, is excellent. While he never smiles, his character's actions speak a lot louder and it is clear that (luckily) the other members of the group, his two sons and the aforementioned older Fortunata, the boys' grandmother, have faith in his leadership skills and be clear conduct respect leadership. Amato gives his character decency and openness and it is a testament to his abilities that his character seems so capable and confident, while his character reveals very little emotion. <br /> <br /> One curiosity of the film is a chance encounter with a mysterious Englishwoman (the excellent and appropriately mysterious Charlotte Gainsbourg) who speaks Italian. Throughout the film, we wonder why she's going to the United States or what connection she has with the otherwise unanimous Sicilian emigre group. In the end, this is finally revealed and the revelation is typically realistic and does not seem particularly melodramatic or conspicuous. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Emmanuel Crialese, who has a firm grip on the realistic, if sometimes superstitious beliefs of his characters and presents them competently and confidently. It is indeed fantastically confident that realism and superstition may have clumped together awkwardly in the film. It is a worthy study of the migration experience.
