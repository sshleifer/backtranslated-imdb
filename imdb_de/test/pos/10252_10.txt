Cooley High was actually a drama with moments of comedy. It was a reflection of high school life back then. From 1976 to 1979, I attended Coolidge High in Washington, DC, and much of what was in Cooley High was commonplace at the Coolidge. After the movie came out, everyone called Coolidge "Cooley High." Climbing, dice, girl hunting, cellar parties and fighting, that's what university life is all about in D.C. I can not forget Motown because Motown music started and ended many days back in the 70s. The hits kept coming. But Cooley High adds a layer of humanity to the craziness, because when everything was said and done, as in Cooley High, my classmates and I had a lot of love for each other. And like the characters in Cooley High, there was a life after high school, but there was nothing better than waking up each morning and experiencing it every day from the first to the seventh period. Thirty years later, we are preparing to celebrate these good times. Cooley High is definitely a piece of time that keeps getting better with time because it's the only thing left over from those days, memories, some good ones and some bad ones.
