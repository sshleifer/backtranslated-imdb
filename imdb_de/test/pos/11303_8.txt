For once a Barbie movie that is good. I'm 18 years old and I'm embarrassed to say so, but I'm addicted to these movies. I hated Barbie when I was younger, but the movies I love. Shiver is so cute and I fell in love with him. He is as sweet as the polar bear and totally in love with Aiden. Oh man, I'm in love with Shiver. I love Annika's determination not to give up hope and it works too. I love this movie and hopefully it will be other good as well. Barbie & Swan Lake is another brilliant movie. I would recommend this movie to children of all ages (including boys) because the movie is so good and I'm not that excited. Barbie and the magic of Pegasus is a charming and exciting movie.
