A heap of human flesh lies dormant on a red pillow. This is the pile of naked flesh from "Little Joe," a New York hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and baby. The movie follows a day in his life after being woken up by his wife and demanding that he should go out and do the traditional male thing - to be a breadwinner. She wants to pay the bread for the abortion of her new girlfriend. We're definitely not in the traditional family unit here ... After Joe plays with his kid, he goes to the streets to wear underpants. Customers come quickly and quickly: the ordinary gay man who wants to see him again because they "work well together," the old English classic who pays $ 100 to see Joe posing like an old Greek athlete; the topless dancer Joe blows praises the rape; the aging gymnast who does not think that what he and Joe do together is strange. After a hard day's work, Joe returns home exhausted, only to be knocked down by his wife and girlfriend. He sleeps again while playing harp and undermining him. Flesh is intriguing as it needs a traditional classical mainstream structure - it has an exciting incident (the money for abortion) and setup, a confrontation and a solution (albeit very pessimistic), even a protagonist with a highly motivated goal, and then focuses on the details of the day's routine of these people, who are quite ordinary to themselves, but extraordinary to most "mainstream" people. It all seems very authentic and natural - the actors are hard to see, the actors are so full of roles - and yet the whole thing is a piece of cunning artistry - a beautifully drawn portrait or an intricately carved statue. Director Morrissey carefully orchestrates every incident, every encounter on his subject of human flesh becomes a packaged commodity, but with such a ripped hand that you almost do not notice it. The woman "grabs" Joe's sexual organ, the old Englishmen mourn a bygone order of classic beauty that created art and poetry of human fleshly beauty, the stripper friends of the stripper wrap themselves as women while reading a Hollywood magazine in which " real "women are packed as products; The gym buys Joe's friendship and affection, thinks artificial porn is real, and can not say, since Joe can not make Joe's friendship and intimacy for the money. The film itself presents itself as the plus of cinematic realism, but it could also be visual art or an early example of conceptual art. <br /> <br /> The genius - a word that is not recklessly used - by Morrissey was to find a way to transfer Warhol's artful claims to filmmaking, which was interesting but boring and boring, and making it into salable products that are among the most intriguing works of cinematography ever made - commercial cans labeled "Meat and" Recycle Bin "and" Heat "with a product label -" Andy Warhol, "which has an idea about that Just as you are struggling with Morrissey's cynicism, you are fascinated by his ability to maintain the highest standards and depth of meaning - the constant, apparent camera flashes constantly draw attention to the cinematic nature of it What you experience, but you are still drawn into the illusion - Flesh is certainly one of the most extraordinary pieces of kinomagie, the one Pu can ever enchant.
