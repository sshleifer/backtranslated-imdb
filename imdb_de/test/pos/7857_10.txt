This movie is not what it seems to be. Clint Eastwood is not Dirty Harry or a "cowboy" here. The charm of the film is based on the careful manipulation of the atmosphere and the theme. It is a Gothic story that takes place during the Civil War. Therefore, all the "action" of the movie or its deficiency takes place in a house populated by Southern Belles of all ages and forms, looking at the whole story through the eyes of the Clint Eastwood character. Seeing him stranded in the house and being held captive by the women is indeed a very "seductive" experience. And who is exactly "beguiled" here? Are the women infatuated with Eastwood's incredible looks? Are we, the onlookers, infatuated with both their sexual attraction and the possible deviant sexualities that unleashed them? Or does "beguiles" refer to what the director does here - keeps us fascinated for a short space just to (maybe) let us go? Don Siegel does it all in one of the most memorable and disturbing movies I've seen.
