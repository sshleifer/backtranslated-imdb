This is a difficult movie to check, as several factors need to be considered. Let's filter that more judgmental .. Okay, are you interested in the facts about the serial killer of Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you withstand an independent, low budget movie? Are you objective enough not to like a movie just because of its lack of stars or its professional looks? Well, if you said yes, you should have a mind open enough to deal with it. This film is an almost 100% dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and the subsequent series of murders and is designed as an autobiography. It's not a glamorous, unrealistic report that unfortunately was the movie "Dahmer" (2001). The movie begins with Dahmer, quite convincingly played by Carl Crew, who sits in the police car as he attacks his home. His thoughts on what brought him there are presented to us in a past, narrated style that explains much of Dahmer's psychosis and motives that killed him almost twenty times. We get to know the character, both the deceitful and the side that came close to a normal life. No one is responsible for Dahmer's fault that 17 people have died, but as a student of criminal psychology, I was more than welcome to his animal side in this film. You see that he has a loving relationship with his grandmother and is trying to find camaraderie, but of course we are witnessing the side of him that everyone remembers. It should be noted that there is hardly any screen violence, and much of it indicates shots, such as spattering blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain. You see two deaths that I remember, one is a pretty bloodless throat cut and the other a man who is pushed into an acid barrel alive. While you see nothing graphic, this cruelty and the convincing spectacle of both crew and its victim make a disturbing scene. And while the actual mutilation on the screen is kept low, you will see the results. There is a prop hand and a head or two, but it seems that this should disturb the viewer and not be exploitative. Besides, these are fake anatomical pieces where the budget constraints are visible. Although acceptable, they look good enough not to disturb. The film actually ends before Dahmer's death in 1994, since he was released a year or two ago. That's about the only big difference from real history, and the information that's left out is, as I said, very accurate. The movie quality could be better, the dialogue often sounds a bit too quiet, and the play of several characters is a bit of a joke, but it's not over the top. In my opinion, this is a flawed, but ultimately honest and serious look at one of America's most memorable serial killers. I think you can say with certainty that the film is memorable, and I respect him for overcoming his limitations to make the story believable, backed by a thoroughly distinguished Carl Crew as a Dahmer.
