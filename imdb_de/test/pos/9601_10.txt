I can not add much to what has already been said, unless I have to because of the 10-line minimum directive. <br /> <br /> I actually received this on a VHS-to-DVD copy, but the quality is pretty bad and I desperately need it to be officially released. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine what extras I would like to see (Tim Healy's character swears by one of them 'The program of Football Bloopers would be great!). You can imagine it now, right? But of course, it seems like most people have to keep dreaming of a DVD release. <br /> <br /> There must be someone in the DVD publishing section of ITV who knows something about British culture. is Web Savvy and tired of watching IMDb every now and then? Well.
