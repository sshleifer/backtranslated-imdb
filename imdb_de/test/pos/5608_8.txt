This one-hour, 30-minute insider joke is best understood by Catholics, the No. 1 religion for self-taught comedians around the world. That does not mean that it can not stand alone, what the movie does, that the film is not without defects that it has. Mainly technical questions: The belief that Digital was the answer when it was really in its infancy in 1998 - a Beta of a Beta, if you will, and a re-mastering will never improve it. For the love of God, Hal ... please get a red. Or three. <br /> <br /> If you like Hartley movies, you will like it. I liked it because I liked Grim / Fool, and there were other benefits to looking back: I saw a disturbing self-prophesy, a plane hovering above the sky, as a harbinger of Armageddon in this 1998 film. It was as if Cheney had got the whole idea from Hal. It's true - Hartley moves his players into the camera as if it were the House of Commons, just part of the gadgets that need a break. After all, we take care of the actors, and the writing lives. Not great writing, but ... passionate. Can I use the word fervently? Determined, intelligent, not condescending. <br /> <br /> absolutely LOVE PJ Harvey in this class, of course I would love her everywhere. Oddly enough, if Helen Mirren needs a younger self, she should visit Harvey and bring a bottle of blonde.
