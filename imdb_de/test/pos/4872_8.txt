This is more of the same thing that made this cartoon popular ... but who complains? It's always fun to see the poor coyote trying different approaches to getting the Road Runner, and then being pulverized by each of these inventions. <br /> <br /> The underground cave hunt was different from the normal price and was clever. It gave us an aerial view of the hunt in a labyrinthine structure. I did not say it was weird. differs only from the usual aboveground antics. <br /> <br /> These and other Road Runner shorts are included in the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 and the transfers are spectacular. The colors are great.
