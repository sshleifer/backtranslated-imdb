It's the best movie I've seen in the last 5 years. Certainly it will be in the same series with masterpieces such as The Platoon, Apocalypse Now, The Doors, The Dog's Heart (Russian film). The play of the boy and his parents is really so good that you can not even say that they "play". No, they live as if it happened to them. Note the smiles on the faces when the main hero is ready to take them for a walk. The hatred and the love in one piece. And the last scene! Really, I'm still in the impression of this movie. It's very hard, even impossible, to combine humor with tragedy, but if you succeed (and Frederikson did), the effect would be twice as big. , I also like this movie (and the novel itself is good too), but after Frederikson's movie it seems easy. (I noticed the same difference when I saw the movie "American history X" and "ROMPER STOMPER" - the latter is deeper). I mean, Milos Forman just showed the material point of view of the problem. You look at it, then you say yes, it's a good movie, I like it, I do not like it, and that's it. But "angels" leave a broad base for reflection. There are no bad and good guys in the movie. Because each of them has the right to behave the way he does. Like the girlfriend of a patient. Of course, she is young and pregnant and that is a problem for her, that his husband is in the clinic, but the feelings and the emotional experience of her boyfriend are even stronger (the result is his suicide). Why do you ask what he did? Are not you crazy to ask? Why not support him, help him, understand him? After all, it's even funny when these people talk to each other. They say brilliant things! There are many things I want to say about this movie, but I can not speak so well in English. But I'm sure those of you who saw the movie understand me. <br /> <br /> Good luck! <br /> <br />
