The best British comedy movie ever! For years, English comedy TV shows have turned into movies and flopped: "Are you served?" 'Dad's Army', the list goes on. However, the popular dark BBC television program; "The League of Gentlemen" has not only managed to create a movie that did not become a flop, but also the best British comedy movie of all time! With its dark and dreadful twists and turns, The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse is the finest British talent! His mesmerizing demonic storyline, written by the League of Gentlemen (Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, and Jeremy Dyson), is in line with the outstanding acting art of the Gents (and guest camsos)! I hope that this is not the end of Royston Vasey, not even after this great success! Do not think, if you have not seen The League of Gentlemen on TV, you will not understand what's going on. Everything is well explained and at the end of the movie you will be satisfied with the result, but you are still hungry for more ... Mmmm, Special Stuff.
