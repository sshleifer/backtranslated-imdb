I have seen this story before, but not my children. A boy with a troubled past joins the military, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor is played perfectly this time by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with ordinary everyday problems, who lives an extraordinary conviction to save lives. After losing his team, he trains the next generation of heroes. The young, restless recruit is played by Kutcher. While his scenes are a bit stiff with the local love interest and do not generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments Costner. I never really saw Sela Ward as the neglected woman, and I wanted Costner to give up out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs. But her presence on the screen is a pleasure. The two unrecognized stars of this film are the Coast Guard and the sea. Both powerful forces that should not be self-evident in real life or in this movie. The film has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the characters' relationships. But it still works. The rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited for maximum impact. This movie deserves the applause of the audience. And the applause of my two sons.
