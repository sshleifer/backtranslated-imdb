Brad Pitt sticks his forefinger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and holds him there until he gets what he wants. Funny, terrible. The fictional yarn takes "The Dirty Dozen" for a ride and sometimes omits to pay tribute to other films. Have fun. Even "Paris, if it sizzles" is mentioned in a charming organic dialogue. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the lack of vanity of the actor. There is a peculiarity in the character, which consists of pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino is visiting a new universe. luckily his hand. His brain and heart are visible everywhere.
