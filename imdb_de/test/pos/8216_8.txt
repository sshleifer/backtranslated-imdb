This movie was exciting and fun. Since I'm a fan of this kind of movies, I liked that a lot. The premise is kind of scary, but the fact that I did not rate this 10 was because the film was a bit over the top in some areas. Cmon: Nobody can identify this girl? I understand the concept of isolating myself, but I find it hard to believe that SOMEONE-ANYONE could not identify this girl as Angela Bennet. It was an exaggeration and also the scene where she went to someone's desk and started typing. Overall this was a really good movie, exciting and keeping your interest alive. Dennis Miller was great as Allen, REALLY believable, Bullock was good as the lonely, reserved computer worker the bad guys underestimated. Who knows today what could happen? But some of the over-the-top scenes prevented this movie from becoming a 10. 8 out of 10.
