I could not believe the eye candy from beginning to end. To be a fan of movies directed by music video powers. I am pleased to inform you that the photography in this film is a splendor to the eye. There are so many rich, complete images shown before me that every time I see this movie I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous films I've seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color for attention is particularly well utilized. Although the characters could have been better developed, action and costumes were worth the price. I recommend you to buy these for your DVD collection. Even if you have not seen this on the big screen, you will not be disappointed. I dont know.
