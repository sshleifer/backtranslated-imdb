Two Soldiers is a great example of film production. The director and producer has brought a heartwarming story to life with a highly experienced and dedicated cast, outstanding cinematography and very creative art. <br /> <br /> The relaxed backwoods lifestyle of the brothers was presented with spectacular details and contrasted strongly with the militaristic lifestyle in which they were encountered. The interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the backwoods of North Carolina and an even tougher war life, the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr) , the older brother (played by Ben Allison) and the powerful performance of the Colonel (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was extremely good. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of Two Soldiers, and I cordially recommend them to all audiences.
