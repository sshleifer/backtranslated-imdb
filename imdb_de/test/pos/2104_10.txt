This movie is an absolute cinema genius. It has a well-composed cast that offers an almost magical performance. The effects are anything but stunning and the story will keep you from the movie. Jack Long plays the role of Abbot extraordinarily well and offers an incredibly exciting display of absolute evil. If you're a kung fu fan or an action movie fan, this movie is an excellent choice for those lucky enough to find a copy. For all the big kung-fu fans this movie offers a fascinating insight into the world of Shaolin. This movie is definitely 10/10 and should be considered as one of the greatest Eastern films of all time.
