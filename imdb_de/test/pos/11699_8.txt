Considering Mick Molloy's terrible track record since traveling alone, I had rather low expectations of Crackerjack. Even the advertising posters for the movie made me nervous. Without the fact that I got free tickets for the preview, I would have put pressure on the mistress (who considers Mick to be a guy - there is a worry) to pay for it. <Br /> <br /> The first few minutes of the movie had worried me - it started with one of Mick's tired routines "fretting about insignificant things," but that had a decent touch, which made at least a little bit of a refreshment. The rest of the script was pretty good and very light-hearted - even the typical Mick Molloy (and Judith Lucy) humor was in a good mood and although I never had to pull away from the hallways, I made a lot more giggles than I expected (and it was consistent) , <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in the plot - quite predictable, but it quickly moved between singles and other jokes - I never had the feeling that anything was too long or too long too short; Mick must have worked hard to polish his script. There were one or two Late Show jokes and one or two jokes that would only get Melbournier - but surely there is enough generic stuff for a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Something I Disappointed was the relatively untrue atmosphere of John Clarke - he just did not seem like a villain, but that does not affect the movie too much. <br /> <br /> All in all, this Australain liked comedy, and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie. I left the cinema with a decent smile, which is quite difficult for an Australian comedy in my books. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
