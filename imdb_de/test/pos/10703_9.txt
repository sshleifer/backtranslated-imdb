For those who expect documentary films to be objective creatures, I'd like to give you a little lesson in American filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Documentaries are heavily dependent on casting. You select characters that you believe improve the drama and entertainment value of your movie. <br /> <br /> After you've taken a lot of footage, connect it to a movie with ups and downs, turning points, highlights, etc. If you have problems with existing footage, either make more sensible material, search some footage or be wise with your narrative. Claiming that the filmmakers used footage Locations that are not part of the movie (favelas next to beautiful beaches) do not affect the value of the movie as a dramatic piece, and the particular image is one that does not resonate enough with its own truthful admission. In any case, use the material that you can. So they did not have any police violence shooting for that particular neighborhood. Does that not mean that you do not include it and just talk about it or maybe insert a cartoon animation so that the audience is not "cheated"? Eh, no. <br /> <br /> As for the hopeful end, why not? Yes, Americans did it. Yes, the Americans are optimistic bastards. But why end up with a down note? Just because it's playing in a foreign country and foreign films are falling down by and large? Let foreigners represent the bleak prospects of life. <br /> <br /> Let us Americans believe that a happy ending is imminent in the future. There can only be one.
