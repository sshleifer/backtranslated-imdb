If you want to play James Bond, finding a leading man similar to BOTH Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter is a brilliant idea. Jean Dujardin, who perfectly hijacks the Connery mockery, posing as the smile and self-deception of Rossiter thinking he is polite Dujardin plays it like a Clouseau who can compete in karate. In the storyline, he searches for Our Man In Schtook, who mysteriously disappears and contains improbabilities like a Nazi cell hidden in a pyramid. If there is a glaring remark, then it is the lead actress, Berenice Bejo, who has all the sensuality of a pudding and is eclipsed by Aure Atika. It's good for a look, but that's about it.
