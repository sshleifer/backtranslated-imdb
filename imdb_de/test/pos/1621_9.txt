I got the movie recently and all I can say is a good movie. There are many famous Roman monuments and historical sites. It comes from the same author and director from the Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks plays along with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The film begins with the space and time experiment in Sweden, until one of the canisters is stolen by the most hated enemy of the church, the Illuminati. The plot is difficult to discuss without spoiling anything. It's a race all over Rome, following the Illuminati Trail, to reach the secret meeting place of the Illuminati. In the race against time, to find the path of the Illuminati. Still, it's a great movie I've seen three times and I still like it, so buy it in the end. It's a lot better than the movie 2010. And the end has a great twist.
