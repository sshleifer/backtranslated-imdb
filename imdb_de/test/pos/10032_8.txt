Recalling the frequent meeting of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, it is likely that "They Die With Their Boots" (1941) is best remembered for the film. It is the sweeping story of General Custer (Flynn) - telling of the time when he entered the West Point Military Academy, and for the lush Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland) through his tenure during the American Civil War and finally his death at Little Big in love horn. Director Raoul Walsh lays his historic epic on the laurels of the highly questionable rejection of historical texts rewritten by screenwriters Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie until truth and fiction are completely disproportionate. Therefore, the fight against Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) is portrayed as a criminal deal between politicians - California Joe (Charley Grapewin) and a falsely absent corporation that wants to reclaim the land that Custer has given to the Indians through the nation's systematic genocide First Peoples <br /> <br /> Flynn, who skilfully plays Custer as if he were a part of Arnold Schwartzenegger for two parts of Albert Schweitzer, has never been so unworthy. He literally radiates charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his faithful heroine. Resident Warner stock players, Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet, provide wonderful cameos that seem to have far more depth and character than they actually contain in the material. So all in all, despite the loose account of the story in favor of a good romantic yarn, "They Died With Boots On" is a rich movie feed for a Saturday matinee or a Sunday night cooing with the treasure. Warner's DVD looks pretty good. Although film grain is often obvious, the grayscale was beautifully rendered with deep, rich blacks and very pure white. In scene transitions, some bleaching is obvious. The audio was nicely cleaned up and presented with a reasonable listening level.
