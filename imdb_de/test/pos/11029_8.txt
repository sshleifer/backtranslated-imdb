This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood. At the turn of the century, in the remote wilderness of Siberia, a small community is stirred when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come out of the mountains to search for food and hunt on remote farms. In this atmosphere, we are introduced to Avakum, a hermit who lives in the wilderness when he comes to the village to sell his annual catch to Boris, his close and rather single friend in the village running a village business. At the request of Boris, Avakum accompanies the arrogant son of his friend Ivan on the hunt for the threatening tigers. Personalities are plummeting and the mood is restless as the older, more experienced Avakum criticizes Ian's amateur methods, an encounter also shared by the other members of the hunt. On the second day, the hunters see their prey and pursue the persecution. In a dense forest, Ivan wounds one of the tigers attacking the unfortunate man. Avakum sees Ivan getting tangled up with the angry animal, but fires accidentally Ivan. He kills the tiger while fleeing. The other hunters arrive suspiciously at the scene. <br /> <br /> Back in the village, the doctor works to rescue the wounded Ivan. Avakum tries to leave the village, but is confronted by Ivan's friends. The trapper, however, strips her off and races away with his dog sled. The young villagers swear they'll get him if Ivan dies, which he does later, but before he dies he tells his father that it was an accident. When old Boris learns that his close friend has run out of the village, he sets up the "lynch mob" and goes to Avakum to find him and fix things. And so begins the main story. <br /> <br /> A simple film that unleashes the conflict between man and civilization against nature, primarily Avakum's struggle for survival in the wild alone. The winter landscape is very well received. Perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack of Jimmie Haskell. Very sentimental and evocative, the main theme reminds of Albinonis Adagio. Other movements reflect Russian styles as well as some folk music pieces. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this movie is not available to my knowledge, which is a pity. The copy I took on television nearly twenty years ago is slowly getting worse. This film is a must for those who appreciate it when they can find it. 8.10
