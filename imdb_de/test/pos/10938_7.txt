I liked this movie a lot, it could've been better. I expected more action than what I got ... which was more of a comedy than anything else. Granted, it was partly serious and there was a good fight scene here and there. Mostly it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all. What's hard to do with a vampire movie? A vampire hunter loses his partner and has to train another, his sister goes through a severe separation, but she is persecuted by a vampire of all things. Granted, this vampire is pretty nice and not able to suck blood. That's all that's really there, except for another vampire's conspiracy for certain royal vampires to gain the ultimate power. Some of the problems with this movie are that its action went here and there and the movie had a very uneven flow, and this seemed to shift the genres a bit. One minute of action, the next pure comedy. But the girls were cute, there is good action, the comedy was worth a giggle or two and Jackie Chan makes one or two energetic appearances. This movie probably needed more development only in some areas, such as the villain, who is not really explored. So for a movie with some good fights and a giggle or two, this is pretty good ... though was it rated R? I've seen things we've done, PG-13, which is a lot worse.
