This movie works on many different levels. It is the profile of a very cool couple, a social commentary on retirement and care homes, a love story, a musical. I've seen Uncle Frank a few times and every time I see him, I'm not sure whom to call first - my parents, my wife, a friend with whom I lost contact. , But there is a way to remember the most important relationships in your life - and continue those that continue. Expect a lot of laughter and probably some tears when one of the lively characters hits a chord here. I'm pretty sure they will.
