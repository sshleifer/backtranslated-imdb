Does anyone know where I could get my hands on this video or movie? I've been searching for a long time to show my daughter, and I can not find it anywhere. Probably because it was only on video and they never did the DVD or VHS or IDK. <br /> <br /> I saw this right before Disney in 1996 and I think it would be the best video to show them. Such a good movie that shows every kind of emotion throughout the movie. also has many actors who have started their career with this film. If anyone knows how to get a copy of this movie or has a copy and is willing to sell it to me for about $ 50 or something, please call 201-566-0148. Thank you
