Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes that reaches the level of a good movie. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements that we like in the Columbo episodes. We laugh when Columbo does something awkward and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode. <br /> <br /> We get the puzzle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something with the murder that causes Columbo problems. The end is the usual, we get the story of how Columbo solved the puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is another good Columbo episode and I will rate it at 7/10. It is near 8/10. <br /> <br /> "Just one more question" - Acting? Peter Falk is as always very good.
