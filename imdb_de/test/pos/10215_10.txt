Nightbreed inspired me the first time. And it has behaved pretty well over the years. The sets and monster effects work are some of the best I've ever seen. No one I know seems to have seen this film, which I believe I saw at the box office because of the lack of interest in horror in the early 1990s. It unfolds like a dark, terrible fairy tale and is much deeper than you think, with a strong message against the bigotry that is presented by a rich mystical past that Clive Barker has created. What the fuck, the movie ends with a really cool sequel that we'll probably never see. My only criticism is that Craig Sheffer is at best just a passable actor and the project might have benefited from a better actor in the role. Just a small complaint, as Sheffer does well. I had a similar problem with Scott Bakula in Barker's Lord Of Illusions, not a terrible performance, but I did not like him in the role as much as other people.
