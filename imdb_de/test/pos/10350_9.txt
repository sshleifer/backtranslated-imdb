I am so glad I recorded this movie when it appeared on BBC last month. It blew me away, so brutal and real. David Tennant is absolutely fabulous, though his character is not always that easy to like or identify with. The last scene in which he plays the song has broken my heart, those eyes ... <br /> <br /> I suppose he would like to see this film between the dr. Who series has shot, and that makes it even more of an achievement for me. I love dr. Who. Yet I have seen absolutely nothing of him in Mr. Tennants portraying this man who knows he has changed and is trying to create a new identity and a new life intense drama!
