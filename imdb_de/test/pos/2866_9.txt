This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with some friends. During the first credits we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They made the stupid movie Wolf Creek, who was totally gay! When we saw that, we groaned. We thought it would be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! Not only is the movie better than Wolf Creek (which is not that hard), it's one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time! They really got their hands on this movie. It was bloody, smart and scary, which are the combinations of a great horror movie. Kane is great as Jacob Goodnight, and Christina Vidal, Samantha Noble and Luke Pegler did a pretty good job as part of a group of delinquents who cleaned an old motel. There were some rough scenes, and for some people who are dying, you are somehow sad. All in all a great horror movie that you can see on Fridays or Saturdays with lights off and friends. Do not look at it in a hotel.
