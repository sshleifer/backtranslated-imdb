It's not the best movie by John Sayles (brother from another planet), but it's not completely forgotten, if not for a reason other than its message. Like Batman, Wild Thing's parents were also murdered before him, leaving him alone in "The Zone", a corrupt part of a nameless city where greed and violence prevail. Instead of dealing with people like Chopper (Robert Davi), Wild Thing fights for justice, uses his powers of Tai Chi and sinister cat impressions, and occasionally sets himself on fire. He becomes something of an urban legend, a modern Robin Hood and a hero for eternity. 1987 at its finest, WILD LIFE
