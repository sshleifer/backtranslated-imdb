'Teen Devian' may look like a light Bollywood musical. To a certain extent, this may even be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the movie was successful with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, either Sadashiv Brahmam (who had the "idea" for this story) or Amerjeet (the director of the film) decided that the familiar formula would change, perhaps even exceeding their own expectations. <br /> This is not just about a handsome man flirting with 3 women and undecided on who to choose as a partner in his life. Dev Anand's character was always in love with each of the three women and she was in love with him, even though they were aware of the other two. The relationship between Dev Anand and Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting - in that each of the women is heavily dependent on him. In the body language of the stars, there are many suggestive teasers that are suitable for the imagination depending on the maturity of the viewer. The topic is surprisingly adult and finally it was the same thing that the end was tame, obviously to please the masses and distract criticism.
