When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought it would be another Disney movie that went almost directly to the video. I finally rented and rented it. I thought it would be bad because I could not see Shia in any other role than his recently canceled show "Even Stevens". When I turned it on, I was ready to turn it off in about ten minutes out of boredom. It started a bit slow and I could not understand the beginning because the years made no sense. Then they explained to me that later on the show I was released from having to wonder. All in all, I thought it was a good movie and I would recommend it. The cast was first-rate and although I'm not a golf fan, I've kept my attention with a good plot.
