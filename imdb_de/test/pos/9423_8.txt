I probably liked that a bit more than Terror by Night, though it was not enough to give that extra *. The beginning is just brilliant when we get a picture of Nazi agents getting hold of a new bombardment and their inventor in a small Swiss village, only to be thwarted by a camouflaged Holmes following the scientist Bringing London back. Once there, he does everything he can to keep the scientist from falling into the hands of the man - not Hitler, but worse: Holmes' archenemy Moriarty. Of course, the scientist disappears and leaves a tantalizing coded note, and Holmes is again in disguise. A climax in Moriarty's harbor edge is appropriately exciting, and we can all assume that everything ends well, right? A bit overly patriotic message when the credits roll. Now that I think about it, the fine feel of the place, despite the obvious circumstances, Rathbone's use of disguise, and the way that much conspiracy is squeezed in just over an hour-what the hell gets that extra * and is my favorite Of the 5 Rathbone / Bruce films I've seen so far. Seen on DVD, part of Mill Creek Entertainment's "50 Mystery Classics" set. Many of the transfers of these el cheapo boxing sets are of very poor quality, but the fans of Holmes find that the Rathbone / Bruce movies (there are 4 on this set) are all very well seen and reasonably sharp.
