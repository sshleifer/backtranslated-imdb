Another popular screening for a British picture in the Century Theater of Coalville. A well-crafted, solid drama with a constantly evolving plot and ongoing "twists in the story" ... while the lies pile up! A master class of casting a flawless cast, which was marshaled for the first time by Julian Fellowes, the first director. Excellent performance as usual by Tom Wilkinson, but good phrases from everyone involved, including lead actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was intrigued by this movie, which includes some shock events that really make you jump. A good short production of only about 80 minutes, probably produced on a very limited budget, but a success in which Fellowes should direct again. Some advertising for the film seemed to indicate that he was playing in the 1950s (according to Nigel Balchin's novel), but obviously this is not the case. Recommended visit.
