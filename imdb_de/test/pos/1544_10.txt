This is one of those classic American television movies that are meant only for a rainy afternoon. Although the script is extremely implausible, it never takes itself too seriously and the cast that leads to a great murder mystery / horror movie is best enjoyed with a popcorn bag or box of chocolates. A big bonus of this movie is the fantastic movie location and despite the strange occurrences and even alien inhabitants around the Tommahawk Lake, I would not mind staying there! and again and again.
