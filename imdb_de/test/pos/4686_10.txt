The biggest compliment to the other commentator here at IMDb, who wondered why this series was not "stuck" in its time, as many other series did in the '80s. <br /> <br /> It's not true, the series would have gotten worse if it continues. <br /> <br /> At the end of this comment I will give some thought to the other movie implementations, rather: Try the Robin Hood legend. <br /> <br /> First of all, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever. <br /> <br /> Nothing is as fun as the two, if you want, three seasons of it absolutely unique series. And at the same time absolutely in agreement with the mostly new and revolutionary findings from Terry Jones' historical documentaries on Egypt, Greece, Rome, Constantinople, the Goths and Barbarians and the Middle Ages and the Crusades (... yes, THE Monthy Python-Terry Jones): < br /> <br /> If you've seen these brilliant and witty Jones Docs, you'll better understand and understand the background of Carpenter, the author of the Robin of Sherwood series (which happens to happen). Be the brother of John Carpenter, who made "The Thing" (the third brother makes music) who wanted to tell us. <br /> <br /> The author of "Dick Turpin", "Catweazle" and the first two seasons of "Robin of Sherwood", called "Kip" Carpenter, is my film overlord. He is better than all the others who criticize his "sword-and-sorcery" element or his "flaw" (from the Robin of Sherwood Webring) of this series (which I can not see) or have other non-fundamental critiques then and even today a lot. <br /> <br /> So if you get to know this "Robin of Sherwood" better, you will be strict. They will abhor the third season first. Not only that, I went through it myself, and besides, I only took the first two seasons to my heart - DESPITE the fact that Robin's actor, Praed, left this series because after the series he had tremendous success and was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series titled "The new Adeventures of Jules Verne" - already the title reveals the emptiness of the entire project. Praed went for money, not fame, he did not follow his gait and kinship, I mean, as an actor. Actors who later personally represent the "real", famous in our time and legendary faces and characters of the Robin legend. The potential of this series should and could have been much greater, without compromising the level of content and the historical message and rebelliousness of current political issues. Again obligatory to say: A change of the lead role was forced by the stupid decision of Praed to leave Robin of Sherwood to leave a stupid remake series of Verne narratives and brilliantly incorporated into the filming of the story. Nevertheless, it is a disaster in some aspects. <br /> <br /> Anyway: If you know about it and maybe Connery was really advertised by his dad, but that the young Connery does NOT "chase away everything", as I thought without prejudice, then you can do the 3 Sadly, here is that the script was no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we no longer have a critical and free-thinking historical background, such as in "The Witch of Elsdon" or in "The King's Fool" , two episodes of the first series A) is funny, B) historically educated and C) acted brilliantly. === <br /> <br /> "Do not trust the lion!" <br /> <br / > Unlike many other characters who wanted him dead because of his own power gain, Richard Lionheart has shown as in RoS and in real history, it was a greater authority than John or others, but it only became for his evil idea of ​​the Crusade and the war against Normandy in Frankr used. He slaughtered and slaughtered tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims, and Jews on Wholy cruises, and his soldiers even devoured the children who killed them for starvation or poverty. After his arrest by the Saracens (Muslims) in the crusades, Britain was squeezed for his ransom with 100,000 marks (then 11th century), comparable to about 30 billion - 30,000,000,000 dollars of the current value) to him He returned to Normandy (in France, where the Norman invaders had gone first) for the Crusades (one hears about this in the episode "The King's Fool"). For this new crusade, possibly a kind of revenge for his capture, "Richard Lionheart drains the land of money again" (quoted from Clive Mantle's mouth as he tells Robin to be critical of the king himself). Robin criticizes this anti-social warfare of Richard, he speaks to Richard and says: "The poor have given everything to free you, how can you ask more of them?" - Richard: "... give me your courage and your strength, not your words!" ... Later, privately, Richard ordered the murder of Robin ... <br /> <br /> So the Crusaders were the real "barbarians". <br /> <br /> PS: Even looking at Kostner in 91, I was upset because in school history lessons I found out that Richard was not just a good man like Sean Connery in his performance at the end of "Prinz the thieves "showed. Well, as Terry Jones said: It's a lie, a treacherous lie! "Sean plays humorist and charismatic, and his son does better work than expected in the third season of" Robin of Sherwood. "<br /> <Again: According to my previous information, Praed is the one to leave Sherwood for a stupid Verne series no one with mind will remember or remember.
