Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years and it's still almost as interesting as I saw it for the first time. It's definitely one of the most unique movies ever made. <br /> <br /> I still think that Martin Sheen also became "disger" in the payroll. He dominates the film, but receives a lower bill than Marlon Brando, who appears only in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours and 17 minutes of film (Theatrical Version). How unfair is that? Sheen is fantastic here, especially his narrative, which runs continuously. It's one of the best stories, if not the best, that I've ever heard in a movie. His voice is only insistent as he tells his thoughts about this incredible, nightmare-like adventure. I always appreciate his work in this film. <br /> <br /> The other thing that strikes me about the movie over the years is the number of memorable scenes I've never forgotten, like ... .. <br /> <br /> In In the first scene of the film, Sheen loses it in his hotel room. Robert Duvall and the totally unsurpassable surfing scenes and the subsequent attack on Wagner's dramatic classical music blasting out of the helicopters; The playboy hare who entertains the troops; Frederic Forrest is freaking out when he sees a tiger up close in the jungle; the strange scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper, who greeted the crew in Cambodia, and then Brando's bizarre character. It goes on and on with strange scenes. <br /> <br /> That does not mean I enjoyed everything. No, there are some very unpleasant scenes, like the one in which an ox is cut in half (can not see it anymore), an innocent family slaughtered by Sheen's young, stoned crew on a small boat Crew is sometimes a bit too stupid. Then there is the huge amount of obscenity caused by too many F-words. <br /> <br /> So there are a lot of good and many bad things in this movie for almost anyone who sees this One thing is for sure: It's a movie you'll remember!
