I just came back to see Black Snake Moan. I had spent time reading reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... "thin white girl chained to a black man's cooler" ... I hate it when "critics" miss the meaning of a movie. Well, I suppose it helps that I live in Memphis ... and also lived a few times in Mississippi. It may also help that I am the former director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this movie. Brewers simple "redemption story" is easy to follow and could have had different themes to tell the story ... but I believe that this is very effective as a "blues". It would be my hope that people do not read all the hype ... and / or miss different reviews ... and a really good movie. Join in with the different things like skinny girls in white panties ... pass Justin Timberlake, accept his character Ronnis (whom he plays very well) ... pass "Snakes on a Plane" and see as the singer Samuel L. Jackson is ... because he has turned into a very credible blues man from the south. If you know little about the culture of the Middle South, much of what happens may seem cartoonish ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer knows how to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story, and you will enjoy this movie. No end that you can say ... so watch this movie ... and yes, I agree with a thing the critics really understood ... the music is wonderful!
