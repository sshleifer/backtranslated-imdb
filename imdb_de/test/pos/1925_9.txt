This is a story about a journey of a man who once had a dream and courage. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who attended the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, a one-handed all-round yachting race. <br /> <br /> I was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview with producer John Smithson, who is also the producer of "Touching the Void," one of the first documentary films to hit commercial success in 2003 achieved. I had gone to the cinema with great hope and did not have much prior knowledge about the cinema's historical event, and I'm relieved that it has not left me in the lurch. For 92 minutes, I was guided by a haunting story that made me think a lot. <br /> <br /> Without any re-enactment, this film took advantage of the limited audio and video archive footage they found, transforming it into a captivating story that allowed audiences to personally understand Crowhurst. The story revealed itself as people who had direct links to the events, including his wife and son, and the eventual winner, the only one who had managed to emerge from the nine competitors. Robin Knox-Johnston reported what had happened almost 40 years ago. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst's records (journals) that he kept at sea during the 243 days are so insistent that it has become much easier for me to understand what it means to be completely isolated a man , While Crowhurst's body was never found, the other competitor, Nigel Tetley, whose yacht sank only a few weeks before claiming the price for the fastest passage, committed suicide three years later, after making unsuccessful attempts to properly complete a circumnavigation especially the sea. <br /> <br /> The director Louise Osmond was in the question and answer session together with producer John Smithson after the show. I had no idea that it was a female director and that was a very nice surprise. The film is released in the UK (in some cinemas a few days) in limited edition. Catch it in the cinema as long as you can, unless you have a state-of-the-art sound system that can recreate the sound of the thunderous Southern Ocean. Then they will surely soon appear on DVDs.
