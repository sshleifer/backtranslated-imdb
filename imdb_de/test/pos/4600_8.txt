Let me first say that you are in the wrong theater when you expect a subtle sense of humor. It's low and hard to beat. But he does not want to tickle your funny bone. He has the sledgehammer and he has drawn a pearl on the side of the head. But do not be afraid. As for movies, this is a pretty gentle training. Oh well, hard on the cursing, but again Mike Judge, not Fred Rogers. <br /> <br /> Was this movie called "Intelliocracy"? F *** No. The jewel of Mike Judge is that he can make people laugh at themselves. Beavis and Butthead were most popular with teenage boys, just like the people she was always enjoying. <br /> <br /> In that sense I do not think that the humor in this movie aims at the super intelligent. Maybe you are too smart to get it. But he is not aiming for you. He is aiming for your average Joe. And he has a message: Get together and learn botany for heaven's sake! It's a bit incoherent and the narrator gets a bit irritating after a while, but again this movie is for people who need a lot of narration ;-) It's funny. It has a message to make sure we all understand. <br /> <br /> I doubt the casting of Luke Wilson in the role of a man with a 100 IQ. Sometimes he is not able to downplay the level of his character (what does he have like a 104?). Sometimes easily enforced. Kudos on Dax Shepard in this case. I remember seeing him in Zathura and thinking, "These guys look like an idiot." In this movie he makes a big idiot. Maybe I'm psychic. <br /> <br /> It took a while for Maya Rudolph to get used to it, but I gave her some leeway. After all, she had to play the straight man to a whole planet. But when she had some time for the screen, she made a solid contribution. Terry Crews played the same psychotic, aggressive character he had played many times before, but he's still a top-notch president. <br /> <br /> Another bonus is that the place was virtually empty. I counted my girlfriend and myself, there were literally six people in the theater. We could have had a barbecue and a mariachi band. So, no annoying people who talk, as is usual in the age of "talk-to-the-TV". <br /> <br /> All in all a good condition and a competent delivery in the light of the intended goal. It was laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> What made this movie so scary was the fact that the movie was still somehow running when we left the theater. We've seen a lot of idiocy in the people around us, maybe even more so from the dose we got in the theater ... <br /> <br /> These are all pods, all!
