I was very surprised to learn that Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for this film. She looked very lifeless and was completely trained by the 54 (!) Year old Bergman in the scenes where they stand side by side. If it had been written today, I think Bergman and the young man Ivan had landed together (Ingrid is so much hotter than Goldie ...), and the two characters played by Matthau and Hawn would be left out of the cold. But it was written in the late 1960s and feels like the Plaza Suite or Barefoot in the Park. The one-liners from Matthau, the innocence of Hawn and the first-class performance of Bergman make this however very pleasant.
