Abe Zwick perfected the unique piece beautifully. He has never made another film, but created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self-hatred that is both corrosive and poignant. He commands the screen and presents the crumbling debris of a man who collapses under the strain of an increasingly meaningless life. <br /> <br /> Paul (Zwick) is an aging queen who has somehow convinced Stanley (Wayne Crawford), an idiot with no sense for the future, to follow his star. He is a little thief whose boiling hatred has escalated lately. He was forced to skip the city and move to a suburb of Miami. As a disguise, he disguises himself like a dry old blue stocking with as much seething sexual torment as the Church Lady. He tells Stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "Aunt Martha". Paul himself has no friends, spends far too much time alone in the house and has to deal with Stanley's relentless lifestyle. It would be enough to make every man cross the line into a transsexual delirium. <br /> <br /> Again, Zwick portrays Paul as a tragic figure who has lost the understanding of how to deal with other people. Nevertheless, there is a certain poetry in his anxiety, which burns slowly in the course of the film. He is tragic, but also elegant. This is ultimately a very sad movie. It certainly has many funny moments, but there is such an undercurrent of hopelessness and desperation that the humor is bittersweet. This film is worth seeing for the performance of Abe Zwick. He could have really built his career on Martha. She's quite a gas when you meet her. Just make sure you cut your hair and stop screaming. She really hates that!
