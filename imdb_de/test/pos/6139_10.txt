William M. Thackeray once said, "A good laugh is sunshine in the house." When I saw Take Away, I have to say that the sun was shining in my house. This movie was great, the opening was very clever, the story went well together. In a nut shell, two Fish'n Chip shop owners, who are usually enemies, are forced to form a sort of alliance to wage a fight between David and Goliath against a fast food chain building a restaurant in their street. The end was hilarious, though I found many who disagree with me. Although the film was very discreet and showed contemporary Australian ethnic stereotypes, in particular the collision or cultural collapse, if one wants the traditional Anglo Australian and Italo Australian stereotypes in between, and how they are a kind of unity despite adversity "found, very nice. <br /> <br /> I found Vince Colosimo's performance as "Tony Stilano" an Italo-Australian Fish 'n chip shopkeeper in his thirties, to be first-rate, his demeanor was very sincere and convincing. Through his performance, he managed to bring the essential to the surface, or I should say, the soul of the Italian Australian stereotype, which in fact is the case Not too Italian, but not too Australian, Colosimo found the balance, breathed deeply into the lungs and gave him life. <br /> <br /> The cinematography could have been better, more shots of the area would have been nice, from what I can see it was in Melbourne, but where in Melbourne? For me, it looks like it's somewhere between Ivanhoe and Bullen, although I'm not completely sure. <br /> <br /> I do not know why so many people compare this movie to "The Castle" Similar themes are going through, Take Away is in its own league. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was excellent with a big "E". He has it all, it's funny, the jokes are great, dealing with current issues that Australian society faces, history keeps fine, I loved it! I highly recommend it.
