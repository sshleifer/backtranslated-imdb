This is one of those films that makes it easy to see how some people would not like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I looked at it last night, I waited until she went to bed. She might have had a few small snippets, but I know she would have had enough in ten minutes. The head has nothing to do with a conventional story. The movie is solid in the psychedelic era. It could be summed up as cinematic surrealism or as a kind of postmodern acid wall through film genres. If you're not a big fan of these things - psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and the acid-trip aesthetic (assuming there's a difference between them), you probably should stay away from this movie. On the other hand, if you're a fan of this stuff, you'll have to go out and buy Head now if you have not already. Oddly enough, the movie has never received much respect. That probably has a lot to do with prejudice. After all, The Monkees plays the lead role - Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork - and The Monkees were a musical group of actors who were put together by the producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider to a child-friendly bubble. Gummy Beatles for a TV series. In their time they had as much respect as Menudo, New Kids in the Block, The Spice Girls and so on. As another IMDb reviewer rightly notes, "Perhaps in 1968 the people who think of the Monkees as a stupid, factory-made pop band rip-off by The Beatles have turned their heads down." <br /> <br /> The Monkees and Head have never been able to cope with this negative public perception. It's a shame because in The Monkees there was a lot of musical as well as otherwise talent. It's probably weirder that Rafelson, who directs here and co-produces with Schneider, and Jack Nicholson (yes, d. H., Jack Nicholson), who has written the script and is also co-productions, decided the Monkees in this unusual direction. It's as if New Kids on the Block suddenly released an album that corresponds to Pink Floyd's Ummagumma (1969) or Atom Heart Mother (1970). In fact, the songs in Head, written by The Monkees and frequent collaborators like Carole King and Harry Nilsson, have a Floyd-like quality somewhere between the Syd Barrett era and the immediate post-Barrett era. This is much more prominent than any Beatles resemblance. Some people have complained about the music in the movie, but for me all the songs are gems. Some people do not like the Barrett era (or others) Floyd, which is just as hard for me to understand. <br /> <br /> But what is it about? The only thing is, The Monkees make a journey through various film genres - there are war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, western scenes, sci-fi scenes, romance scenes and so on. However, apart from the reality of the film, this is primarily (though not exclusively) on a studios. At root we see how the Monkees make a movie. Of course, all the scenes in the various genres have something surreal and self-referential, and they and individual shots within a scene tend to lead one another with a dream logic not unlike the Monty Python television series. As a dream, Head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare, while he is often one who would make you laugh in his sleep (something I often do, by the way). Technically Rafelson uses a variety of techniques to accomplish this. There are scenes with extensive negative images, there are many very fast cuts (including a great sequence in which Davy Jones and Tony Basil dance alternately in a white and a black room, each carrying a combination of white and black, each reversing occasionally as fast as two frames back and forth at the same time), there are many bizarre segues, there is an animated cow dog, there are weird editing devices and so on. I hope this stuff is not just a remnant of the psychedelic era. This is the kind of artistic approach that I like. It seemed like a good idea back then, and I still think it's a good idea. I would like to see films like The Life Aquatic starring Steve Zissou (2004) using these advanced techniques. Well, that would make the movie unreal. <br /> <br /> Some people who do not agree well with the aesthetics of the acid journey have complained that it is basically b.s. Meanings for something to offer that should not have one. I do not agree with such a pessimistic / nihilistic view; Head should have many meanings, and it's not just movies without conventional acts that have multiple interpretations. Nicholson, Rafelson and Schneider have a lot of interesting things to tell about The Monkees - the film postmodernistically comments on their manufacturing status; Popstar - Far ahead Pink Floyd, Head combines pop star and violence, from war images to images of fans who can cannibalistically dismantle their idols; and naive US-oriented notions of international perceptions and respect - well-armed deserters surrender to Micky Dolenz just because he's an American and then blow him up a Coke machine (again in the desert) because he's thirsty can not get access. The film comments on many other topics - from the big industry to the police, polls, spectators (especially in terms of tragedies) and on and on. Head is full of ideas, fair enough, with intelligent, multi-faceted things to talk about. <br /> <br /> Head deserves to be considered a classic - he has basically the same flair as the Beatles Yellow Submarine. Both had a premiere in November 1968, interestingly enough, and both were intended as a summary of psychedelic aesthetics. Yellow submarine was not quite successful. Head is all that Yellow Submarine should have been.
