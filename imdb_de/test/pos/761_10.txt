I thought this movie was clever and played very well. It is a film that clearly outperforms other films in terms of originality and enjoyment. Rupert Grint played the role wonderfully and has a general knack for the acting business. The almost obsessive mother added a lot to the plot and was a figure that could almost be abhorred. This somehow reminded me of the divine secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Not based on the actual content of the film, but on the conditions and the overall tone of the film. "Driving Lessons" is a story of the coming of age that many find easy to find because of their overwhelming mother, lack of freedom, and the discovery of themselves.
