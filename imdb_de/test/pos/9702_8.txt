My sister, a friend, and I saw this movie for my birthday on September 24th. We all saw the first "Jackass" movie a while ago and we all enjoyed it. We were really looking forward to number two. <br /> <br /> We were not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I laughed hysterically from beginning to end. However, it is equally shocking and amusing and definitely not for people with weak abdominal pain. It's obscene, but it's also a groundbreaking American cinema ... well, maybe that's a little too much praise for a movie where men deliberately hang their scrotum on ice sculptures, but it's groundbreaking that it shows obscenity Whether we want things that no other "decent" American movie released nationwide would dare to show us. <br /> <br /> There was only one particular scene that I considered unnecessarily obscene, and it was about a horse - I will not go into it. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I almost gagged, and I was almost crying (due to a physical reaction to looking at a scene that had a leech and an eyeball, not sadness). In my humble opinion, "Jackass: Number Two" is the movie of '06. <br /> <br /> Does that make me a donkey? Perhaps. But if so, then I could really care less.
