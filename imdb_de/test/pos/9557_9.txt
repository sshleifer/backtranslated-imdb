"Best in Show" is certainly the funniest and deepest movie by Christopher Guest. The characters are superbly portrayed and the pet-to-owner connection adds a new level of comedy to the movie. I have been a fan of Guest since Spinal Tap, but in this movie he has truly achieved what he did with the "Spit Umentary," a genre he invented and has now perfected.
