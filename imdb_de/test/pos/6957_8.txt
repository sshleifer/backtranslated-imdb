This is a good, undervalued movie, and Rip Torn, as well known as he is, is a seriously undervalued actor. I read Howard Frank Mosher's novel many years ago. How well does Craven capture the book and beauty of the Northeastern Kingdom of Vermont! I was lucky enough to grow up in VT in the 1940's and 50's and still lived there when the "Irasburg Incident" took place. I have not seen _Stranger in the Kingdom_, the Craven / Mosher collaboration based on the incident (and another Mosher novel), but this movie inspired me to track it down.
