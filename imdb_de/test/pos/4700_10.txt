"Sister Helen" is a great documentary about a rigid, intolerant, dishonest, embittered (civil) nun who runs a shelter for drunks and doppler in a very rundown neighborhood in the southern Bronx. All but one of the 21 inhabitants are drunk addicts. Robert, the only representative of the middle class? did he have a real job, a house and even a BMW? Regrets that she died before he could deter her. Why? <br /> <br /> Robert was on probation like six residents. He complained that Helen had a huge stick over her and was constantly threatening to hand him over if he did not mumble to her. In an "Extras" interview, he said that Helen headed the center to compensate for the death of the three men in their lives? her husband and her two boys. The husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at the age of 55. One boy died of an overdose of heroin and the other was stabbed to death. Helen stayed behind with a daughter who had left her. Let the middle run. The daughter was not satisfied. She wanted her mother. <br /> <br /> Fascinating is how little Helen has changed. Outwardly, it seems like she has made a big change. After seeing this intriguing and disturbing video several times - once with the directors' review - it became clear that Helen had replaced 21 male addicts with a boss to replace their three dead men. <br /> <br /> Helen admits that she ignored her children and spent every day in bars. Her bossiness, intolerance and sharp tongue did not occur at the age of 56 years. It was extremely difficult to live with her. Even Robert says he stayed clean despite Helen. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Helen, who abuses a man who wants to live in an animal shelter. Allegedly, she demonstrates her street mind. Another time she humiliates Mel, her "assistant," because he has not bathed for a year. Then she moves his dirty pillowcase in the air. The film is viscous as Helen threatens and humiliates people. Her signature song is "My Way". Her favorite phrase is, "I'll be completely honest with you." People who use such expressions often turn out to be the opposite. <br /> <br /> The residents are really in a bad mood. Only Robert has no marketable skills except the broom. They all desperately need a roof over their heads, and Helen has the power to admit or expel whoever she wants, because Helen runs the place alone. She has no board of directors to answer to and receives no public funds. It's her show. <br /> <br /> Helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety. She stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can do the same. It makes drug abuse on alcohol or drugs and not on the underlying problems that have forced the men to drink and to the drug. She is not a therapist, just a landlady who dyes her hair, wears a habit, and exercises full power over her tenants and stops drinking. <br /> <br /> Helen also outruns her inmates by asking for urine tests. Twice Major, a very solid and respected senior resident she trusted, had failed his tests. Helen was angry and drove him away. Major stopped and said the results were wrong because he had never made heroin. Helen did not give in and did not think that a mistake could have been made. This was particularly disturbing as she knew Major for a long time. However, she disagreed with her relationship, assuming he was a liar, and relied entirely on the results. Major finally discovered that the codeine had appeared in his cough syrup as opiate. Helen never apologized publicly but allegedly agreed privately. <br /> <br /> Helen also had a very bad reputation in her old neighborhood. She admitted to Robert that she had got up very late one night to cut someone's hoops. The person has done her wrong and it was definitely worth cutting her hoops. She was not a nice woman. So she finally decided on the only way to keep the name Travis (her last name) alive. since the three male Travises died? was to found the Travis Center. <br /> <br /> For some residents it was a very good deal. They met Helen and got a cheap, safe, sober and structured apartment. One, however, said he preferred jail. Addicts and drunks do not all have to be treated like children. Helen used "old school" techniques that were discredited. However, nobody was forced to stay in the center, and for some it was definitely a positive experience. The Travis Center is not a treatment center. It is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who are putting their lives in order. <br /> <br /> To get the complete experience of Sister Helen, you will see all the additional interviews and the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences with Sister Helen and her guests.
