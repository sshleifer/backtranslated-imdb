This is one of the most cerebral movies I have ever seen. The scripting language, the costumes, the scenery, the plot, the characters, etc. are all outstanding. You will not be bored. I watched this movie intensively or just listened to it while I worked so many times that I lost the count. Scarlett ages gracefully and gains wisdom beyond her last years. This film takes you from Tara to Ireland, where her family originally comes from, and you see the results of another civil war being played between the Irish and the English. <br /> <br /> This film shows the double standards of men at the time - a man is still respected when he has girlfriends and whores, but no woman. If it is only seen in a private place with a man, society accuses them of inappropriateness. And of course, Scarlett always thought outside the box and broke the rules when needed to make the necessary changes, to help people and / or to survive. <br /> <br /> Scarlet's beauty is definitely to the bone. Their strength, self-esteem and wisdom grow larger with age. <br /> <br /> I remember her lines when I was confronted with too much on my plate, for example, "tomorrow is another day," and how she wore herself, her determination, her courage, and her have learned experiences. This is a good movie to show your daughters how a woman teaches how important it is to have respect for oneself, and that men, especially very pretty ones, can have two sides and treat a woman differently, ever After How She Behaves and What She Does Respect Yourself An attractive woman must learn what this movie teaches. <br /> <br /> This film is like a therapy for me and it's better than Gone with the Wind. The second part takes place in Ireland and anyone who is Irish decent will appreciate Scarlet's landscape, people and character in it.
