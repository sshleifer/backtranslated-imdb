Well, I do not want to add anything to the drama that was "preached" in this film. <br /> <br /> All I can add is that it is by no means a "historical" picture. Unlike "Braveheart", "Titanic" or "The Patriot" all have very credible and serious historical changes, purely from a theatrical point of view (possibly the worst excuses). <br /> <br /> Did everyone accept a humor bypass? <br /> <br /> All I can add is a paraphrase of good Captain Macleane - "It looked awesome and we have a damn good laugh". <br /> <br /> - One last point. It is amazing that there are comments that refer to the "modern music" in a historical environment. I wonder if the same people make the same judgment about Moulin Rouge. I do not suggest.
