I was fortunate to have seen this movie at the Seattle Film Fest, and was thrilled with how great it was. This is undoubtedly one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!). This is a loving look back on life and times, music and relationships of one of the true legends of music. Harry Nilsson deserves to be at the forefront of Gershwin, Cole Porter and all the other great songwriters of the 20th century. He was considered equal by all four members of the Beatles, who all called him the 5th Beatle and had the same wavelength as themselves. Harry refused to tour, so many today do not remember him and those who were born after his heyday do not know who he was. That's tragic. Everyone should have the opportunity to get to know this wonderful talent. This film is a step in the right direction to finally give the man his right. Unfortunately, the film is not widely distributed or even a DVD, so good luck for the time being to see him. <br /> <br /> If you are someone who has the power to put together a DVD distribution deal, please contact the filmmakers. This movie must be available. Hey VH-1, what about when you show it on air and then maybe put it on DVD? Harry Nilsson deserves nothing less.
