There is a version of "Nevsky" which is shown with a live symphony orchestra, a choir, a soloist and the movie. If NEVER done by you within a day, you will see "Nevsky" this way. The Oklahoma City Philharmonic did it a few years ago with the OKC Canterbury Choir (one of the most beautiful ever). I think I cried all over, it was one of the most emotionally emotional movie experiences of my life. I'm just listening to "Nevsky" on the radio and it's still ripping me apart. There are films that I love and classical pieces of music that I love, but there is no combination that I can think of that comes close to the effect of "Nevsky" in real time.
