All I can say is that every time I see CONRACK I see you. Martin Ritt, DP. John Alonzo, I feel a sense of inspiration and enlightenment about what makes the power of cinema possible in such a simple film. The film Conrack is set in 1969. It is based on a true story. It's a story about a white man (Jon Voight) teaching a group of young black kids how incredible the world is outside their small island in South Carolina. <br /> <br /> History puts a teacher's job at the center A noble thing when it comes to changing the lives of children. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
