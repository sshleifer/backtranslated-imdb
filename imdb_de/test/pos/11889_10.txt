El Padrino has just been released in Europe and really kicking his ass. This movie with its great cast - Damian Chapa (Blood in Blood Out), Robert Wager, Jennifer Tilly, Robert Wagner and many more) - is the best gangster movie since SCARFACE. A movie that everyone has to see. 2 hours of action with a fantastic incredible stunt !!!! <br /> <br /> GRACIAS JENNIFER !!!! We are looking forward to part 2 !!!! Does anyone know if there will be one? Keep it up !!! I loved it !!
