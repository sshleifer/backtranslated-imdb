I highly recommend this movie. It blurs the line between childhood fantasy and everyday reality so seamlessly that you have to believe it to believe it. The actors and the director have such perfect timing that in a scene a name calling fight becomes a kind of dance. I loved the story, the actors, everything. Although I think there were one or two clearly cheesy scenes, the movie as a whole was flawless.
