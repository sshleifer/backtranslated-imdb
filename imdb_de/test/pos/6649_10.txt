How is it possible to like the same movie and not like it? <br /> <br /> The storyline is very similar to Jody Foster, Sommersby, just not so good. Nicole was great ... Jew was appropriate. You did not give him many lines ... is there a reason for that? In general, he is a pretty good actor. She is so elegant, his character is so rural. One wonders what they see into each other. <br /> <br /> Romance between the two was successful only with Lady Chatterly's Lover. <br /> <br /> I think the dislike comes about because the movie is too long. They could have told the story in two hours. <br /> <br /> The story is good. Good locations, good shooting. The character actors were great.
