OK, most of us agree that this is a poor attempt at a remake, but at the same time another movie. Do not get me wrong: "American Werewolf In London" is a superior movie, but "American Remake In Paris" is also a decent movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, the only real similarities are the TITLE, 2 American BACKPACKER and WEREWOLVES. Apart from these three things, "American Remake In Paris" differs quite well with its special mix of humor, action / adventure and horror. Most people who say that this film is better than the original are the youth of today's generation who believe that every film produced before 1990 is total crap. Those of us who grew up in the 1980s can appreciate older films and know what they have contributed to today's horror films. Many people do not realize that without the old classic movies, including B & W movies, horror would not be what it is today. Now I'm getting off the beaten path a bit ... An American Werewolf In Paris, a good try is to recreate a classic, but it will never outperform the original. Still, this is still a very entertaining movie and I can only recommend it. I give him a 7 out of 10 points. Maybe that's a bit generous, but I have seen much worse attempts to recreate a classic.
