I'm a guy, so I was very reluctant to watch the movie because I know that Richard Gear likes to be in teardrop movies. I'd rather see action / adventure / sci-fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear wanker. Diane tended to exaggerate a few times, as Richard did, but they brought it with them and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teenager with a huge attitude, so you started hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but it was a masterpiece for entertainment purposes. Borrow it and see if you shed no tears. If you like the notebook you will love this one. The beach scenes were flawlessly shot. Although the hurricane scenes were off the beaten track, it was still a bit panicky to see how they responded.
