What the hell do people expect these days in horror movies anyway? Is it MUST be something scary like 'SAW' or just crap ... ??? Well, I'm not pretending to be an omniscient expert, but I'm about 47 years old, literally saw and owns thousands of movies, and I really think that this director has made a really good and sincere effort for this film. Believe me, I got ready when the dialogue began to crumble. It's not a Mamet script, that's for sure; but come on !!! With all the HORRIBLE trash out there, especially in horror, I thought that WAY was closer to the top of the pile than most. The director used many neat, clever camera angles; The soundtrack was superb and atmospheric, perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of movie. The editing and the timing were very good. And it did not come back to the tired, worn-out cliche of excessive "Slasher" violence; for example ***** MINOR SPOILER ***** During an absolutely adorable and completely free (but delicious ... um, I mean taste) nude shower scene, I FULLY expect that she will be sliced ​​and diced; AMAZINGLY, we just enjoy their heavenly loveliness and that's it. ************************************************** ******************************* What. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; WE actually see the doll talking to her, but not when recording the video. In addition, the mother sees that Pinnochio is moving and quite angry. So are both the mother and the daughter mentally ill ... ??? There is also the original "killer" and what the mother had suspected was a possible evil influence. But despite all this, we still are not sure who committed the murder. ***** END SPOILER ***** So all in all I believe it was a good, strong and sincere effort to create some good old 'early full moon' style and a lot of restraint in the violence. And without typical SLEAZE without reason (just the beautiful, innocent, beautiful shower scene that I will remember until the end of my days ... :) Compared to the absolute MINDLESS drive, a DEFINITE, a strong 8/10! !
