I saw 2:37 at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and was thrilled! A scene of panic opens this movie at 14:37, playing in Adelaide High School. This scene remains unanswered as we return to the beginning of the day and be introduced to the young people preparing to attend school. The audience becomes familiar with each of the main characters and examines the daily problems that teenagers face - including drugs, promiscuity, being gay, bullying and violence. Each scene is played again and again from different perspectives of the teenager and reminds of Gus Van Sant's Elephant. This is a remarkable film by the first-time director Murali K. Thalluri. It was created with non-professional student actors and edited through an unprecedented draft script. It features breathtaking performances by a number of student actors, notably Teresa Palmer in the role of Melody. This movie of coming of age is both intimate and thought provoking with a startling and disturbing ending.
