Daisy Movie Review By James Mudge From beyondhollywood.com <br /> <br /> On paper, "Daisy" sounds like the dream of an Asian film fan, led by "Infernal Affairs" co-helm Andrew Lau, showing everyone's favorite characteristics Girl, popular Korean actress Jeon Ji Hyun. Unfortunately, despite the talent and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in Amsterdam, the film is a disappointment, as it is a romantic drama that spreads to misery and self-esteem. <br /> <br /> The storyline follows Hye Young (Jeon Ji Hyun), a rather naïve Korean who lives in Amsterdam, spends her life in her grandfather's antique business and portraits tourists. One day, at exactly the same time, she begins to receive flowers from a secret admirer whom she considers a mysterious man of her past, who once built a beautiful little bridge for her. One day, she meets Jeong Woo (Lee Seong Jae, also in "Holiday" and "Public Enemy"), who, without her knowledge, is an Interpol agent tracking down Asian criminals in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> With Hye Young Under the assumption that Jeong Woo is responsible for the flowers, the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship. However, it turns out that the man who sends the flowers is actually Park Yi (Jung Woo Sung, from "Sad Movie" and "Musa"), a murderer who works for a Chinese crime syndicate. Inevitably, the love triangle becomes tragic and the two men end, while poor Hye Young tries to figure out which of them is the love of her life. <br /> <br /> Although "Daisy" is supposed to be a love story, it has the feeling of a funeral, with a slow, sombre step and an action stacked on misery. Half of the film's running time is filled with scenes in which the characters eagerly look out of the window into the rain, the silence interrupted only by bouts of self-pitying tales. Director Lau seems to have the impression that the film is a weighty Shakespearean tragedy, not another grim hit-man love story. As such, the proceedings are somewhat overbearing, though the plot is inherently predictable and largely based on the cliché liberal of "Fulltime Killer" and John Woo's classic "The Killer." <br /> <Almost every aspect of the movie is full of fear that the three main characters are suffering as if the weight of the world is on their shoulders, steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations. Park Yi, in particular, as the kind of overly emotional, socially backward-looking assassin so popular in modern cinema, is a bit ridiculous, from his gross incompetence in the job to his jolly attempts at Impressionist painting with Hye Young or his penchant for To discuss flower growth. This lengthy passivity makes the film's central romance a bit hard to swallow, and Lau tries to arouse the sense of fate that brings the characters together, more like a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Fans of Jeon Ji Hyun It should be noted that her character is much closer to her role in the supernatural drama "The Uninvited" than "My Sassy Girl" or "Windstruck," and although she makes an effort To pull some crazy faces here and there, their performance is certainly muted. <br /> <br /> The film benefits from brilliant production values, and Lau takes good advantage of the scenery of Amsterdam and plays the contrast between the gray, almost Gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue sky flowery fields of the landscape. Unfortunately, he tends to over-emphasize slow-motion for some of the emotional scenes, which, coupled with some visual postcard effects, gives the film the feeling of acting in the age of perfume advertising. There are a few scenes of surprisingly violent acts, though these are few and far apart, and although they were well staged, they seem to have been thrown in as a reverberation and do little more than raise the pulse briefly. <br /> <br /> Despite its shortcomings, "Daisy" provides a mesmerizing view, and the story almost fails to see, with whichever of the men Hye Young will end, in spite of itself, mainly from a morbid fascination but to see who is dying will be their arms. The smug melodrama works well enough to pick all the right boxes for the genre, and the movie works perfectly as a pleasantly shiny, whiny romance. <br /> <br /> It's worth noting that the DVD contains the director's cut of the film, which once shows that it differs substantially from the theatrical version, which not only adds 25 minutes, but also rearranges some scenes, which makes the narrative less linear. Although this new version may be too long, it is certainly superior, because without these changes the film would certainly have been more conventional and would have suffered from even darker character developments. <br /> <br /> Wai Keung Lau (director) / Jae-young Kwak (writer) CAST: Woo-sung Jung ??.
