William Shakespeare probably did not see Stephanos as a gay doctor, Antonio as a faithful wife, or Caliban as a goatherd with a Trinitron, but the Bards had done worse work over time, and perhaps even enjoyed the lush pageant of life. This is his "Tempest." which was reconfigured by Paul Mazursky and co-author Leon Capetanos. This time around, Prospero is Philip Dimitrius (John Cassevetes), a Manhattan-based architect, who is tired of designing Atlantic City casinos for the lovable mafioso Alonso (Vittorio Gassman), especially after discovering that Alonso is having an affair with Philip's wife Antonia (Gena Rowlands) leads. Together with his daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald), Philip flees with Miranda and his new lover Aretha (Susan Sarandon), a nice Catholic woman, who struggles with Philipp's z√∂glibischem lifestyle, on a remote Greek island. Will a sudden storm make it all right in the end? <br /> <br /> Here's a thought of Cassevete's career: how many other actors could make a movie so confusing that it's so intriguing? A favorite of film critics for his earlier work, often with his real wife Rowlands, he presents a central figure who truly suffers for his art, but appears to be amused and enjoyable. It is not Prospero but something rich and strange that makes a great change in the sea. <br /> <br /> "It's all here," he tells one of his loyal companions, Aretha's dog Nino. "Beauty, magic, inspiration and serenity." That's it. "Tempest" transfers London to Manhattan after 1611 London and finds some nice resonances in Philip's displaced life. "Show me the magic," he calls to a stormy skyscape, and Mazursky's version, complemented by Donald McAlpin's sophisticated cinematography of purple seascapes and naturally sun-kissed Greek landscapes, does just that. <br /> <br /> It's by no means a perfect one Movie. In fact, the grand finale, which is the only part of the film that follows Shakespeare's plot to a degree, is chaos. Rowland's character is difficult to maintain in this film, and having met Sarandon in all her blatant fame, it is difficult to understand that Philip continues to be concerned about his wife, not to mention his leftist wish, an unfortunate victim "to do this, restore the natural order of things. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot to love about "Tempest". In addition to Cassavetes, there is Ringwald's film debut as his faithful but restless daughter, here as in the play an object of desire for the primitive-rustic "Kalibanos" (Raul Julia). Ringwood is exactly the same youthful muse of privileged adolescence that would inspire John Hughes, but with an emotional depth, the later Hughes films did not appear. Ringwood and Julia never got the Oskar's attention, but both would win Golden Globes for their playful work here. He tries to woo her in her island isolation with his TV-repeats of "Gunsmoke" in Greek, seduced by her 15-year-old body. <br /> <br /> "I want you with my Bonny Johnny balonga." Kalibanos says he is being pushed aside, but he still won our sympathy, especially after performing "New York, New York" with a chorus of goats. (When "Tempest" hit the screens, Julia was the offender of Broadway as the lead role in "Nine.") It's Mazursky's show, although Cassavetes sometimes feels like working with improvisation readings and emotional collapses galore. (Philip introduces himself to Aretha by saying, "I'm in the middle of a nervous breakdown.") He plays his character as a lovable dwarf and tries to crystallize his fortune by building a theater on his otherwise uninhabited island Gassman's rich performance comes as a pleasure to the other man, who is just as gracious as Julia, while telling a teen-obsessed Philip, "Boys do not have half as much money as we do. They're nervous ... and they love each other in the back of an old sports car. "Although Tempest is excessive and overbearing in his spots, he is, like so many other art films, very entertaining and a journey that is very similar to Shakespeare, even though his dreams did not exist in one To smoke Go-Gos concert behind the scenes.
