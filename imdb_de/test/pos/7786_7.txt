After the success of GHAYAL, RKS began working on this movie, which was a comedy. The film was shot for 3 years and released in 1994, but for some reason it did not work. Before this movie came out, DAMINI (93) was successful /> <br /> The movie is a crazy comic movie like most Priyadarshan movies these days, but it's funny and well handled. In contrast to today's films, the film has a real story and makes you laugh. Most characters have become famous, be it Crime master gogo (Shakti) Kapoor), Paresh Rawal and others. <br /> <br /> The movie makes you laugh throughout the run, though it's too slapstick and overkill, though one of the funniest movies is. <br /> <br /> The direction of RKS is very good Good music is good <br /> <br /> Amongst the actors, Aamir steals the show and delivers his funniest performance. This was his first out-out comedy that makes Salman good, but looks like an amateur front of Aamir, but does a good job and her chemistry is adorable Karisma is annoying and sounds like a kid, Raveena is enough, Paresh Rawal Shakti Kapoor is too funny in both roles, he is in a good mood. Shehzad Khan (titled by Ajit) is very good and also Viju Khote is funny. Everyone is good too
