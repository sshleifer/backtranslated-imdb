This program is certainly my favorite television comedy. Australia produces very few good programs - most of the television I see (and I live in Australia) comes from the US and England. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this show is how controversial this is. For example, when they passed numerous safety barriers at the APEC summit and pretended to be Canadian diplomats. <br /> <br /> The show consists of pre-made stunts, a general satirical discussion of current world events, and sometimes on stage skits All this results in a fabulous, extremely funny TV show. The segments like "Ad Road Test" and "Message from Osama bin Ladin" are hilarious. For anyone interested in funny satirical TV comedy, this is definitely the show you should watch. <br /> <br /> All the boys are great and have great entertainment for half an hour to entertain you. <br /> <br /> I would rate it 10/10.
