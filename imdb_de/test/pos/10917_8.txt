I looked at it again after I had not seen it since it came out (97), and it still made me laugh. It's cleverly written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can watch Bob Newhart in this movie and do not giggle, you're more of a man than me. <br /> <br /> For I think, the scenes in which Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, Kevin Kline hears the tape "How to be a Man" and the (almost) wedding scenes with Joan Cusack three of the funniest scenes in each Movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, the last scene is an apology for a happy ending, but ... few films are perfect.
