Cecil B. DeMille performed a number of comedy dramas in the late teens and early '20s. In Gloria Swanson, he found his perfect lead actress for these provocative pieces. In "Do not Change Your Husband," Swanson plays a bored housewife whose wealthy businessman (Elliott Dexter) pays more attention to the work than to her. She is chased by a handsome roue (Lew Cody) until she enters the boring husband for the new lover and divorces. <br /> <br /> Things will soon become familiar and Swanson discovers that the new husband is as careless as the first one. To make matters worse, she discovers that Cody has a woman by her side (Julia Faye). After several confrontations and comfortable meetings, things are solved. <br /> <br /> This was an absolute hit in 1919 and helped make Gloria Swanson a star. Although she was only 20 years old when she did that, she is very good as a possibly stupid woman. She looks great and wears some stunning dresses. <br /> <br /> There is a memorable scene from 100% DeMille, where Cody Swanson lures with promise of wealth, pleasure and love. While cooing, she imagines the scenes. Pleasure is a fantastic scene from Swanson in a spider hammock swinging over a pool while people dance. Wealth is a scene in which Swanson is clothed like a Babylonian queen, while servants carry with them their jewelry boxes that throw away. Love is a scene in which she is a forest nymph who makes love in a forest clearing with a pan-like character (Ted Shawn). Pure Hokum, but very entertaining, and Swanson looks great. <br /> <br /> Dexter is very good as the sleek husband shaving off his mustache and starts training to regain his wife. Cody is also good at being a fake charmer who's a liar and a cheater. Faye is funny as the bitchy other woman - who is no less called Toodles - who gets her. Sylvia Ashton plays Mrs. Huckney. Ted Shawn was married to Ruth St. Denis and together they were groundbreaking and influential modern dancers (Denishawn School). Swanson impresses me every time I see her. She seems to have been such a natural actress, yet there is a possibility that the camera captures her expressive face, which is simply mesmerizing. It's a pleasure to look at her. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining movie with many shades in different scenes to keep things alive. And many pieces of furniture are back in style 86 years later.
