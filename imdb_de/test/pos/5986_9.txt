I would not compare it to Le Placard that IMHO had more weird moments, but Romuald & Juliette, who were a slow starter, certainly ensured that attention was maintained throughout the film and a heartbreaking result was achieved, a brilliant one Pathos and a realistic situation that is played by all actors. <br /> <br /> It was a typically French film in which he was confronted with prejudices and phobias, which in turn led the viewer to confront his own shortcomings! I am very pleased to have this in my library and will undoubtedly watch it over and over again, which is a sign of a great movie for me.
