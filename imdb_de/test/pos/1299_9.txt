I was prepared to dislike this movie, and the first 10 minutes or so did nothing to dispel my fears. It starts with two high school gangs facing each other with bad kungfu. A scenario of countless other Korean films. Ho-hum. Add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote "He was Cool" (which was barely passable), and I thought I was indescribable for two hours. <br /> <br /> But don't give up that fast! "A Romance of Own Own" was directed by Tae-gyun Kim, who also did "Volcano High" (which I thought was a lot of fun). However, "Romance of Own Own" is soon turning around for the better. A high school girl who has just moved to Seoul finds herself in the center of attention with two potential applicants. Each type has its own merit, and it is not clear which (though) would be the right choice. <br /> <br /> What follows is not the usual teen love triangle. The emotions are complex and even if you disagree with certain decisions or actions during the development of the film, you can certainly understand why the characters make them. <br /> <br /> The film asks questions to the characters and the audience. Who do you choose? When is one obliged to even make a choice (and is it unfair to feel like he is making an effort)? After you (or your heart) made a decision, how do you react (and how * should you react) when new information emerges that makes the situation look new? There is a scene in the end that is very subtle but captures exactly what I think is a real reaction, rather than an exaggerated "movie reaction". The subtlety is in a figure in the background of the scene. Recent events and revelations have confused and emotionally overwhelmed him. Basically, he does not know what he should think about it. Instead of letting him "play" or look completely stunned, he simply stares at a fixed point that can not react or even say anything. It's like someone just pulled the plug on him. His reaction was faithful to me and I appreciated the scene. <br /> <br /> Like most Korean movies, there's a mix of action, bravado, slapstick and melodrama. Korean films often take abrupt turns (see "Sex Is Zero" for a great example), which can be a shock to the uninitiated. Continue and get involved with this. I like it, I love it or I hate it. I think most viewers will be able to understand and appreciate the actions and reactions of the characters.
