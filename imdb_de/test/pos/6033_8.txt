As for the story, this is not one of the best or most adeptly written Columbo movies, but the movie is extremely well done, has great direction, and really good acting. Director Nicholas Colasanto has done a great job with the actors in the film. Apparently, he allowed Peter Falk and John Cassavetes a lot of room to play, also since both are counted here as uncredited directors of this film. Must be part of his directing style to give the actors so much room. It works very well for this movie. Maybe he did that because Colasanto also worked as an actor himself. He may be best known for playing the role of coach in the hit series "Cheers," from 1982 until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk seems to be better than ever his role as Lt. Columbo. Even the experienced actor John Cassavetes does a great job because the movie is his killer, and he fits in well with the lieutenant. Next to them is Myrna Loy. A great star from the era of silent film and also Pat Morita in an early role. But not only the acting direction in the movie is really good. Visually and technically it is also a really great movie, with slow long shots, without any cuts. The reason why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. It really takes time to set things up and tell their story. The film also offers some nice artistic and experimental shots. Of course, everything fits the 70s. <br /> <br /> But as I said, in terms of history, this is not one of the best movies in Columbo. The clues left out to the lieutenant are too obvious this time. The killer looks a bit stupid, as if he does not think his plan is good enough, while the character is obviously an intelligent man. Columbo is also trying this time to irritate the suspect and other characters more than he normally tries to solve the crime. This and the different acting style of Peter Falk are one reason why his character may look different than in other Columbo movies. But different does not mean worse in this case. <br /> <br /> The film also contains a pretty good score by Richard DeBenedictis, who then became a staple composer for the Columbo films. <br /> <br /> A great Columbo movie to watch! <br /> <br /> 8/10
