I do not play video games at all, but my kids do. <br /> <br /> I got a big kick. Want to see more of this kind of movie. "very cool," as my youngest would say. <br /> <br /> Interesting characters and the entire story were interesting. Like I said, I do not play video games, but I think my kids would enjoy it. It was not full of bad language and that is a nice change. This visual concept was different, which caught my eye. Besides, the soundtrack was pretty good. I could even try some of the games that my sons see because of this movie. Who knows, maybe one day I'll be a player.
