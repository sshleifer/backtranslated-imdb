(Very mild spoilers, a basic plot sketch, no real details) <br /> <br /> IF you enter the movie with low expectations. I saw this movie a few days ago at a free show in Maryland, and the only reason I had agreed to it was ... because he was free. I expected a few giggles, but since I've never been a big fan of Tenacious D, it was not much more. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes of the movie are hilarious when we take a look at Jack Black's modest Christian ancestry in an American Midwestern city. The film then takes us into the future, until the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the genesis of the band and the genesis of their name. As the title suggests, the second half of the film describes their search for the legendary "Pick of Destiny". Again, the beginning of the movie was loud, funny, and most of the movie always had a smile on my face. That is, there were times when it felt a bit long; It's only 100 minutes, but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter. The story is as absurd as it sounds, and this is not a movie you see when you want a real plot. Which is fine except that it means that a lot of jokes are very good or bad ... and if they're missing, they'll be bad. Same with the songs; It's a musical, but many of the songs have lost their appeal after the first minute or so ... then it went on anyway. <br /> <br /> I'll say that the R rating really saved this movie from the bomb attack; The humor of the D simply could not work without cursing itself for sex and referring to drugs. But if you're not really a fan of the band, or at least know that you appreciate their style of comedy, I'd advise you to save some money and rent it. "Pick" makes you giggle a bit ... but is it worth $ 9? I do not think I was tempted to rate it at 6, but since I think many would like it to justify it in theaters, a 7 seems more appropriate. Just make sure it's your style.
