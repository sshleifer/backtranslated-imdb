Does anyone know why this movie is called Couch Trip? I have just looked at it and am still not sure why this title was selected. The movie was very funny and it's probably my favorite performance by Dan Aykroyd. It's even better than its Ghostbusters performance. I read the back and thought it sounded good, so I bought and when I finally got a chance to watch it, I thought it was better than I had originally expected. I think this movie is as good as the Animal House and the national Lampoon holiday. I wish comedies that have come out lately were written, and it was nothing that is not sad, and the bad things that happen are also funny parts when someone else feels that way and wants a comedy Script for a movie in which there is no sad situation.
