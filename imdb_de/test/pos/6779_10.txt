The game was made in 1996 but is still good today. The graphics are not so hot and the actors are not Oscar-worthy, but the plot is twisted, diabolical and very enjoyable. The dark story is intriguing from the first movie and continues throughout the piece. We played several people together for a number of reasons: 1) to use all of our thoughts together. 2) so as not to be so anxious. <br /> <br /> Play this game and you will not regret it. Do not try to find a Quake Engine.
