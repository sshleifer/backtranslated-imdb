Robin Williams is a national treasure, especially when he lets go and sets aside his mudlinish approach to the drama. He manages to liven up Barry Levinson's usual restrained pace, and there are moments in this movie where he really shines. <br /> <br /> As the cheerfully chosen American president in "Man of the Year" Williams regains the serenity and outrage that was associated with him. What makes him so attractive is his humanity and sympathy. Here is a man who can strike but really loves his audience. His humor is like barbed wire, and yet he is cathartic. That makes him very attractive to the people in the film and in real life. Laura Linney again portrays an intelligent woman in need. She is a fabulous and very talented performer, but I think she has got herself into a clich√©, and it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case. Walken goes through his ungrateful role, and the climate scene of the SNL sketch floats barely above water. <br /> <br /> Enter some fun moments, and these are invaluable. Enjoy Williams and forget about some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise entertaining movie.
