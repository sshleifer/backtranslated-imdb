In this film, Lindbergh's historic flight over the Atlantic is modeled, while he touches through flashback episodes in his career as an aviator. Stewart was about 20 years old to play the young flier, but his good performance, especially in the solo flight sequences, makes this a minor problem. Waxman's rousing score is a big plus. Despite the long running time succeeds Wilder to maintain the drama, despite the known result. What was Wilder for a year in 1957? In addition, he also wrote and directed "Love in the Afternoon" and "Testimony to the Public Prosecutor". And his next two were "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment". What a run!
