Many of the previous comments are correct, but some, well, not so much. <br /> <br /> This is hardly a "B" movie ... it is well produced, the live sequences are really great and the model sequences are first class. It is not "cheaper". <br /> <br /> Ricard Barthelmess is pretty good at it, and it's a nice companion to "Only Angels Have Wings." <br /> <br /> If you want to see something John Wayne, first discovered by J. Carrol Naish, they end up together. <br /> <br /> Tom Browne is youthful (and a bit boring), but saddling him with Hollywood's most wretched pencil mustache makes his character even less credible. Sally Eilers is much more. <br /> <br /> As for later influences, Wellman is in the early Airliner-in-Distress Zone ... the opening sequence of this film, where the Airline Operations Type arrives "Grand Central Airport" would have fit in "The High and the Mighty" ... Imagine Regis Toomey ... and a 1955 Buick.
