This is a really good movie with fantastic humor. Jim Verney, as we know, was very good with facial expressions and demonstrated a lot of it in this movie. This is definitely the best of the Ernest movies. I would certainly recommend it to any Ernest fan who's out there in movies and I'm sure everyone will enjoy this movie. In the movie, Ernest plays two roles, villain and good and plays them pretty well. I really like exaggerated humor where things just seem impossible, like in the Naked Gun movies, and there's plenty of that in this movie. I bought this movie after seeing it. Good direction, good script, it's worth renting.
