Wolfgang Peterson directs this thriller, in which Clint Eastwood plays Secrect Service Agent Frank Horrigan, who plays a smart psycho (John Malkovich) in a cat-and-mouse game where the president offers protection. Mitch Leary (Malkovich) remains in contact with Horrigan, who upset the agent with discouraging statements about his abilities and past secret service protections. Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) tries to keep Horrigan down; But he is strong in preventing Leary from carrying out his death threats. Very good FX and fast tempo support the plot. Eastwood and Malkovich are outstanding. Russo has a chance to get your attention. This strong cast is rounded off with: Dylan McDermott, Fred Dalton Thompson, John Mahoney and Gary Cole.
