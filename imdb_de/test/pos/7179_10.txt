The second film about the adventures of the Gaulois couple Asterix & Obelix is ​​ten times better than the first one. The humor is great (and disrespectful) and the script is well taken from the original comic from 1965 by Goscinny & Uderzo. I fell asleep with the first movie (although I'm a big fan of Asterix) and did not want to watch this sequel. An excellent comedy for all. Highly recommended!
