I save for the sequels. I needed something to go crazy with tension, fear (what if it's not so good ?!), and the constant lack of information. I needed something to calm down a bit, something to pass the time, except, of course, the Matrix. This was just right. <br /> <br /> I found it informative (like the part about Keanus Hals ...) and some things were funny. I regretted Carrie-Anne so much when she said there was only one bathroom and all these guys. I just found a problem with it. With 95% of people actually being male, they just kept their mouths shut and there was language in them. It's not nearly as bad as The Shawshank Redemption's curse, but the one scene in which Keanu describes a bad day clogs your ears when you're little. > <br /> <br /> It was entertaining and exactly what I needed. It's what all Matrix fans who go crazy need to keep them quiet. They mention a tiny bit about the sequels and someone almost gives something away, but he gets caught in time (shoot!). It gives you almost no spoilers, but it's great if you're a matrix head like me. <br /> <br /> There is no spoon.
