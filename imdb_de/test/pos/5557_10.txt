Faqrscape is really one of the shows that just has it all, great acting, great cast, great writing, sets, chemistry, muppets ... it has it all and more besides a home. This fantastic series seems to have everything and ends. TPTB seems to think that this is a series that shows successive single sets, as anyone who watches knows that this is an ongoing, epic love story that has an end to be seen. If you've never seen Farscape do yourself a favor, watch the DVD when the first season comes out in October ... and season 2 is the best there is! Watch the repeats on the sci-fi channel to catch up and then the new season starts from January to March when most shows go to hiatis and watch out. If all goes well, we will end our work!
