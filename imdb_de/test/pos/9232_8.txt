Someone once defined what is defined as the definition of AN INTELLECTUAL: "A person who can hear" The William Tell Overture "without thinking of the LONE RANGER!" In this we agree from the heart! It would certainly be a great task to achieve this, and Leopold Stokowski, Arturo Toscanini or Leonard Bernstein would find it almost impossible. <br /> <br /> And there is no shame in it. The radio series and television series, along with several film series, feature films, syndicated newspaper comic strips and comic books, have contributed to making "the Masked Man of the Plains and his faithful Indian companion Tonto" a deeply rooted element of our collective Psyche and our literary folklore. <br /> <br /> As with most legends, it all started gradually, first with a series of radio plays written in Detroit on the WXYZ radio station for local use. The creator was a George W. Trendle and the lead author of the series was the brother-in-law of Mr. Trendle, Fran Striker. It was the year 1933, when the ranger rode for the first time into the "Plains of the Early Western United States". The Lone Ranger, Tonto and the radio series successfully led the Americans of the Depression era through the 30s and 30s until the Second World War. But the post-war era found the country in the midst of a super-nova explosion of invention and technology. A new communication medium was in the starting blocks, but could only go out after reaching VE-Day and VJ-Day. Once this was done, the world and America were ready to approach both peace and prosperity. The "new technology" was of course TELEVISION! And we certainly need something other than "Roller Derby" and "Wrestling From Marigold Arena" to fill the air time. And while the first time a television station had anything except the portrait of this Mohican Chiefs (Test Pattern, Schultz!), The networks very soon began to tap into their existing natural resources, their existing programming! Practically all would be ready for adaptation to the TV screen. <br /> <br /> So the people from Lone Ranger, Incorporated were very interested as the producers Jack Chertok, Harry Poppe, Sherman Harris and Jack Wrather approached them. A deal to The Masked Man and Tonto on the waves of TV as well as the radio. <br /> <br /> Immediately they went to work and gave us the first season, which used the considerable protocol of the radio dramas, all potentially adaptable to television dramas. They occupy Clayton Moore, an outstanding supporting actor in many feature films and with about a dozen years of experience. He also did some serial work in Republic Pictures' Thrill Factory, which would be invaluable in THE LONE RANGER. As his "loyal Indian companion" and partner who brought justice to different parts of the border, we had sheer perfection in actor-supporting actor Jay Silverheels. ** We must mention that there was this conflict around '53 when Clayton Moore left and was replaced by John Hart. After about one season Mr. Moore was so missed again! Now back to our story !! The first years of shooting gave the episodes their own look and sound. They used the off-screen narrator, who gave them an authentic feel and an individual, extraordinary series. The salaried actors were all veterans of late-night movies of the 1930s and 1940s. Many were almost exclusively "cowboy movie" players. A good example of this is the casting of Glenn Strange (Bartender Sam on "GUNSMOKE") as a vicious, murderous gang leader, Butch Cavandish. And it was the Cavendish Gang massacre at the Texas Rangers that led to the emergence of John Reid (who was thought to have been killed with the other Texas Rangers) as the "LONE RANGER." In addition to the classic cars in the cast, you will find a lot of new and emerging talent (then) in the cast. We see people like Phyllis Coates, Dwayne Hickman, Denver Pyle and others in the cast from week to week. All this together with the demand for fair play, justice and peace in a Western world. <br /> <br /> The last two seasons have brought big changes. First, the use of color filming. That made no difference, since a color television was still a long way away for our household. The second was a new set of musical themes and queues. (Apart from Rossini's finale from "U NO Wutt!") The new music was never a big deal for us, as we preferred the "old radio" storage material. <br /> <br /> With this series and two feature films During this time, THE LONE RANGER (Warner Brothers, 1956) and THE LONE RANGER AND THE LOST CITY GOLD (United Artists, 1958), the character is permanent and indelible in our identity as a people, we Americans, impressed!
