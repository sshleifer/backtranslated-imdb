When I was a kid, I remembered the show, but thought the show might be a bit older as an adult. Well, but it's for me that the show is rather retro (and the music is very funky). <br /> <br /> This show is usually well written. I find it a travesty that this show was canceled after a season, especially if this show was more popular than the Incredible Hulk. <br /> <br /> I think fans should overlook the bad special effects and enjoy the stories. <br /> <br /> This next sentence contains Verderber: My favorite sequence as a child was when two Spiderman competed against each other, fighting each other in an interesting way. A similar idea is spun out in Spiderman 3 in the film. I liked the ideas in this TV program that some will hate. I think Stan Lee was not a fan.
