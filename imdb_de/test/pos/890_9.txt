With respect for Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicolls and their characters, Department S will forever be associated with Peter Wyngardes Jason King. Austin Powers is bad. He's a lot more nuanced than that. Jason King is lazy (he often lets all of them he is selfish (his appreciation of people depends on whether or not they have read his novels), many of his detective works are speculative speculations that support them, and he sulks whenever Annabelle is right ... and she is often. He is clearly a man who has a mid-life crisis and drinks alcohol, but ... Jason King is brilliant. If Wyngarde had played him as a pure hero, that would not have worked, but he often shows King as a paper tiger, led by his libido, the love of plaster, and the awe-inspiring attitude (and sometimes gets in the way of his detective work), but he does some of the best lines and beats in TV history. And if you do not play it whiter than white, the chemistry and the interactions between the three main characters are even better. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on DVD recently, you'll see how much depth Wyngarde has in Jason King.
