Like many children born in the 80s, I grew up with the Mel Brooks movies, which were not necessarily the more "runny" ones like Blazing Saddles and History of the World Part 1 (of course I saw, but not seen, them so often now), but for the "whole family", spaceballs and this movie. I knew at the time that I did not see great art, just a belligerent, stupid, though always laughing, attitude to Robin Hood and / or adventure movies. To call a family movie in quotation marks, however, means: a) Adults can enjoy it just as much as children, if not more because of the little jokes and stupid vulgarities, and b) as soon as a child sees it, when he revisits it, as I do some Male, it is still so fresh, but with some things the first time is not very clear. It's a comedy that's not only filled with jokes in Robin Hood films and other films (of course, godfather and minor mentions to other modern-day films), but also one that references Brook's own films. This is a filmmaker who is not just funny about his own style. <br /> <br /> Basic story: Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best twists) returns home from the Crusades to see what's in it's danger with King Richard gone, and so it continues to be Reclaim land and, of course, rob the rich to feed the poor. On the way, he meets Achoo (Dave Chappelle), bumps into Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the Sheriff, and of course still whistles out of love for Maid Marian. This, of course, is the usual clothesline for Brooks, which lets the comedy run into the scenes, and even though a joke sometimes does not work or becomes lazy on repeated consideration, so much so that it's hard not to laugh. It also helps that some bits are among the best in any Brooks movie, such as the Godfather bit (Dom DeLouise at its best), Brooks' own cameo as Rabbi, Lewis and Chappelle's acting moves, and an endless amount of citation lines and a few funny songs. Some of them are obvious, yes, some of them are right on the pages of Blazing Saddles, sure, but is it a good time for the right amount? In any case - and for parents who grew up with the Brooks work of the 70s, it's a fantastic way to bring the boys to their work through this work (even the suggestive sex jokes and those that are not R-rated are fun).
