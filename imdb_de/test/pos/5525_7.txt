The title does not refer to a questionable poker hand, but to six comic players. They come in pairs: Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland as a couple traveling to California for a second honeymoon, George Burns and Gracie Allen as another couple sharing the costs, and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth as sheriff and hotel owner in a small Nevada town. No attempt is made to make a coherent narrative; it is a collection of comic bits that are strung together. The first couple just want to spend time together, but the characters of Burns and Allen are not married, so the men collide, as do the women. There's a bit of conspiracy: a villain brings $ 50,000 into the suitcase that Pinky (Ruggles) gets out of town, but as the expedition is headed by Gracie, the loot can not be found. The bad guy turns up in Nevada and Fields accidentally gets him. A heap of pleasing pieces, Ruggles's puzzled expression, Gracie's brazen, breakneck talk and Fields playing billiards, playing with a corkscrew cue and making a flat, greedy, back-kicking double when threatened, and his wonderfully distinctive manner and way to stay longer words. And trying to remember the name "Gracie," he says to Skipworth, "Hmm, start with a K ... McGonigle." She replies, "Oh no, no, no, no ..." "Mmmm. Wangahanky!" "No, no, no, no, no, Oh, Gracie." "Yes that's right."
