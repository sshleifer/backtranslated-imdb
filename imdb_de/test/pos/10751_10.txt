I really enjoyed this old black and white talkie. At first, I did not recognize Harold Lloyd as Mr. Cobb, a missionary in China who came home to find a wife. Mr. Cobb's attempts to clean up the town hall had many twists and turns. His methods of making the punishment fit for the crime would probably be illegal, but this is not a reality-based film. This would be a perfect movie for kids with the exception that there are almost female women (pasties only on Grace Bradley)! The old phones are adorable. The only mistake is a typical problem for this day: Caucasians are used to represent Chinese men. This is offset by the positive nature of the Chinese representation. They are the wise, good and friendly people. Trivia - a Bekins truck appears in the movie when Black Maria's police go out.
