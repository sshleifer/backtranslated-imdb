The story of a closely wounded Christian family "reborning" three of its four members after a car accident caused by a pie reveals how well most of them are anchored where there is so much potential Country to go top, and how truly inspired is most of the acting. Where most of the movie's moments, especially its open and "innocent" discussions about sexuality, after three of the four family members have removed their guilt and shame, are hilarious, it makes you think and the characters stay with you. <Br /> <br /> How often does a character in a comedy turn from caricature to physical emotionality in a scene? How often do we see a cast that can retreat from showboating in the middle of a sentence to show a bit of humanity under the skin of the character? Even many of the "bad guys" in this film have moments of heartbreaking honesty, though much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and horrible. Even the most questionable acts in this film are behind truth and history, which is a difficult task in satire. How refreshing it is to see a dark comedy that dares to be humanistic. How nice to see actors so engaged that they dare to make them look ridiculous and sublime. <br /> <br /> And as a gay man, I do not think I've ever been so touched by a heterosexual sex scene as I was when the parents of this family found the first sexual encounter after their accident. <br /> <br /> Bravo. Bravo. One of my favorites at Outfest this year.
