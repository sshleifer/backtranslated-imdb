Sherlock Holmes (Rathbone) and Watson (Bruce), the tracking duo on Baker Street 223, are again active against their old enemy Dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill). The film opens in Switzerland, where Holmes was the inventor of a bomb sighted attack by the Nazis. Tobel (Post) saves. Back in London, Tobel hands over four parts of the device to various scientists. But Doctor Tobel is kidnapped by Moriarty. Sherlock has to solve his disappearance and be vital. Holmes has only a hunch that his girlfriend (Kareen Verne) decrypts the detective with an extraordinary mechanism. But dead bodies accumulate scientifically, but have appeared as murdered and Moriarty knows the keys as well. Holmes disguised as a sailor goes to the investigation and finds Moriarty's shelter. The image is based on the dancing men of Arthur Conan Doyle. This is a Rathbone Brotherhood effort for World War II along with "The Voice of Terror", in which we are asked to believe that the great detective could have lived in this century. Both stories are completely patriotic and flag-drawn films. In fact, in the end, there is an advertisement of war bonds with obvious propaganda. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent Holmes thriller with gripping wartimes and unanswered secrets and untroubled suspense. The film shows the habits of the Holmes series. His nemesis Moriarty, Mistress Hudson, Inspector Lestrade (a jolly Dennis Hoey), and of course, the chubby performance of Dr. Ing. Watson.Basil Rathbone is great, he is the best movie in cinema Similar to Peter Cushing and Jeremy Brett on television. Rathbone, because bizarre dub is top notch, he's cracked, smart, grumpy and impetuous. In the fight against joke, he's matched with Moriarty, his archenemy, a first-time villain, Lionel Atwill. Nigel Bruce plays Watson with humor, jinx, goofy, and gaiety. He is the perfect counterpoint of Holmes. In addition to Paul Paul and Whit Bissell, there are also second-hand secondaries. This classic gets an atmospheric black and white cinematography, but available in a dreadful version. Sufficient music score that suits Frank Skinner's suspense. The film is professional R. William O'Neal, the usual saga director and common in the monster movies Universal.
