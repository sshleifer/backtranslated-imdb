To be honest, my IMDb reviewer, I really enjoyed this show. The reason? Well, it did not try to be more than it is; I mean, a sitcom with regular expectations, a well-known and repeated storyline, witty and talented actors and skilful jokes geared toward a post-college crowd, but ripe to be funny. <br /> <br /> Jaleel White is as always funny and delivers witty and funny sex-oriented jokes. The humor is very ninety, without taking into account the tendencies of the new millennium, and that, in my opinion, is the main reason why the show did not succeed. It got stuck in the 90s. Oh and Mrs. Ribisi was really funny and cheeky. <br /> <br /> My favorite show has to be the one that deals with karma that bites in the ass! Not a cult classic, but I'm sure he's part of the regular nostalgia of early 2000.
