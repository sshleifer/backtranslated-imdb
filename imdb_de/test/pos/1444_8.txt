Many scenes and dialogues are just chubby, but if you sum things up, ie machines daily cycle of depressing walkup over depressing bar to depressing burlesque hall, depressing, smoke filled poker games and back home, you get a weird feeling somebody trying that somewhere Live the junkie around 1955 faithfully. Whether it's Sinatra, who would have stumbled upon this kind of character, who grew up in Hoboken and works in numerous bands, or Preminger, who uses the soundtrack and the Frankie-Zosch subtext to capture the addict's inner world view on the Hays Pass code cage over. They get a good deal to On the Waterfront, which was shot at almost the same time. A kind of faux-realistic work that asks you realistically how deeply drug culture is embedded in American life.
