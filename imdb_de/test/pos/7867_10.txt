Clever psycho-drama about a wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood) seeking refuge in an isolated Confederate school for young women during the Civil War. Slowly, Eastwood begins to seduce every girl in sight until the tables are turned and he becomes an unsettling, gothic-toned finale. Never before has a movie been so deliciously erotic and at the same time disturbingly macabre. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the finest hour of Eastwood (those who embark on "Dirty Harry" will indeed be surprised), while the rest of The Cast offers unparalleled excellence. Try to watch the movie on video, as TV reviews usually delete important flashbacks between Geraldine Page and Patrick Culliton.
