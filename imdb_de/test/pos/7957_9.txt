I've always had the idea that Korean movies were all about comedy and drama, but "Christmas in the Fall" changed my point of view. This movie is so easy. There are no melodramatic scenes or the top comedy scenes. Not a single scene in which the actors scream loudly. Not even a scene where the actor and actress kiss, not even a simple kiss. And yet, this film can reach its viewers in a way that I know has existed. The end of the film left me speechless. I do not even cry, but my eyes were red-hot. This film has given me a feeling that I can hardly describe in words. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can recommend this movie to anyone, but I recommend this movie to people who want to see real cinema. 9.4 / 10
