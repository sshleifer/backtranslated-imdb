I finally saw this shocking movie last night, and what a disturbing mind it is, and it's incredibly bloody and memorable scenes and a total assault on the senses. Looks like a movie from the minds of Lynch (especially ERASERHEAD), Buttgereit and even a bit of "begotten". What this guy does to his pregnant sister is unimaginable, but then it really happened, or is it the left and right sides of his brain that are fighting. This is the main theme of this artwork to draw a clear line between fantasy and reality, and what happens when the right side of the brain, which dreams and fantasizes, passes over and dreams the logical left. And the music in this movie is incredible, a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. Although this film is totally shocking and disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including hardcore sex) you'll ever see in a movie, I've regarded it as a work of art and loved it. And this music still fascinates me, I have to try to find the soundtrack, if available. Seeing "subconscious cruelty" is a real event, and the viewer will not easily forget it. And a hint to Gorehounds, that's a must-have. <br /> <br /> Attention ... Be careful when buying this movie because some prints are studded with the graphic sex scenes and extreme bleeding, especially the copies from the Japanese release.
