Sam Elliot is a brilliant San Francisco Detective Charlie Fallon. When his partner is killed in a meeting with an informant, he snaps, kills the informant and causes his body to fall into a river. The next day, Fallon receives a rookie partner to investigate the informers' murder. Sam Elliot does a good job of portraying a man who has been tortured by blaming his own murderous acts, and mourning the death of his partner, who may have been involved in police corruption.
