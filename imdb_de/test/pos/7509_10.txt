This film has George C. Scott at his best, Bernard Hughes at his best and Diana Rigg at their best, and of course Paddy Chaevsky writes "Masterpiece" Warp! There are also very short excerpts of future biggies like Susan Sarandon, Stockard Channing, etc., that have a line of scenery that you do not necessarily see until the fifth or sixth time. Nancy Marchand, a young and middle-aged supervisor, is also great at virtually every Hollywood "face" of 1970. <br /> <br /> It's one of the few movies that improves the more you see it. Watch out for the "Surprise" scene "Wait into Dark"! This is one of the few movies I have ever bought on DVD. It's so great.
