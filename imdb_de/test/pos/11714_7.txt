"Sharky's Machine" is clearly a vehicle from Burt Reynolds that gives Star Space the opportunity to show off its talents, and it sprays the machine, the movie plot with colors from other films and other styles, offering a variety of moods in one nutritious story <br /> <br /> The film was produced in 1981 with 119 minutes (lengthy for the period). The film went well, the box office revenue amounted to 37.8 million US dollars. It had a lot to offer: Burt Reynold's actor and director, a solid double strike; a William Diel novel adaptation and the South of Atlanta Georgia, at that time a land of Hollywood film production opportunities. <br /> <br /> Reynolds Tom Sharky falls in love with Rachel Wards Dominoe the hooker With a heart of gold reflected here as in "Hustle" as he starred alongside Catherine Deneuve, this film also had a corrupt politician at the core but with a downbeat, the Hollywood bliss did not end in "Sharky's Machine." <br /> <br /> The story is pure detective / action.Sharky, a narcotics detective, abuses a bust of a drug dealer and brings some innocent ones He's being diced down, literally turned into a truck to deal with perverts and other misdeeds that 'upstanding' police consider latrine duty, his new digs give him the chance to meet many equally sincere officers, the do the dirty jobs no one else wants, and when some attention is focused on a certain pimp, Sharky looks at some evidence and discovers that a particular prostitute Dominoe (Rachel Ward) - Dominoe is screened by police forces and political forces, and Sharky sets up a 24-hour surveillance that oversees her. During the time he is watching, he learns that the current Governor Hotchkins is visiting Dominoe, as well as a smooth Italian gangster Victor (Vittorio Gassman). Before the police can set up a case with the evidence, Billy, Victor's brother, a Cola-snubbing shooter (Henry Silva) shoots through the door of Dominoe's apartment, seemingly killing the beautiful Dominoe, but when Sharky finds out the murdered victim actually a roommate was Tiffany (Aarika Wells) Sharky confronts Victor and tells him that he will have him arrested. Sharky is captured and tortured by some Ninja killers, led by Smiley (Darryl Hickman), for information about Dominoe, but Sharky overpowers her and arrests the governor, killing Billy in a heated persecution after killing Victor. <br /> <Reynolds wants to show the inner workings of a hardened policeman who falls in love, but the action of the police with noir elements and Reynolds' ability in film development tend to override the dynamics of relationships , <br /> <br /> We learn about some of the men, which leads us to explain why they are working towards pensions instead of fighting real crime. This element of the film appears under Reynolds unregulated instructions sketchy and performance. <br /> <br /> A Reynolds movie is always unique. He likes to engage stars, either character actors or others, and then allows them to improvise, sometimes with mixed results. With his crew in "Sharky's Machine" he gets some nice moments and sometimes some exaggerated gems but always a sense of ensemble and good nature. It works with Reynolds as the author. <br /> <br /> Reynolds, the actor / writer always seems to smile at himself and the viewer as if he's saying that everything is wrong, but he's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Great line: In the scene with Victor, as Sharky throws the glove down. "They're all over people like you, and want to know the worst, they're from the state." This seems to be the biggest insult the officer can throw to a criminal. Reynolds filmed the film in Atlanta when he shot himself reading the phone book and was sure to have targeted and demographic targets. The movie marked Rachel Ward's appearance in 1981 as the New Star of the Golden Globe Year was nominated. Reynolds has always had presence and star power and decided to make films near home, Georgia. <br /> <br /> I received my DVD from half.com for $ 7.99 and unfortunately it does not contain any comments or making-of features, which is a pity. Maybe the next generation will have it. <br /> <br /> The movie is still a lot of fun and both Reynolds and Ward are great looking actors.
