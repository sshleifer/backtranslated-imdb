Darr is a brilliant movie ... It's one of my favorite movies .. SRK did a stunning job in this movie ... <br /> <br /> This role could not be played by anyone, because this type of role only fits to SRK ... <br /> <br /> SRK plays a mental villain in the movie. <br /> <br /> SRK's performance in this film is the best performance ever in Boll Wood. .. <br /> <br /> SRK deserves an honor and an encouraging call for its fantastic performance ... <br /> <br /> Juhi also offers excellent performance. <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol looked strong and physically fit in the film.
