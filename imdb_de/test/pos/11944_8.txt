Normally I have difficulty watching a TV movie, the extra-long commercial breaks slow down my concentration and I give up and find a good book. This, however, made me accept the additions and stick to the end. I know the movie is based on a true story, but it was not discovered why it took so long to find Denny? They had his name and I would accept his social security number. As he moved a lot, it seemed like finding him as soon as his number was registered for a job. The actors seemed a bit old for the role, and a buried metal object when it was dug was not rusty. These were just technical faults and not taken from the record. It was better than most for a LifeTime movie.
