Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time. Both Aamir and Salman Khan did brilliantly, while Aamir's acting was far better than Salman. Amir Khan is as' MR. PERFECTIONIST 'in Bollywood and he proves it in every one of his films. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the two young Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan), both of whom are poor families and a big dreamer. They want to get rich without being in pain. When they hear of Raveena Bajaj (Raveena Tandon) daughter of Mr. Bajaj (Paresh Rawal), who comes to India to find his groom, they both fool their fathers to marry Raveena Bajaj. The journey begins. There is also a twist in the movie that makes the movie even funnier. Paresh Rawal plays a dual role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and, as always, has done brilliantly. Shakti kapoor (crime master Gogo) also adds A great comedy. <br /> <br /> This film is a tickling, tickling comedy and one of Bollywood's classic comedy films from the first minute to the last minute.
