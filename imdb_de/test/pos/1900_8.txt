The various Law & Order and CSI franchises should be happy that Dolomite can not get through. The police, ADA's and Coroner women were intrigued and the men were subjected to such emotional shudders that slowed the speed of warp (would not you like to see David Caruso's Horatio and know all about the Hush Puppies of Dolomiti)? Ice T could cry and return to the Playa Trail. <br /> <br /> Low budget, bad but enthusiastic spectacle and a vision of what the gutbucket nightclubs offer their guests: funk bands soul singers, the last vestiges of Chitlin Circuit Entertainer's old-style (that crazy dance group) James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding and many others came to fame from these clubs while their colleagues worked in local or regional personalities. Rudy Ray Moore came from this background and the character of Dolomite is a mixture of bold black bathing pools that roam. He should not have gone to the joint, the pig had no arrest warrant, as his bubbly middle-aged middle-aged man maintained a faithful kung fu stable is a mystery that only a sect student can explain, but all that lies next to it. It's a glorious home movie by a legendary performer that leaves its mark compared to the mirrors of actors ranging from Established Hollywood to indie film snore festivals. A funny stupid movie!
