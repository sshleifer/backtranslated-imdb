A not too bad start to the series heavily laden with war propaganda, but the sincerity of Rathbone & Bruce makes me happy. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty fantastic story from start to finish, how many McGuffins are there? Holmes (and Moriarty independent), who has so quickly uncoded the Dancing Men's Code, was amazing Watson - why were not you surprised? The post that explained the bomb sight / enlarger tickled me, it was just the kind of cheap trick that Universal would play - and reminded me once again that they did not expect people to be critical of this over 60 years later. This (and I think every other potboiler from Universal at this time) should be looked at once or twice and forgotten. You might have known that people basically do not change, that what ordinary people entertained in 1942 still maintained a select group (2005) and made the script and sets more rigorous. Lionel At the time, Atwill was going through his Hollywood rape trial. I wonder if it was this or particularly effective make-up that made him look as outlandish as Moriarty. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about SW, however, is that this was the first Holmes film directed by Roy William Neill, he has directed, I believe, and produced everything except one, creating a wonderful continuity the environment was created.
