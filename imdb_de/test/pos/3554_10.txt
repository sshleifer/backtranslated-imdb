A capricious police officer suspects a French duke of being the notorious thief ARSÃˆNE LUPINE. John & Lionel Barrymore tasted for the first time a movie in this fascinating thriller. Equally and yet so different, they are the perfect counterpoint to each other. John plays his role with polite sophistication (if not in disguise) and Lionel is earthy and common in his portrayal, with everyone obviously having a wonderful time trying to play the other one. With the help of a generous script, the result is a draw, the viewer is the clear winner. <br /> <br /> Despite being staged by the two male stars, Karen Morley is intriguing when the mysterious woman who finds John naked is naked. Tully Marshall gives a colorful appearance as a stupid nobleman who has much to lose to the master criminal. Henry Armetta and George Davis are very pleased as two seriously unfit security guards. John Miljan is strongly represented in his small role as a police prefect. <br /> <br /> Film artists will spot a non-credible Mischa Auer as a leader in the Louvre during the environmental scene, which deals with an attempted theft of the Mona Lisa.
