Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us how much she hates her mother Adele (Susane Sarandon). That's how the movie starts. Adele decided that she and her daughter moved to California without asking anyone and leaving their husband for no reason. The story is about the relationship between mother and daughter. It is very deep and touching, thanks to the great work of the actresses. Natalie was nominated for this role in a Golden Globe. She's one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen, as well as Sarandon. You really look like mother daughter. The soundtrack is great too. The movie is incredible. * 10 out of 10 *
