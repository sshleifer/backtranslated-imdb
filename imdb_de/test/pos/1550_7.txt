I liked this Columbo movie somehow with its atmosphere, which was a real thriller, and its approach sometimes even reminded me of Film Noir, in the movie it was the first 30 minutes. It's really beautiful and in a good old style with the right camera angles and light. It does not immediately mean that this movie is a brilliant movie, but it is solid enough to consider this a good Late Columbo movie entry. It's definitely a better movie than the average "later" Columbo movie entry. <br /> <br /> Twenty-six years after his previous appearance in Columbo, George Hamilton returns again to play the role of murderer next to Peter Falk, of course, in a completely different and new role. I liked him in his role and he was a good "villain" from Columbo, who gave the good old lieutenant good competition. They had some nice sequences together. The problem with the "modern" new Columbo movies was always somehow that there was no known actor besides Peter Falk. This movie obviously does not suffer from this problem. But I have to say that this film does not show Peter Falk so well. He has certainly played the character better, and his performance in this film is not quite consistent enough, which is probably also due to his film Daryl Duke, who also shot the really terrible movie "Tai-Pan" among many other projects <br / > <br /> It has a pretty good and enjoyable story, but of course the fact that the same plan to cover up the murder was previously used in a previous Columbo movie does not help either. It has become accustomed to the 1975 movie "Columbo: Playback". Still, there are plenty of original "original" moments to tell, though of course every Columbo movie is more or less the same. But, well, that's what made the Columbo series so great and consistent. If it is not broken, do not fix it. <br /> <br /> It's also true that in this movie more clues than usual are left out for the lieutenant, which does not mean that the movie's murderer is stupider or sloppier, but I see it more as the authors, who are overly enthusiastic than others. It does not spoil the movie or the story, and in fact it may even be more fun to see Columbo hard at work and to discover all sorts of small but important clues. Fortunately, the film is also filled with some pleasingly effective relief options in columbo comedy. <br /> <br /> Just a good Latin American movie entry in Columbo. <br /> <br /> 7/10
