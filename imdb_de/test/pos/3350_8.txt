What can you say? This is the uncut Hardcore Musical Alice! It also works with a big, energetic cast that seems to be having fun until it stops, and while you might want a reworked version, we're lucky enough to have this video transfer in the first place. Pretty much a pleasure everywhere. There are a few moments when things go wrong, but that could have been, and is not, embarrassing. It could have been, and today the camp would have been too. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, melodic and just sexy enough. Fine appearances, especially the Kristine DeBell in the lead role and was it that a non-accredited Richard Prior as a vulnerable knight was vigorously (albeit discreet) ridden?
