Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan) is back after freeing the seas of the dreaded pirate Lo. Back on land, he is assigned to the police, where he clears up corruption and crime in a suburb. He is involved in the fate of several Chinese patriots who seek to gain sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause. The Chinese Manchu government is after these revolutionaries, and anyone who stands in their way is in trouble, even if they are with the police. I had high expectations for this movie after watching Project A. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed. Compared to the first movie, there is simply not enough action. There is only one good fight scene to the big end. This fight scene is at the "gangster site" and it's good, lots of people are flying around everywhere and bad kicks and punches are thrown. Jackie Chan and his stunt team do not disappoint here. The end is very entertaining, Jackie Chan shows us why He is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting stuff! The only bad thing in the end is that the fighting is too short and forgotten. Conclusion: many funny moments, good acting and crazy stunts. But not enough for a top rating.
