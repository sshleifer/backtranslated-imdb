David Cronenberg, like his colleague David Lynch, is an acquired taste. A director who plays with themes like reality, perversion, sex, insanity and death will inevitably get the most extreme experiences from the audience. He has proven this with films like The Fly, Naked Lunch, Crash and eXitenZ (Capital X, Capital Z) and more recently with Spider. It's best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Try not to read too much about the plot, otherwise it will be ruined for you. What I can tell you is that Cronenberg takes you on a journey into the world of video games that serves as a metaphor for any kind of fleeting behavior. To live by fantasies is something people always dream of, but how far can you go in before reality blurs and fantasy turns into a nightmare? These are the topics that are addressed in eXistenZ, an exploration of identity, the human psyche, physical bodies that invade diseases, and, above all, reality itself. <br /> <br /> The story and the direction are excellent , Cronenberg knows his craft very well and successfully brings an artificial world to life by avoiding the usual pitfalls and stereotypes of such stories. The film is pretty disgusting stuff, but is unusually restrained in the Gore department compared to Cronenberg's other work. The shock effects that he plays are never exaggerated and the plot is very intelligent and creative. It's not the most intellectual movie of all time, but you'll think about it, wonder and be pretty confused. <br /> <br /> The acting also brings two thumbs up. Both protagonists, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, play their roles perfectly and skilfully show the changing moods and identities of their character. The dialogue may seem a bit old-fashioned and clinical at times, but that's part of the effect Cronenberg sought to create a dissatisfied and unfamiliar atmosphere that worries you very much. Supporting actors such as Ian Holm, Don McKellar, and a particularly scary Willem Dafoe continues to lift the film with its disturbing, familiar performances. <br /> <br /> This movie takes some getting used to, but if you appreciate the dark tone of blood smoked pictures and an existential discarding story, you will love it.
