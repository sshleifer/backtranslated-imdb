I loved it. In fact, I have watched it over and over again and could see it again. This movie will not be boring. <br /> <br /> The vampire concept is revolutionized in this film. It's a good job that's great for the current generation. Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me anytime and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Logue offers a great comic relief. <br /> <br /> This vampire movie is like no other. I can not wait for Blade 2
