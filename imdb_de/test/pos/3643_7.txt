Based on the manga (comic) of the well-known artist Masamune Shirow, this animated feature was a bit of a disappointment to me. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but the animation is just "OK" as long as it could / should have been stunning. The film is IMO-capable, but somehow flat and uninspired, if you know what I mean. A wasted opportunity considering that Shirow's other work, Ghost In The Shell, is a classic in many ways. It set new standards for Japanese animation and produced, among other things, a brilliant series called "GiTS: Stand Alone Complex" and want it all. Take a look at the original manga, which is highly recommended.
