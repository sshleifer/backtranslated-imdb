For many years, I thought I was the only person on the planet TEMPEST had seen, and I am so glad to learn that I am not the only person who has discovered this sleeper anywhere in their cinematic effort. TEMPEST is based on the Shakespearean game and follows an architect (the late John Cassavettes in one of his best achievements) bored with his work and his crumbling marriage (with real-life husband Gene Rowlad's) deciding to say it all, we say To hell with the rat race and live with his daughter (Molly Ringwald in her film debut) and the new girlfriend Aretha (a luminous Susan Sarandon) on an island. Although Paul Mazursky is credited as a director, Cassavette's hand is seen throughout this film ... the long scenes filmed without cutting, the improvisational sense of dialogue ..., the complacent narrative style, this is definitely his show of At the beginning, at the end, and if you're not a fan of his work, the movie will be tediously boring and boring, but if you're a fan, there are rewards. Cassavettes is surrounded by a first-class cast. His scenes with Rowlands crackle intensely and his surprising chemistry with Sarandon stands in stark contrast to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in her film debut and there is a scene that stages Raul Julia as Kalibanos, the man of Cassavettes on the island. Julia stops the show in a scene with a flock of sheep dancing accompanied by Liza Minnelli, who sings "New York, New York". This movie is sad and tragic, funny and intense. Yes, it's a bit long and incoherent and it's a bit too hard to be different (there's even a curtain at the end of the movie), but it always fails to catch the attention of those who have something else in their film like filming.
