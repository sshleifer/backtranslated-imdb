I have to agree with all the previous commentators - this is simply the best of all frothy comedies, with Bardot as sexy as Marilyn Monroe ever was, and definitely a prettier face (maybe there is less mysticism, but watch Marilyn pay for it I do not think I've ever seen such a succulent looking woman on the screen, so perfect that even a gay man like myself was thrilled with it - and not just for aesthetic reasons (if the idiots are the evangelicals Really Want To achieve their "convert-a-queer" number, they really need to raise their standard, as no church mice are needed here ...) Their breasts, the rest of their character, their delightful voice, the funny way She shakes herself as she walks through a room ... just to show up in front of a man whose breasts were literally like exquisite confrontations ... I think boyer is egg one of the greatest leading men in film history. Nobody played more big female stars than he did: Garbo, Dietrich, K. Hepburn, Colbert and here Bardot, among many others. And he was also in "Fanny" with Leslie Caron and had small parts in "How to Steal Million" with A. Hepburn and in the Deneuve movie "The April Fools" (although not opposite) I can only argue that, though the loud, hideous music about the opening credits is appropriate - I mean, Bardot is not meant to be subtle about anything else, and her essential volume (I do not mean her voice) is part of her irresistible and, you might say, exemplary Charm. Vidal is handsome, even though pouting Brigitte says at the beginning, "I do not know why I'm in love with you, you're not even pretty." <br /> <br /> Dear, dear Bardot! Really one of the wonders of the 20th Century, not to mention the joy that she is still with us when so many of the truly characters pass so quickly in all their eccentric glory.
