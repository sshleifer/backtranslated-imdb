Many people make fun of Steven Seagal's acting skills. And I really understand why, if I remember Fire Down Below. Well ... ok, his other films are acceptable (as far as his acting is concerned!). <br /> <br /> After reading the reviews about The Patriot, I did not expect anything from this movie. I barely got through Fire Down Below and read a lot that the Patriot was even worse. That's why I was really surprised. In my opinion, it is one of his best films. If it had more action sequences and a few more battle scenes, it would be THE best. I liked the story of the director and the actor. Cammilla Belle was amazing. She will have a great movie career in the future. The few action scenes were very well done. And Steven Seagal believed in his unusual role.
