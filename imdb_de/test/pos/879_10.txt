An excellent thriller of all time. Vijay Anand is a director and editor. The appearances of Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove to be an asset to the film, whose script was elaborated down to the smallest detail. Cinematography contributes to the mystery, glamor and other demands of history as it develops. And the music of Sachin Dev Burman is unforgettable. "Yeh dil na hota bechara" by Kishore Kumar, "Raat akeli hai" by Asha Bhosle, "Rula ke gaya sapna mera" by Lata, "Aasman ke niche" by Lata and Rafi and "Hothon pe aisi baat main" by Lata, Once again Burman Dada confirms his unique stature as a first-class composer with his own style.
