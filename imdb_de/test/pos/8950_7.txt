When I see this kind of movie again, it's turning more and more into English humor, which has not been seen too often on screen since Monty Python and Man About The House. Too bad. <br /> <br /> Brenda Blethyn (Who I saw in Saving Grace for the first time earlier this year, someone else has to see it by the way.) It just seems that way, just like Alfred Molina. The rest of the cast, though almost unknown to me, is great performances. The movie begins slowly and gradually gains pace and pleasure - halfway I had tears in my eyes with laughter. All in all, a funny English movie, a thousand times better than the supposedly "funny" trash that comes from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
