This is a delightful movie they do not do that way. Well done by all and populated with interesting character cast members. An intelligent, witty screenplay acted with the right mix of broad comedy and unobtrusive humor. Withstands repeated (annual?) Sightseeing. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** Editing this eponymous film, directed by Arnold Whatwashethinking, is an unbearable mess - painful to look at - without a scintilla of the charm and wit of the original.
