Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's just too long and varied and cerebral to become perfectly perfect all along the line, especially as far as the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue are concerned. In every production, there are certain moments, scenes or intonations that one disapproves of. I've seen a lot of Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott and now this BBC movie with Jacobi. In terms of faithful full-length productions, this piece is considered one of the best. <br /> <br /> Most Hamlet productions are drastically reduced as the performance of the entire game requires a staging time of four to five hours. This production seems to be complete - that is, ALL original Shakespearean dialogues are intact - and is therefore essential for scholars and Shakespeare lovers. And although the lines in rare cases (for those who are less familiar with the text) seemed rushed, the script is mostly well-played, well-spoken, and well executed. Subtitles are available and very helpful, even if they occasionally lag behind. <br /> <br /> Jacobi does a pretty admirable job with the longest and impossible role of the theater. I actually cried when Hamlet died, and I do not think I've done that before. Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are outstanding, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes) and the rest of the cast. The sets are minimal, so thankfully we can focus on the game without distraction or attention to the bare necessities. <br /> <br /> With 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full length Hamlet is a long way to sitting. But if you really want it, it's 100% worth it, even if you need to take a break for yourself. I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
