I was very touched by the gentle power of this film and the mood it created. I think it should have gotten a lot more credit than it did. I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer should have been nominated, but I think all performances were outstanding and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange have portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of the sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity. Although I did not read the book, I found the modern concept of King Lear very cool. I'll never see it like this again!
