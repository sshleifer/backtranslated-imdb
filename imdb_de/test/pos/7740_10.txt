I have often heard that people were disappointed that Mazursky's "Tempest" has little to do with Shakespeare's original. In my opinion this is both true and false, but above all it is a bad starting point to offer criticism. A work of art should never be criticized for what it is not, but what it is. The movie "Tempest" is not a faithful reproduction of the play, but in my opinion, he is faithful to Shakespeare's intellectual work. What is "Tempest" is one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No, not experimentally as with hand-held cameras and mumbling dialogues, but experimentally as in the investigation of the history of a story, without taking into account the revenue of the box office. Mazursky's Tempest is epic, sad, realistic, happy, full of life, but above all, he is resourceful. Cassavete's depiction of Philip / Prospero is in itself worth a rating of 10/10, and if you look at Gena Rowlands, Susan Sarandon, a wonderfully deep Molly Ringwood, Raul Julia, the dialogue, the music and the remarkably small, scattered throughout the picture Adding tableaux ... I'm resting my case. One of the best films of the 80s. Do not miss it.
