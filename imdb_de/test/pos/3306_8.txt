Great piece that shows how the settings have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines ("Miss Bender, I do not care if you let it beat on a native drum!" Says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange asks in disbelief how she should read a book to summarize a large number of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've scanned and scanned this film on TV, and not in the letterbox version of pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics), you have not really seen it. Hopefully, this guilty pleasure of a movie will soon be available in a letterbox version and with its original 4-track stereo soundtrack on DVD. Big opening title sequence that really captures the mood of 1959 in New York, while Johnny Mathis sings the title track "Best of Everything" in an echo chamber surrounded by a violin choir and another background screamer. Miscarriage! Madness! Office romance! Bitchy cold-hearted bosses! Love foiled! It's all here to enjoy.
