slowly, but intelligently, you pass by as if you had lived it. filled with thought-provoking ideas art race and be cool. The only thing that hit me hard was the ideas about rock-and-roll lifestyles. <br /> <br /> All performances were improvised. I will say it again. ALL PERFORMANCES VALUE IMPROVED sounds like a gimmick, but it does not make these characters real and like someone you hang with. This is also an amazing thing if you think about how strong the character is in this movie. Right from the start in the title sequence, Ben is immediately classified as an outsider, moving through the crowd. <br /> <br /> Okay, it breaks down so if you're a person who lives the cool jazz / rocker lifestyle you'll like it, when your smart and big movie is understood with total crap. You'll love it, and if you both like it, you might be fav. <br /> <br />, but if you do not have any, you'll probably think it's boring and say, it does not follow "one Line "and write a crap report like Ben_Cheshire
