Tia Carrere was the reason why I decided to watch this movie because neither the title nor the cover would have been enough to interest me in spending my time and money on this film. This shows, me and all, that a DVD should not be judged by its cover. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** The movie felt like it was slipping, what is not going anywhere right now ?? The awkwardness of Paul Faber (Zak Orth) around girls is almost too embarrassing to watch, and the edge of the otherwise attractive Kirsten Beck (as Alexondra Lee) is too schoolgirl to look at. Where were the 1995 really hip? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Vicky Mueller (Tia Carrere) and Todd Boomer (Jason London) was tempting from the beginning! The first meeting over the lake? magical. What a nice coincidence they should meet again, just as he has behaved before Alexondra like an idiot ("Boomer, with two O's like in idiot ??"). It is a pity that we as an audience knew who Vicky MÃ¼ller really was. (Well, the title has betrayed that, would not you think?) <br /> <br /> What really surprised me was the acting. Especially in the scene where Vicky Todd gives a metal version of his alter ego (the dog character) in the little white jewelry box. The actors really managed to restore the tingling sensation of a first kiss. Point of no return for Todd and Vicky. Actually a shame that the film ends up in focus (after getting over Harvard's Drive Harvard's father), that he reunites with his friends. I could imagine a whole new movie? to Vicky to New York? There must be a good art university Todd could attend?!? <br /> <br /> Still a movie that does exactly what we want from Hollywood: entertainment for the duration of the movie. Has anybody noticed that none of the loved ones in this movie is happy? Todd's mother is slightly crazy (on the phone 24/7), his father does not find her attractive (more?) Todd's teacher is obviously disappointed with his wife and vice versa? Todd herself enters into a wonderfully erotic and bold relationship that, however nice it may be, would be realistically very difficult to maintain (age difference, maturity gap, etc.), and Alexondra and Zak will not get together because Alexondra is not mature enough to dealing with a relationship (-> their reactions to the condom, cheating, Zak's advances, etc. are all very immature and often include running away), and Zak himself, the poor guy? is too much of a best friend / like a brother who pulls himself Alexondra. <br /> <br /> Mind you, good movie! I gave it a 8/10. Brilliant performance of the actors - bringing the script to life.
