"Beep Beep" by Chuck Jones (so called, though the Road Runner clearly says "Meep Meep") is the second of the hugely popular Road Runner series and a tremendous improvement over its predecessor, the historically important but little smooth "Fast and 'Furry'. While offering several predictable fast-fire gags, 'Beep Beep' expands the original cartoon with more ambitious, longer sequences. Among them is a fantastic, advanced hunt through an old mine, where the Coyote and the Road Runner are represented by two small lights. There is also a very funny longer gag with some rocket-driven roller skates. 'Beep Beep' also sees a big improvement in the performance of Wile E. Coyote. He not only looks prettier than his wobbly prototype in "Fast and Furry-ous", he also draws the audience into the cartoon with a greater number of glances into the camera, to the brilliance of his idea or his fear of impending appearance to clarify pain. Although it's a bit slow to get started (too many adjustments of blueprints hinder the pace in some of the early gags), once 'beep beep' arrives in the mine shaft sequence, it's clear that Jones has now got these characters really under control the bigger options, what he could do with it. There are better road runner cartoons than "beep beep", but there is a real sense of triumph over this cartoon, as if it were confirmation that a series should be milked out of this scenario.
