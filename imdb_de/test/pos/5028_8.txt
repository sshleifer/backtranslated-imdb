That pretty much sums it up ... cheesy. MacDowell's inability to act can be painful at times, and Hurt needs to spend some money to play those subdued roles, but I enjoyed it anyway. <br /> <br /> Why? In a word, Travolta. He is great in this movie. Although I can not over-estimate the movie, it certainly deserves more than it seems.
