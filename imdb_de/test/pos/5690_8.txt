As a child, I loved the song "Never smile at a crocodile" and when I was in that state that was actually inspired by true events. Smile would be the last thing that came to my mind. From the beginning, I've never been so entrenched, exhausted and exhausted as I was when I saw this independent Australian horror movie on a budget. Three people in the Northern Territory were waiting in a mangrove swamp with a very exciting crocodile in the water below them. What really brought the film to life was how realistic it was to convey the fear and uncertainty of the character situation to the audience. The documentary camera work with a restless, eerie backdrop and authentic performances effectively brings you out of your comfort zone. What we get is a story about a patient's survival, not just a bloody creature. Think of "Open Water (2003)", where the budget and time constraints kept it unobtrusive, but this minimal barrier increased the experience. <br /> <br /> The slow story may be black white, but it never seemed to be available or succumb to formula patterns. Well, not big, and the connection between the characters was emotionally connected even with a mere, straightforward script. One can say, "less is more," and the deeds and expressions that illuminate the lingering thoughts torment their minds. The ordeal is terrifying because the threat is very much alive and never seems to relax. This is what drives the chaotic adrenaline of the movie and in which it lasts to the end (even if it is buried). <br /> <br /> Writers / Directors Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich's economic guidance alienate and resonate with the observer with his taut and shocking psychological traits. For certain patches, the notch increases with pressure-induced tension and stunning images. The way the night sequence is executed is immensely cool and pulsating. The threatening crocodile manipulation toy with its fresh meat in a depressingly exciting way. Sure, some moments felt unlikely, but they never bother or distract. Sound FX is the key, and sometimes that does not eat you. Rafeal May's music score is modest and does not add much to the mix, but when it does, it creates an organic-sounding quality. The cinematography of John Biggins is beautiful and quickly becomes aggressive as the mood changes. It was always on the move and claustrophobic, but none of these jerky movements. The editing was spiky, and the effects were professionally ensured by the first-class combing of live crocodile material. <br /> <br /> Something like this production should also rely on the cast to credibly sell the story, and they do it. Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda and especially Maeve Dermody are convincingly good. Much of the responsibility lies with Dermody, and it delivers heavily with an inspired turnaround. Now this article may make some comparisons to another killer crocodile movie "Rogue (2007)", but the two could not differ in their what and how they want to be. However, if I had to choose, I tend more to this trip, because he should stop by his mere participation in you. <br /> <br /> A remarkable effort on all fronts, where everyone involved has the potential to really pay attention.
