For those who appreciate the interface between silent movie and social commentary, this is a unique movie. The film is a tribute to German Expressionism, an allegory. The film is full of visual symbolism and an artistic style that is in no way inferior to anything he has seen since the 1920s. In addition, attention to details of the time and the visual composition of the scenes as a tool for advancing the story is stunning. Apart from that, the story offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its impact on the social voice, perception and opinion. In truth, it is not so much the silence that permeates the film as the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thoughts that inevitably follow. All in all, this movie is something that is not often seen. As the producer of the film said in the following questions and answers, you will think about its meaning until the next few days.
