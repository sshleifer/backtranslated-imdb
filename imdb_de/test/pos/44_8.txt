Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy raised by rather unusual people in a house. <br /> <br /> The editing and soundtrack really pull you into the story and let you experience the movie as the author really wanted to be seen. <br /> <br /> The music is really involved in the story that brought the characters to life. Through the editing, the story became more progressive and captivating. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by some performances of the cast, especially by S. Epatha Merkerson. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see the one-man show with these movies writer, Ruben Santiago-Hudson.
