(Some Corruptors) Faced with a mid-life crisis and his marriage to Cindy, Teddi Siddall, tired of saying more about what he did and where he stayed than the Air Force, USAF elite Red Beret Sgt Major Davis Bay, Gary Cole, decided one morning to just go away and start a new life as a civilian. <br /> <br /> David had this idea for the first time when he met at a Halloween party that loved Alyson and Karen Sillas. Hiding his background by telling Alyson that he was in a top-secret military outfit was the perfect cover for him. Back at Jackson AFB outside of Austin Tex. David begins to examine the options of his life with Cindy and the USAF and decides to change his identity by fleeing from it. David then calls Alyson, who only met him once, and makes an appointment with her. Before you know it, David, who now uses the name Haywood, is betrothed to be married to her. <br /> <br /> When Dave fakes his death in a bicycle accident, Dave purposely leaves his wife and children in the cold, forcing his military to join his country. It was not long before Dave found out that civilian life did not appeal to him. It is now too late for Dave to return to his first wife, Cindy, and his two boys, facing jail and a court martial if he returns to the USAF. Dave accepts the only work he could do to support him and Alyson and her young son Chris: he used his skills learned in the Red Berets to rob banks. Based on a true story, "Lies He Told," Dave Bay / Haywood has three, not two, different lives. One of a hard-working family man as a ruthless bank robber and another as dead and highly decorated, by the US President and Prime Misnister Of GB, an all-American hero. Gary Cole is very effective as both Master Sgt. David Bay & husband David Haywood. David's actions, though unforgivable, are understandable in the case of his depression because of his marriage to Cindy. The pressure of her grumbler came to the point where he just got lost and wanted to get away from her and the children. But he would have had to get professional advice from the US Air Force on what he wanted instead of choosing the easy way out. Which in the end led him straight to Levenworth Ferderal Prison. Maybe overzealous macho Dave thought it was a bad sign for his career and his ego to get help for his problems. Karen Sillas as Alyson is the putty He holds the film together with her and first explains that his new husband has disappeared frequently, some even for two weeks. He is taking covert measures to protect the country from domestic and foreign terrorists. The real reason for his long absences was the result when he planned and robbed banks. Only then did he know how to make a living out of what he had learned in subversive actions over the years in the elite Red Berets. Alyson visits Dave's mother Carolyn Bay (Linda Goranson) In Portland, she learns the truth about the double or triple life he has led since his marriage. As a result, Alyson learned of his marriage to Linda and the two sons he had with her, as well as his fake death and now AWOL from the USAF. Since this is a true story, the end was everything you would have expected in a normal Hollywood or TV movie. This makes the movie "Lies he Told" much better than what you would expect.
