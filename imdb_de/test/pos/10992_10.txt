"Manna From Heaven" is a delightfully captivating film. Within the changing paradox of middle-class American values ​​from 40 years ago to present, in the storyline the concerns and hopes of an interesting area are being ameliorated by Damon Runyonesque's characters. <br /> <br /> Her struggles with moral dilemmas that could have been "What could have been" hope that teen dreams and romantic yearnings will be fulfilled and "Hit it big" will join together the most entertaining movie. Rather than relying on sexual explanations, the growing relationship between Inez and Mac / Bake is classically subtle, but clear. His release of the knot in her laces in the Art Gallery and her heat in her poker game are outstanding. <br /> <br /> The crisp writing of the script is skilfully interpreted by an outstanding star and a minor cast. One of the few films I ever saw twice in the first round, "Manna From Heaven" definitely guarantees national distribution. Conrad F. Toepfer
