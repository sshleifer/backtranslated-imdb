I like Tom Hanks and he's one of the few actors who will pull me into the theater regardless of my concerns about the movie. I was worried that Mr. Hanks would return to "easy comedy" as he made the transition from television to film in this arena - remember "Big"? Well, "Charlie Wilson's War" is not an easy comedy. It's a political satire and a very well written political satire. The script is the star of the film, and Aaron Sorkin's wordsmith is one of the best on offer this year. Mike Nicols holds the entire escapade together and delivers a movie that carries a very fast 90 minutes (timing is everything in the comedy, and nothing is funny when it drags). Nicol's choice of sets and lighting is also reminiscent of 1970's and 80's TV, a deliberate move to root the piece in one period. <br /> <br /> The return to modeling and archival photography by Digital special effects also enhance the retro look and credibility. Note for the production designer in the selection of footage: I know the difference between an F-16 and a MiG and a Bell and a Hind. But maybe that was part of the joke, too. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in Philadelphia. It was interesting to watch and listen to the audience, NOT to get the historical references to their own story. The story repeats because the recidivists have forgotten what happened the first time. Kudos to both Mr. Hanks and the chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman. Sorkin's script is brought to life by these actors, and the entire production team is at the very top of the game. <br /> <br /> Recommended by heart.
