The fire gives everything ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the film's masterful meditations on art. It originated in nineteenth-century Korea and tells the story of the famous painter Ohwon. However, instead of sticking to a cheeky anecdote, melodrama, or psychological egg hunt, it presents a series of episodes of his life, all of which are wonderful works of art. There is no interpretation of these episodes, but leaves it to the viewer to think along with the pictures of Ohwon himself. In this way, the viewer goes into the same kind of contemplation as Ohwon, and without his talent, he can feel "in" the inspiration of his paintings. <br /> <br /> One reason why this is so effective is the absolute masterful allusion to nineteenth-century Korea and the musical / artistic world Ohwon moved into. Outside of the images, there are so many great shots in the world that we get a mirror effect of seeing the beautiful world that inspires Ohwon, Ohwon to live and look. This world and the artworks he creates reflect each other. The story is told with extreme economy. A feeling that is evoked is barely present or explained, it just seems to be fast, then it vanishes for the next one. As an analogy, this is a kind of Mozart work of art (endless and rapid succession of great ideas) and not Beethovinian (obsession remains a great idea). It has a classic restraint, much like Ohwon's pictures. There is really no music that conveys the feeling, except for some classical Korean pieces that are used in several scenes (and mostly by characters of the movie) with great effectiveness. If I recall correctly, there is a haunting image of a flock of birds flying over the blue mountains while a singer whirs. <br /> <br /> "This life is like a dream and only death will awaken us" <br /> <br /> One of the advice of Ohwons teachers in the film is that "the painting lies between the lines ". The film follows this attitude, since so much matter is between what is spoken and described in the film *. I have seen it twice and it was very rewarding at the second viewing. A very tight movie with little hidden explanation. You can see how it is in the 96th film of Im. It is an artistic masterpiece. As Ohwon's great friend and mentor tells him in one of his pictures, "Not a single blow is wasted." <br /> <br /> I compare it with Andrei Rubylev in quality, though it is very different in style. It's much easier and more directly entertaining to watch, but classic in the form in which Andrei is gothic. All in all, highly recommended for just about everyone except appetite junkies. Both times, when I left the film, I felt a wonderful spiritual renewal. <br /> <br /> One point in Ohwons life I had invaded was that his insane drinking and swarming began suddenly after visiting the nobleman who told him that "good art can only come out great knowledge and learning. "The next short scene in which Ohwon was was very angry, and the next damned drunk, as he often stayed for the rest of the movie. I'm curious why the noble words influenced him so much and drove to the drinking that dominated the rest of his life. Or was it just a coincidence?
