Before I saw the preview of Angels & Demons today, I've eliminated my uncertainties that might keep me from enjoying them. the enormous hatred against Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because the name of Dan Brown is tapped on all the posters. I was open-minded and expected the worse, but instead I got a two-and-a-half-hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that's definitely a good entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The film hangs loosely from the actual novel itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) flies to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and re-election by the papal conclave. All this is arranged by Carmelengo Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon learns of a new threat in which a secret brotherhood announces its presence, an anti-antimatic time bomb that is now targeting the Vatican City, and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, who uses his intellect (and trust me, you hear a lot of it), is given the task of finding and saving you with the help of the mysterious path of enlightenment. Helping him with the search is the CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also a co-creator of antimatter. <br /> <br /> The film itself is uneven. In a minute, Langdon and the Swiss Guard rouse a branded cardinal, the next minute he bores you with meaningless information about every random object he passes, apparently slowing down the highly anticipated action / thriller sequences of the book. It's an interesting read on paper, but on the screen it can go both ways. <br /> <br /> The characters are discreetly written on the big screen. Ewan McGregor convinces as a calm but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna with a famous accent. Tom Hanks has been a bit more agile, intellectual, and physical since his recent performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his nor Ayelet Zurer's achievements are worthwhile, and rather than being involved in the story, they are simply thrown away as assets. <br /> <br /> Angels & Demons accomplishes what DVC could never do. an exciting, fast-paced movie full of satisfying explosions, beautiful replicas of St. Peter's Square and the basilica (including many churches) and a pulsing bomb that counts the midnight hour. Ron Howard does a decent job of directing this second Langdon adventure, this time taking a lot of criticism and almost (almost) exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases. <br /> <br /> While newcomers can speak of a "National Treasure 3" that poses a much greater threat, there are still plenty of contagious suspense / thriller feasts and ingenious statues of Rome to inhale. Fans of the book The drastic changes in the films may feel different, but given the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it creates, A & D is extremely well suited to keeping the viewer on screen, not on the sleepy shoulder. <br /> <br /> A good book to film adaptation that is both attractive and entertaining. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10
