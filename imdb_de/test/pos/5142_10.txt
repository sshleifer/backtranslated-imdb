If you read the book by Carl Hiaasen, the film follows pretty closely, with a few minor changes for Hollywood. In my opinion, this is a great family movie. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) steals the show from an all-star cast that includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The kids in the movie do a great job, led by Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley. <br /> <br /> Brie Larson may be a bit too small to play Beatrice. I imagined a taller girl, maybe 6 feet in the role of Beatrice. That might have made her more credible because she beat Dana. They should have developed their "tough girl" character stronger and let themselves be bitten by a tire or kick a football through a person. She is very pretty, and I understand why she was occupied, she is an attraction at the box office. <br /> <br /> It's like a PG is getting a movie these days, no sex and very little violence. This film is a true parenting dream, a film with a strong environmental message, with children who have deep appreciation for the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. It shows how adults committed the responsibility of our planet and that our children can demand better. One of my favorite lines in the movie is, if Mullet Fingers says, "Florida could use some mountains like Montana, Florida is so shallow that there's nothing that can stop developers from clearing the coast from coast to coast." The wildlife photography of Florida also spoke volumes without dialogue. As a family movie with children aged 5-15, this is a great movie! As a bonus, the parents are entertained, especially if it is "Parrotheads".
