*** SPOILERS *** For some strange reason, Oliver Stone's "Talk Radio," based on Stephen Singular's "Talked to Death" and movie star Eric Bogosian, has never been talked about the murder of Denver Bergshaus Alan Berg (1984) the recognition that deserved to be earned. The film of 1988 was prophetic enough to recognize the underground movement that was developing in the farm and inland America. A movement that spawned some seven years later, such as the angry and angry Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh, who hatred the US government's actions in Wacco, Texas, leads to his friend Terry Nichols, who sustained the detonation of the US Federal Building in Oklahoma City On 19 April 1995, 168 people were killed, which was the worst act of terrorism on American soil to date. <br /> <br /> The film is, as far as I know, the first time that a large branch of entertainment media mentioned and executed the rural militia novel "The Turner Diaries" by the late William L. Pierce. this has become a refreshing underground classic. "The Turner Diaries" predicted a domestic and utterly catastrophic terrorist attack, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, on a US government agency that was the FBI building in Washington DC Eric Bogosian, Champlain, is the top rated show in the Dallas listening area and is now close to the national competition. Barry gets his high rating by his razor-sharp wit and abusive behavior when he's in the air. To accept all people and not to cause any problems, no matter how unpopular or taboo they are, has made Barry the most heard and hated man on the radio. Barry, who is a showman at heart and does not believe that his talk can lead to violence, maintains his distaste for his call-in listeners as his rating reaches into the cell. But there are those who are in the circle of listeners, mostly right-wing extremist types who do not allow themselves to be over-distracted by their facial attitude. One of them decides to take matters into his own hands at the expense of Barry. <br /> <br /> Powerhouse performance by Eric Bogosian as tragic Barry Champlain, who has crossed the line between entertainment and hard reality in his radio actions. He thinks that he is not so important as to be wanted for his on-air opinions and murdered. Enemies do not like that. He learned too late that there are those out there who are crazy enough to attack him from the outside. Also in the movie "Talk Radio" is a very young Alic Baldwin as Barry's boss Dan trying to temper him, but in the end he fits in with his talk show style as he kills the competition and does not realize he is it is ultimately that he is killed in the end. <br /> <br /> Both Ellen Green and Leslie Hope are the two women in Barry's life, his former wife Ellen and now the lover and talk show producer Laura, who uses Barry to his advantage and almost loses both in the defeat same time. The 1988 movie "Talk Radio" is so ahead of its time that even if you look at it now in 2005, you still think it's too disturbing to be shown to a hypersensitive and sensitive American audience.
