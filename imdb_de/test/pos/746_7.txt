DO NOT LOOK AHEAD This little forgotten pearl has a special place in my heart and in the video list of nasties. The flute sitar rattle box soundtrack is classic. The main character, though much hotter than most low-budget starlets, is a pretty normal low-budget lead. The Doctor Masters character is well written and well played. Some of the smaller characters are somehow stupid, but they add to the film's nostalgia. It's Campy. I'm not trying to lie. The character that makes it great is a lazy-clan man-child named Sam, one of the patients in this crazy sanatorium. The blood is pretty normal, though I find that the color of the blood is great. It's like that .. Red. I think this movie was badly received because of its advertising efforts. A soulless, little advertising expert got his grubby hands and thought, "Let's rip the AD campaign for Last House on the Left, that's fine." Such little idiots have ruined the world of film. All balls and no brain. The editor may or may not have been an alcoholic. Maybe all drunk there. You will see what I mean. Another little note. Do not buy this from the Wally Mart Dollar Rack. They have brought it to an unsurpassed level. Try to find the longest cut you can.
