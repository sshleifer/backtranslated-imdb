A very good movie that focuses on a very important topic. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is completely preventable. If more families saw this movie, maybe more children would not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits plays in one of his best roles. This is a great movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is no different than the thousands of families that exist in the United States today. There are children who fight with this world. The really important point here is that everything could have been prevented. More people should watch this movie and take what they have to say. It's done well, with important messages handled in an elegant way.
