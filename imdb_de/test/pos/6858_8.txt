This is a great German Slasher who is often quite exciting and creative, with a funny story and solid performances. All the characters are cool and Benno Fürmann is great as a psycho-killer, and Franka Potente gives a fantastic performance as the lead role. It took a while to get started, but it never got boring and there were also some good death scenes, and the music is wonderfully scary. I was lucky enough to get the subtitle version instead of the dubbing, and I thought all the characters were pretty likable, and it's very well done and well written. It also has some really good plot twists, and the effects are extremely well done, and the end is great. The finale is particularly exciting and Franka Potente was in my opinion the perfect casting choice. I also wished that Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey (David) was not killed so quickly because he was a really cool character. There were actually a few moments when I felt uncomfortable, but in a good way, and I have to say that this movie deserves all he deserves. He also has a lot of holes, but it's not enough to obstruct the movie. This is a great German Slasher who is often quite exciting and creative, with a funny story and solid performances. I recommend this a lot! The direction is great! Stefan Ruzowitzky makes a great! Here you work with excellent camera work, very good viewing angles, great close-ups (see the opening sex scene), doing a great job by adding a spooky atmosphere, and only keeping the movie at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There is a good deal of blood and blood. We have carcasses cut open, many bloody operation scenes, many bloody stings, people are dissected in consciousness, severed finger, self-mutilation, gutting, bloody neck, many evil looking frozen corpses, lots of blood and much more. <br /> <br /> The Acting is very solid!. Franka Potente is fantastic as a lead actress, she was very personable, was left under pressure, was vulnerable, easy on her eyes and we can take care of her character. The only time she seemed to suffer was when she had to do a few bad dialogues here and there, but that was not very often, she was wonderful! Benno Fürmann is excellent as a psycho killer, he was just chilled and wonderful OTT, he really made me goose bumps and was an effective killer! Anna Loos played her role very well, as the smart bitch, I dug her. Sebastian Blomberg was great here as Caspar, he was quite likeable and had a mysterious character, his chemistry with Potente was also active, and in the end there were big twists in which he was involved. Holger Speckhahn was good as idiot Phil and did a good job. Traugott Buhre is good as Prof. Grombek. Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey was great as David, he had a really cool character and I wish he was not killed so fast. The rest of the cast works well. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can only highly recommend this great German Slasher. *** 1/2 out of 5
