I have never read a good review for "Vanity Fair" and can not understand why. For something that was "blown out in ten days," everything is amazingly good. Admittedly, "Becky Sharp" is a better movie and Miriam Hopkins a better Becky, but there's nothing that can stop this movie from a solid 9/10. Sometimes Myrna Loy just seems too cute and nice to play a bitch, but sometimes she just has to squeeze her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. Meow! Switching to a more modern environment did not work against Vanity Fair, and the only thing that really leads to conflict is casting. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was less than five meters tall, and some of the leading men were very tall too - all this came together to make Loy look like an absolute Amazon woman. <br /> <br /> "Vanity Fair" is similar to "Craig's Wife", no matter how bad the main character is, you have to love her. And you know that she deserves her comeuppance, and more, but she still feels sorry when she gets it. Although this version is based on the same story as "Becky Sharp," this version had a different ending, which is interesting because most of the other films were almost identical. In terms of enjoyment, the end of "Becky Sharp" is ultimately more pleasing, if aesthetically pleasing, and from the flow of the story there is no doubt that the end of "Vanity Fair" is the better, whether you really like it or not it.
