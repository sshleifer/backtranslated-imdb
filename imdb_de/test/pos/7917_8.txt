"Alexander Nevsky" marked the return of director Sergei Eisenstein after a period of exile to filmmaking, and he produced a propaganda film that proclaimed Russia's superiority over Germany unite to fight Germans; Russia wins. The film is indeed an expanded montage of mostly battle scenes, mixed with a few moments of German brutality (like a rather shocking scene in which German soldiers throw Russian children into a blazing fire). This was Eisenstein's first sound film, and it is clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium. In fact, this movie looks more like a silent movie with some sound added to it. There are some dialogue scenes, but they are rather lifeless on the screen and the tempo is as if the actors were not on the set at the same time as they were filming them. Eisenstein uses the sound mainly as an excuse to put a rousing Prokofiev score on the process, and this is indeed one of the film's biggest assets actor or tell his film in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how he pictures and Music is edited together for maximum effect, and "Alexander Nevsky" shines through all the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Note: A
