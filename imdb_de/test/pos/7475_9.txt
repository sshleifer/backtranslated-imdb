I turned to this movie in the middle of the night and nearly skipped it. Just because there was nothing else, I decided to look at it. In the end, I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> An interesting plot, good characters, a clever script and a brilliant directing make this movie a good movie you can just watch. This was indeed the first time I had heard about this movie, but I would have been happy to have paid money to see it in the movies. <br /> <br /> My IMDB rating: 8 out of 10 <br />
