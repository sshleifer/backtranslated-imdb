Once the slow start sets in, the movie starts and makes a lot of fun in many unexpected ways. The cast of the ensemble is really good, with Heather Graham being perhaps the weakest of them. Casey Affleck as her brother is really good and extremely sympathetic when you notice my drift. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the movie if you just want to have good hours. Teenagers should really enjoy this movie - it says a lot about relationships.
