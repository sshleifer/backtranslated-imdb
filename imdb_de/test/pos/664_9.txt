STMD! is one of the funniest and most enjoyable low-budget movies I've seen in quite a while. Director Jeff Smith (who also co-wrote, cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love for undervalued horror movies of the 80s with this movie! If you love the cheese dairy, the absurd situations, the crazy and stereotypical characters of the 80s horror movies, you will love this ambitious homage to the past. STMD! definitely matches the qualities described in the poster and then some. It has all the "excessive force" and "unfounded nudity" reminiscent of the entertaining horror movies of the 80s that we all love. I had a great time seeing STMD! From the outfits of the 80s, which carry the stereotypical characters to the blood spatter, to stupid tone, I just could not get enough!
