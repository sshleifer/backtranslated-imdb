This is an absolute must in the Hitchcock tradition. They are kept in the dark while suspects come and go. Dennis Quaid is like Dexter, a man sentenced to die, and Meg Ryan named as his baby. There is not much to like in this little tension and all the pieces fit together as they should. You will not be sorry that you have seen them, if you like tension.
