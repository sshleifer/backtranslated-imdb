I rate these 8 based on the premise of the movie. The acting was fine, there was no one who stood out as amazing or horrible. It is worrying that intelligent people are getting fewer or fewer children ... while the silent "W in '04" followers are evolving like rabbits. And although I do not believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years, I see the parodied prophet of Mike Judge as a life-like art. The world is ruled by idiots, and it gets worse when the intelligent, free-thinking people become a minority and the "git 'he's done" fans are superior. The proof is our farce of choice. <br /> <br /> But I digress. If you are lucky enough to play this in your city, look at it. I paid my popcorn for $ 7.50 to see FAR WORSE garbage (Date Movie or Napoleon Dynamite anyone?). There are laughter, there are wreaths, but overall that's entertaining. If you have half a brain, you'll think how this movie, though funny, is accurate and a little scary. I'm not at all surprised that this movie is virtually unknown, because Fox was the one who distributed this and they would not want any of their sheep to see this and say, "Maybe I'll read a book and not watch" Next 'or' cheat 'or' my balls'. "If our society does not stop the mute of everything and the bastardization of the English language (er, Mr. Bush), then we'll really move on.
