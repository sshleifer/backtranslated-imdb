Lang makes Hawks as well as Hawks in the first part of this extraordinary Western, before settling for the final in the typically deterministic, dark and guilty Lang. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that show its size almost immediately but at the same time very subtle. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is on horseback and is persecuted, we do not know why - he stumbles over the wounded Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his weapon and his horse, but to discover that Creighton is doing badly he decides to fix him first. This is mainly mediated by facial expressions and very short, cropped dialogues - in two minutes we know that Shaw is an outlaw, but basically a good guy. Shaw helps Creighton on his way to civilization and then disappears. <br /> <br /> A few weeks or months later, with Creighton on the run and an expedition laying westbound telegraph wire from Omaha. He hires Shaw as Boy Scout trying to leave when he finds out Creighton has the responsibility. but Creighton still wants him to repay a debt and feel some quality. Also employed is a tender foot, the son of a benefactor of the project, but atypical of the Easterner Richard Blake (Robert Young) is quite competent, as he immediately shows in an amusing, but exciting, grumpy sequence. Both hires vie for Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), who is again not typically able to look after herself like any other man. The camaraderie between the three men, the comedic elements that include a reluctant cook and various raucous tumblers, and the beautifully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the movie and remind me more of Howard Hawk's "Red River" or "Only" Angels Have Wings "as most Lang - but they are so well played and the action is so natural that it does not matter and does not change our enjoyment - if it changes our expectations - as the more common Langian themes of The Enchanted Past, Dark Secrets and the immense train of lighter, destructive, and evil ways dominate the later part of the film, Shaw's old friends come back to chase him as the wagon train and its wires move westward, attacking the crew, and Shaw has to go with the fight what he tells Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade, Anf should stirrer of Outlaws tell. <br /> <br /> The early Technicolor, which moves quite seamlessly from the soundstage to the western locations, is easily Lang's best western movie and one of his best movies for my money. He conveys, like each of his films, the tragic inability of men to escape their past and to make a movie about the future. Scott is as good as I've seen him, with a wink he shows more than many actors in a paragraph section and the rest of the cast is consistently alright. The inevitable showdown between Shaw's criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary and a surprise even to a longtime long devotee like me; and even in 1941, there seems to be no place where more importance can be found on the fringes of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside. You can shave, you can feel like a new man, but you can never really be one, as long as the old ties are still holding you back. <br /> <br /> Genius.
