I saw this movie recently at a 3D Hollywood film festival. It was in polarized 3D optics (gray glasses not red & blue). It was a lot of fun watching this movie in front of an audience. The print was excellent and the 3D quality perfect. The performances were over the top and that added to the fun, the surprising ending (which we're not supposed to share with other movie actors, at least according to the trailer and the poster) had made people laugh. By today's standards, this is probably more comedy than horror, but with the extra dimension of 3-D (complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen), this movie was an entertaining trump in the '50s horror.
