This short, formal cartoon with Pepe Le Pew concerns a cat who believes she can solve all problems by pretending to be a skunk. The only problem is that he attracts the most unwelcome attention of an honest and honest skunk (our hero Pepe, who is leaving the stage), who is decidedly more attentive, say, than Mr. Cat wants it. Every great plan has its drawbacks, but this is a corker! I wonder if Jack Warner got a call from the Hays office because Pepe and the object of his worship were both male. After all, Betty Boop was co-responsible for the emergence of the production law. Subsequent "conquests" were definite and definitely female. Very good cartoon, but Pepe is a figure that works better as a focal instead of supporting them. It is worth seeing. Recommended.
