I think it was Fran√ßois Truffaut who said that the best films are either the joy of filmmaking or the torture of films. This strip is definitely of the first type. Tromeo and Juliet are a pleasure from beginning to end. The crazy zeal of this Shakespearian shenanigan is contagious. I do not think I have laughed so much since I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It is so good!
