What a bumble bee looks like Porky's rip-off turns out to be a pretty touching film about being young and in love. <br /> <br /> The story is about three friends, Gary, Ricky and David's school hours looking for sex. When a new girl arrives in town, Gary falls head over heels in love with her. <br /> <br /> The movie turns from a dodgy sex movie to a study of youthful insecurities. It is funny and sad at the same time. There is never the love story formula that plays a prominent role in any movie. They know that the guy meets a girl, a guy loses a girl, a guy gets a girl back in the final frame formula. This formula is thrown aside after a man has met a girl. Maybe that's why I liked the movie so much. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is especially good and the end is definitely a tearful. It could also be one of the most realistic endings I've ever seen in a love story. <br /> <br />
