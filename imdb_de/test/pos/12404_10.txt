I recently rented this video after seeing "Final Ascent" by the same author. I was not prepared for how intense this movie would become. I found it appealing from start to finish and wanted the teens to get away with their attempted crime. The ending was definitely troubling with some implied acts of violence, but succeeded well. I highly recommend this picture.
