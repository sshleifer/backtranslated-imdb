There are so many "10 Best" lists that could easily fit "The Dead" - best drunken screen, best literary adaptation, best use of music that was not written specifically for the film, best use of poetry, best screen language , best ensemble cast and finally maybe the best movie ever. This was John Huston's latest and greatest film, adapted by his son Tony from the short story by James Joyce and shown on the evening of the Epiphany Festival in Dublin in 1904. He is largely confined to a place where the home of the Morkan sisters is, and not much in a conventional "dramatic" sense. They entertain their guests. There is singing, dancing, reciting and a lot of small talk, but if you watch this movie, you can not imagine anywhere else than you would be in this company. <br /> <br /> After all, of course, it's about much, much more. It's about love, loss and regret, these sturdy mainstays of a great drama. In the closing scenes of the film, tenor Bartell D'Arcy (Frank Patterson) sings a song "The Lass of Aughrim" that conjures up in the minds of Gretta (Anjelica Huston), wife of Gabriel, (Donal McCann). the spirit of her first and probably greatest love, a boy who died with a certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen, and suddenly Gabriel realizes that he has never really known his wife and that he was not the great love of her life , At long last. Emotionally, these scenes are incredibly powerful. First, Gretta tells the circumstances of her lover's death and then, as the voice in Gabriel's head summarizes his own feelings. This is a great movie theater, the monologues that Huston and McCann delivered superbly. <br /> <br /> But then all the performances are extraordinary. This is an ensemble of the highest order, and though it would be rude to pick one actor over another, the screen has ever given us a more likable, ingenious or convincing drunk than Donal Donnelly, or has ever delivered poetry with such passion that Sean McClory (p. the IRA man in "The Quiet Man") introduces Lady Gregory's translation of "Donal Og" here? Another peculiarity is, of course, the knowledge that Huston himself was close to death when he made this film, which seems to me to be the culmination of his life's work. Death may be its central theme, but watching this movie is a life-sustaining experience.
