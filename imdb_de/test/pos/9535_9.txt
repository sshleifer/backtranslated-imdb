This brings back so many childhood memories. (I'm not old, I'm 19) It's brilliant. The trains, the old house, the fallen runner, the really fearsome landslide (well, when you're 6 years old), the drama, when the kids can stop the train, or will the train crash? This is undoubtedly a children's movie, but it offers great harmless behavior to children, no blood / guts / guns, etc. And it has Bernard Cribbins in it, which is cool. 8.10
