I just looked up "Who will love my kids" to buy when I came across this website and made a post from a British !! I'm a big fan of this movie and would have recommended it to everyone. What has calmed me is to find someone else who finds comfort in the good will of others. I also have a son with Aspergers (among others) and it is also a fear of me to think if anything has happened to me and my husband that someone wants to accept not only my beautiful "normal" daughter, but my special and gifted son also. Being at home and being able to engage with people who grew up with the same values ​​as me is more important than you know. I live here in the USA and have never met anyone who has seen this movie. So if you've read this all, try to do that. It is a very moving experience, especially for anyone who is a parent, or even if you only have a sympathetic bone in your body, you will cry and beg. After that you will count your blessings, and to anyone who has ever had an experience like or near this, my heart will come to you. It makes me realize that no matter how hard or stressful something gets, just remember there's always someone worse off than you. An amazing movie, and what makes it even stronger, is the fact that it's on one true story based. Do not be put off by how sad it is. At the same time, this film is heartwarming and you feel encouraged by the strength and goodness of humanity.
