Michael Radford has done a great job bringing this difficult game to the screen. He has taken on a spectacle of anti-Semitism and has shown us that Shakespeare knew the humanity of the Jews very well. Radford said after the show, and I agree that Shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be withdrawn from a driving compulsive need for revenge. He also rightly points out that a man who was anti-Semitic could not write Shylock's speech: "If you stab me, am I not bleeding?" Radford is of Jewish descent and has selected the good and the bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty. No character is free from mistakes. No character is evil. Radford set the piece in the 16th century, which provides a lush background of Venetian politics and decadence, to which Shakespeare's words can be projected. <br /> <br /> If you get the opportunity to hear Radford talk about the film, I am very thankful to recommend it because it conveys details of 16th century Venice life, many of them illuminate his decisions and give the consideration a considerable additional depth. I hope that the DVD will be published with detailed comments. Jeremy Irons makes a wonderful account of Antonio, a man who resigns himself to carrying the burden of his past misdeeds. Lynn Collins, a relatively unknown, gives us as Portia an absolutely flawless, dazzling and detailed task. Not only is Ms. Collins beautiful - she also gives Portia layers of intelligence and humor before the process scene that I've seldom seen in a production of this piece. The rest of the cast also do a great job, with a notable performance by Kris Marshall as Gratiano and a wonderfully subtle work by Allan Corduner as Tubal, who plays the foil to Shylock. Finally, while Al Pacino gets his usual strong (and loud) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he does not say words, but you can see all the emotions and insane moves that flow in and out of him while he is perceiving His fortune is changing. <br /> <br /> If you like historical films, I can not recommend this movie enough.
