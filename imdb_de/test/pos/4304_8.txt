This is my favorite columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) Plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning does not indicate who you did it to! Peter Falk is as usual in this episode of Steven Bochco (who also wrote "Murder by the Book", my second favorite episode) in form. The supporting actors are great, especially Julie Newmar (very undervalued) and Jeanette Nolan as housekeeper, who keeps getting Columbo upset. The last name of Martin Landau's characters is 'Paris'. This was the last name of Leonard Nimoy's character in Mission Impossible. Coincidence? Or a joke by Steven Bochco?
