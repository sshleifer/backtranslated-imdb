Shuai is a stocky and unkempt young Beijing boy with a punk haircut looking for a livelihood in a market hall selling cheap books. He seemed to have nothing to do with the wiry, intellectual intellectual of Zhang, middle-aged, and yet they both end up in a restaurant and discuss the pros and cons of murder (the Chinese title might be the case) better than "Talk It's translated over. If it sounds like it's a pedestrian, do not be fooled: this movie is rich in action and usually runs at breakneck speed (though the tempo is pretty bad towards the end). <br /> <br If you're just getting to know Zhang Yimous's dignified historical dramas, such as Raise The Red Lantern and Shanghai Triad or his newer martial arts epics, Hero and House Of Flying Daggers, you'll be thrilled. Regardless of the other films you've seen, you'll be surprised and pleasantly surprised - this is by far his most original, quirky and experimental work. It was filmed within a few weeks on a minimal budget, almost entirely on-site in Beijing (and used many ordinary Beijingers in the minor supporting roles - there is even a fleeting cameo of the director himself), and mostly with one hand. Camera in a jerky, hyperkinetic style that is a million miles away from the elegant formalism of his most famous films. OK, I live in Beijing, so I enjoy the bizarre little details of everyday life that I recognize and enjoy (though they were recorded in '97 and things change so fast here), but I truly believe that This movie can be appreciated by everyone. I saw it, since I have so many other Chinese "comedies" in a movie club showing subordinate versions of the most recent Chinese films for an audience living almost exclusively abroad. and it's the only thing I can remember where the audience laughed out loud. For a non-Chinese audience it is sometimes a bit too strange, a bit uncomfortable, as it involves violence and, after opening, mutates into something darker in the second half as a breezy, unconventional romantic comedy. It is very, very funny though. <br /> <br /> It is also excellently played by the two leading roles, especially the longtime collaborator of Zhang Yimou, Jiang Wen, who is probably the main movie star of mainland China and has a pondering screen presence reminiscent of a young depardieu or De Niro. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie as proof that the Chinese have a sense of humor that translates into other cultures as proof that Zhang Yimou is much more than a one-man Trick-Pony ...... and for a thoroughly good time.
