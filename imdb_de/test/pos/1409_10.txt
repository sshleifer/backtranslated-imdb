It's a shame that this series was not remastered by Warner or any other professional movie house and produced on video. <br /> <br /> Copies of most episodes are available, but are generally of low quality copies of copies. <br /> <br /> As far as I understand it, 92 episodes were produced, but only 15 are listed here. <br /> <br /> Some of the serial authors, like Richard Matheson, went on to become well-known authors. <br /> <br /> Excellent series, well written, well staged and well produced. <br /> <br /> Michael Weldon, <br /> <br /> Udon Thani, Thailand
