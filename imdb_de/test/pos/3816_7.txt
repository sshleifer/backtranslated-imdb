This movie was enough for me to see it several times. The plot has holes, but the lead actors make it work. Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge) does a great job as a 37-year-old woman who has sacrificed everything else to become a doctor. She worked for years to earn the money for medical studies. She plays well at her residence and is about to take her board exam and make her dream come true. Meanwhile, Julia's sister and brother-in-law are murdered and forced to take on her niece Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart) as the next living relative to avoid becoming a state station. Amanda is about 7 years old from her looks. Amanda is so traumatized by her parents' murder that she has become mute. Needless to say, Julia's 16-hour days make Amanda longer. Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighbor in her apartment building, who works on the life of Julia and Amanda. He is always there with a trick or joke to help Amanda cope with her distress. Amanda begins to get used to Kevin as the film progresses, perhaps more than her aunt. Julia starts relying on Kevin to look after Amanda as she tries to handle her case load and prepare for her board exam. Kevin is always there when a crisis breaks out for Julia. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. You watch them come together before the end of the movie. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was good as well. Arlen managed to convey much without words. The plot made Julia and Amanda gradually warm each other. You can see how they work out a relationship throughout the film. <br /> <br /> We discover that Julia's sister and brother-in-law (the Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole a very valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three employees who wanted to share the proceeds of the theft. Julia discovers that the Meyers had planned to skip the country under assumed identities. The conspiracy is unclear as to whether the Meyers intended to cross their partners twice, or if they themselves were crossed twice. <br /> <br /> In any case, the Meyers are murdered at home by two of their former colleagues. The killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the Meyers before they are killed. The murderers search the house and can not find their price. They leave a living witness to their crime, Amanda. The killers then spend the rest of the film making awkward attempts to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda, who have no idea where the prize is. Finally, the killers kidnap Amanda in the hope that she knows something about the position of the microchip. <br /> <br /> Finally, Julia discovers the truth about Kevin. He is an investigator who is hired to retrieve the stolen microchip. After some rough moments in the relationship, they manage to rescue Amanda and send the bad guys. The foreseeable end lets the three form a family and happily move into a future together. <br /> <br /> What impressed me about this plot was big holes. Kevin moves to the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda the same day after the murder of the Meyers. How does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the murderers? The killers effortlessly leave fingerprints on the scene without worrying about hiding their identity. The murderer, who pretends to be a psychiatrist, is revealed to Amanda by the remains of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles. At the beginning of the film he was not shown in the murder scene. There are other weaknesses in this direction that are too numerous to mention. <br /> <br /> The film could have been a lot better if the script was refined before filming. The filling of the plotting holes would have caused little effort and greatly improved the effort.
