I saw Fame when it first came out. This is the 1980 high school class that happened to be my senior year. I've seen the movie between high school and college this summer, and since I'm a performer myself, he has a special place in my heart, definitely some storylines that are either incomplete or make no sense. However, these issues are more than offset by the passion and emotions of the characters and the incredible music. <br /> <br /> I saw it again recently and was surprised that I still loved it the way I did the first time. Fame is often compared to Flashdance, which I do not think is fair. Although Flashdance has great music and Jennifer Beals is great, I think Fame is far superior in terms of developing its characters and the complexity of its stories. For anyone who really loves the arts, this movie is a must.
