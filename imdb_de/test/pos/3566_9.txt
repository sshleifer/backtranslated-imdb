Leonard Maltin gave this film a dreaded BOMB rating in his 1995 movie and video guide. Which movie did he watch? Kid Revenge or God's Gun are bombs. This movie is a pleasure. It's awesome. It is reading and writing. It is well mounted. It is beautifully photographed and uses brilliant colors. Already in the opening scene, the movie draws your attention and points out that this film is a successful satire of the entire western of spaghetti. The film is played from beginning to end with tributes to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip and the famous Showdown in Good, Bad and Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton and Gilbert Roland work well together to make the satire work. It's too bad that Mr. Maltin rated this movie so badly that he is undeserved. One can only guess about his reasons. I suspect that he missed the point of the movie altogether and expected something more serious than this movie should be. Kudos are among those involved in this project. This movie is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people interested in literary films and appreciating satire.
