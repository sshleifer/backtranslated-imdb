This horror movie is definitely one of the best I've ever seen in my life. There are many reasons for that. The story is really good, there is a lot of action and great horror sequences. The actors are not very good, but it's not that bad, but Kane is definitely the best actor, but he's always been a good actor. The cast is very good as Kane as Jacob Goodnight, Christina Vidal as Christine, Michael j. Heath like Tye, Samantha Noble like Kira, etc. Besides, I just have to warn you that the killer scenes are very disturbing, but they are very creative, but that just makes it better and you can not have a horror movie without blood and blood look very realistic. I'm sure you will not be disappointed if you do not see anything bad, because it's a really good movie. So make sure you do not rent or buy anything bad because it's just so great. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ********** from ********* * <br /> <br /> ***** from *****
