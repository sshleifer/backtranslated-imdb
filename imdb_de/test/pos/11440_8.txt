My wife and I are in favor of any positive comments made by other IMDB members. Although this is not a blockbuster, it has a very special charm. Real and heartwarming. <br /> <br /> We saw this on video at the end of a long day. We were very tired and in bed. Normally my wife falls asleep in a situation like this in a matter of minutes, unless it's an extraordinary movie, and it kept us entertained until the end. <br /> <br /> Maybe younger audiences in their teens and twenties do not like it, but for the rest of us it's a real gem! See it!
