Jean Dujardin sums up Connery's mannerisms: adjusting the cufflinks as they enter a club, when all the women admire him, the casual straightening and straightening of the tie, the boastful, steel gait. It's scary and you realize how much of Bond was Connery's creation in the sixties and not really Ian Fleming's character. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is an allusion to these early films, mainly from From Russia With Love and Thunderball. The main joke, as chauvinist as the hero, is not only in terms of sexism, but also nationalism and colonialism, and how he puts his noses out of the joint when he is sent to Egypt. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect - after about 20 minutes it seems to be a one-joke movie whose parts are reminiscent of parodies of the day when there was plenty. Morcecambe and Wise's The Intelligence Men had suspicious-looking men in fez who also followed their heroes, and that goes back a bit. Unlike Sellers' Clouseau or Baron Cohen's Borat, Dujardin does not give his character a real layer of real pathos - he's too busy perfecting his Connery mannerisms. It's not enough with the credits or a big song, and there's no funny or serious villain like Mike Myers' Dr. Evil or Ricardo Montalbane's Naked Gun Nemesis, for the hero against whom he plays. <br /> <br /> But the scene where OSS117 wakes up in Cairo one morning made me laugh aloud in the three-quarter empty movie theater, and the whole thing looks wonderful. Also, you never have the opportunity to see Operation Kid Brother on screen. The women are Asta-Crumpet, really hot. It's a Bond parody, without getting into the crazy scientists / Ken Adam sets or funny gadgets. Highly recommended.
