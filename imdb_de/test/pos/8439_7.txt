This is a pretty good thriller at a Southern California nuclear plant staged by James Bridges and stars Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas. Fonda plays a television reporter who wants to become an investigative journalist, but only a television reporter. Douglas is an independent cameraman and Lemmon is a supervisor in a nuclear power plant. Fonda and Douglas are routinely sent to a nuclear power plant, and it almost comes to an accident, and they get everything on film. Everyone tries to cover up except Fonda and Douglas, so Douglas steals the movie. Lemmon starts investigating and finds out that the company cares more about profit than factory safety. It's a good movie with a pretty good ending.
