I only saw it once - in 1986 in an "artsy" theater in Minneapolis ... but I remember it as if I had seen it a thousand times this morning. Hilarious ("Sawing for Teens", playing Scrabble with all the "e" tiles), beautifully animated (she takes her eyes off, shakes them back in place and then puts them back on) and poignant (the end of the world, the pettiness ) from a snit) ... <br /> <br /> Required consideration for the human race. If you call this just a cartoon, then you call THE GREAT GATSBY quick typing.
