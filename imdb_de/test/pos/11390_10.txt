A small-town kid who works in a big city becomes a giant star and then gets out of control. It shows you the rise to fame and then falls from fame and again to a small increase. Great actors and a great director = a great, great movie called Boogie Nights. <br /> <br /> P.T Anderson. An amazing director who made Boogie Nights incredible. From the moment the movie starts, the moment it ends ends, and you can feel how beautiful this movie is. Some scenes are literally breathtaking. A great story, a great movie. Mark Whalberg was fantastic, Philip Seymour Hoffman was wonderful because he is in everything. Thomas Jane was great as well and although he only played a minor role, he played it perfectly. There is one scene in this movie that I can not overcome: "The Drug Deal Gone Bad Scene". It was fantastic. Music performance and cinematography became an amazing experience. I had not seen Boogie Nights and thank God I did it, it's so well rounded and I'm now a GIANT fan of PTA (Paul Thomas Anderson). <br /> <br /> Do whatever you have to do and watch this movie.
