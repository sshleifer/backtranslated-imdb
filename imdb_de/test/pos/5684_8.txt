So well done, no CGI crap. Has anyone been on the Darwin's Adelaide River "Jumping Crocs" tour? Black Water was realistic. Rogue was a bit curly. <br /> <br /> I thought the blonde chick was excellent - she had not seen it before. And the other chick is a baby, she is always excellent. <br /> <br /> v. Exciting - I would compare it to Jaws over every other man who eats animal strips. <br /> <br /> Got the whole Aussie thing, without going OTT with struths and crikeys. <br /> <br /> loved it!
