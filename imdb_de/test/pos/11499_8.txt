Some people go through life and move from one thing or person to another, without paying attention. Others resort to one thing, another person or a principle and remain stubborn, committed to whatever it is - and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it. But we are all different, "Made from different clay," as one of the characters in this film puts it, which makes life so interesting. Some people are just crazy - and maybe you have to be that way to live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to do things, life? Writer / director Lisa Krueger tries with a slight rapprochement to see the thin line between entering - and how to commit - and the obsession in "Committed," starring Heather Graham as a young woman, is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy. Her name is Joline, and this is her story. <br /> <br /> Granted, Joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general. She is a woman of her word who sticks to it no matter what. And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it's forever. The only problem is that someone forgot to tell Carl - and he has been away for 597 days in marriage; to "find" yourself and find out everything. When Joline realizes he is not coming back, she refuses to give him or her marriage. Maybe it's the "tone" she's made of. Nevertheless, she leaves her home in New York City and goes looking for him, which she does - in El Paso, Texas, of all places. But as soon as she knows where he is she keeps her distance, gives him his "room" and does not even let him know she's there. She considers Carl a "mental coma," and it is her job to hold a "spiritual vigil" over him until he comes to his senses. And while she watches and waits, her life is anything but boring when she meets a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress in one of the local restaurants; Carmen's "Grampy" (Alfonso Arau), who is something of a mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has problems with Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic), an artist who does and cares for Pinatas. For Joline, it's a journey of discovery, where she learns a lot about Carl and even more about himself. <br /> <br /> There is a touch of humor, a touch of romance and some insights into human nature. This quirky movie is more about characterization and character than action. Krueger presents everything very well and delivers an exciting and entertaining movie. Their characters are very real people with all the desires, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition. a rich and diverse group through which she tells her story. We see it from the perspective of Joline, while Krueger engages us in Joline's mind and thus its motives, giving a decided perspective on the events as they unfold. Along with the deliberate pace at which you soak up the atmosphere and ambience that creates it, this is a very effective piece of storytelling. This theme is based on a serious seriousness, but Krueger refrains from something hard or too deep and instead focuses on the natural humor that develops from the people and situations that Joline encounters. And the result is a well-structured, influential and optimistic view of what we call life. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham takes up this role from the first frame of the film to make Joline a very unique character creation. She dives into the role and gives a convincing and credible performance. It adds the small personal traits and nuances that distinguish the difference between a representation that is a mere representation of a person and a real one. And for this movie to work, it was imperative that Joline be viable and believable - and Graham is successful on all fronts. Her on-screen presence has never been so tempting, and her vivacious personality, or even the way she uses her eyes, is enough to totally attract you. it's all part of the character she creates; There is an appeal to Joline, who radiates from her whole face, who she is inside and out. She is a sympathetic, pleasant person, and because you have shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. It's a good job, from the way the character was written to the way Graham brings her to life so alive. <br /> <br /> As Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is also totally captivating. Her performance is very natural and uncomplicated, and she uses her instincts to make her character effective. She has a charismatic presence but is less than extravagant and gives her an aspect that is attractive. She is refreshingly open and open; One has the impression that Carmen is not something that holds back, but is absolutely honest on all fronts, and that is also part of her charm. And like Joline, this character is well written, and Velazquez convincingly brings her to life. <br /> <br /> Overall, there are a number of noteworthy performances that form the heart and soul of this film, including those by Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (as Joline's brother Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and, above all, Mark Ruffalo as a T-Bo, who manages to create an unforgettable character with only a short actual screen time. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carls Editor) and Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist ). A movie that says something about the value of resigning to consider The Big Picture - thinking about who we are, where we're going, and what we really need - 'Committed' is a pleasurable experience; A ride that is definitely worth it. 8.10.
