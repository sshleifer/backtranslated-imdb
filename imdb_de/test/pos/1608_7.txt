In Luchino Visconti's film Death in Venice, not only the beauty of the environment, but also the quest for beauty itself, decays Gustav von Aschenbach into a man's shell. To understand decay, we must acknowledge the beauty that enchants us. It is best described and explained in a quotation from Socrates, which can be found in Thomas Mann's version of Death in Venice: "Beauty alone is beautiful and immediately visible." the only aspect of the spiritual that we can perceive through our senses? Anything else? if the Divine, if reason, virtue, and truth, through the senses, would speak to us? Should we not perish and be consumed by love? "In the movie, we see exactly what happens, the man is surrounded by a longing for beauty, which turns into a longing for the boy Tadzio, although the prudent part of his mind tells him that worshiping beauty is sensuality and abandonment He can not restrain himself. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to describe this as a beautiful film, we see early on the extravagance of the salon, and we get a perfect summary of the life of the turn of the century turn of the century All perfectly captured by filmmaker Pasqualino De Santis, Visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of Venice, but instead the glorious and sensual artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensual beauty, and these things are banished to the past which we know to be of unparalleled beauty and uniqueness Nothing more than a resort with curious hotel staff. The streets become tedious labyrinths, filled with disgusting dirt and decay, the city decays in tune with the protagonist. Only through the flashbacks can we take a look at why this famous composer is a weak and harmless man. The death of his daughter and presumably his wife along with the failure of his music make us understand why he destroys himself. <br /> <br /> Alfred, with whom Aschenbach conducts detailed discussions about the meaning of beauty and who can create it; but Alfred is more than just a friend, he is Aschenbach's alter ego, and what Alfred says articulates the composer's own doubts and fears. The scene in which Aschenbach decides to leave Venice is immediately followed by a clip in which Alfred tells him that he is weak, alienated and callous. In the end we might come to the conclusion that these flashbacks are not reality at all. It is a decay of memory, rather than objective renderings of the past, these flashbacks become distorted memories. We can say that these are dilapidated memories, because even Aschenbach alludes, he explains, "the reality directs and demeans us"; And following the scene in the travel agency's office, we see Aschenbach confront Tadzio and his family and warn them - leave Venice, but right after the meeting we see him again sitting at the employee's and find that everything is in his mind, he deals with long scenes without dialogue, framed by the poignant music of Gustav Mahler. It lets the mind of the beholder wander as we observe Aschenbach's life and his respectability with the beauty around him. <br /> <br /> Slowly, the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by fatigue that mixes with the growing awareness that the city is suffocating in the dirt. The crumbling city sets the scene for the attractiveness of the middle-aged man to Tadzio, the romantic longing for something so ideal and ambiguous that even in the imagination it can never be consumed. The beauty of this Polish boy ignites a fire in him, which makes him shine first and then consumed. The film ends with Aschenbach sitting weakly in a beach chair and seeing Tadzio fighting with his friend. We see the black dye from his hair running on his cheek, and it looks like corrupted blood, but it is a vision of the expiring moments of his life before his last breath. The final decay has happened, all around him is the city so he has become what he loathes. When Aschenbach dies, he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film who had disturbed him. It was the pursuit of beauty that initiated his decay. In the pursuit of artistic beauty he could not perceive his own death and that of the city around him; His sensuality is spoiled as he is constantly kept at bay by death and decay. These three themes combine The Damned and Death in Venice, beauty, death and decay. These themes are Visconti's art. The beauty of his work lies in the decay of beauty itself. <br /> <br /> In this film we learn how a great man breaks up. We see the revered composer Gustav von Aschenbach in the pursuit of true and pure beauty, and in this pursuit he falls to ruin, leading him to a miserable, lonely death that observes the goal of his affection. I believe that through these films Visconti tries to say that beauty can not endure. Decay is inseparable in the world around us, and when distracted, it can destroy the splendor. When you die in Venice everything is canceled because of the culture and the pursuit of beauty. Beauty and flowing are interwoven in Visconti's works like thorns, at once beautiful and destructive. These themes determine his art.
