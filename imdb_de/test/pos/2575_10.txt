I really think that this movie has earned some Oscars! I really do not care what people say bad about this movie ... because it's a really well played part of Samuel L. Jackson and mostly Christina Ricci !! I'm a big fan of her since I saw her in Addams Family ... trying to see everything she does, and that's absolutely one of the best games she has played !! I love her look (though people say she is not pretty ... I think she is ... and I love her eyes) !! The movie is about a lot of things ... people say it's religious ... people say it's about racism ... people say it's about drugs ... people say that it's about nymphomania ... well, maybe it's a bit of all that !! What I really feel, though, is that this movie has a lot of eye opening for the blues it stands for and what it stands for ... and where it comes from: life ... the heart ... the pain ... the sadness ... and most of all ... spontaneous feelings !! I hope you can see ... if you're that kind of person who likes a movie not just because of the pictures or the story she's telling you? This is a good movie you can see ... if you do not ... well ... see it anyway ... can not hurt so much, and you see Christina Ricci look so hot !! She is a fox !!
