Tim Robbins has done a masterful job directing this movie. I say that because he avoided conventions and stereotypes. He also oversaw superb performances by Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more amazing is that Robbins can not find patrons. He only tells the story and lets the events play in the mind of the beholder. This is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinion on the death penalty, one of the most controversial issues of our time, without being illegally manipulated in both directions. I can not recommend this movie enough, 9/10.
