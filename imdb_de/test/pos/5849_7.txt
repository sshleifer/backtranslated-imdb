This thriller has so many twists that he had me on the edge of the seat. I've seen it on video, part of the landscape on "The Bluff" might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen. Actors include Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin (from "The Truth About Cats and Dogs"), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker in "Dawson's Creek") and Ryan Gosling (???).
