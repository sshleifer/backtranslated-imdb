I always enjoy watching this cartoon, with Sylvester trying to catch Tweety on the train instead of Grandma. It's actually a standard fare, but entertaining, especially when Tweety pulls the emergency stop rope. One of my complaints about it is how sloppy the animators were by train. If you watch this over and over again, like my little boy (who loves trains, which is why he liked it so much), you start to notice a few things. The luggage cart changes trains, either 3rd, 4th, or 5th and 5th not in long shots. The engine has either the number 651 or 814 or none. The coal offer has either the number 99 or the letters "S.P. & Q.R." on it or no number or letters. The coaches wear the "S.P.Q.R." without "&" in long shots and then close-ups with the words "SouthEast and Western". <br /> <br /> All this does not bother the story, but the production details were obviously not considered very cautious in. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this cartoon is one of my favorites with Sylvester and Tweety.
