This was a fantastically written script when it comes to seeing things from a different perspective. The comedy was on time and not over the top, the drama was generally terrific, and the storyline served more to create misunderstandings when we think about people who rely only on their outward appearance. The plot revolves as Amanda Bynes' brother / sister character tries to play football on the boys team and instead find a new love interest. Tatum Channing has the real misperception, and he does well to be disinterested at first. Later, it becomes clear that the most important thing in life is friendship, not attitude.
