If you have not seen it yet, you should really do it on DVD. I can not believe how much I liked it! It is amazingly realistic and believable. It's true, much of it is speculated, and I would have liked to know more about what was speculative and what facts were proven (there are not many), but it deals very well with the theme of "Cruel Mother Nature". It will remind you of the nature programs you've seen on Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel, only the animals here are dinosaurs. They work naturally; They eat, kill, mate, play and fight for survival. They will actually root for some of them and against others. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the effects are excellent. Sometimes they look a bit too much like CGIs, but then you see them in a different perspective that makes them look more realistic. In some cases, you are actually convinced that you have seen a dinosaur. My favorites were the coelophysis, the birds of prey, the diplodocus, the iguanadons, the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds. Most of all, I was disappointed with the T-Rex, which sometimes looked a bit too computer-generated. <br /> <br /> In any case, you should definitely see this production. It's educational, well done and very entertaining. For what it is, it is an A!
