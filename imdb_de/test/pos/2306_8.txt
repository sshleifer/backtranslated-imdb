Eros and Thanatos, love and death dominate the dialectic of life. At the end of the 19th century, in a remote Japanese village, a young man and a married woman older than he fall in love with each other and decide to kill their husband to enjoy their love. However, they never enjoy this freedom, as Remorse pursues them as usual at the time by the weakest member of the couple, the woman, of course. In an atmosphere in which the dream (nightmare) mixes with reality, the spirit of the murdered man first appears to the woman, then to the man. It also tracks the dreams of other villagers creating a climate of mistrust and gossip about the couple, compounded by the arrival of a police officer to investigate the disappearance of the murdered man. But what makes this movie more interesting is the development of the couple's feelings in Shakespeare's profound psychological and dramatic development of regret, fear and anxiety that turns her love relationship into a nightmare until her final demise. The expressionism so popular with Japanese theater or film acting is also present in the performances of the players, but not in exaggerated form. Only to the extent necessary to more effectively depict the deepest feelings of the depicted characters. This is indeed a solid good movie.
