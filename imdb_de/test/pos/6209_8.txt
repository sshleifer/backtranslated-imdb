Preston Sturgis' THE POWER AND THE GLORY was not seen by the public for almost twenty or thirty years until it reappeared in the late 1990s and even appeared on television. Meanwhile, Pauline Kaels had started promoting THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK, the screenplay by Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles for KANE based on Sturgis' screenplay here. As mentioned at the beginning of this thread for the movie on the IMDb website, Kael overestimated her case. <br /> <br /> There are about six narrators who take turns engaging in the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane and Raymond the butler. Everyone has a different focus on Kane, reflecting his faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course everyone reveals their own mistakes when he tells their version of Kane's story. This method also results in frequent overlapping re-captures of the same incident. <br /> <br /> This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, as KANE is a legendary business leader - this is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who has risen from the ground to head the most successful railroad system in the country. However, there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right-hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the almost three-dimensional view that we receive at the time of Kane in Garner. When Henry tells, he talks about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical audience - she only sees the defects in Henry. A typical example: Although he has worked his way up, Tom is getting more and more upset in his later years. Unions are troublemakers, and he does not want them to be slowed down by their Shenanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a big walk-out and how she has preoccupied him to the detriment of his domestic life. However, Henry's wife reminds him of how Tom ended the strike with strike and violence (apparently blew up the Union headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man, but one is pure white and one is pure black. <br /> <br /> I'm not really knocking on THE POWER AND THE GLORY because I did not copy the success of KANE (just a few films - including all of Orson Welles' other films), but I realize that the story is presented well enough to end the interest in the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the couple's worldly success is brought home fully. <br /> <br /> When they get married, Tom (partly) wants to show good performances. giving his wife and family the benefits he never had. But in America, big business success comes at a cost. Tom is deeply involved in the management of the railway empire (he is expanding it and constantly improving it). But it takes away too much from home and he loses contact with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who becomes his lover. When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior, it destroys her. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Tom also gets a shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eve marries Tom and gives him a son - but turns out to be Eve's son of Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cockroach causes Tom to shoot himself. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a complete success - sometimes the action is not convincing. This, however, makes the business seem real (note the scene in which Tom reports to his board of directors on his plans to buy a small opposing railroad and describes the use of debt to finance the plans). Sturgis had a rich background so he could bring in those details. All in all, it's a first-class movie. No CITIZEN KANE maybe, but interesting for movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.
