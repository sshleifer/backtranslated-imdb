I like "hack". Imagine the "Lone Ranger" reborn as a taxi driver from the 2000s, a decent but flawed guy who does his best in Philadelphia while trying to figure out problems from a troubled past, and you have the summary , David Morse is almost perfect as Olshansky. He helps people, but instead of driving in the Old West "Silver", he drives a taxi through the streets of Philly, without distributing silver bullets. The cast is first-rate and well above average. At times the witty dialogue almost reaches the level of the classic 70s series "The Rockford Files". This show deserves a return, hopefully in a better time window than Friday (9 PM).
