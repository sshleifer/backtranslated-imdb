I can understand why others were more uncomfortable to the climax and made a turn that is really hard to take. However, I think the setup works pretty well. The music, rather threatening and spiky, really offers a scary aura that matches the relentless sound of a constantly ringing phone that fights English actress Joan Matlin (Jean Marsh) Bonkers. She borrows a nice dwelling of a buddy as she tries to start her career in New York City (the buildings in front of the window look as realistic as those of David Letterman) and is greeted by a loud phone ringing rather loudly by loud blows against the wall. In search of answers regarding the person responsible for such a disregard of their mind, Joan discovers that no one is leasing this room and that a former tenant has actually strangled herself. Without the help of the manager, Joan will decide to find out for herself who makes her suffer like this. Joan discovers the empty space and the phone with a specific female voice that will follow her. <br /> <br /> The episode, I think, is a tour-de-force for Jean Marsh, which is a one-woman show. She is the only actress that is visible, and we follow her through the crisis that is slowly undermining her, the phone and the beating from the other room, causing her much suffering that is frightening. Instead of leaving, Joan remains so shaken by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wants the phone (or whoever rings) to stop. The episode provides a possible answer to who is plaguing Joan and why. A character called Beth comes late in the story as Joan tries to figure out whose female voice was on the other line, who knew her name on that dreaded phone she spotted in the room opposite her. The fate of Beth could only tell the viewer why Joan is being traumatized. I think this episode is an exercise in Spooks instead of credibility, some did not like it very much, but I certainly did. I admit that as a physical threat that's "crawling" on Joan, the phone is hard to take seriously, not to mention attacking her, but I thought the intense opening twenty minutes earlier would have been appropriate enough, to make up for it.
