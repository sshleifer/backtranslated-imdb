One of those films I went through through the The Criterion Collection and, as usual, a change. That was a great decision. I was almost fascinated by the quality of the film, the story he told and how he was told. The almost minimalist feel of the film with sparse dialogue and almost constant music added only a very special level to the film. This is really a great movie to spend some time enjoying.
