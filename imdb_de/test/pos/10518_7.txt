Nothing fancy here, but a nicely traded story about a maltreated deaf woman (Fonda) of a small antagonist (Bochner) who meddles in one of her husband's plans and his lover. Sutherland and Weber are police officers who are drawn into an easy-going murder investigation and the story just keeps flowing.
