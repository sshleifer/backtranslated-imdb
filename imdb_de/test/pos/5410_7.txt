It's hard to judge "Imaginary Heroes" without referring to the fact that director and screenwriter Dan Harris is only 25 years old. It is hard to believe that he has seen this film, which is not only a mature work, professional and profound, but also with some of the shortcomings of routine that are specific to senior directors. <br /> <br /> The setting is the American suburb familiar from 'American Beauty' or 'Desperate Housewives'. Like "American Beauty't," the film is about suicide, but it's the beginning of the movie, and we look at a middle-class family coping with the death of talented athlete brother and son. Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is the mother, both are superb at dealing with the loss to find the reason and motivation to survive. Harris drives his actors with a sure hand, and the first two sections of the film (a total of four are the seasons) form a wonderful suspense, with credible dilemmas and real questions. It's the second part of the film that's a little disappointed, it looks too tired and conventional, and I suspect that the producers may have intervened in the work of the young screenwriter and director to bring him to the Hollywood convention. So this movie is not a grim version of "American Beauty" with a different focus. However, I am sure that we will learn a lot about Dan Harris in the next few years.
