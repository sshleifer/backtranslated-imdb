I've seen this movie more than once. It's not the best scifi strip I've ever seen, but it's not a bad movie. The spectacle is good and the characters are "real" in low-budget sci-fi than most. (At least it's not full of dumb bimbos like so many other low-budget scifi's.) I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She is a good actress and worries about a single mother and about something better than others. <br /> <br /> Do not be dissuaded from the naysayers. Convince yourself and judge for yourself.
