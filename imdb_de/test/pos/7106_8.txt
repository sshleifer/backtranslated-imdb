Dracula (John Carradine) visits Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), who believes that everything can be cured by science. He wants Edelam to cure his vampirism - Edelman agrees. Then Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) appears and seeks a cure to turn him into a werewolf. The Frankenstein monster is also discovered but does not do anything. <br /> <br /> Very ambitious plot for a 1940s universal horror movie. Trying to heal monsters through science is actually an interesting idea. Also this movie has beautiful sets (LOVE the castle lives to the doctor), lots of atmosphere, is very purposeful (great use of shadows) and has pretty good special effects. <br /> <br /> Acting is all good except for Carradine - he tries, but I could never accept him as Dracula. Lionel Atwill plays (as always) the police chief. That's pretty much forgotten and mocked as a stupid movie, but I think it's very good. It was also the last time the Universal Monsters were made serious - the next movie was in 1948 in "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein". It's a great movie, but the emphasis is more on comedy. <br /> <br /> The only real mistake here is that for 67 minutes there is a lot of action and some logical holes: Why is Dracula trying to bite the pretty Miliza (Martha) O'Driscoll) when he is healed? And why (and how) does the doctor bring Frankenstin to his castle? These are still small complaints. Recommended.
