As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the history of the sport, I was delighted with Disney's sensitivity to the subject of golf lessons in the early twentieth century. The film showed well the psychological battles that Harry Vardon had carried out in himself, from his childhood trauma that he was expelled, to his own inability to break the glass ceiling, which prevents him from being accepted as equal in the English golf community , Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles and in the eyes of the Americans of the upper crust is a mere caddy mocking his attempts to rise above his level. <br /> <br /> What I liked best is how this theme manifests in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working-class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper classes. However, his mother recognizes her son's gift and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of facing those whom he considers inferior. Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the film was not the actual site of the historic tournament, the small freedoms of Disney do not affect the beauty of the movie. There is a little Disney moment at the pool table; Otherwise, the viewer does not really think about Disney. The ending, as in "Miracle", is not a Disney creation, but one that only human history could have written.
