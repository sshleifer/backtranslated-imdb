Well, where do I start ... <br /> <br /> As one of the other critics said, you know that you expect a real treat when you see the opening shot - minutes and minutes of filming a guy on one Travelator stands. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat Rubin's excellent summary of the story. However, what I would like to say is that this movie has packed me more than any movie I can remember. I sat with my mouth open and on the whole edge of the seat. The camera work, the soundtrack and * fantastic * performances (especially those of Tony Servillo) pull you on the screen and do not let you look the other way. <br /> <br /> It's Italian, so everyone looks fantastic. but it's not just an exercise in a cool style. This is a movie that has a lot to say about happiness, loss and love. <br /> <br /> Go and see it.
