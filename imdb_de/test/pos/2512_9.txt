This movie is often shown on premium cable channels and I keep looking at it. The performances are wonderful and the material has happened so much that there is always something new from the movie. <br /> <br /> I may be distracted too often when watching movies at home. The dogs are barking, the phone is ringing, the popcorn is ending during the credits. But this film is about people and about what motivates us, what animates us, what leads to cracks between us and what inspires us. <br /> <br /> For me, it's films like The Love Letter that make me take a risk on new films. Honestly, I am surprised that the film is not better known. I would like to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan in many other roles. They are a pleasure to see. Kate Capshaw is wonderful and I had no idea she was. Ellen DeGeneres plays a far more complex role than just the comic relief. <br /> <br /> This movie offers interesting visuals as a background for the characters and their interactions. I find it refreshing every time I take the time to look at it.
