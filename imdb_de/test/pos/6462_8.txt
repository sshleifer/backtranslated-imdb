The edge of town from 1957, directed by Martin Ritt, stars John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. It's the story of a troubled man, Axel, who has a mysterious past that gradually comes out during the movie. He has a connection that gets him a job on a loading dock working for Charlie (Jack Warden), a real buddy who takes kickbacks from his workers and rides them hard. Charlie has a strong dislike for a black, T.T. (Poitier), who occupies the same position. T. T. invites Axel to work in his team; Axel defies Charlie and does it. Axel finds a place to live and talks to T. T., his wife (Dee) and their son's white teacher (Kathleen McGuire). In a tragedy, none of the men on the dock will talk to the police, and Axel has to deal with his values, what he stands for and what friendship means. <br /> <br /> This is a really excellent black and white movie that strangely is not about being black or white! It's really about the limits you set yourself and to know who you are. Charlie is a fanatic and hates that a black guy has a good position on the dock. T. teases Charlie and gives as best he can. There is no discussion that T. T. and Axel spend time together, or that T. T.'s son has a white teacher with whom the family also socializes. What Axel, a loner, considers difficult is accepting friendship or trust in someone - those things he can learn through TT. Poitier absolutely shines in "Edge of the City" - he is warmhearted, energetic, affectionate and smart, a man with a real zest for life, not afraid of anything. Cassavetes is excellent and plays a completely opposite figure - hiding in the shadows, chronically depressed and always nervous. <br /> <br /> The film leaves open what happens to Axel. Whatever, he's a different man now. <br /> <br /> Strangely undervalued and unknown movie, possibly in the shadow of a lot of the angry films of young men made during this time.
