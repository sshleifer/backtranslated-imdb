There is a fair bit over the price tag of a silk negligee. The bimbo in the office shows the bargain she got for $ 22 (close-up of the tag). Later, Mary Astor finds the day in the bedroom of the boss (evidence that Bimbo slept with him). Still later, Mary Astor is on the verge of having an affair with Ricardo Cortez, looking at the price tag of her HIS negligee ($ 14) and remembering how much she was attracted to the Bimbo, as well as the fact that she was 8 US dollars spent less has the "most obvious" woman she has ever met. It seems like an obvious morality, but it was done well. The movie would be stronger if Robert Ames's character were played by a more powerful actor (he is too indecisive for a self-made salesman and he spends most of the film on camera with his face averted), and if Ricardo Cortez had more to do given as an ironic smile. Both male lead roles are bland and forgetful and are hampered by the so popular in this film time pancake make-up. The Mary Astor character, however, is interesting, appealing and believable. Behind Closed Doors it is worth seeing.
