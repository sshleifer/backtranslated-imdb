I do not have to repeat the summary made by Glenn. The black-and-white rendering is even more powerful when it comes to depicting village life in the countryside at this time. The deep level of friendship that Babette shows towards the two older sisters touches the hearts. The side occupation is excellent and their services are outstanding. It would not be fair to pick out a character because the whole story depends on the cast altogether. I can not say exactly why I rate this movie as high as I am not a professional critic. Individual viewers may or may not agree with my rating, as enjoying this type of film is always in the eye of the beholder.
