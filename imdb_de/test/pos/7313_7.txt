Norma Shearer dazzles as she changes from a frumpy, stubborn housewife to a seductive potential divorce. Most 1930s movies have a creaking edge - the camera work is sometimes quite lethargic - but we have to forgive this ubiquitous pleasure for their chubby "qualities." Marie Dressler - Shearer mingles as a guest of the eccentric globe-trotting with a strange selection of Lovelorn types, including her long-lost husband. The dialogue is fun, often smart, and the performances are offered. Shearers and dressers shine the most. Shearer even shows her piano skills in a musical short. Her strange but appealing stance and "affair with the camera" is consistently apparent - and she hits every emotional tone, real and unerring. For his time. , .a good show.
