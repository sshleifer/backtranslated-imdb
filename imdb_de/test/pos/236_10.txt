This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable. Throw Rita Hayworth as his love lover and comedian Phil Silvers out of all people as his buddy, and you've got the ingredients for a true crowd pleaser, and that's what it turned out. Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the "wrong side of the tracks" in 40s movies), whose main attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is adorable and even plays a double role as Rusty's and Rusty's grandmother. Rusty has a great chance through the machinations of John Coudair (Otto Kruger), who lost and lost Rusty's grandmother. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Danny, who lets Rusty go, to the detriment of his club, because she has a chance of success he can not give her. But of course Rusty does not want that, because as is common in movies of that time, the right girl is the only thing the girl has in mind. There are no surprises, but everyone does a great job. Kelly does the first of his amazing trick dances, this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window. He was the master of this kind of dance, and you still have to ask yourself how they have adjusted everything so that it really seems to be in two places at the same time. The melodrama gets a little bit thicker, and there are a few unfounded war references that do little but offer the opportunity for one or two songs, but Kelly takes this movie to the next level. That was before he became a megastar and perhaps too smooth for his own good. A subordinate edge of rudeness gives his character a credible and almost wistful atmosphere. Kelly's character in the 1980s "Xanadu" was also named Danny McGuire. This film was the beginning, the film the end of a grandiose run for a dancing genius. Of course, this movie meant a lot to him. Highly recommended.
