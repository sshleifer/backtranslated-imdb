That was such a beautiful movie. Such an amazing achievement by Joseph and Brad. Very innocent written and performed. Something you must have seen !! I almost cried through the whole movie. This is a movie that every family should go to see with their children. It teaches us all a very important lesson in life and how we should approach the tough issue of AIDS, how to teach our children how to deal with it, and the people around them. Not only in AIDS, but in every incurable disease. I had not even heard of this movie until I could scroll through t.v. one day and happen to bump into it. I recommend everyone to look at this. Do not forget your box of handkerchiefs. More films should be made like this. Extremely heartwarming.
