This film is all about reality. The submarine war in World War II was not a clear science. There were no computers that contained accurate enemy details, and there were no precise tools to 100% control the submarine. Not all of the crew left with a song in their hearts and a smile on their dial. People expecting to see a "pretty war" in this movie will be grossly disappointed ........................ GOOD, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve that the reality is pushed into her face. War is not clean, exactly, packed by people who are about to break in song. It is endured by frightened, cold / burned, hungry, desperate people who do everything they can to survive. <br /> <br /> "We Dive at Dawn" is a fine example of a desperate situation that requires desperate action.
