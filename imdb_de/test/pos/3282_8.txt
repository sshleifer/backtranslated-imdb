ManBearPig is a pretty funny episode of South Park. It mocks Al Gore and his talk about global warming and only replaces global warming with ManBearPig (a fictional monster that has parts of a man, a bear and a pig). He tells the boys about it Stan gets pity on him at a school meeting, so he and the boys decide to hang out with him. Gradually, they are trapped in a cave where they believe Manbearpig is theirs, and they are stuck for days. In the meantime, Cartman thinks the treasure wants to keep everything to itself. ManBearPig is a good parody of global warming and overall a fun South Park episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
