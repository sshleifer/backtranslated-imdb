This is a report of events that have been printed several times, and I had read two books - "A Journey for the Crazy" and "The Curious Last Journey by Donald Crowhurst" before watching the movie in Sheffield just before Christmas. I must say, it exceeded all expectations for the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe Yacht Race. These men had set out to do something that had never before been done without auxiliaries, wooden boats, satellite phones, GPS, and only their minds and dexterity to take them around the world in one piece. Not to mention the months of loneliness, the thundering southern ocean, little sleep and boats that often literally fell apart. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this documentary is superbly composed, tightly edited, in a good mood with a great narrative. The archive material and the interviews are fascinating and bring the story to life. Clare Crowhurst's interview material is particularly enlightening and moving as she reports on the events that led to her husband, Donald Crowhurst's departure from Teignmouth, the doubts and fears in his mind and their reaction to subsequent events. I was touched and even had one or two Two tears shed as the credits began to hear other people express similar feelings. <br /> <br /> The two books I mentioned above are useful for more details and background which could not fit in the 90 minutes, and I would recommend them. <br /> <br /> This is ultimately a true story of human courage and human frailty. A must for anyone interested in sailing, adventure, human effort and real heroes.
