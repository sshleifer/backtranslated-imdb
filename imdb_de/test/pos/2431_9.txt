Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna was a two-part, star-studded, historic TV movie based on the Peter Kurth book Anastasia: The Puzzle of Anna Anderson. It keeps itself pretty good historically, the names are changed etc. But stick to the real story. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom are quite good with the Russian royal houses, Czar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra. What came to my mind were the all too brief depictions of Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. All in all, it was a pretty stylish production with a fine spectacle. I was pretty impressed with the production values ​​when it first aired on NBC in late 1986. The main actor was also the good German actor Jan Niklas, who had previously played in NBC's other Russian epic "Peter the Great". <br /> <br /> I felt that in Part 2 some important details of Anna Anderson's trip to America were skipped. It's also important to know that 1986 was less known about Anna Anderson's story. It was not known then whether her claim to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine. In the late 1990s, more was known and Anna Anderson is said to have been a scam. <br /> <br /> It's a pity the networks are not making good TV movies anymore.
