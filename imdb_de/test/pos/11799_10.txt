I'm glad I have HBO now. I did not mean to watch a movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next movie on HBO was this, I decided (based on the description) to at least try it. I am so glad that I have chosen this film! Maybe this movie just caught me in a vulnerable moment (I'm a bit stressed and did a big test for which I want to study), but it definitely gave me the perspective of friendship, not to mention a valuable lesson about empathy. I am currently one year away from completing the pharmacy school, and the whole scene involving the doctor and nurse was definitely a learning point for me! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I just wanted to inform the world This is an amazing movie and not to be missed. There is definitely something for everyone in this film!
