<br /> <br /> When this movie was released, I was dismissed as a light pop nonsense. That was a mistake. <br /> <br /> After repeated visits and a documentary about DIRTY DANCING, the attractiveness of this movie is certainly awakened. <br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING is a movie about change. The evolving nature of relationships within the family, changing the world view as they grow up, etc. The story takes place in August 1963, the last weeks of the last summer of the American people's innocence. The many personal changes the characters have experienced reflect the many changes in American society that would be marked by the killing of Kennedy and Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Female filmgoers revered this film and repeated trips to the movie houses it is the world's most successful dance film. As a man, I find the romantic couple of the ultimate stallion, Patrick Swayze, very difficult to accept with the very simple Jennifer Gray. This would be fatal for most romantic dramas, and it could also have led to a fierce dislike of most male reviewers. <br /> <br /> The film's soundtrack was ranked 1 before the release of the film. To this day, it's almost impossible to attend a wedding without hearing a DIRTY DANCING song. Baby's mother woke up near the movie and asked Bach's father, "Is something wrong?" /> <br /> Babys father, the family member, has set itself the goal of keeping everything that happens to be kept secret. He tells his wife to go back to sleep. However, if you resist as well as possible, the change is unstoppable. DIRTY DANCING is the story of a person waking up in innocence in the last moments of our country's last sleep.
