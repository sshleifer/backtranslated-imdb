This movie has moved me more than I expected, and I was ready to cry. The acting mainly wore this film with outstanding performances by Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger and the minor cast. These actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they spent the rest of the night with me, and I struggled to shake this war drama. The costumes and cinematography were also magical, but were not carried away. They did not perceive the focus, but added the entire effect. Cold Mountain could never be my favorite movie, as this title is always part of The English Patient, but it is among the top five. The story itself was well developed and remained pretty unpredictable. I did not know which line came next. A heartbreaking story about humanity and war. In fact, this film was so starkly real that it was barely noticed in the 19th century. It seemed to apply forever.
