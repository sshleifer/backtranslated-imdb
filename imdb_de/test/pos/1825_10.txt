Valley Girl will always have a special place in my heart: I would say that this is certainly the best teenage sex comedy of the 80's, but that's a compliment. This is a good movie, period. It's very time and place specific - almost 20 years later this is a wonderful snapshot - yet its story remains timeless. (These are just Romeo and Juliet, after all, without death!) Nicolas Cage is wonderful, and shows all the early promise that, as it turns out, he has renounced overcrowded action Crapola. Deborah Foreman is the revelation of this movie and I can not believe she did not make a bigger career. Somebody discovers it FAST. This is sweeter and gentler than most movies in the genre - the necessary nudity seems to be contained in contractual obligations - and while it's not groundbreaking, it's certainly nice to see this kind of movie that respects its characters and does not crucify Flat young girls to have fun - even Foreman's crew of best friends, who are misled by peer pressure, is never portrayed as a villain. (In fact, her friend Stacy, who was forced to double with Cage's friend Fred, has a good time despite her protests and exposes Fred to Fred in the backseat.) This brings you back to the early '80s when you get there would be, but it does pretty well today. Warning to those unfamiliar with the film: DO NOT watch one of the seemingly continuous VH1 screenings, but lend it in its unprocessed splendor. Otherwise, you're missing some of the most powerful, time-specific dialogues in the movies. And you can not write about Valley Girl and not mention the fabu soundtrack of great 80s songs - most of one-hit wonders that are not only essential to the sense of time and place in this film, but also thematically good. selected. See it - fantastic little strip! Fer shur !!
