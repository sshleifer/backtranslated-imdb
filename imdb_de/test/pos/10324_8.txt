Clyde Bruckman borrowed the premise of this short film from Buster Keaton's "Seven Chances," which was recently replayed as "The Bachelor." In the original, Buster has 24 hours to marry to inherit a large sum of money. In this version, the music teacher Prof. Shemp has only 7 hours (after all, it's a short one!). This is one of the better Stooges shorts due to the storyline and wonderful routines (including the phone seating scene with Moe & Shemp starring at Laurel & Hardy's "Berth Marks" and the famous Marx Brothers stateroom scene in "Night at the Opera" remember) The guys are doing well in their variation of this routine.) I'm not a big Stooges fan, but this should be considered by any comedy student since the early 30s as one of the best of its kind.
