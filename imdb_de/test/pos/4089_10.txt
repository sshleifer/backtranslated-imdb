Why take a perfect original drama, based on an absolutely good novel, and make it a quasi-musical new? And occupied with actors who lack vocals or dance talent? Similar to "Showgirls" or the last two "Star Wars" movies, "Lost Horizon" is full of unintentional laughter. Who can forget Sir John Gielgud, who smiles uneasily in his Dali Lhama outfit and oversees an interpretation dance for the Republican party ("family")? Or Sally Kellerman, who lovingly crushes George Kennedy and makes her best impression as she hops from one rock to the other ("Every Little Thing You Do")? And my favorite, Bobby Van, who embodies the strength of the American education system ("Question Me An Answer")? I can not wait to release the DVD as hopefully comments from Liv Ullmann will be included, which will finally explain what she was thinking when she was ready to make this movie!
