Impressive. I saw this movie and "Up" the same day within an hour in different theaters. I first saw "Mr Bug" and then was totally disappointed in "Up" follow-up. What a beautiful and touching movie! Films of the 30s and 40s can annoy us today with their melodramatic drama and dialogue, but as an animation, the same melodrama and moaning humor can be wonderful. And the soft "organic" lines of the '30s draw AND the music just puts you in a pleasant mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybirds, grasshoppers, bees, snails, stinkbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets and more with all her sweet little (but not overbearing) idiosyncrasies. Interacting with the human world, from nemesis (cigar smokers, high-heel wearers, innocent kick-the-can-playing children) to kindhearted and unknown destroyers, is realistic and intriguing. They take care of the beetles, AND Dick and Mary. The protagonist Hoppity is not a perfect superman who wants to "get things right," but an optimistic optimist who walks the garden path (literally!), And every time you think he ends up happy in the 1930s style it to another roadblock ...! I was much more on the seat edge than with "Up". I walked out of the cinema, grinning and giggling. Something that has not happened for a long time!
