THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting film for HBO, who dealt in depth with the power struggle between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This fight is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who do not know the story and know where Letterman is now, it might be interesting to learn that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as the host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world, but Letterman noted that his dreams were disappointed. A frequent restaurateur, Leno had one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, Helen Kushnick, in his corner, working tirelessly to get her client's job done. It's not often that we see behind-the-scenes Hollywood machinations that have been redesigned for entertaining value, but for fans of these two late-night superstars, this movie offered a mesmerizing look at a very tumultuous time on late-night television. According to this film, Letterman was practically promised the job by Carson himself, while NBC Leno had promised the job, and here Helen Kushnick came into play. The film presents Leno as a kind of milkshot who manipulated and feigned his career of Kushnick's ignorance of some of Helen's strong-willed manipulations of some of NBC's biggest rulers, and Letterman is portrayed as a smart and smart businessman, despite Carson's support of NBC and Kushnick was hunted. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly restore Letterman and Leno, but it's the razor-sharp performance of Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates as Helen Kushnick gushes the film. Bates commands the screen in one of their best, if not so well-known performances as the venomous Hollywood agent who eats TV studio executives for breakfast. There's also a wonderful twist on Impressionist Rich Little as Johnny Carson, but it's first and foremost a fascinating story and Bates' powerhouse performance worth checking.
