My friend and I watched The Guardian. At first I did not want to see it, but I loved the movie. It was definitely the best movie I've ever seen. What they do and I think they should really be valued more. Not only was it taught, but it was a really good movie. The film shows what's really going on and how hard the job is. I think being a USCG would be a challenge and very scary. It was a great movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone. The end broke my heart, but I know why he did it. The story was great, I give two thumbs up. I was crying, it was very emotional, I would give him a 20 if I could!
