Caution-possible spoilers ahead ?? .. Just saw "Joe" for the second time. The first time was 30 years ago on an air force base. It reminded me of the Luftwaffe coat with Tech. Sgt. Stripes worn by the friend / dealer; We airmen laughed the first time that appeared on the screen, very laughing, because this is a "Lifer" rank. Over the years I have brought several other pictures from the movie. First and foremost, the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter was the executive. As someone else commented, you could not take your eyes off them. I did not know until now that this was a 20-year-old Susan Sarandon in her first movie. What a loss, that she did not make any more films when she looked like that. I also remember the irony of having a counterculture hero like Peter Boyle playing the title role of a right-wing gunner. Not unlike George C. Scott, the generals in dr. Strangelove and Patton plays. And of course, the shocking ending left a lasting impression. Over 30 years ago, this was the most talked about movie ever to be played on the base. We thought it was a great movie and I refused to see him again because I was afraid he would be as disappointing as Easy Rider. But when I saw it today, I was surprised how well the movie has lasted. It's a very strong script with few holes, though you'll have to ask yourself if the friend immediately comes out of the bathtub when Sarandon comes in with him. <br /> <br /> Looking for an explanation why this movie is still so entertaining I have to think it has something to do with the perfect physical cast. Boyle was physically credible as Joe (as others have pointed out that his portrayal inspired the character of the Archie Bunker a few years later). Did Ted Knight model his 'Caddyshack' character Judge Smails after Dennis Patrick's advertising man in 'Joe'? They look alike and sound the same. Patrick was absolutely confident that he was the over-grown boss of the upper middle class. And Sarandon's innocence with the Raggety Ann doll still evokes a protective response from all male audiences - perfect casting. <br /> <br /> The nude and drug scenes actually hold up (they were very provocative for their day) and are as clear as anything you can find in Thirteen. The only thing that dates this movie is that the violence is not realistic or graphic. "Joe" was about the same time as "The Wild Bunch," and the tone of the movie had just changed. <br /> <br /> Another reason why this film persists is that the events of recent years have revived the relevance of the theme and context of this film. The film portrays both types of "conservatives" as full of fear and hatred for the unconventional ways of counterculture. and full of envy about her free and hedonistic lifestyle. The counterculture is presented as ridicule about the straight culture; and though they are paranoid towards Conservatives (legitimately, since this was only a few months after Kent State), they can not resist displaying their lifestyle in order to resist. The political landscape does not differ more than 30 years later. I am not sure that conservatives envy young people and liberals as much as they did in 1970, but they fear and hate them more. <br /> <br /> An outstanding movie that is surprisingly as up-to-date as it was in the early 70's.
