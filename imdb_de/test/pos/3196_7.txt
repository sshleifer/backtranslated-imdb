This short was in the fourth installment of the Short Cinema Journal - a movie I rented on Netflix, but originally a monthly film series for people who like mediocre modern short films AND have the DVD full of commercials. I've tried two DVDs of the journal so far and was furious with how terribly a viewer has to navigate the hard drive to see the movies. Talk about an overproduced and too complicated procedure! I have and will continue to see as many shorts as I can and will continue to do so, but I really doubt if I will look at the journals for these factors. Now it could be so, because I did not like the record very much, that I was not positive about this Portuguese animated short film. That is definitely possible. But even if this is the case, I find that the other reviews on this simple little movie were far too positive. Part of the artwork was really beautiful - I liked how the simple black-and-white drawings suddenly turned into 3D environments when the camera dived into the city from a bleak remote shot. That was lovely and needed work. But as far as the story of a cat who wants to go to the moon, she just did not do anything for me. <br /> <br /> IMPORTANT UPDATE - I saw this movie on a DVD titled "Cartoon Noir" on February 5th / 09. It was a pretty nasty collection of art films. This time, however, I saw THE STORY OF THE CAT AND THE MOON with a completely different audio track. Instead of Portuguese with subtitles, it had a narrator with a French accent who spoke English in film noir style. I usually hate dubbing, but this time it really did make the movie. The narrative of the Portuguese version leaves much to be desired if you do not speak the language or understand the intricacies. If you do not speak the language, look for the other version (if you understand English).
