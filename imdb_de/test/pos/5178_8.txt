My whole family enjoyed this movie, including 2 small children. Great values ​​without sex, violence, drugs, nudity or obscenity. No billions of dollar special effects have been added to try to misdirect viewers from a badly written storyline. A simple little family fun movie. We especially like the songs in the movie. But we only heard some of the songs ... Mainly during the credits ... I would like to buy a soundtrack CD from this movie. This is my 4th Bill Hillman movie, and all have the same guidelines as mentioned above. With all the movies your kids are not supposed to see, this Hillman guy has no risk assessment. We love his films.
