Cult director Lucio Fulci is probably the most famous for his bloody zombie flicks from the 1980s, which earned him his rightful reputation as "Godfather Of Gore". However, Fulci's biggest movie ever dates back to 1972, and although he is definitely tough and violent, he is not nearly as bloody as many of his other films. "Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino" aka. "Do not Torture A Duckling" from 1972 is not only by far the best film by Fulci, this enticing and absolutely brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre. The breathtaking atmosphere and the exciting excitement, the great Sicilian scenery, the fascinating history, the brilliant performances or the intense moments of shock - I do not know what I should praise most about this brilliant Giallo! "Do not Torture A Duckling" really offers cinematic perfection in every respect, making it an absolute masterpiece of Italian horror cinema. <br /> <br /> Unlike other Gialli, seductive beauty queens do not kill one but little boy who is the victim of a murderer. Body of little boys are found in rural Sicily. While the police are desperately looking for the killer, the small town is essentially full of strangers, and the townspeople are screaming for a culprit ... <br /> <br /> The film is amazingly exciting and uncompromising with a somber one from the beginning , dark and constantly tense atmosphere that is not the same. The theatrical performances are among the best in Italian horror cinema. Tomas Milian (one of my personal favorite actors) is an outstanding leader as journalist Andrea Martinelli investigates the crimes. Sexy Barbara Bouchet delivers both a feast for the eyes and a brilliant performance. Equally outstanding achievements come from Irene Papas and Florinda Bolkan, who are absolutely brilliant in their role. The great score by Riz Ortolani brilliantly amplifies the excitement and atmosphere, and the film is brilliantly filmed in mesmerizing Sicilian landscapes. While not as bloody as many other Fulci films, this movie is definitely tough and uncompromising in its own right with a few shockingly brutal scenes. <br /> <br /> "Do not Torture A Duckling" has everything that horror needs. This is not quite as easy as most other Fulci films, but I assure you that it's worth the search. Every horror fan MUST see this personal favorite of mine, and I recommend to any real movie lover in general not to miss this. A masterpiece!
