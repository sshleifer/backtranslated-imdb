I really enjoyed this movie, it definitely keeps you on the edge of the seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they show the life of the other couple, as well as Terry and Bobby, and show them as people with emotions. Because this movie had to show Bobby as a cold and vengeful person. <br /> <br /> I agree with another review. He did not have to make much effort as a murderer to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decided to adopt a baby together. Some reviews say she was naive, I think she was adopting but the best actors. Great movie to watch !!
