With some wine, some friends and a good mood, I had a really good time watching this movie. I especially liked the appearance of Jilon Ghai (as "Randy"), who was such a kick in the pants! His scenes with Charity Rahmer ("Michelle") were amusing. I would not want him to come to me, but it was great to see "Randy" trying to score with "Michelle" and seeing the results even better! Of course, the girls in the movie are also a lot of fun. AND, a friend of mine showed me the PLAYBOY issue where Pilar Lastra was the Playmate of the Month. She is definitely a spectator. All in all, this film was entirely dedicated to its purpose, which should entertain us lightly and carefree.
