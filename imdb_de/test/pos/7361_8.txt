I can not believe that I liked it as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than the same, but the connecting story and its surprising ending fascinated me. Many familiar faces will make you ask "where have I seen them?" Forget the runtime listed on the New Line band. These are not 103 minutes, according to VCR timer and IMDB. Space Maggot pampers the campfire in his own way and moves with him an 8.
