Episode # 13 of the Fanciful (excuse the unbelievably gay terminology) "Supernatural" TV series pulls Sam and Dean Winchester to Missouri, where they were asked by an ancient Dean flame to investigate a series of mysterious murders in their small town. It turns out that a big pick-up truck with an invisible driver runs down African Americans on a lonely road ... While Dean tries to rekindle his past love affair, more and more residents of the city are turning up as street killers. The cause seems to be due to a past racial incident in the 1960s that left a frustrated Redneck spirit in a ghostly abeyance, trying to kill black drivers. "Route 666" is another good part (which is not unusual, as I've noticed), which includes some notable aspects related to the two main characters, like Dean leaving the game and Sam's admitted regret, the college Killer Truck is not the worst thing in the world, even though it works well for an hour. Not a fantastic episode, but a solid concept with more horror movie references.
