I usually try to avoid Barbie movies, but this one was unmistakably great. Kudos to the graphics and character voice over. Everything went well. This enchanting story is a great spin off from others, but worth the purchase! I do not have kids, but the babysites I babysit (including boys) find it intriguing and love the extra features on the DVD. I honestly do not know why this is rated so low, but for children especially your 8 year old Barbie will love. It's not easy and predictive like most movies. This "kids" movie has excellent morale and shows teamwork. It has no swearing, romances (if you're old enough to figure it out), and a beautifully written storyline. That's why I give him ten out of ten!
