What an incredible story and what a beautiful movie! It goes to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film communicates the passion of the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it hypnotized and almost gasped as the story unfolded to its inexorable end. The execution of this film was almost flawless: it is simple and pure and plays with our hearts. He directs us to understand the strange platonic, absolutely possessive connection between two creatures that should not be part of another's world. Both are capable of affection but, ironically, it is the "developed" that becomes dependent and possessive and can not accept the other's freedom. It is one of the most intriguing and intriguing insights into the many forms of love and an incredible study of how oppressive and destructive human love can sometimes be. <br /> <br /> Only a rudimentary mind would associate this story with bestiality.
