Anatomy is an entertaining and engaging film that misses the inconvenience that should be associated with the subject of the film. The idea of ​​ethical ignorance in medical science is one that drives the viewer to discomfort, and the realism of the institutions ('Heidelberg') and the special effects make it a not-so-easy movie. <br /> <The characters, the screenplay and the glamor of the movie, however, seem all too familiar with the scream movies that repopularized this genre. Unfortunately, while the subject is on the subject, the viewer is presented with another movie full of college characters we can not really care about, unresolved underground pieces and hammy stage murders that have been reinvented even since the memorable Drew Barrymore opening scene in Scream a few years ago. Steven Ruzowillzky does a pretty good job of scripting and directing, but pushes no boundaries other than the general theme. While we are presented with an entertaining film with some reasonable performances, unfortunately the old feeling remains with us: With this film nothing is wrong, but also nothing extraordinary. An entertaining film and an interesting film. A chance to see foreign filmmakers influenced by horror culture after the scream. 6 out of 10
