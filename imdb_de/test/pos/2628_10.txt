Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are great in this 1970s melodrama. The lush settings, the haunting music and the twists and turns of action make it a really interesting movie. I saw it when it first appeared on TV. When I had a video recorder, it ran again, but I had no opportunity to record it. Would love it on VHS if someone has a copy. Apart from the excitement (beautifully processed), I find that the story is unique and quite faithful to the book MRS. MAITLAND'S AFFAIR by Margaret Lynn. I would say that it was one of the most overlooked best films of the 70's made for television. I rated the film number 10 because it was made with so much originality. There is a true pathos and a romantic atmosphere that sympathizes with the viewer.
