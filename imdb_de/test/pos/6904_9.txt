If you want to see a great little horror comedy with an eerie feeling, this is the one for you. If you expect a blood-fast streak that will put off your pants, then this is not for you. <br /> <br /> For the budget that made this movie, the music was really great! Although the film was filmed on a budget, music and sound were definitely better than most movies with a huge budget! <br /> <br /> The story was really well done and the director is recommended. There is an almost perfect mix of comedy and horror in this movie! The acting is first class and leaves room for a sequel, which I definitely endure! I have no doubt that this film will become an instant cult classic. <br /> <br /> In short, this film tells the story of a boy who enters the career of a grave robber. It tells the story in retrospect of each of the more fantastic experiences the robber duo encounters. Vampires to zombies and even aliens! Our stars start out as simple grave robbers who steal for jewelry, but quickly become kidnappers of a crazy doctor (Angus Scrim) who needs bodies for his medical practice. When the duo finds a way to send a vampire to a cruel employer, the grave robbers discover that trading in undead corpses is far more profitable than just stealing ordinary corpses. The only problem is that there is another band called Murphy House competing for the same undead corpses - and that's where the two seriously robbing gangs collide head-to-head with dire consequences. One of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies I have have seen for years and that reminds me of the evil dead. Do not miss this, you will regret it!
