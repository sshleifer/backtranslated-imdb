In "Hoot" Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, the new student in the school, who has just moved from Montana. But Florida is very different from Montana. Despite the fade-in issues, Roy discovers a bigger problem. A new franchise restaurant is coming to town and families of burrowing owls are in trouble. Can the new kid, a tomboy (Brie Larson) and a runaway (Cody Linley) stop the big business from destroying those owls' homes? <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty good. The children (Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley) are the true stars of this film. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) is fine, but really does not matter much. Robert Wagner (Mayor) and Jimmy Buffett (Mr. Ryan) either. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this was a fun movie that the whole family will enjoy. For a first producer, I thought Jimmy Buffett had put together a high-quality piece. Plus the owls were really cute.
