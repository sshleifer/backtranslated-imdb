Yes, I know, Roscoe Arbuckle did not like to be called "Fatty," but I could not resist the joke. <br /> <br /> This is a good Lloyd Hamilton short film from his heyday directed by Roscoe. The two work together with many good gags and Roscoe's usual attention to the details to capture the picture in an interesting way. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a couple of long camera pans and some nice camera tricks to tell his story and show Ham as a good actor and a talented comedian. This story features some interesting topics, such as Lloyd's classic MOVE ALONG: It's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of it. Or you decide to ignore such problems and laugh at your head.
