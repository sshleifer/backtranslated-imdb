first real movie this year. amazing long shots, sometimes with fixed camera, so specific to Nordic cinema (except dogma). I find a real author's film. Athmospherique :-) It just delighted all my senses and did not forget how the picture becomes violent and painful during the scenes in which it tries to kill itself. That's the point that I believe he does not get up in the entire storyline. If this was an ideal world, you could not die, but you kept your conscience? Either there was the real world with "tailor made" rules or it was a "fantastic" world, but in this case no accidents can happen in which people remember what it was like before. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of Kafka and maybe more of Huxley's Brave New World, especially in the part where sex was actually available to everyone, as it was considered a right to enjoyment. There was no conspiracy, but I think it was better that you recognize and feel all the strange behavior of all people, the absurdity and the lack of real sentiments in this "happy" world. <br /> <br /> I think the end too was awesome. True World is indeed a homo homini lupus, you will be eaten if you are not strong enough.
