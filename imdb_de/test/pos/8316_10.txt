SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> I received this Dino documentary on DVD for Christmas 2004. I longed for it and was by no means disappointed. The score is memorable (my <br /> <br /> favorites were the theme song "Sauropod" and the song "Winters Coming"). The effects were dazzling, you could almost believe they were there. You actually learn something; Stegosaurs MAY were able to pump their plates with blood. Female T-Rexes COULD have gone to murder before laying eggs. I know there are a lot of people who think that this was based too much on speculation, but there will always be questions we can only guess. And there are also a lot of hard-core, undeniable FACT. We know that some dinosaurs were herding, we know that Diplodocus swallowed stones to grind the vegetation in their stomachs. Despite this "speculation" ran the series extremely well. So good that it resulted in a follow-up, a prequel and several specials. If you are a Dino fan then this is for you. The Jurassic Park looks small and unsightly.
