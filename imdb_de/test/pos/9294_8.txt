The funny team that brought you "CNNNN" and "The Chaser Decides" returned to ABC with their new series "The Chaser's War On Everything". Filmed in front of a live audience, the Chaser team is once again doing what it does best: political, international celebrities and media personalities. <br /> <br /> The satire is simply priceless and nothing is sacred. In recent weeks, the Chaser team, along with the Queen (during their visit to Australia), was hunted to reject John Howard, and Kim Beazley (Opp. Leader) threatened to kneel. <br /> <br /> A particularly funny is the Mr. Ten Questions segment, which features an overly enthusiastic reporter targeting celebrities (most recently Charlize Theron and The Backstreet Boys) and asking them ten such inhumane questions: "What is your optimal rice length?" Just for the record, Theron ignored him and walked away, and one of the Backstreet Boys got angry and "refused to acknowledge him with an answer." <br /> <br /> One segment that recently struck me was one of The team decided to become a "Statue Busker" to earn some money. When he realized how hopeless he was, he put a real statue in his place. THE PERFECT SCAM! In twenty minutes he got thirty dollars! <br /> <br /> A brilliant satire of everything in Australian society. Two thumbs up! <br /> <br /> (By the way, the show will not be shown three weeks after Easter because "although the team are all atheists, they are also hypocrites.")
