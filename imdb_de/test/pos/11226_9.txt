The harsh, cold landscape of Big Sky Country, with its majestic snow-capped mountains set in barren plains, is here in this Lynchian fable / slide show about the death and melancholy of the young and talented Polish brothers (who previously lived in Poland) Poetic Used Indie film fans have been dedicated to the bizarre and intriguing "Twin Falls Idaho" - a film about a young woman who falls in love with two brothers who happen to be Siamese twins. A small orphan dies and a city is flooded in the name of progress (in the form of a damned hydroelectric power station). With their eerily appealing music, minimalist dialogue and character development, as well as uncanny fantasy sequences with some unique angels, the Polish brothers focus on what every good movie artist thinks of a movie, the moving images ... the images, the scenes ... pictures of deep beauty, taken on celluloid. This should be best viewed late at night, so that the haunting images can linger in your head and flood you when you drift off to sleep. The fact that all this was done with a footwear budget of less than $ 2 million shames Hollywood on its bloated film costs and hollow films and shows that the Polish brothers are expecting something big in the future.
