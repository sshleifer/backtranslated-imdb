Fuckland is an interesting movie. I personally love the dogma movement. I wish it had taken longer. It already seems to have died. Many critics have done their best to turn it off. I do not know why. It is the most interesting movement in the film world since the French New Wave. Next to Fuckland I saw the first three of the series: festivals, idiots and mifunes. They were all great, festivals was in my opinion a masterpiece. Fuckland is not up to the others. I was just fascinated by filmmaking. It is played as if it were a real documentary, with a real person so obsessed with his camera, refusing to put it down. In some parts of the film, it becomes clear that this is a fiction, but the illusion has been dragged out for an astonishing time. I wish the filmmakers had come up with something more interesting. Basically it's about this guy, Fabian, an Argentinian who visits the Faulkland Islands. The Argentines were only allowed to visit the islands in recent months, and Fabian plans to impregnate the women with Argentinean children. He puts his eyes on one, and most of the film is spent for their seduction. The two actors are very natural. Camilla Heany just implies that she is an actress. Fabian Stratas seems to be completely real. The politics of the film is a bit confusing for me because I have only an idea of ​​the situation around the island and its recent history. I think I was three years old when the Faulklands invaded. The last part of the movie does not work at all. I do not understand what the filmmakers wanted there. Nevertheless, Fuckland is an interesting dogma experiment. However, it violates some dogma rules, especially the no-diagetic music rule. There is a lot of that. 10.7.
