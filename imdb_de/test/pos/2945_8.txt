I saw this movie today at the Philadelphia Film Festival and I liked it all in all. It is an interesting and well-founded analysis of the all-too-common revelation that our parents' marriage was more flawed and difficult than we had originally imagined. In addition, this film is a great example of exposing truths about our parents' lives after their deaths and their associated problems. I found the sound quality (recording and editing), however, relatively bad and annoying. *** It may well have something to do with the specific theater and projection conditions. *** I am not a filmmaker / student or anything else and am not claiming that he really understands the sound production process, but as a consumer I have distracted the audio found part of the movie. In particular, I heard very unpleasant lip noise through the film (especially a long interview with the younger sister), and often the background noise level was louder than the voices of people (for example, the scene in which a small group raided the movie mothers papers). Has anyone else seen this movie, he noticed something about the sound ... thanks
