Women will like this movie better than men. Of course women like all romantic comedies more than men - on average. I like romantic comedies in general a lot, but I think this is 5.5 for the first 50% of the movie, about 6.5 for the next 40%, and about 9 for the last 10%. I feel like reluctant rate with 7. I make films and rated all movies as 7 or better and none with 6 or worse - at least that's my goal. I have over 1200 movies, so why keep the dogs. <br /> <br /> My wife liked this movie more than me, though I'm not sure why. I'm a bigger Drew Barrymore fan than she is. <br /> <br /> This film was about a young woman returning to high school to write a story about today's high school experience. The first time she was in high school, she was an idiot and must learn to be cool the second time. Her journey towards cooldown and her falling in love with a teacher is history. What drove me crazy in the first half of the movie was how mangy she looked. I wondered why they would choose her for this role until I realized how capable she is of looking like a dog. So much so that I really do not think I want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning. ARGH! Of course, she eventually turned into a pretty attractive (cute) woman, and she became very popular. <br /> <br /> The end is about 9.9 on the very sweet scale, so you like it. Otherwise it is not very memorable and easy to miss.
