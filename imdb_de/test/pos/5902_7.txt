This is not quite the best Canadian movie, IMO. I do not get off track and call 3 or 4 better. Only a few nights before I had seen "The Bicycle Thief", the highly rated Italian classic, and there are some parallels. Both filmmakers filmed their film at a specific time and location, with minimal resources for sets and cast. In both cases, the result is fascinating and it's fun to take care of the realistic surroundings and characters on your own. The long strokes over faces and landscape make this picture almost worth seeing. Apart from that, this is not quite in the same league as the Italian classic. The film is filmed in a cold, barren asbestos mining town in Quebec. This frigidity contrasts with the warmth of the people and the eye of filmmaker Claude Jutra. Basically, you get a bunch of vignettes, which are probably nostalgic memories of Jutra - not ha, ha funny - but poignant and probably sometimes difficult, but now overheated with the patina of nostalgia. The film meanders; There is little tension. Somewhere between half and two-thirds begins the story. Everyone you've met so far is involved, and you've gotten to know these characters pretty well. so you have some patience at the beginning. The story is good; It will make you think, and it includes sex, love and death, all the basic elements. If you like Bergman, Godard, Truffaut and all these things, you will not be disappointed.
