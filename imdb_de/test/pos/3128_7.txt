The Western can be divided into many subgenres. One of the widest divisions is the one between Town Westerns and Plains Westerns. Most westerns are a mixture of the two, but at one end of the spectrum are images like High Noon and Rio Bravo, which are almost exclusively in a settlement and seldom move into real nature. On the other hand, there are such as Wagon Master, where in the wild hardly a homestead can be seen. John Ford, director John Ford, was usually on the "play" of the two westerns and shot the interiors with a focus on making them small and tight, and then juxtaposing them with the open-air outdoor spaces that are both exciting also look dangerous. Wagon Master has a typical Frank Nugent script with an interplay between experienced oldsters and green teens, but it still presents some new challenges to Ford. In this picture, the dangers come not from the harsh landscape, but from the group in the form of Cleggesen. In addition, the lack of real interior scenes means that the external effect may become less important over time. <br /> <br /> Ford, however, was a true maestro when it came to manipulating space. He turns scenes of the warehouse or wagons so that the frame is framed and we get the same feeling of inclusion as if we were in a real interior. Compared to his other Westerns, he does not open the room too much by running the car path through ravines and passes instead of traversing the bare and empty plains. One of the few moments in which he raises the landscape wide is when the Indians are discovered and there is a threat of external threat. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master offers some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief and some great contributions from the whimsical cast. Harry Carey Jr. became a good actor like his father, and this is one of his better early roles. Joanne Dru was disappointing because she wore a yellow band, but she seems to be feeling a bit sass as a character and is actually pretty good here. Jane Darwell, who won an Oscar in John Ford's Grapes of Wrath ten years earlier, performs the only function here of performing a running gag in which she plays a faint old horn. Nevertheless, with her great timing and movement, she makes the piece to work. Francis Ford, in one of the many silent drunkard roles he played in his little brother's pictures, is of his cheeky best. <br /> <br /> And now we come to lead the man Ben Johnson. Although he was by no means a bad actor, he would never become a big star like John Wayne. And yet he was one of the most authentic "West" players with his effortless equestrianism and relaxed flair. And that brings me to my last point. This was obviously one of Ford's personal favorites, though it seemed pretty nondescript. Wagon Master does not have a big theme or dramatic intensity, it's just the genre that is going on. I think that's what Ford loved about this movie. It's a picture for the Ben Johnsons and the Harry Carey Jrs, not for John Waynes or Henry Fondas. Small in scope, but worthy of his class.
