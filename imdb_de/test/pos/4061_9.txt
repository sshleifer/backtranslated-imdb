Dad (78) and I (46) both had a good time watching the movie today. For a man primarily known for serious roles, De Niro is a comical actor. Of course, it helps if you have his earlier film images against him. Imagine, one of these roles, 15 MINUTES, was a police officer who had to deal with the interference of mass media, and you have interesting comparison and contrast performance. <br /> <br /> Murphy plays another of his Axel Foley type of characters. Shatner plays a burlesque of himself, a parallel world self best known for TJ HOOKER and not STAR TREK. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of policing and its work, fictitious colleagues in television and film. Shatner gives talks on proper gliding over a hood. De Niro points to holsters scratching the bonnet finish. Ironically, as the film progresses, the character of De Niro begins to integrate the illusions of the TV cop's reality into the real world in which he works. The film takes its inspiration from a number of sources, so you could do that make the comment, it's derived. Well so what? Satire has to deduce its humor in order to exist. Besides, the movie has original moments. For example, I'm pretty sure the villain's death method has never been done. <br /> <br /> A doubt about the reality of the weapons involved - would not these weapons have had a kind of recoil? In order to penetrate steel, these balls had to have enough inertia to penetrate. The highest moment of inertia of a sphere is at the moment of the shot. So ... firing a salvo of these tank killer missiles would have driven the shooters back on their asses. Oh, what the hell ... it's a satire. Perhaps the cannon's lack of recoil itself is a satire on the B-F guns so casually used in thrillers. <br /> <br />
