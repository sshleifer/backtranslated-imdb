I have just returned from the European premiere of The Gamers: Dorkness Rising. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if you are a player (CRPG, RPG or LARP), this movie is for you. And if you are not a player? Well, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The acting is certainly not Oscar-worthy, but in the whole element of the film it adds to the charm. The humor is ubiquitous, along with some very nice accents (the tribute to Gary Gygax is especially well done, if you can see it). The performers are very down to earth in their appearance, which does justice to the fact that they are ordinary people who like a normal hobby. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film and the picture quality are reasonable, but all in all, it is only part of the atmosphere that helps define this film as the movie "Dungeons and Dragons" by Gamers are written and performed for gamers. <br /> <br /> You are not afraid to use terminology that is specific to a system to be part of the movie, but in a very understandable and totally fair way. It also touches on some of the perceived prejudices some gamers may have about other gamers, and handles them pretty well. All in all, the movie is very much about a thoughtful, balanced balance of character, action and entertainment (the bard is amazingly good value for money). <br /> <br /> In the end, filming this movie is pretty tough, so I gave him 2 points. <br /> <br /> Score (for non-RP'ers): 7/10 (A few moments might be over your head, but the main parts of the movie just work so hard and do so much more.) <br /> <br /> Score (for RP'er): 10/10 (Everything fits together, in perfect quantities and with perfect charm and feeling)
