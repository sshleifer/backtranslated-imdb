Excellent performance. There are still good actors! Also great director and photography. Very loyal to Shakespear and a must for all Shakespear fans. Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his last monologue (out of a short candle, out). He gave the sphere of moral decay and the dark forces a human face, which makes it all the more interesting. Helen Baxendale is a very credible Lady Macbeth, who can sometimes be very happy and sometimes she looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. If you love death and decay and the lyrics of Shakespears ... this is one.
