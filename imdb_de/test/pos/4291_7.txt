Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a pleasure! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett, the supporting roles were rounded off to fours by lies and intrigues. The central point, however, is that every character has a decency to be decent - the moral conscience is maintained despite obvious contradictions. "Contradictions are the source of all movement and all life." How true are these words. Watson's Anne Manning is at the heart of these intrigues - she is the central conscience to which the other three cling. She is unperturbed by decency. <br /> <br /> The circumstances of lies are something special for everyone: one to defend one's professional name; one who has to hold back due to pressure from the family / partner; one simply does not want to face the consequences; ironically, one can not believe the truth and the lie to save the friendship. These are all precarious situations. There lies the intrigue - fascinating to see how everyone tackles the truth and lies. Contradictions in fact. Despite the apparent shame decency and heart remain strong. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the theme and how each character behaves are masterfully and clearly presented. It's not sensational or complex as another film "Where the Truth Lies" 2005. Thanks to Fellowes' writing and the differentiated performances of Watson and Wilkinson. There is some kind of warmth that comes from the seemingly bold face or frustrating hidden lies. Of all this, human weakness not excluded, they meant well. Following the story, the turn of events gave satisfaction and a smile on how the two Manning's have grown in their relationship. <br /> <br /> You could say that in "Separate Lies" there is no obvious action drama or exciting scenes, but the intrigues are there and will grab your attention. To deserve production efforts include the filmography of Tony Pierce-Roberts (a veteran of Merchant Ivory films) and music by Stanislas Syrewicz, where mood and sound to the composer Zbignew Priesner (the filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski Trois Couleurs, especially: Bleu 1993) recall. This is a British movie that you might not want to miss. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson (Anne, the Woman): Breaking the Waves debut in 1996; Hilary and Jackie 1998; The Luzhin Defense 2000; Gosford Park 2001; Punch-Drunk Love, Red Dragon, Equilibrium in 2002. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson (James, the husband): The Full Monty 1997; The Governess, Rush Hour (as a villain) in 1998; In the bedroom 2001, Normal (HBO Cable Film) 2003, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004, recently as Father Moore in: The Exorcism of Emily Rose 2005 alongside Laura Linney.
