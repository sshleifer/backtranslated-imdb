First, I rated this movie with 10/10. For me it's just one of the best I've seen since I was born (I'm 23, but I've seen a lot of movies). The story is cruel, but the reality is not? It went deep inside me and touched my guts. I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and I still remember it! Second, there is no "national preference" (this term is a direct translation from French) of this film. I mean, it's not like that because it's a French movie I put up so high: it really got me when I saw it. Besides, I do not know very well what Marcel Carne 's filmography is, so I do not know if it' s his best movie or not, but I know it 's not his most famous: Hotel du Nord, Quai des Brumes and Les Enfants du Paradis most famous. Third, the film is in B & W, but it deals with temporary problems of youth (not acne) like love, friends and studies in a modern way. It could even be played frame by frame with real young actors, a Dolby (tm) sound and special effects (a car crash), it would still be a great movie! <br /> <br /> Problem: Maybe it's It's a movie that can be seen by young adults (between 16 and 25 years old) - and of course beyond that - in order for the message to be well understood ... I did said that it was a great movie?
