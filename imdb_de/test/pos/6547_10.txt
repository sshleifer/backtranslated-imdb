I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and was fascinated. The only Japanese horror movie I've ever seen was KWAIDAN (which, by the way, I'm proud to own a DVD), great! The idea that a city is absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like Lovecraft's. It is certainly reminiscent of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, of the inhabitants who are slowly turning into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). And who can forget the washing sequence? I hope we will make these available on Region-1 DVD soon (I see Sundance recently showed it on US TV, hopefully they'll do it again soon) so we can all see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
