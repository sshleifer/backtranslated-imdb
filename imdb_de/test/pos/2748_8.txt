William Wellmann, who shot one of the most exciting silent films of all time with "Wings" (1927), returns here with another compelling story of Daredevil Flyers. Wellmann had been an air ace in World War I, and nobody knew biplanes like him. Here they are, stunts fly, crash, explode in the air, and everything you can imagine, as well as a fascinating glimpse of the commercial operations of 1932. And there's a good, strong story, honored by the gritty Richard Barthelmess ( the silent star that has made several films with DW Griffith), Sally Eilers and Tom Brown. Eilers is a real Sizzler. Such a relief to see a real woman with real fire and character, rather than one of those phototyped, blind dummies who play in movies in today's Hollywood and all look identical. The story is sad, played with real pathos and well directed. Towards the end of the film, there are some exceptionally exciting scenes of danger and rescue and probably the most ingenious blind landing in the dense fog that was ever thought of. I must not betray the genius aspects of this episode. The character played by Barthelmess is very similar to Wellmann himself, a truly wild hell-lover in the air. Anyone who likes early aviation would love this movie, and it's very rewarding to anyone who likes good solid entertainment, love, tears, and uninterrupted action in a sort of delicious Wellman omelet.
