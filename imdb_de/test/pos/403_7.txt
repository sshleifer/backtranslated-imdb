Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [# 4/10] with atmospheric, almost noir black and white photography and gorgeous Spanish-American backdrops and sets. And also a more unconventional story! <br /> <br /> A man who looks like the crazy murderer of his first two wives will be found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party. The Crime Doctor is on-site (supposedly as a guest) to declare him murdered immediately and resignedly, and so we are considered with a rather strange group of people thinking about it, because one of them did the act. Was it the foaming brother of the deceased First Wife, the third wife and rich widow Hilary Brooke, the dancing brother and sister vampires, the intense young man, the eccentric cabinet maker Lloyd Corrigan, who was loaned out by Boston Blackie, the irreplaceable butler or the disagreement on Jerome Cowan? Police Inspector Emory Parnell had quit his job, but Warner Baxter as Ordway was as unwavering as ever. One of the fools listed on the IMDb is wrong: When Ordway broke into the murder chamber, he says, "Through the middle of the forehead," and Cowan replies, "This time he has not missed." Favorites: Baxter and Cowan traveled through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make up for their interrupted dinner party. The scene in which Braga's resting place lies seems to be bumpy. The plot sometimes seems to shift a bit, and the way everything was explained might have been more monogrammed, but if you let it be supernatural in the air, that would not be the case! <br /> <br /> It's worth it If you already like the genre, you will not be disappointed, unless you really do not like the genre.
