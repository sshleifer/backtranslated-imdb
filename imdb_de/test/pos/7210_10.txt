If you have never been "tromatised", this is the Troma movie you must first see. Amazing acting, charged soundtrack and wicked humor fit perfectly with Troma's unique brand of storytelling and special effects. Although Romeo and Juliet are not said to be word for word, the fact that it behaves in Iambic pentameters gives the strange feeling that it is closer to Shakespeare than the exaggerated music video with DiCaprio and Danes. I suspected I had seen the ultimate Shakespearean comedy when the cast of Moonlighting overtook The Taming of the Shrew, but Tromeo and Juliet did not come near her. I strongly recommend the DVD version, which includes a second audio track with director Lloyd Kaufman as entertaining as the main track.
