River's Edge is a very disturbing film written by renowned American screenwriter Neal Jimenez. It is based on an actual event that happened at a time when most American teenagers were trying to understand their lives. This is one of the most outstanding films made by American director Tim Hunter. Much of the film's focus is on a ruthless murder committed by an intrepid teenager. This unfortunate event raises a series of questions about the real motivations of teenagers in American society. The first publication must have had vivid memories of the great actor Dennis Hopper in a confused role as a sympathetic social outsider. Matrix star Keanu Reeves also looks good as a teenager before he reaches star status. At a time when teen flicks are being made without serious preparation, one hopes that "River's Edge" can not simply be ignored as another stupid teenager. It had a massive impact on people who lived in turbulent times of the past than the one Residents of a sleepy city almost was not born. For today's generation with its heady Internet props like Facebook, Twitter and Orkut River's Edge may seem outdated, but its serious admirer can not deny it.
