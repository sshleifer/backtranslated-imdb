A complete staging of the director telling the story of the Qin Emperor's ambitious plan to unify all kingdoms of China. Some great characters, sets, costumes and scenes. However, I was not thrilled with the movie as far as the skills of the actors are concerned (which I particularly liked) or the look (although the troop deployment was extremely impressive when it comes to being a real man, extras!). <br /> <br /> I have seen Li Gong in other films and she is always great. I think a good deal, but not one, to judge true historical accuracy. Good movie and found the 2 1/2 + hours no problem. <br /> <br /> Rating 7 out of 10.
