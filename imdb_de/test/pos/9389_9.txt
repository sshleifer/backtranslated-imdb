I love B-horror movies. However, I'm not usually a big fan of "so stupid, that's funny" movies. I MUST rate this so easily because Death Bed: the bed that eats is so unique and so original. There are many question marks, many action holes, and the WTF factor has ramped up to 11, but I did not get bored for a second. I really could not call it scary, every minute I said to myself, "What the hell is this bed / movie going to do next?" I saw this with a friend who does not like horror movies or B movies at all, and even she was pretty pretty. The effects were indeed very imaginative and the colors and atmosphere were pretty good. The movie remains very even and even (though ridiculously ridiculous) throughout most of the movie and the acting was not terrible. I can see at the point that there are certain discrepancies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of belief almost impossible, but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that it did not really bother me. Seriously, this film has hit me for the hit, which I will not only never forget, but I guarantee that I will think back to certain scenes in the future. Does anyone else know any movies in inanimate objects that people are eating genre? totally fantastic
