I hate vampire movies. This statement was very interesting for me. I want to point out one thing. "bakjwi" literally means bat in Korean, and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, Count Dracula or vampires become a thug and fly away or wuheva fly. We also know that bats are mammals that can fly, which many consider "extraordinary". When I saw the movie, I realized that the subject of bat is deeply embedded in this movie, and not just to make the connection between bat and vampire. Duality of Human Nature = If you read Aesop's Fables, There is this fable in which mammals and birds fight, and a bat does not seem to strike any side, and it tries to play both sides to its advantage. Mammals and birds learn what this bat has done and drive the bat out of their land at the end of the story. <br /> <br /> The two contradictory sides of human nature struggle throughout the movies. sang-hyun's blind priestly friend, sang-hyun's effort to quench the thirst and his sexual desire, tae-ju plays on both sides, her ordinary, boring life. Watch movie) and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance, sex, violence, religion, dark comedy, tragedy, revenge, you name it! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is too boring and too long, but this movie is very fresh and new, something I have not seen before. I would not say that this is the best work of CW Park, but it is mos. def. the strangest thing to understand, yet darkly fascinating!
