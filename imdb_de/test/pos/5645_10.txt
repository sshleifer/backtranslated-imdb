This is probably the biggest war movie and certainly one of the biggest movies. There is no sentimentality, no patriotic agenda, not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this sombre glimpse of what we can only call hell. It is this quiet severity and lack of manipulation that gives the film its amazing power. There are no attempts to turn Ichikawa's protagonist Tamura into a hero. He's just a poor, fucking bastard trying to stay alive in a world of horror hoping, but he's not sure he can hold on to his humanity. Ichikawa's intense lack of affection and illusion leave fire on the plane alone. Ichikawa died in February 2008.
