In fact, the nature of the entire series is irresistibly funny! But not always funny ... There are moments of extreme punch as the deeper aspects of human emotions are touched. <br /> <br /> Time and again, the series comments on the weaknesses of human nature and the lifelong, or in this case eternal, effort to overcome them. Monkey is smart and stupid at the same time. His arrogance and his reliance on his own martial arts make him in trouble in almost every episode. Pigsy is just rough. Sandy has a philosophical attitude. He has many of the funniest lines. <br /> <br /> The English translation is a pleasure. "Ignorance can always be improved," Sandy retreats casually, "but you can not do anything for stupidity!" "Who are you?" The tour group is asked. "We are three kings of the East," says Monkey. <br /> <br /> This is not just for kids, it's a magical trumpet for those who can face reality
