The real case of an innocent First Nations Chief (the Indians) of a Winnipeg City Officer (the cowboy) is the basis of this television movie. The actual case caused a degree of racial tension in Canada, a minor matter of Martin Luther King. The injustice of the First Nations people is becoming a fixture in the Canadian Cinema Diet. What makes the movie worth seeing is the focus on the reactions of the family. The father of Gordon Tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother of Eric Schweig calls for justice. The stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach (WINDTALKERS, SKINWALKERS) have smaller, almost cameo-like appearances. The soon to be star Eric Schweig gets involved in this film with a powerful performance. An honorable mention goes to the experienced actor Gary Chalk, who has brought more than 100 films at his own expense. His portrayal of the troubled Soul Inspector Dowson was worthy along with Eric Schweig of a Gemini Award (the Canadian Emmy). The special effects (jump cuts, dream sequences) are occasional and not overbearing. Combine this with beautiful scenery in northern Canada and recent events involving police and First Nations people like the Neil Stonechild case, and you have a very rewarding and relevant experience.
