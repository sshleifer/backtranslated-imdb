Lovable stupid anime, just six episodes, about an unfortunate delivery boy named Kintaro (though he's called a delivery boy, even though he's in his twenties) and the adventures he undertakes on the road. Each episode sees him arrive in a new city, get a new job, and develop some love interest before each episode ends up leaving. <br /> <br /> Gently sexist, youthful, sometimes very immature, that's the kind of anime that just puts a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Not at the beginning, if you are not a fan of anime, as this will certainly not convince you about the genre, but for those who are already converted, that's fluff.
