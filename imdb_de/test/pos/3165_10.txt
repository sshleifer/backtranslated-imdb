I saw it in Europe. Great movie!! <br /> <br /> This film explores the spirit and flesh of modern times. The protagonist Jim Kirk drives through America with an unwieldy motorhome and often stops to fill his gas tank. He is middle-aged and confused. He refuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio talk. He is the flesh: excited and sometimes at a distance, quite unaware of the growing tension he experiences around him but feels uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The mind pervades the film through talking and other sounds as well as through what appears and passes through the field of vision. The mind finally collides with the flesh and Kirk goes down without understanding what happened to him. He has rejected how bad things have become, because he is so reckless of us all because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. We are all in the same denial, and so, like Kirk, we run the risk of going down and being blown away by desert sand like himself.
