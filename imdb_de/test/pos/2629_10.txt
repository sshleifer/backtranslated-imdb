I saw this movie for the first time at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my absolute favorites! It's a classic - the fascinating storyline, great characters, excitement and shocking ending (all set against the backdrop of the beautiful Monterey / Big Sur coastline) are never old. Roy Thinnes portrays Johnny Brant, a fascinating figure who becomes more mysterious as his true identity unfolds. The show is great and believable. Viewers get into the net that develops between the workaholic husband, the disappointed wife and the seductive stranger (Thinnes as Brant). For years I've been looking for a copy that I can buy - I guess TV movies are not released as a video. Great movie, see it if you can find it.
