I almost stopped watching Hindi films because of the mediocre quality and storylines. An exception are Ramgopal Verma films. This is a nice movie with great performances from the Starcast. This is a must-see movie for those who are tired of seeing stupid dance and love stories. The adaptation of the story and the characterization was exceptionally good. You should see this movie for Nana Patekar. Based on the life of Mumbai policeman Daya Naik, this film deals more realistically. The film deals with the life of the simple man, whom he knows not only as a specialist for encounters. I rate this as one of the best films of the year
