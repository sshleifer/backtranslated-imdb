Our family and friends really enjoyed this movie. The theme was well handled by the director with great performances by Shabana Azmi and Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast members. The climax was well built, but for the end it was not "good" for a long time. We are still trying to understand what the director wanted to convey. Did you have too few ideas or was the ending understandable for all movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the audience ship. However, this should not mean the recognition of Konkana and Shabana Azmi for the good relationship with the characters.
