A wonderful story that should be seen by all families. The story, the drama and the production values ​​are all first class. I recommend "Checking Out!". <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderful as an aging actor who wants to decide when he will die so he can continue to know how things will end and not be a member of the audience. "His three children hurry after him New York to confront him and change his mind There are, of course, unresolved family issues that need to be addressed, and the script and actors treat them well and with great humor. <br /> <br /> The story is about from a Jewish family, but it could also be any other family Well, maybe not a WASP family The siblings have problems with each other and also with their dad I loved writing, governing and acting All in all humorous and touching movie.
