I have to admit that I did not see this movie in the theater. Since he came out at the start of a summer blockbuster season, this cute little movie could not help but lose himself in the shadow of multi-million dollar special effect films, right? <br /> <br /> "" Return to Me "has a beautiful and straightforward story at its core, headed by Bonnie Hunt (who herself has acted as an actress in a series of great pictures as an actress ...) The charming story is beautifully woven with clever comedy and brought to life with outstanding performances by veterans as well as younger actors. <br /> <br /> To those who say that David Duchovny did not have a really good way out I agree with his "Fox Mulder" format, seeing his other film work and being by far the best he could have done for himself, Minnie Driver is just beautiful, charming, funny and vivacious in her role as Grace But outside these two leads, you're surrounded by Grace's close-knit family and friends, Jim Belushi is an absolute prick, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real force and not to mention the talents of Robert Loggia and the lovingly deceased Carroll O'Connor. Ironically, I saw this movie again on DVD the day before his death. This was his last movie, and he gave a performance that an actor of his caliber could certainly be proud of as the finale of a great career. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Return To Me" turned around. I was still a funny love story and turned it into a movie that has become one of my favorites! Take the time to rent them ... it's well worth the effort!
