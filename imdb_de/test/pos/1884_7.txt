That was a funny movie. After seeing the Evil Dead trilogy a week ago (and wanting more), I got as many Bruce Campbell films as possible, including really bad ones. This is funny, without being extraordinary, but as safe as hell. <br /> <br /> I mean, you have crazy scientists, superhuman cyborgs, half-freaks, gypsies, former KGB drivers, jealousy, passionate murders, love, romance, sex, action and more, all with the same 6 actors :) <br /> <br /> You really have to see and enjoy it, I can not explain it in a text box. I think it's not so much a cult movie as Evil Dead was, but Bruce Campbell definitely touches me. Ted Raimi helps, Tamara Gorski looks both beautiful and interesting (she left the hooker on Friday, the 13th) and Vladimir Kolev also shows promise as an actor, though he will probably be a minor character. He films in Hollywood his entire career. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: funny movie. If you liked Evil Dead, you will like it too.
