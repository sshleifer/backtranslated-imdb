I have to admit, before I saw this movie, I thought, this is one of those slack love stories in which everything works well. but I proved wrong when I sat down to look at it. I actually thought it was a really good story about a family going into a dance park for three weeks. There, the youngest daughter, Baby, finds love, but finds it difficult to find there with her new love because she disagrees with her father. But on the way, another dance teacher helps and risks the whole relationship ... A really heartwarming movie like no other. <br /> <br /> 10/10
