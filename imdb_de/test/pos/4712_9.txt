I always wanted to see this movie, and when I finally came to, I knew I was surprised when John Boorman's name appeared on the screen. Mostly for his epic films (he directed the first Conan directed and Apocalypse Now written) in the classic Hollywood structure, this fits in with his catalog. <br /> <br /> I also can not say how perfect this is The timing was given that Myanmar (Burma) is again undergoing a riot of monks and students against the government run by the military government "junta", which is exactly the same (there has been a change of leadership since then but is essentially the same) movie from 1988. Now, due to recent events, this film has to be aired more than ever on TV (caught on the IFC).
