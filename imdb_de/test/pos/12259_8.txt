Spooky journalist Holly Hunter produces investigative news for a major news network. She is an outsider with a motorized mouth, dazzling in her work and with little time for romantic relationships. Here are William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men fighting for their love. Brooks is an old school journalist who loves Holly because she is good at journalism. Both believe that the media exist to test the gods, educate the public and fight for the truth. Children of the sixties embody hippie values. They are defenders of the public good. Knights bravely fighting with pen and camera. William Hurt, on the other hand, is a much more complex character. At first awkward, awkward and humiliating, he gradually reveals himself as a sexy and manipulative performer who can step up the corporate ladder. In contrast to Holly and Brooks, he symbolizes modern media values: news as a spectacle, journalism as entertainment, newscaster as a celebrity, truth as editorial director. We want to despise him and his blip-time junk food journalism, but we just can not do it. He plays the game according to his own rules. Do we judge him because he lacks a moral backbone? Are we condemning the game? Can the game exist if its rules are not followed? How did these rules develop? <br /> <br /> This is not the network of Lumet and Chayefsky, so the movie does not bother them. Satisfied with keeping things level with the light comedy, it ends with Hurt being promoted to the London Division and Brooks becoming a tiny community network. Holly has rejected both men and remains trapped between them. As the last bastion of media integrity, the spooky reporter recalls his roots, mourns for Brooks, and warns himself to be on the guard of the future William Hurts. "The film is positively banal." Chayefsky's vision is a vision of global media in spite of her He foresees a world in which globalization has homogenized cultures, information is subject to corporatization, and a handful of media monopolies control all international news.This is a world in which the truth is subject to shareholder meetings and economic interests A World Where Audience Reviews Define Content And Opinion Polls Define Top Stories. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's why "Broadcast News" yearning for the glory days of journalism ends with such a bittersweet note, it knows what the future holds poses in 1987, has been living for at least a decade. <br /> <br /> But today, in the digital age, things are even worse. Through mergers and acquisitions, very few massive companies have dominated the communications landscape. This involves the hyper-commercialization of content, the barrier between the creative / editorial and the commercial side has almost collapsed. Today everyone can start their own blog or website, but these are basic issues. As the individual's reach of communication increases (due to technological advances - e-mail, internet, electricity, air mail, etc.), the world of the individual also increases. He has to project his voice both farther and louder, desperately battling that deafening white noise, the incessant verbal statics of the world community. <br /> <br /> So in the end, you need two things according to democratic theory. First, you need a strong coming of rulers and people who want to be in power, both in the private and public sectors. Secondly, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all the important issues of the day. In a democratic society, the media system as a whole should create that kind of culture. Unfortunately, the current structure of the global system directly addresses the needs of democratic journalism and a democratic society. <br /> <br /> 8/10 ?? It's lightweight, but a witty script, some funny moments, and a short cameo by Jack Nicholson set it apart from most other films about journalism. Interestingly, unlike most films about the media, she never submits to satire and instead plays things as a straight triangle. <br /> <br /> Worth a look.
