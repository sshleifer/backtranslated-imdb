Being from the Buffalo area, I knew that the film had read many articles in local publications. The film impressed me the most, especially the clever plot, the acting and the local scenes. Nice to see so many older quality stars in different roles. I have the feeling that especially the over-50's will find the movie excellent and you can leave the theater if you have spent your time well.
