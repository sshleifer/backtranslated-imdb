In a better civilization, these and many other films by David Suchet would appear in theaters. The actions are fabulous (no, I would have no idea who did that, but the clues were all there if I had been more resourceful - the best secret), the production values ​​amazing, the acting (by Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Lysette Anthony, Megan Dodds and of course David Suchet (Hercule Poirot) are just perfect, the dialogue is wonderful, the music and the feeling of excitement and excitement are just wonderful stuff. <br /> <br /> One of the joys of this Hercule- Poirot movies for a man show how many beautiful women play in them! Here were two - the sexy sinuous Megan Doods and the stunning Lysette Anthony. <br /> <br /> You really can not go wrong in renting these - they are just wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind works all the time because everything is there and you fight, but if you think all the time, thinking can keep up with everything - and the attitudes are great. <br /> <br /> I can not think of thought-provoking films as these Hercule Poirot / David Suchet movies. It's impossible to overprice her - and I'd never read an Agatha Christie a few months ago.
