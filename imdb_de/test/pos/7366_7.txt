Good (not great) little horror movie with a high "creep" factor (not to be confused with a movie of the same name from 1991 or the newer (2001) Campfire STORIES). A central story of stranded teenagers sharing ghost stories around a campfire in spooky forests nicely blends in with the various stories that make up the bulk of the film (Watch for Ron Livingston (Office, Band of Brothers) and Jennifer MacDonald in a movie spirited , sexy segment ("The honeymoon")). Solid drama and a few really "terrifying" moments make this machine an above average cooler. A good example of an interesting plot, paired with a quality ensemble that yields more than the sum of its parts. "Surprise" End of the main story adds a nice scary twist, though some may see it coming. Film is not available on DVD, but on VHS.
