This was a very funny, fast movie. I have seen it more than once and keep my rent for others. I just want to use this opportunity to ask someone how HK producers choose their subtitle translators. I am very curious. Please guide me. <br /> <br /> To reiterate: It's a really great movie with a lot of content, subtleties that are reminiscent of the classics but full of slapstick. Remember, for example, the Mexican comedies of Cantinflas. <br /> <br /> The film does not disappoint the director's fans, who have noticed that he is clearly picking Chinese topics and trying to get to properties that are rarely explored. The director's entire collection is a kind of disarming insight into the culture. <br /> <br /> And I do not see how his funny girl could be crowned in Chinese Feast.
