I use "Princess Raccoon" (to give the film its not very accurate English title) as litmus test for the humor of my friends. It leaves them either cold and confused - as apparently other commentators on this site did - or it leads to doubled laughter, unassailably large grins, and occasional gasps of admiration. <br /> <br /> The laughter comes from the movie mix of contemporary-style parodies. Targets include a bouquet of Japanese and Western classical stage forms, from Kabuki to late Shakespearian and the Christian fantasy of the Spanish Renaissance. The bare vacancy of the modern American and European musical, as witness to a multitude of random tap and rap songs and some very funny banal lyrics, all choreographed with a lovely "amateur" cliche; Japanese anime and samurai live clich√©s; hearted Buddhist ritual; and the overwhelming sweetness of Viennese operetta. I have not laughed so loud at this type of movie since Ken Russell's unpleasant musical deconstruction in The Boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The grin comes from the skilful textual subversion of the Japanese legend, narrated in a traditional 5-act structure reminiscent of the 17th-century master Chikamatsu. In his work, the narrative is advanced in a mix of songs, recitatives, high-flying poems and little comedy relief - here the juicy roar of the incompetent Ninja, Strauss, of farmers under the illusion that he is a Tanuki raccoon human form. All of this is somehow related, and even more remarkable is the awakening of the observer's emotions through the emergence of cultural references. In truth, "Princess Raccoon" wears her pan-cultural garb with seductive ease, and that's where the astonishment gasps for breath. Visual - again as in Russell's masterpiece - the film is a treat, a color riot with its digitized backdrops of classic Japanese images of screens and prints, over-the-top costumes and stage sets, mixed with breathtaking live-action sequences on summer fields and by the sea. They will love or loathe it, but it makes no sense to use chalk to be cheese. and "Princess Raccoon" is first and foremost a maliciously witty and loving rejection of our contemporary cultural vacancies in East and West. Bravo!
