Roy Andersson's "Du Levande" is not entirely original, as it is a counterpart to Andersson's previous film "Sånger från andra våningen". The film still has an aura of total originality. Some conventions of filmmaking are still thrown away: most actors do not look like you would expect a movie to be, and the footage takes a long time. Most of the time, the camera does not move, but people are moving around it. The shots start from somewhere and often the landscape is built up in amazing proportions. W.G. Sebald comes to mind in literature with the same technique. Due to the time invested in each shot, the exposure is very high in many scenes. There is a story and it is not - it is left to the viewer to build in his own mind. This movie is positive. It is determined not to negate this while not overcoming the social injustices. One of the news I got from this was that maybe all breakdowns and accidents are not fatal. Great movie.
