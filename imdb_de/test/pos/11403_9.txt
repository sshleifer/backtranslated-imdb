I've watched both movies and I've undoubtedly seen the remake as the best. I know that many people would not agree with those who have become fans of the original, will most likely dislike this remake, but I thought it was well thought out and definitely scary, it was so good that I'll see it again tonight , the original has crippled me because they kill the kids, I mean, who does that in movies anyway .... but in this one kids have at least half a chance ... The only bad thing about this movie is when the babysitter (Jill) goes to the sounds she hears, and runs out into the bushes to look for someone, obviously nobody would mind if I have babysitting, this is the only thing I found wrong with the movie and although they probably had to put that there to build up tension, I do not want to give to all those who have not seen it. I suggest you listen instead to all those people who say they are be crap and worse than the original A better movie for teenagers, because it shows things that most of us are afraid of, but when I was in the cinema at least 10 adults were over 70 years old, and they enjoyed it, though they enjoyed it I think you'll do it! I give 9 out of 10 points!
