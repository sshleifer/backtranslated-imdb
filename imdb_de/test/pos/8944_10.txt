I accidentally found this movie during the channel surfing on Cinemax. I have to admit that Christopher Walken put me on. And the attitude was the kind I wanted, so I started to look at it. At first I expected a serious drama movie, and it seemed to be like that for a while ... until I started giggling here and there and before I knew it, I laughed so much at the whole movie. I like how subtle and carefree it is, but it still has a big impact on the audience. The plot is very simple, and it's far from too much trouble to be funny, as is the case with many Hollywood comedies. Nevertheless, I almost rolled on the floor. A must for a nice evening rest or anytime in this case.
