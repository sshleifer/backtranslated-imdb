Kirk and the crew visit a Federation colony on a remote planet rich in natural resources. The devil in the dark is the Horta, a very unusual silicon-based life-form that dances through solid rock. The Horta has killed miners and must be decided. But how? <br /> <br /> It's hard to continue this test without writing a spoiler. So I just focus on the technical aspects of the episode and start the topics. The special effects are fine, but many scenes with the Horta seem a bit absurd. Trading is pretty average for TOS. Some miners are a bit awkward. Nimoy has the toughest part of everyone in Devil in the Dark and he's doing well. <br /> <br /> Why is this still a favorite of mine? <br /> <br /> Devil in the Dark is truly an anthropological and ecological morality disguised as an adventure. More than many episodes of this major television series, it emphasizes the importance of being open-minded and at least having some empathy with others. In addition, this is one of the most interesting, though not likely, plot rotations of the original series. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
