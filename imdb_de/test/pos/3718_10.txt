This is an example of what film school teachers would call a good debut film. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, in a nutshell, cheap, guerilla film, no sets (only disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Even the black-and-white film was a stroke of genius, probably chosen for its low cost rather than for the film effect, but it worked. Reno was amazing as a breed. The acting was great. The plot was simple and effective and there were no limp remnants that could distract you. A tight, well-developed, cost-effective budget movie. Released in 1983, it was close to the art of big-budget action action through the Hollywood movie engine, and filmmaking was more exclusive and therefore more difficult, requiring more people in the right places than today's internet-enabled world. So Luc Besson would have to negotiate a lot and keep his promise to achieve that result, which makes the final product all the more remarkable. <br /> <br /> But the French film industry has always maintained a great reputation (yes, I know that Luc Besson is Belgian, but The film is a French production and was the source of many Hollywood remakes.) > <br /> If I have a criticism, it is so that the cover image on the DVD (and possibly the original poster) bears no similarity to the film and seems to be a rather bizarre image than representative of any movie e's themes - at first glance, it seems to be a man in a post-apocalyptic armor on a swing, but the second inspection reveals a man in armor with a lance on an office chair, his legs on a desk in confident This is never the case in the film. <br /> <br /> It's a black and white film set, zero dialogue, physical action, tight scenes and brilliant actors t to be included in your private movie collection. A great movie.
