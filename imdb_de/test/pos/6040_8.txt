Elizabeth Ashley receives calls from her nephew Michael - he cries, screams and asks for help. The problem is that Michael died 15 years ago. <br /> <br /> This film made me silly in 1972 when it aired on ABC. See you again years later, it still works. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit slow and predictable, the deaths are very tame and there is a pinned-up happy ending, but this is a TV movie I have to give room. Elizabeth Ashley is excellent, Ben Gazzara is fine and it's fun to see Michael Douglas so young. And those phone calls still scare me from the living daylight. I actually had to light during one of them! <br /> <br /> A scary little TV movie. Worth seeing.
