William H. Macy always shows a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems to be anywhere else. In short, he should be more actor. "A Slight Case of Murder" is directed by Steven Schachter, who shot two more great movies with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap), exaggerated acting, poor cinematography, and subordinate scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a television movie that does exactly what the kind of movie was created for. To tell a little story (not a simplistic story) that does not have to be viewed on the big screen. <br /> <br /> "A mild case of murder" is easy, entertaining and a great watch. > 7.6 out of 10
