When Jurassic Park first hit the market, it was revolutionary in filmmaking and special effects. For the first time, when people get cold, they go to a dinosaur movie and are convinced that they have brought real dinosaurs to life. However, some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples of what the real creatures might look like (T. Rex, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, etc.), some were changed to fit in the movie (Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus), and the movie was shot on a tropical island instead of being in their natural habitat. Walking with Dinosaurs shows us the true animals in their real habitats millions of years ago. The amount of detail and scientific information used is great. Now we can see sights like a drab Triassic desert, a whole herd of Diplodocus, an Icthyosaur kid, a MASSIVE sea monster, a pterosaur look, dinosaurs in the South Pole, two Torosaurus-Lock horns, T.Rex roar in the camera and the effects of the comet that spelled her fate. These dinosaurs walk, run, feed, fight, breed, hunt and swim. The series also reveals the other creatures they have shared the world with. Two episodes mainly focus on two different species of animals, the flying pterosaurs and the marine reptiles that lived under the waves. The places and landscapes are spectacular and look all the more distinctive when a CG Dino appears on the screen. And for CGI and Animatronics, the CGI dinosaurs' movements look completely natural, the color scheme is bright and vibrant, and the crewmates have taken careful steps to ensure that the CG animals interact with their surroundings in any way they do Actual creature would do splashes in the water, brushing through bushes, raising dust and throwing shadows on the ground. Granted, the CG is not perfect if the animals look just too short, but the rest of the time it looks stunning. Puppetry is sometimes poor, but it does have its moments, especially the scene with the cynodonts in the first episode. Kenneth Branagh's story is pretty good and at the same time gives us important information and drama. But the real pleasure is of course to see a living dinosaur, which he did all those years ago, and also some really sweet moments with Cynodont (mammal / reptile hybrids), Sauropodlets (Baby Diplodocus) and T.Rex chicks ( Yes, even T .Rex can be sweet) and reminds us that nature can be brutal and all the more so. All this leads to a prehistoric masterpiece of nature, with which you can see a real dinosaur and take your breath away, all from the security of your living room. If you're looking for nature, dinosaurs, informative learning, amazing pictures, or just a really good display and entertainment, Walking With Dinosaurs is definitely right for you. Easy to recommend.
