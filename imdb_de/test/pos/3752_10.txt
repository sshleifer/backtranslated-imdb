The main reason why I loved this movie is that IMx (formerly immature) was in it. They were in house party 3 when they were eleven, but now they're all grown up! I was a bit shocked by some of the things they did in the movie (almost ready to rip my hair), but I realized they were not my little boys anymore. I think Chris Stokes did a pretty good job, considering that this was his first movie.
