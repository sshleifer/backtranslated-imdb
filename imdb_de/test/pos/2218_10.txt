Had the pleasure of watching a new independent movie called Half Empty. Usually I go to the local cinema with my husband and feel like we're being held on the latest sequel or prequel that Hollywood throws at us. This was different and surprising? So much more entertaining than anything Hollywood spends millions on advertising. If my husband and I go to the movies, are we entertained? and "Half Empty" did just that and the film did it in a clever way that made me feel like my trip to the cinema was worth it. It's a funny, human and surprising, sometimes musical story that cleverly maintains in its simplicity. I especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing harmoniously in the bathroom. It's almost like an operetta. This particular scene reminded me of a scene in "Phantom of the Opera" when 4 of the performers did not just do it, d. H. They sang against each other in a friendly response. I'm not a movie buddy, but this movie was more fun than any other big studio movie I've seen lately. It is stupid, funny, entertaining and amusing. Absolutely enjoyable? I expect that from movies, but rarely do they deliver like "Half Empty".
