In Dublin, the crippled rebel Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) moves into the Carrigmore Residential Home for the Disabled and affects the lives of the residents. Roy is able to understand the unintelligible speech of Michael Connolly (Steven Robertson), who was abandoned by his prominent father in the shelter many years ago because of his cerebral palsy and they become close friends. Rory persuades Michael to move from Carrigmore to an apartment in Dublin, and they hire the beautiful Siobhan (Romola Garai) to help them. Living with Rory, Michael encounters a new world, finds friendship, love and freedom and learns to survive by itself. <br /> <br /> "Inside I'm Dancing" is a wonderful story of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. The acting of Steven Robertson and James McAvoy is fantastic and I do not understand that they were not nominated for such great performances for the Oscars. Romola Garai also has a first-class performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy. The script is touching, never stupid and without salvation, and the exact direction of Damien O'Donnell is very sensitive. Unfortunately, the DVD's Brazilian title is ridiculous and gives a false idea of ​​this excellent movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Melhores Dias de Nossas Vidas" ("The best years of our lives")
