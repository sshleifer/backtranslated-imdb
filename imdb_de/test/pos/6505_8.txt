Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their scratch art. From this one-line description of the movie you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little movie is. It is a joyful and lively celebration of a cool subculture that is little known. It's full of great underground hip-hop music and you see some top DJs (like DJ Q-Bert, DJ Shadow and Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys) showing off their stuff. When I went into the film, I was not sure if "scratching" could really be called an art form or that the turntable could be considered as an independent instrument. Scratch has completely changed my mind on these points. What these guys do with their turntables is really amazing - it's definitely an art - and the turntable, if you know how to use it, can be turned into an instrument that you can "play" drum or guitar. You'll even get an introduction to the basics of scratching DJ Q-Bert (eg how to use the fader to achieve different sound effects). All of these DJs were inspired in their own way to pick up the art of scratching after seeing Herbie Hancock play his song "Rock It" (you remember this song, right?) Live at the Grammys. Her attention was not Hancock himself, but his DJ and his scratch. Scratch is not just about scratching but also about "scratching", thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is filmed and edited. There are moments when clips are quickly "rewound" and then "forwarded" several times. This is reflected (in the film medium), what happens when a DJ quickly swings the record on his turntable while using his fader. Wicka-Wicka "Sound." Whether you're a hip-hop fan or not, you can count on Scratch to give you a very entertaining night in the cinema, and having seen it I had to have my own turntable And I mean that as a compliment.
