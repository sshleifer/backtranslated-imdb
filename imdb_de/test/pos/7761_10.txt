Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a highly rated anime in almost every review site you find on the internet. So I really wanted to know why, and I was anything but disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you pass the very bizarre (but rather funny) first episode, you will find yourself in a very entertaining and very entertaining situation weird world. A very well drawn, perfectly animated world that is. <br /> <br /> I can not tell much of the story without ruining it, so I'll just say it's a high school comedy ... and yet it's not. I can not really say what it's all about, really. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'm a huge anime fan, and I have about 50 complete series, and I'm not joking when I say this. Although I have not finished seeing Haruhi Suzumiya, he's standing in my personal collection at a very high rank. I fell in love with it at first glance, and I assure you that at least you will not be distracted by its irresistible charm. Trust me, I do not give everything that I look at.
