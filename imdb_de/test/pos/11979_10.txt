This movie deserves the 10 I give. <br /> <br /> But not the 10 you would give films like "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas" or "Psycho". This is the kind of 10 you give to a movie that makes you laugh again and again! It is the most terrifying film written and staged the most. It has the most amateur effects, but you enjoy every moment! I saw this movie on TV today and did not want to move! Read the following dialog to find out why! <br /> <br /> (The whole college is all about Manisha, who has just been raped and the guys who tried the rape are asking for forgiveness) <br />> Bad Guy 1: Please forgive us! <br /> <br /> Bad guy 2: Yeah, we will not do that again. <br /> <br /> (No answer from Manisha) <br /> <br /> Akshay: Come, forgive them! <br /> <br /> Manisha: I do not know ... <br /> <br /> Akshay: You are a beautiful woman and even dead men can be aroused by you! And these are living young men! Do not blame them! <br /> <br /> Pancholi: Yeah Manisha. <br /> <br /> Manisha (to Suniel): What if you tried to rape your girlfriend ??? <br /> <br /> Suniel: I would break her hands and legs and kill her. But still, just forgive them. <br /> <br /> Akshay: Yeah, if you do not forgive them, then it will be as if you are too arrogant about your beauty! <br /> <br /> Well, that's a true masterpiece of dialogue! This movie is always entertaining, especially because there are so many tricks and unrealistic situations! The villain (Munish) can basically do anything. He can blow a sandstorm out of his mouth or get a motorcycle from behind and just as easily disappear again. <br /> <br /> Each actor talks by turns. A line from Akshay, then from Suniel, then from Arshad, then Aftab, then Nigam. This is the main rule of the director, so each man is assigned the same screen time. And then there's the mighty trailer that can even make a fast car without hurting you! All these things make the movie an entertaining movie and I can watch it over and over again. I think this movie can go to the Comedy Hall of Fame, if there is one. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that he did not try to be funny.
