Awww, I love that! The fairytale of the cat and the moon does not really need a summary, because that's how it is ... the cat that chases the moon, to a Spanish poem. It is the art that is interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called "Fan and the Flower," which last year (2005) was an Oscar winner. > <br /> But these are really good shorts with strong black and white shapes that shift into beautiful movement and poetic seduction. If you think cats are poetry in motion, you will see it and you will believe it more. <br /> <br /> It also has such a touching ending. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
