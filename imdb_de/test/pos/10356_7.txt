The US-made last entry in the "Blood Island" series of Filipino horror films pertains to Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), the ruler of a fictitious country. He dies of cancer, but it has been found out how to bring him back: Put his brain in a donor body. The crazy doctor (Kent Taylor) puts him in a highly unlikely body: the man-scarred giant man Gor (John Bloom). A friendly doctor of the ruler tries to remedy the situation and put an end to crazy doctors' plans. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) fight several actors. I've previously worked with Taylor, Adamson's sexy wife Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov and Vicki Volante. They tried to get the feel of the previous "Blood Island" entries, but you can say that this was done by the state. It may not be a "good" movie, but it has a lot of funny elements that turn into a fun, trashy whole. A vicious dwarf (Rossitto), bloody operations, a rather unconvincing makeup job at Bloom, the political intrigue subplot, caverns full of cobwebs, etc. The narrative is actually pretty coherent with conspiracies thrown in here and there. I think something could have been trimmed; Some scenes are drawn. But it has its funny moments and an end that people might not expect. Both Taylor and Rossitto are fun; The latter seems to have a good time in his role. Volante is appealing enough and Williams is O.K. in the heroic role. In any case, it's nice to see all those familiar faces in one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing special, but as a trashy B "horror" (I use the word easy, this is not exactly scary) movie, it's definitely fun. <br /> <br /> 7/10
