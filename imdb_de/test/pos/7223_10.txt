ROMEO AND JULIET had been interpreted in many ways, but few versions gave the essence of the piece. The only ones I can think of that really bring the spirit of romance to the point were WEST SIDE STORY and, believe it or not, Tromeo's and Juliet von Troma's movie. At first glance, this is another splatterfest, and many think it would bastard the Shakespeare classic. The film, however, has an honest feeling. Of course, updated to address the sick youth of today, but not without merit. Yes, the frequent mutilations, body piercings, car accidents, lesbian scenes, masturbation and incest are in a bad mood, but what does it matter if you have such a sweet love story as your base? As bad as most of the drama in this movie is (I mean, it's Troma after all), the two main characters have real chemistry, more than in the big purses TITANIC and STAR WARS EPISODE TWO. There is a lot of modernization, but much of the original text is in tact, especially when Tromeo and Julia are together. There is a great scene in which Juliet expresses the famous adage, "Farewell is such sweet suffering," and Tromeo quickly follows in the grunge fashion of the nineties: "Yeah, that's all shit." I really hate that this movie does not get the recognition or the broad release it deserves. I hope that the people who see this on the shelves of the video store will not be cut off from the big news of the movie because they would miss a rather subversive experience.
