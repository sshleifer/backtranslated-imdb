This is a film by Oshima, the director of the notorious "In The Realm Of The Senses," a movie that is so sexually cramped and undisputedly controversial that it has been banned for a while. The movie, which first appeared in Japan in 1895, features the very pretty Keziko Yoshiyuki as Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls in love with a much younger man who courts her in his own way. This man, Toyoji, comes to her while she sleeps and seduces her, though she is soon ready to be seduced. Soon they have an affair and plan to kill Seki's husband to be together forever. They do it and throw it down well. However, they did not count on the spirit of the dead husband chasing Seki and others in the village. This movie is visually very impressive. The use of shadows underlines this story of passionate murder. Ms. Yoshiyuki (who is still an actress) is particularly good at her role. It is sometimes sexual, but not like "in the realm of the senses". Some of it follows our imagination. I've found that this film has a consistent consistency that makes it look very good. A bit scary, but that suits the territory. I would recommend that.
