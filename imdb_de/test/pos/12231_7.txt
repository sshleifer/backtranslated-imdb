Most Christmas movies have a "redemption" theme, but most are a variation of a very similar plot. This movie is crazy and has an unusual plot. You may have to stay in the first half where events seem hard to believe for a movie (but not as incredible as in real life - Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, says he never invented anything in his cartoons) all are based on real stories that his fans have told him. The second half begins to put the action together. I enjoyed it. By the way, one critic stated that the idea of ​​having someone out of cash is unbelievable at ATMs these days, but it's perfectly believable if you've lost your wallet - the during which money cards carry you everywhere on a business trip?
