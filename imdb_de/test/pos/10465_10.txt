This is one of the movies that gets better with each ad. I looked at it three times and registered with IMDb because I wanted to comment on it. Films about food have been filmed earlier, some of them are really good - like a certain Japanese comedy that connoisseurs of Asian cinema will know anyway. But this one is really in his own league. At its core is a Protestant Christian parable that symbolizes the ideal of kindness, but far from being dogmatic, it also addresses the "good" in each one of us, regardless of our religious beliefs or lack thereof. There is a pervasive understatement and refinement in Babette's feast, but this makes the message of the film, if any, stronger and not weaker at all. If you can not attend the extraordinary banquet offered by Babette, you are still welcome to this feast of the soul. Highly recommended!!
