Zachary Scott does what he does best, d. H. He's playing a worm in "Danger Signal," a 1945 B movie starring Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman, and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. After the last murder, he rents a room in the family home of Fenchurch, Hilda (Emerson) and her mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws herself at Emerson and she is blinded. In the middle of romanticism, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes home from a medical treatment. When she mentions that she was Uncle Wade's favorite and he left her $ 25,000 (after 1945 standards), Scott loses interest in poor Hilda and plays for Anne. Anne looks like Rebecca from Sunnybrook Farm until she starts sneaking around with Scott - overnight, she's 10 years old and she's going to be pretty nasty to her sister. At last heard the news that her tenant is not good, Hilda calls a psychiatrist (Rosemary DeCamp) to psyche him and advise her Scott does an excellent job as a slick sociopath. This was his strength - as a weak-minded sheriff in the "Flamingo Road" he showed no real presence. As for the two-time timing, we saw him doing so in "Mildred Pierce," where he has proven to be particularly good. Emerson is a bookie stenographer whose hair is brushed off her face and big glasses, but after hours she's lovely and shows a strong performance. DeCamp has always been an underrated actress - here she has a soft German accent and is adorable. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining movie, but it is a very routine story. The action really does increase it.
