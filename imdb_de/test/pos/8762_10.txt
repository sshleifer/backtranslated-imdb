"Traffik" tells the story of the use and trade of narcotics from different angles. From the point of view of a police officer, from the point of view of politicians, from addicts, from the point of view of the smuggler and from the point of view of a farmer. In a carefully compiled plot you get the impression of how everything is connected. Starting with beautiful shots taken in the poppy poppy fields in Pakistan, downtown Karachi, the airports of Frankfurt and London, and the run-down buildings where smuggling takes place, one sees the massive dimension of drug use.
