Hey, I've never seen a manga comic, but apparently this movie is based on one. Well, that's life. Anyway, this is a pretty bizarre movie, to say the least, as things literally get out of hand in a small Japanese town. People are obsessed with the Uuzumaki (spiral) and this young girl watches as her boyfriend's father films a slug, and later in the movie, people turn into slugs? It also seems that the father of this boy is so obsessed that he somehow commits suicide in a home appliance. There is some bizarre humor that could be at home in a Tim Burton movie, but there is also something outrageous that only the Japanese can do with justice. As with many Japanese films, the end is the end. Was something solved? Well, not in my thoughts, not. There is some guidance as to why this is all happening, but they are not explored and there is still much left, either imagination, or it is not considered important. Still, there are many things that can thrill the eye, and if you're not obsessed with making sense, it's worth a visit because it's so original and bizarre. My favorite was the father with the rotating eyeballs in person. 8 out of 10 stars.
