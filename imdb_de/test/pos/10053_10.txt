I had seen this movie as a child and was thrilled. I loved how stuffy and energetic Nikki is, and how she usually ruined Louden's perfect yuppie life, corrupting him and taking him on her crazy ways. As a child in the 80s, I saw New York exactly as it was portrayed in this movie, the domain of Madonna's character, with wild animals running rampant and disgusting bald heads chasing people around and causing chaos. Now, as an adult, I find that I love the movie for the same reasons, and even more for the love story that is woven into the crazy antics of Mrs. Nikki Finn. Although I still like to go somewhere and find an indoor atrium, like in this movie. Pure beauty and genius.
