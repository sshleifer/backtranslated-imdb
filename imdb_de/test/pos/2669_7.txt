Frank Sinatra played in this weird little shorts by RKO, which is now open to the public. The movie was released around the same time the war ended, and is a nice plea for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Sinatra during the stage song. After leaving the stage, he went down the alley and found a group of children who chose another because of their religion. Instead of yelling at (or helping) the boys, Sinatra gives a nice civic lesson on religious tolerance and equates prejudice with fascism. The children seem to get the lesson, but then out of the blue, Sinatra begins to sing a song that, frankly, would have hated the children. He had a nice voice, but I think that affected the good news he gave the children about tolerance. It's good news with too much singing - even though Frank Sinatra is the vocalist. It's also an interesting curiosity - a beautiful historical piece that's often overlooked ... and it's very touching, though a bit snotty.
