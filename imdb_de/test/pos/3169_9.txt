For me, the storm and its characters (which I mean the admirable ones) are like old friends. Ever since I started acting (I played Ferdinand), I immediately felt in the fantastic world Shakespeare created. I remember a student who decided not to play Ferdinand, so I went on stage and had the honor to play for an excellent Miranda. <br /> <br /> One of the virtues of having a good friend is that you can never fully know her - there is always something you can learn about her character. So a Tempest of Quality movie production is like visiting an old friend we care about a lot: every visit reveals a new look on the memory of the work we've had. Prospero's books emphasized the ritual and elegance of the piece, the lavish celebration of art in art. Here we see a vision as esoteric mysticism, with lovingly designed interiors full of candles and chalk diagrams on the floors, more with Aleister Crowley than with the Naples nobleman. It also made me think again - why was Prospero expelled from Naples? His magical power is so palpable in this production that one wonders if Prospero was condemned only by politics to exile, but rather to the fact that he is different from his peers. So he suffered in the real world. Was thrown out, fainting to change the wrong to the right. All the villains in this game, whether they realize it or not, act to create a more painful world of hell - it is always in the oppressor's interest to bring life on earth to hell. Prospero, however, manages to bring these terrestrial villains to his island, where he has (absolute) dominion. Shakespeare brings his audience to the theater, to the realm in which Shakespeare dictates the events, the words, the words results. Shakespeare, of course, is Prospero - but what really makes this film stand out is that Prospero makes such a reason, even though it is surrounded by what society calls irrational (astrological texts, alchemical symbols, magical diagrams, etc.). Is it more sensible to be a man of garment and murder or to be a heretic and to work towards the elimination of injustice? Prospero is a heretic, because he loses his magic not because the books in Naples lose value, but because they are no longer necessary - the world itself - has become the magic of books. <br /> <br /> In Hamlet Hamlet presents a piece to his colleagues. The play accuses its fellow men of having conspired for other purposes. The reaction of the audience is different: While Ophelia is confused, Claudius responds with baffled shock. This happens within the piece, and Shakespeare has performed this piece for the men of his time. Did Shakespeare look for their reactions? In the storm, Prospero lives the game he builds and we live with him. How do we react? Are you reacting to the happy ending with simple joy? Are you upset and shocked at the strangeness of this production, which is completely appropriate in the light of the source material? Are you sad that this little life, the play, is completed with a sleep, as ephemeral as ever? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for the life of humanity on Earth, but man is weak and unwilling to recognize it for minor power struggles. We have Claudiuses. <br /> <br /> Like a good friend, this movie is not without flaws. I do not agree with the decision to paint some scenes in blue. The dance of the sailors is quite tangential. But in the heart this is truly the storm and one of its many faces.
