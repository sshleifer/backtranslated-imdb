It's too bad that Iameracing wants to deny the reality of Faulkner's and Clarence Brown's intentions in creating the story and the film of Intruder In The Dust. I suppose the burden of a history of racism is hard for any Southerner to bear, and I can understand that. But to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. YES (to borrow uppercase letters) Iameracing, there are many places where blacks and whites get along well in the South. But to deny the way black people have had to live and still live, the conditions and injustices they have suffered are not imaginary. Sometimes blacks and whites came together from true affection and understanding. Sometimes it was only as long as the blacks knew their place. The point that made Juano Hernandez (in film and print) a somewhat spiky type, not warm and fuzzy, was to underline the fact that bigotry in and of itself is wrong, and human rights are just that for everyone, regardless of whether we like a certain person or not. <br /> <br /> It would be good if you stopped denying the existence of racism and the great damage it has done to Americans of all stripes. The fact is that black people (among others) have usually made no exception and the benefits of justice are as impartial as whites. Separation, discrimination and lynching are historical facts. People like Iameracing could argue that these things were not as prevalent as some think, and would probably love to free their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior. It would be wonderful if the southern ancestors of Iameracing (if any) had never participated in the terrible racist actions that are affecting the country's history, and I hope that was not the case. If so, we congratulate them, but this fact does not erase the fact that others have done so. And even if the terrible things that were done to the blacks in the South (and in other areas, do not forget the Civil War's draft revolts) were only half as numerous, only a third, does that make them less terrible? Is the murder of ten children hanging on ten men, the sexual assault of ten women, less terrible than the same things that happen at a hundred? <br /> <br /> Iameracing asks us to get the "Mississippi Burning" chip off our shoulders before we see "Intruder In The Dust". Well, I ask you, whether the murders of civil rights activists have happened or not? Why should that be forgotten? It could be forgiven. But to prevent their repetition, they can not be forgotten or translated into smaller events. The racism depicted in "Intruder In The Dust" is deliberately portrayed there. It is there to say something. <br /> <br /> On a cinematic historical level, it's also ridiculous that Iameracing devalues ​​the racial perspective. Every viewer of films made before the 1960s knows that black actors / characters / extras are usually intentionally cast. To judge from our film history; Wars were always waged by middle-aged white men; There were no blacks in the Old West; It was possible to go down a street in a big city and never meet a black man. There were no black hospital attendants, taxi drivers, clerks, salesmen, and so on. Blacks were almost never cast in relation to a role, unless the breed mattered. If Falukner (and Brown) wanted to tell a simple murder story, he probably would not have blackened the Hernandez character. <br /> <br /> Racism exists in the game. Probably for various reasons, I'm sure we both wish it was not, but it does. If we want things to be the way we want them, it probably can not help, but it still does not make them that way.
