This is a documentation that is different from all others. It has so many levels and shows us so much that it is almost impossible to analyze everything at once. Documentary filmmaker William Greaves shows us the process of filmmaking from a different perspective. We see the struggles of the actors, the director, the sound crew and all the others trying to hold on and make this movie successful. If it was just a movie, that would be normal. What Greaves does makes it more complex when a crew films the actors, and then this is filmed by another crew just to let another crew film the whole thing. Three cameras each with different goals. It's almost dizzying, but exciting at the same time. I like the parts where the crew gets together and discuss what's going on. Even they are in the dark, which Greaves is trying to do. Half see this as an experiment, while the other half sees it as a chaotic and confusing failure. No matter which side you choose, you can not claim that Greaves does not involve you in this process.
