I've just seen it for the first time in 10 or 15 years ... maybe near 20. In a way, it was better than I remembered ... in other cases it was MUCH worse. <br /> <br /> Especially the music. It's just awful. The movie contains only 5 songs, most of which are used more than once. The opening song is shouted by a chorus of annoying kids, and the disco-y theme song is performed by Rick Dees. It can not be worse. Even the background music is terrible, and many of them repeat the themes of the other disgusting tunes. We also get a really lame slapstick, mostly in the appetizer. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Bill Murray is brilliant as usual ... you have to wonder if he's misleading the whole thing or if the writers gave him all the weird lines. Or maybe he is just so great - a weak script turns into a funny genius. Best of all are his surreal PA announcements. ("Lobster ... get out of here ... you're a threat!") <br /> <br /> You also get much more character development than you expected in a movie like this one. At least half of the characters look like real people ... and mostly real people you would like to have. Even "Spaz" can do more than any other Eddie Deezen guy, and if he gets the girl, that's plausible. (She is not absurdly hot, but he does not automatically fit in with one of the nerd girls - see "Revenge Of The Nerds") to see examples of both movie phenomena.) <br /> <br /> And if that Action seems clichéd ... Well, you have to wonder if it was not a cliché when they did that. Although it was not the first summer camp, the movie must at least return to "The Parent Trap" - it's certainly the movie that made it his own genre. In fact, I was surprised that there was no talent show scene ... "Wet Hot American Summer" faked the summer camp genre so perfectly that I just assumed everything came straight from the meatballs. (I also half expected Jon Cryer to drive in a convertible with a chimpanzee thanks to "Epic" from Mr. Show's epic Olympics parade "Monk Academy"). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this seems to be A little gone until the comedies of the late '70s / early' 80s - it's not a cable clamp anymore and certainly does not have the cult following of Caddyshack or Animal House. I was delighted to see it on Showtime today - and in High Definition! Sure, it's pretty awful in some places, but in a 70s / 80s teen comedy you could do a lot worse. And again, Murray is a genius.
