I would like to know if "The Outsiders" (Australian TV series) will ever be released on DVD in the future? And is the music (Title Theme) available on CD? <br /> <br /> There was only a series of thirteen episodes of this drama and it should have been at least three or even four series in total. <Br /> <br /> The young German actor in the series also appeared in a German television series called "Black Forest Clinic," which aired here in the UK, overlaying the English dialogue with lip-synching. <br /> <br /> I look forward to comments from TV industry staff on the above questions. Thanks in advance.
