Ernst Lubitsch gave us wonderful films like Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop Around the Corner, Being or Not Being and other wonderful movies. But usually the eighth woman of Bluebeard is described as one of Lubitsch's weakest films. <br /> <br /> But I consider this film as an important movie. This film began the collaboration of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder and Walter Reisch wrote the screenplay for Ernst Lubitsch's Ninotchka. Of course, Lubitsch collaborated with writers in the script process. After that Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. They have written the script together for famous films like The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd. <br /> <br /> There are many funny moments in the movie. I found "Taming the shrew" very funny. There is a famous phrase called "movies are slices of life". And here's a great example from Bluebeard's eighth wife (1938). In the first session of the scripting process, Lubitsch asked this question: how did the boy and the girl come together? Billy Wilder immediately suggested that the opening scene should be the menswear of a department store. "The boy is trying to buy pajamas," he said mercilessly. "But he just sleeps in the tops, he's frugal, so he insists on just buying the tops, the clerk says he has to buy the pants, it looks like a disaster, then the girl comes to the store and buys her pants because she only sleeps in her pants. "Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were enchanted. It was not until months later that they discovered that Billy Wilder himself is an absolute top sleeper and that he had been using the idea for months to wait for a chance. <br /> <br /> I received this information a book. I think that this film can be considered the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Immediately after this film he made wonderful films like Ninotchka, The Shop Around The Corner And Being Or Not Being. <br /> <br /> I thought Gary Cooper's performance was good. I think Lubitsch cast Gary Cooper, probably because Gary Cooper played Long Fellow Deeds, who inherited Frank Capra's fortune. Mr. Deeds goes to town. But that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie. I rate this film 9 out of 10. Lubitsch films are different because his films are life episodes.
