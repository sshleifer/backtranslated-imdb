This is the first movie I ever had on video and 14 years later I still have the same copy. Elizabeth Taylor was just as good as twelve at the age of twelve, Mickey Rooney gave Mi Taylor a real dimension, and Donald Crisp was as solid as Mr. Brown. The amazing Anne Revere seemed to be the smartest woman in the world as Mrs. Brown. After almost 60 years, the warmth, humor and excitement of this film still affect the viewer. We still laugh at the jokes, the root of The Pie, and love Velvet for the spirit and the ability to love it shows. I love it as an adult just as I loved it as a kid. A must for every family video collection.
