This movie blew me away. I thought I knew something about the uprising in Attica. After seeing this, I did not know anything. The story is told through the relationship between the lawyer and the black prisoner. Both the personal history of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were fascinating. The flashback sequences in prison were great. It's hard to believe it was not documentary footage, it was so real. It was not just a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper. I give two thumbs up.
