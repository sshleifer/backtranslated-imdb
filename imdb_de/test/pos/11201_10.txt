This is not a movie that impresses you with high budget, high-tech recordings, fast camera movements or shimmering costumes that are thought up by an overzealous and hungry director. But it is a film by a director who is also a very good photographer and who has a very good feeling of seeing things as a human, not a demigod, unlike most directors. This is not a movie in which actors and actresses try to perform their best 'performances' with unreal or at best learned gestures and facial expressions. It's more of a movie where they look as real as they can be. Actually, they are not professional actors at all. The dialogues between the main characters, their expression and their emotions are as real as they can easily be in real life. They tell the people around you the same lies with the same regrets that you avoid expressing in words. They show the same signs of annoyance to an unwanted guest. This is the same sense of separation that you get in modern city life. And this is your chance to see yourself from the outside, imitated by the main characters. I have seen all the films of Nuri Bilge Ceylan. His short film Koza (Cacoon) thanks those who put him in the DVD. Many would compare him to Tarkovsky, Ozu and perhaps Bresson or Bergman, as he develops into a real author. And he sincerely says that his films are not meant to make money, but to give meaning to his life. That's the kind of sincerity you find in Uzak.
