The most amazing movie I have ever seen. I did not read the programming and happened upon the movie by accident. I thought it was a real documentary, and I got sick of what I saw. I first found out that it was a movie after it was done, and I searched the internet for more information about "Penalty Park" in the US. It felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really happened in the US when you are from Europe. I have to admit that I really felt anti-American after watching the movie and figuring it was not really that way.
