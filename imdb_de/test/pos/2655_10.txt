2001: A space odyssey <br /> <br /> Is it a sermon? A report on the history of humanity? An investigation of man's futile attempts to advance technology just to destroy technology? Is it about the fragile balance of time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacular effects show? a film that Kubrick made only to show us the unlimited possibilities of the film and to show us the truth that images are overwhelmingly more powerful than words? <br /> <br /> 2001: All this is a space odyssey. One of the most interpretable films ever made, it's almost more fun to analyze and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events of the film than actually look at it. But it is deliberately open to discussion; When Kubrick had made the meaning of his wondrous 1968 classic (# 22 on AFI's list of the biggest 100 films I've ever made, my personal 21st favorite, currently ...), nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Director, Original Script, Art Direction and visual effects for which it had won) it would have lost half of its fascination, all its complexity, and much of its cinematic value. We only have technical ingenuity; which in itself is commendable. <br /> <br /> Because every shot is worth the time. And there is a lot of time left. 2001 is very elegiac and also cool; freestanding. Emotional seclusion and the slow pace pay tribute to the unique visual experience. 2001 begins with the ancestors of the great apes, who evolved from scavengers of the planet to hunters and toolmakers after discovering a huge monolith in the middle of their desert home. serving as bone in one of the most inspired spine edits in film history) was thrown into the air and turned into a satellite, leaping into space a few thousand years ago, where astronauts had discovered a similar object on the moon, and followed then the movie, which was followed by a crew of space travelers as they follow the signal of the monolith through space, accompanied by their unreliable computer HAL, who attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew, before eventually becoming the only survivor through space and space Time (in a flood drug-induced he paints that hippies have probably returned an epileptic shock a day) will grow old, die, and become a "star child" reborn. Phew. <br /> <br /> This tempo and emotional emptiness is in sharp contrast to the film's most ironic scene; the destruction of HAL. When the crew's last discoverer shuts down the machine, submerged in the sacred aura of red light, Kubrick has always used it as a repeat motif. HAL sings a beautiful song, it's a strangely emotional experience. And it's all genius. <br /> <br /> Other notable aspects of Kubrick's masterpiece is the catchy voice of HAL (a quiet, somehow sinister Douglas Rain), the minimal use of dialogues (Kubrick confided in his imagery to propel the film and give it to his actors just banal, unhelpful lines, the most famous being "Open the podium bay door HAL"), satellites orbiting to unorthodox music, and the first impressive recording of the earth; Slowly, he reveals the glare of the sun in front, played to loud, triumphant horns. <br /> <br /> 2001 is always a mystery and will forever be the strongest point in cinema: visuals are more powerful than writing. It's all about one of the most legendary and best directors in film history, whose unique vision has always been his own. 10/10 <br /> <br /> "Open the Pod book doors HAL" -2001: A Space Odyssey
