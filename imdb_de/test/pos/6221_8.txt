All films by Risto Jarva are worth seeing. Some such as "Jäniksen vuosi" and "Loma" are the best films of their genre and have achieved the status of a classic in Finnish cinematic history. <br /> <br /> Most people have made through Jarva an impression of actor Antti Litja films. Litja starred in three of Jarva's films, all of which became box office hits and movie reviews. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see that the idea of ​​"Jäniksen Vuosi" still lives in commercials (I think operator Sonera's TV added that Litja in Lapland walked with a hare in his arms. who has seen the movie knows what I'm talking about.) "Jäniksen Vuosi" Like the famous small town in Lapland, Sodankylä, where the best film festival in the world takes place - the Midnight Sun Film Festival. I recommend it to everyone to go there in June - but remember warm clothes and raincoat :)
