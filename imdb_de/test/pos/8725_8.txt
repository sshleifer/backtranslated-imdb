Well, I would say that, despite its shortcomings, this is a very pleasant and somewhat touching film. I did not believe for a minute that Matthau knew the first thing about what a dentist was. At the beginning of the film, Hawn's character also seemed to be recovering from suicide depression fairly quickly. Not to mention the whole thing was pretty ridiculous. However, the film succeeds due to a good pace, humor and its stars. Matthau was not a dentist, but he was just as amusing as usual. Bergman has made the film very sensitive (especially during the scene in which she and Matthau enjoy a drink after work) and also a lot of humor. I think it was her performance that made my brother aware of this movie after listening to a few scenes. The performance of Hawn is remarkable, although an Oscar might have been over a bit. Basically, do not take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy it.
