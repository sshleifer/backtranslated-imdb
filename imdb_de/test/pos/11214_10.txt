Uzak (2002), a Turkish film shown as "Distant" in the US, was staged, produced, written and filmed by Nuri Bilge. <br /> <br /> Ceylan. <Br /> <br /> This movie is a grim and grim version of the clash between a "city mouse", Mahmut, played by Muzaffer Özdemir, and a "land mouse", Yusuf, played by Emin Toprak. <br /> <br /> Both men are outstanding actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skills. (Tragically, Emin Toprak died in a car crash shortly after the film's completion.) In most cousins ​​of cousins ​​of cities and cousins, the contrast between rural and urban lifestyles is portrayed in a humorous way. There is little humor or even warmth in this film. Both men have lost contact with human society. Mahmut's work as a commercial photographer for a tile company gives him no satisfaction. He has divorced a woman he apparently still loves, and has no satisfactory interpersonal relationships. Mahmut has lost his job due to the closure of a factory in his small town and does not do this. They do not have the skills or energy to find work in the city. His human interactions are primarily limited to silent observations of other people crossing his path. He is clearly a warm and caring person, but he can not express those qualities in an urban environment. The cousins ​​are not well related to the world and they do not relate well to each other. None of them tries to act in a way that provides an opportunity for connection or proximity. <br /> <br /> In a sense, this film shows a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Perhaps every cousin could have provided at least part of the shortage in the other's life. Instead, they control parallel unlucky tracks. The two men are consistently distanced, a situation that suggests the title of the film. <br /> <br /> One of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which Ceylan builds detail after detail. These details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we would have learned by a simple depiction. Uzak was shown as part of the Rochester Laboratory film series. It is not a "working film" in the traditional sense of this genre. It is a working film because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfactory work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf). <br /> <br /> This is a quiet, absorbing, dark film. Although not a happy sight, I walked out of the theater and realized that I saw a really creative and <br /> <br /> important movie. This movie is worth seeing and worth seeing!
