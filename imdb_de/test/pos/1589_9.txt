This is a ravishing, but economical adaptation of the novel of the same name by Thomas Mann. Dirk Bogarde gives his best screen performance - he believed himself. The dialogue is minimal, so his face must recognize the nuances of his agonizing character - a composer (a novella writer - the only major change) who travels to Venice in 1910 Touch of decay. Trained as an opera director, Visconti seamlessly combines Mahler's music and imagery in his best film since The Leopard (another breathtaking film that greatly influenced Coppola's Sicily in The Godfather).
