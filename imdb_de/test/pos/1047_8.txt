A columnist in a magazine who writes about life on her farm, though she actually lives in a flat in New York, has to come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, she transforms into a fun little screwball comedy thanks to a fine cast. In a big departure from her previous role as Femme Fatale in Double Indemnity, Stanwyck has a beautiful comedic flair. Morgan is slick as the friendly war hero, while Greenstreet is well-stocked as a publisher. However, Sakall steals the film as a cook trying to master the English language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible European accent.
