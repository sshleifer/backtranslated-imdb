This film begins as a college T'n'A movie, but gets pretty ugly after the main character's sister is raped by a biker group driving a van. It has a pretty good pace, and James Van Patten is doing pretty good work in this Cannon tax write film. This was the first movie I saw at Parkway Drive-In here in Toronto. The main feature was "Alphabet City" and "Young Warriors" was the additional feature. Of the two films, "Young Warriors" was far more entertaining and memorable. If you're a fan of Blow'em movies, they're extremely violent, so this would be a great addition to any collection.
