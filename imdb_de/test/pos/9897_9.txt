I was also fortunate enough to see Peter Falk at the Phoenix Film Festival "Checking Out". This is a very sweet, character-driven movie that enchants audiences in Applebaum's plight. More than funny, every character in the family contributes to a priceless comic relief that not only promotes laughter, but also triggers some happy tears. Peter Falk was born to play this role. He plays a 90-year-old "young" father of three, who brings together his adult children in what may be one of the most important times of his and her life. The 2-day voyage that the Applebaum family takes through the delightful New York setting (with carefully chosen characters) not only leaves the audience happy, it also nourishes their sense of family. "Checking Out" is a must-have movie, not only for those who value the family, but also for those who do not !!! My thanks go to the director, who took the opportunity to present this POIS to his audience. Robin Sly, Scottsdale, Arizona
