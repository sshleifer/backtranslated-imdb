It has been years since I saw these shows. For years, I have been looking for someone who has seen them or knows something about them. I thought I invented it. I remember the soldiers and death most of all. I would ask movie fanatics if they had seen it, it was a Jim Henson, and people still did not know it. These are great fables. I was very young when I was less than 10 years old, and it left a lasting impression on my life and faith. I would recommend anyone to see them, just remember that they are from the 80s, so they do not look like today's movies. Just give them a shot. Jim Henson was ahead of his time and died too early.
