In this approximately 34-second-long Thomas Edison short film, Annabelle Moore shows the "Serpentine Dance" choreographed by Loie Fuller in two different, flowing, flowing robes. Moore was one of the big stars of the late Victorian era. She appeared in a number of Edison Company shorts, including this one of the first Kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894. Loie Fuller actually had the Serpentine Dance, in which Moore plays here, patented robes (as well as whole frames), which are often tinted in the film by hand and which predict one of the most famous symbolic devices of the silent time. Allegedly, the Moore films were so popular that they often had to be renewed (including Refilming). The version available now may be a newer version / remake. Moore became even more popular when rumor had it that she was naked at a private party in a New York City restaurant. Later she played in 1907 as "Gibson Bathing Girl" in the Ziegfeld Follies. She appeared there until 1912. <br /> <br /> The short film is characterized by its freedom of movement, which, especially during the "second half", becomes almost abstract. It is somewhat reminiscent of a painting by Morris Louis, although it is almost sixty years before Louis' relevant work. <br /> <br /> You should be able to find this short film on DVD in various anthologies earlier films.
