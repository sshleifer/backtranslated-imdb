George Saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of Hamlet while killing a guard. Months later, an employee of him sells fakes of the book for large sums of money. One of the fakes is sold to a man who works for the Nazis. Not pleased that the Nazi frontman wants to get his money back, at the same time appears an investigator who works for one of the other deceived customers. The middle-aged woman, protecting herself for safety, begins to play all sides against each other and holds a meeting between various parties in the public library of New York. However, when people begin to die, the library is imprisoned and more murders (and perhaps some rare book thefts seem close to the event.) Complex Crime Murder is a good little thriller with a great cast (Saunders is by Richard Denning and Supported by a group of solid supporting actors.) If there is a mistake, the film is almost too complicated with actions with actions and each for themselves.The theft, counterfeiting, murder and wartime intrigues (this was 1942) are for the short It's an entertaining little movie with a darkness and a sense of inevitable sinking for some of the characters, who clearly identifies this as one of the first movie noirs - until Denning shows up, we're at some charming thieves that we like, maybe even more than the hero, but it is clear from word and deed that this is not a completely happy e and they know, even if they know they are fighting it. A good little movie worth looking for.
