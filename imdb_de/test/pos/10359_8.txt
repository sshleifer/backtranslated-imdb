This is a somewhat inconsistent entry with an outstanding sequence in which an over-the-hill party in the diner recalls that it was their hiding place 30 years ago. a ho-hum duo between two aging rockmusos; A noiric abduction turned upside down and an opening episode (plus epilogue) with theft artist wannabe Edward Baer and the current "hot" Anna Magloulis property, which has its moments. No film in which Jean Rochefort appears can easily be rejected and here he seems to be considered one of the over-hill quintets. Although the movie is worth a visit for Rochefort alone, each of the sequences has something to offer and is worth a look.
