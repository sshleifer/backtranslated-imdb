BROADCAST NEWS opens with a series of short vignettes that are a clever way to start a story about TV anchors that have no idea what they are reporting on. In a speech to a group of would-be reporters who are bored by their presentation, most would go. When the last one left, the co-host of the event says quietly to HOLLY HUNTER, "I do not think there will be questions and answers." Subtle line in a brilliantly written, unobtrusive comedy, a farce about the showbiz aspect of the TV anchoring. WILLIAM HURT is the inappropriate newsreader who works with HOLLY HUNTER as a network anchorman. Hurt needs help reporting, and Holly refuses to take the bait - at first. He knows that he can only look good, but he is not a reporter. He turns out to be a quick study as long as his earphone works and he gets all the direct information from executive producer Hunter. <br /> <br /> Holly's other anchor-mate (ALBERT BROOKS) helps by feeding her information, which violates her pass. Of course, she comes into conflict with her feelings for the Ace reporter Brooks and the equally strong attraction to the handsome anchor man Hurt, who has its own alliance with a handsome employee. <br /> <br /> You have to wait for twenty minutes before the movie ends to find out which man she will end up with. Brooks tells her that Hurt is the wrong one because he represents everything she stands for. In this unpredictable comedy, one can not say who Hunter (the neurotic heroine) ends up coping with. as well as the film itself and the director / author James L. Brooks. A total of seven deserved Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> The script does not opt ​​for a traditional happy ending - and in this case, that's the only mistake for the brilliant script. I felt cheated and a little disappointed by the melancholy conclusion.
