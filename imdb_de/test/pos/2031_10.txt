If you like the '80s rock, you should definitely see this movie! I only recently saw it and completely fell in love with it! <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very entertaining, delivers a great deal of rock music and not a single second of boring movie find! It was a great idea that some of the real life musicians were doing what they did best. I was happy to see both Zakk and Blas perform solidly for Elias. I agree with many people who said that the first half of the movie was much better than the second, especially in terms of the script. That could have been a bit better, but no big deal. One thing that bothered me a bit was the performance of Jennifer Aniston. I thought she was not the right person for this role, I just could not see her as a rock star girlfriend. But as the movie progresses, somehow you realize you've done a good job with it. There is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that will not leave you cold. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a good and funny movie that does not fit deep into the characters, but gives you good fun, a sense of nostalgia and of course the mighty vocals of Jeff Scott Soto and Mike Matijevic!
