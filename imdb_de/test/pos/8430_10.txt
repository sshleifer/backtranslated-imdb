"The China Syndrome" could not have been published at a better time: twelve days after his release, the infamous clash occurred in Three Mile Island. But even if this (and / or Chernobyl) had not happened, this film remains an important look at what could happen through mismanagement of nuclear facilities. Jack Lemmon is in a five-star performance as a supervisor, trying to uncover a cover-up in his nuclear power plant. Jane Fonda plays the reporter trying to investigate, and Michael Douglas plays her cameraman I do not know if the current threat of a terrorist attack makes "The China Syndrome" more disturbing, but in any case, it's definitely a movie everyone is watching should. <br /> <br /> I hope these people have been driving the nuclear power for years and just watched this movie so they could know that their views and ideals have completely died.
