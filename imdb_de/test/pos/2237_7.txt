I saw this movie on TV late at night, expecting a camping "masterpiece" on a low budget. I was surprised with a pretty decent movie. Angelina Jolie's unique acting skills (or should I say lack of it?) Make her perfect as Android, and the other actors, though terribly average, are at least not terrible. <br /> <br /> There is a conspiracy; It's a pretty complicated plot where conspiracies and the lengths a couple (a human, an android) will follow to go to his illegal romance, with a "big brother" character and an android killer, which is thrown into the mix. The production and sets were also much better than I expected. I did not see the original cyborg, so I can not really compare it to others. This movie is not a Blade Runner, but as a late-night, futuristic, guilty pleasure it's worth a watch.
