This was on the Saturday before Halloween this year (today, at the time of this writing) and it must be the best horror anthology. Usually I'm not a fan of horror movies - mainly because of the amount of crap that was released recently. However, the director of Campfire Tales has the Hitchcock gesture of suspense - unlike other contemporary films, you do not need every opportunity to stupefy you, instead using foreboding and near-misses - incidents that seem like the moment The climax will occur in the moment before, but it turned out that this was not the case. <br /> <br /> I did not catch The Hook or the first main segment, but from what I read here, it was the two that you can not miss. <br /> <br /> 'People Can Lick Too' was full of excitement - these shorts will keep you on the edge of the seat, waiting for something to happen to the little girl as she walks around. Her yard and home was looking for her football and later on your dog. She encounters so many near-misses that the tension before the climax of the short film takes heart-rending proportions when the girl gives up and goes to bed and thinks her dog is under it. She reaches down to lick him and she feels the touch of a tongue on her hand ... before she notices that on her mirror, written in blood, "people can lick". I'll give you the last seconds to figure it out, my reader, because at that point the shorts could have taken any number of turns. <br /> <br /> 'The Locket', however, was the undeniable masterpiece of this film. It starts with a man riding a motorcycle and just driving to what he does not know, but he can feel him approaching. As he drives on, a storm breaks out and he has to seek shelter in the house of a dumb girl. The two manage quickly, but before they can do anything other than the kiss, the girl reveals by writing that spirits inhabit her home. They start packing quickly to leave, but they are trapped in the middle of a scene imitation decades ago - a father coming home to his daughter and boyfriend, preparing to flee, murdering both and then committing Suicide. I also have to leave you to discover the end - I certainly could not hope that the story will definitely do justice, and what I have said so far is just a brief summary of the story - I could not hope I the nuances and sensory details that help to convey. <br /> <br /> "The Campfire", the link between all stories, is a pretty interesting remake of the car crash theme and the girls are very attractive - in fact, most girls look good in this movie. Despite the fact that it is hacked, history is given justice, and the end is hard to predict when you're busy with the other stories. However, if you pay enough attention to the segments of The Campfire, it's certainly possible to predict the end, especially if you've seen movies based on the same premise. (MST3k fans, do you remember Soultaker? The same premise, but without the horrible writing by Vivian Schilling and most of the movie, if you've seen the first 30 minutes of it, you should be able to predict the end.) All in all, the best horror movie I've seen in a while, and the only horror anthology worth buying.
