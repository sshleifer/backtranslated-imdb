This film by the well-known Czech director and writer Petr Jarchovský is remarkable for its peculiarity, but is annoying and distracting in its details. The theme and title of a poem by Robert Graves refers to a woman with several men and some vile relatives in her life trying to outdo her two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and the little blonde asthmatic and protect Cuba (Adam Misik). The poem is widely documented, but the subject - it is a little lost. <br /> <br /> Marcela (Anna Geislerová), the beauty and Jarda (Roman Luknár) have lost everything In the 2002 floods of Prague and there seems to be nothing left but good sex, with such revenge emanating in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Cuba have to keep their ears in front of the TV against the noise. Hrebejek enjoys such explanations and skates on the verge of embarrassment or shock. There is no good explanation why, but financial despair has led Jarda to process stolen cars in the large garage located next to his apartment. His car-thieving cohort drives off a posh Volvo left by carefree Benes (Josef Abrham) with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a super nice guy, but no fool. His Volvo is wired for satellite tracking in such cases and that leads the cops directly to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort go to jail. <br /> <br /> "Beauty in trouble escapes to the good angel / who she can rely on," begins the poem by Graves. In fact, this Fracas leads Benes to Marcela when he meets her at the police station. He introduces her sushi and explains how to drink wine, and introduces her to a picture book about Tuscany, in which, although he is from Prague, he owns a beautiful villa and has lived most of his life. He is here to reclaim the house in Prague, which is now inhabited by a married couple with an old and frail mother whom he lets stay. Benes' every gesture is benevolent, even if it does not prevent Jarda from going to jail. Under these circumstances, Marcela has to retire with Lucina and Cuba to count on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the far less tender grace of today's husband of Zdena, the skinny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer) - for the Children, when they commit the cardinal sin, take the uncle, the uncle is hell. Jiri Schmitzer abducts the film at this point and never let it go completely. Even in the final scene he is a laughing threat. It is surprising that the disgusting Richard does not sexually abuse one or both children. He insists that Marcela has to leave alone, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing, he and Richard become unlikely allies. Unlikely - maybe implausible. Why would Benes like him? But what is the whole story of Benes? About some things the film gives too much information and about others not enough. <br /> <br /> Of course, the "good angel" Benes is infallibly friendly - and a polished, handsome older man whose manners are in line with his Italian education. Only at the end, when he is pushed to the limits by the devious residents on his Prague property, he proves that he can not lie down and go over. <br /> <br /> Jarda's religious fanatic Sdena (Jana Brejchova) is also involved, and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch. But she is just another wildcard that does not raise the deck. <br /> <br /> The poem was set to Czech translation and sung on canvas by accordionist singer Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in an expanded staging at a prison performance played by witness Witness Jossen's Jarda and the car thief. If you adore Hrebejk as an author, you can enjoy this sequence. otherwise, it tends to feel voluntary. Also included is a series of songs by Glen Hansard / Marketa Irglova from the Oscar-winning Irish musical film "Once", including the title song of "Falling". They feel more out of place due to their familiarity with "Once", even though this movie was in first place. Arrest Hrebejk's people; Even the little Koba has his Shakespeare childhood moments and a wealth of charm. But the director and his author seem to be unable to resist the temptation to turn away and expand too much. The problems Benes endures can be useful to show that he has a hard side. However, such a complex demonstration was not necessary. The drama is alright, and there is something wonderful about bizarre and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money are lost in the Shuffles and Marcelas conflicts, and it never becomes clear how she resolves them. It's fine that there is no solution and that Graves' theme and poem do not match that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda on a return visit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her children. However, there are still too many questions as to what to do about the disgusting Richard or Jardas annoying pious mother (Emília Vásáryová). Why is it that we suddenly hear that Koba receives letters from "India" allegedly from his father, who is in prison? When did that happen? Interesting details that have been hastily inserted. This seems to be a world where you can not see the forest for the trees.
