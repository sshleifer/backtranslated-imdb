Cheers to all the wonderful fans of this movie who not only saw and appreciated it, but (based on the many educated comments) actually GET IT! I have always considered Paul Mazursky's "Tempest" as a reflection on the Shakespeare play of the same name, as noted in several other reviews. On the other hand, if you are looking for a simpler adaptation of the game, you should look elsewhere. As an experiment, however, it only succeeds spectacularly. Enchanting, moving, funny, sad, dramatic ... all that and much more. Cast, film locations, script, music are just fantastic. Cassavetes and Rowland were never better. Susan Sarandon's turning point was more than an indication of the great work that will come from her in the future. Molly Ringwald makes her film debut unforgettable and you just have to love Raul Julia's performance ... he steals the show in several scenes. The always great Cassavetes was confident and assured enough performers to have him left! A study on the thematic elements of the Shakespearean classic could be life, when updated in "more modern times," Mazursky's "Tempest" burns brilliantly!
