I lay in bed and leafed through the channels ... and boy, I have channels ... 500 of them. With more than 70 movie channels, I'm probably watching a movie on cable once or twice a month. DVD Poled me I see Natilie Portman, I'm interested. 110 minutes later, I'm still interested. How could that be? When I saw the preview of this movie in the theater for the first time, I remember that I made fun of it. I never thought I would look at it ... no matter what it looks like. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a book, and you can say it. The movie is very episodic, and it's not that the movie has a great storyline, it just sucks you in. Maybe it's the performances that make him. I was pretty sure. <br /> <br /> This movie was good for no reason ... <br /> <br /> Peter's movie rating (out of 10): 7
