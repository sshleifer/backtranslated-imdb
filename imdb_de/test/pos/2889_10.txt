These people are excellent and everything they bring to the public is top notch. The musicality of this band is incredible and we should all be very grateful that we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to experience such a championship live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it! I recently saw these incredible musicians playing in Houston, TX, and was thrilled. I have not missed a show since the windows are closed, and I have to say that they are better than ever. Everyone should hug these guys and teach others what real musicality is! There will never be such a dense and well-made trio in our lives again. Let's just hope and pray that they will not retire so soon!
