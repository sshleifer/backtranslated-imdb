I first became aware of this movie when I saw a preview of another movie. I was intrigued, but I did not see it before it was a short run in theaters. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to watch the movie several times. Unarmed civilians are subjected to much violence. There are lessons to be learned here. One of Patricia Arquette's lines sums up. "For Americans, if it did not happen on TV, it just did not happen." There is a lot of truth. <br /> <br /> Another point is that she thinks of a point just because she announces it is an American citizen whom the soldiers separate and let pass. That's not how it works. <br /> <br /> The landscape is beautiful. Acting is all decent. THE PROFESSOR is especially good. Mainly, though I am interested in these characters. Francis McDormand and Spaulding Gray are fine, but their appearance is short and therefore does not matter. Patricia has courage. It could have been very bad in the hands of a smaller actor. Since this is love or hate, the film should still come up with the idea that there are still military dictatorships in the world in this century, and until one of us is hurt, we ignore their oppression. <br /> <br /> Aung San Suu Kyi is the political leader of the film. In real life she won the Nobel Peace Prize. She was recently released from house arrest. At the time of writing, the W. Bush administration is trying to urge the military government to talk to it and reshape the government. The Burmese government was under such control that the name of the country was changed to Maynamar Republic. The US government has not yet recognized the new name. <br /> <br /> If you do not see a message in your movie, do not look at it. If you do not mind, if you are a little familiar with your conversation, then this is a good one.
