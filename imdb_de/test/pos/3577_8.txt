"The bad dreams always come back as unwanted friends," says Marion Fairlie, who lives with her half-sister Laura in a huge country estate in the middle of the Victorian era. "And last night I found myself in the Limmeridge cemetery - usually the dead are dead, as are the criminals who are locked up, not the victims, but then nothing normal happened to us." And we start with a first-rate gothic story of insanity, deception and villainy based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of the Victorian mystery. It's a good idea to be attentive because there are plots of land that are all focused on a cunning and reckless system that involves a lot of money, whatever else money. <br /> <br /> Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell) are dedicated to each other. Marion is wild and protective; Laura is softer and much more romantic. Marion does not have her own money; Laura will inherit riches when she is of legal age. Marion has no marriage prospects we know about; Laura was pledged some time ago to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), too charming a aristocrat. They are her uncle's wards, a cumbersome, condescending, immensely egocentric hypochondriac (Ian Richardson). Everything seems to be routine, but then a young artist, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln), is busy teaching them drawing and artistic appreciation. And when he comes to the local train station at night, there is no carriage, so he walks to the farm on foot. In the dark woods, he meets a strange, white-clad woman who wanders around and talks about things he does not understand and then disappears. Do we feel uncomfortable? Yes, and so are he and the sisters when they realize that the strange woman looks very much like Laura. Later, love is born between Walter and Laura? Is a bud blooming? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and causes Laura to marry Sir Percival? Does a cancer cope? And are we slowly discovering secrets about the relationships between Laura, Marian and the white woman ... are we learning to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival's intentions? Let's get to enjoy the style and manners of Sir Percival's close friend, Count Fosco (Simon Callow) ... and finally, recognize the ruinous depths of depravity and the power of honor and true love that humanity is capable of is? Do we visit Victorian insane asylums, see cases of high towers, dig open graves in the middle of the night and see the retaliation arrive in the midst of the roaring flames of a locked church? <br /> <br /> Well, of course, and it's a big trip for us. <br /> <br /> This BBC / Masterpiece Theater program is characterized by good acting and excellent production values. To integrate Collins' novel with more than 500 pages in a television show of less than 120 minutes, a good offer had to be cut or shortened, and some changes were most likely to be made in the time available. The production of The Woman in White, however, is in my opinion very good as a moody, romantic, dark television story. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion does an outstanding job as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever effort to slowly let us see the rotten slime under the skin, which still has charm among the villains. Ian Richardson as uncle of the young women almost steals the show. He gives such an imperious and sharp performance that almost upsets the story every time it appears. Perhaps the weakest part is Simon Callow as Count Fosco. The Earl is simply a monster, but extremely civilized and charming. Collins described it as tremendous. Callow does it well, but I miss a bit of the monstrosity of evil. <br /> <br /> At one point, Marian says, "My sister and I love gothic novels, sometimes we pretend to be in them." She did not know what she and Laura expected.
