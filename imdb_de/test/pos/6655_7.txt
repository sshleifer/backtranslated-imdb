I went into this movie and thought I would not like it, but I hope to be surprised, but just like the movie, it became bleak and desperate. But do not misunderstand me, Minghella delivers everything from a great epic, and for those who like this kind of experience and are willing to embrace this adventure and accept what comes as close, they will not be disappointed and it will so in her opinion one of the better films of the year. The acting is of high quality and will most likely feature a trinity of oscillations for Law, Kidman and Zellweger, though Portman's few scenes are the most powerful in the film. The filming locations are beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot. <br /> <br /> For those of you who want the director to take you on an adventure instead of going out of your way, Minghella will make you disappointed and adapt. The movie is so bleak that it becomes one Boxing bag epic I'm trying to do with emotions, but so extreme and so often that during the movie I did not feel I had time to invest emotionally or recover from an earlier shock, and it became unrealistic and therefore too difficult to really care about, let alone predictable. All in all, because of the "cold mountain" I was almost too exhausted to even think about the good aspects of the movie, since everything I remember is death, which was an original subject, but not the characters in the end the focus.
