So Madonna is not Meryl Streep. Nevertheless, this is one of her first films and also a comedy. Give her a break! Sure, the film is at best mediocre and pale compared to its previous counterpart to Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is (a bit of fluff), it's pretty funny to see it. I do not have to hear anyone who supports the acting skills of Madonna with evidence or even adjectives other than "terrible," "bad," or other vaguely descriptive words. If you want to see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stay singing, how about Whitney Houston? She had the most undeserved commercial success of an actress in history and could not work herself out of a hatbox. The American public obviously can not tell the difference between a credible performance in a movie and a starpower. I think Madonna was always at least believable in her films. Get real people. Madonna bashing is 90s.
