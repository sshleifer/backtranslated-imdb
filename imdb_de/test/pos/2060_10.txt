I am very sad for some people who have reviewed this movie. It is obvious that their standards are so high that they can never enjoy a movie just for the enjoyment. Or maybe their enjoyment lies in taking movies apart; Are you looking for a reason not to like her at all? <br /> <br /> The Long Kiss Goodnight is an action movie in the truest sense of the word. Sure, there are holes in the plot that are big enough to go through a halfway, but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the movie itself. I've never been a big fan of Geena Davis, but I was impressed with how they could create two very different characters, Samantha Cain and Charlie Baltimore. In my opinion, it was not even necessary to change their looks to distinguish between the two ... Their acting was more than enough to do the trick. <br /> <br /> More than anything This movie was by Craig Bierko. In the hands of another, the character of Timothy could only have been another interchangeable villain. His decision to play him casually was just the perfect counterpoint to all the action scenes. It's not often that you find an actor who can express himself so well only with his facial expressions ... point in case: the scene in the freezer with Charlie and her daughter. Where most films would overload the moment of "revelation" with unnecessary dialogue, Bierko's eyes told the whole story. <br /> <br /> The basic action? Thin, to be honest. A seemingly average housewife suffering from amnesia slowly discovers that she was an assassin. When their memory returns, so do the people who want to see the killer dead. Is she really Samantha, the housewife who bakes cookies, or Charlie, the cold-blooded assassin? Or maybe a little bit of both? For me, The Long Kiss Goodnight was a pleasant journey to find out.
