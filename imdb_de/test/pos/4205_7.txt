The early films of the Dead End Kids (before being renamed "The Bowery Boys") were all very entertaining and well-produced films by Warner Brothers. Although they were more formal, they still had excellent writing, acting, and keep up well over time. Do not confuse them with the cheap Bowery Boys movies by Monogram Pictures - despite the presence of Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey, these films have had some of the shortcomings of previous films in terms of quality. <br /> <br /> The movie begins With the tough guy John Garfield he won the lightweight boxing championship. Unfortunately, he is drunk shortly thereafter and is held responsible for a murder he really did not commit. The problem is that he was so burdened that he was not sure if he did not kill the man. So he runs away and lives like a hobo. At some point he meets with May Robson and the Dead End Kids - and a lady you know is going to be his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> While the rest of the movie was not all that surprising, it did not seem to matter because of the quality of the movie. Garfield and the kids are at their best and this is a movie that will appeal to everyone but the most fussy audience.
