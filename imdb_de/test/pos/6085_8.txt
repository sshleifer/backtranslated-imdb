Anthony Minghella's "The English Patient" is a movie that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is magnificent and impressive in scope yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its depiction of human love and suffering. At the Academy Awards in 1997, the film had been awarded nine awards out of twelve nominations. The decisive clean hit since Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Last Emperor" (1988). Based on the 1992 Bucher Prize by Canadian writer Michael Ondaatje, "The English Patient" is a moving meditation on life, love and loss that traces the story of a critically burned man after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> A man (Ralph Fiennes) is spotted in the burning remains of a crashed plane. His face is scarred beyond recognition, and the man seems to be suffering from amnesia. It is believed that he is an Allied soldier and is simply referred to as the "English patient". After the war, in the mountainous hills of Italy, a friendly nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), who has apparently lost all relatives, remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man. Over time, she learns more and more about her "English patient", who turned out to be a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Instead of losing his memory during the plane crash, we learn that this scarred man may have chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to heal himself from the tragic memories of his past love. Through numerous flashbacks, we learn of Almásy's former deeds in the Sahara Desert and his romantic connection with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> It's certainly easy to see why 'The English Patient' was so successful at the Oscars. It's such a beautiful movie that combines the serene beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape perfectly; not since David Lean's great 'Lawrence of Arabia' did a film show the desert with such beauty and grandeur, taking full advantage of the aerial footage of Almásy's plane. Even in the more intimate moments of the film, the excellent use of close-up and lighting captures the emotion of the scene, coupled, of course, with the brilliant performances of all the performers. <br /> <br /> A long time My favorite actor, The English Patient, may have been Ralph Fiennes's best performer, and considering his story includes movies like Schindler's List and The Constant Gardener, This is not a supplement that is easy to understand. His Earl Laszlo de Almásy is a very sympathetic figure at first, but as we slowly learn more about his past, his loveable qualities are undermined by his less admirable leanings towards others. Ownership is a major theme of the film. When asked by Katherine what he hates the most, Almásy answers with "possession." If you leave, you should forget me. " However, as the relationship progresses and Katherine perhaps distances himself from him, Almásy reveals a touch of arrogance. He insists his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he wants, "I want to touch you, I want that." Things that belong to me, that belong to me. "<br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar here for her performance, excellently qualifies as Hana, the lonely nurse who fears to love those close to her because of the tragedies she has always had Having taken care of Almásy alone for some time, a dubious Canadian thief joins David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his fingers during the war and suspects that Almásy betrayed him to the Germans also a tentative romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bomb distributor from the British Army, but due to her background, Hana fears that her involvement in Kip will sentence him to death, especially considering his very dangerous work. <br /> < br /> With a length of 160 minutes "The English Patient" Brings wonderful memories of the classic romantic epics of the past and successfully finds a G Lightweight between mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The end of the film is heartbreaking and sad, but also uplifting in its own way. While some romantic relationships are doomed from the start, others have a very good chance of bringing good luck. Still, it's always better to have loved and lost than never to have loved.
