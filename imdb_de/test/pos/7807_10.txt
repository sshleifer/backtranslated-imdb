It's just ridiculous how underrated this movie is. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It never stays behind, it never slows down, it's a movie that has a wonderful flow into the storyline. That makes a great movie together with the brilliant writing. Aamir and Salman are unheard of, even Raveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti are delivering a great villain comedy, but Viju Khote and the Ajit wannabe are the best with their baffled villains. If you want to laugh and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with your family or friends, you will not regret it. Most Indian films tire me in the end because they are 3 hours long. This movie is just as long, but I wish it was more finished, because it's an amazing movie.
