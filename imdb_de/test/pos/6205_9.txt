This is an extremely exciting series that looks good and portrays a sensitive subject with great luster. We follow Michael Ealy as undercover FBI agent Darwyn, who is supposed to infiltrate a terror cell led by Farik (Or Fehr). The series is well written and has enough twists to make you sit at the edge of your seat and wait for what happens next. Michael Ealy is, in my opinion, one of the best actors I've ever seen seen as a covert agent portrayed. Outwardly cold, but still a good person who does his best to keep afloat in an extremely emotional rollercoaster ride the FBI has given him. Or Fehr, on the other hand, comes from a man who could fit into any social scenario. Big and strong, but still able to disappear into the gray mass when needed. Very binding and extremely clever. The way the two communicate on screen is spectacular. <br /> <br /> The way the story evolves, and the level of detail that the script provides, makes the whole story extremely believable and very lifelike I would imagine. It is so important to you feel insecure and do not know what might happen next in real life. We read about terror every day, and here we get a good look at an underworld that most of us know very little about. <br /> <br /> It's a series that is sure to be more. You are sitting there at the edge of your seat, just waiting for the next week's episode to come. It's a sure winner in my eyes, and I have no problem with this series being the best on my list of all times.
