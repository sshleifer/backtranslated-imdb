It's a sort of social commentary on how our life got out of control in the 1970s. The film is something that Mr. Schlesinger threw together after a bad day on the highway. A mess of snippets about the nuts found along the highway in Florida, and along the highway of life, the cast is mostly wasted and probably landed on the tailoring floor. The problem is that what does NOT land on the floor of the cutting room should probably be! Now available on DVD, it's kind of fun to watch a comedy that would have cost $ 100 million if produced in 2004. She's running along and is not too heavy to sit in, and strangely, in 2004 we're still pretty much just <br /> <br /> hoping in our cars and driving faster and faster, nowhere.
