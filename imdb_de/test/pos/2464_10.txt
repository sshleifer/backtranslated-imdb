This movie is sporadic on cable, and I've never really seen it. I thought he was like the Bruce Willis movie "√èn America," with the usual banal story of American freedom, and so on. But it was not like that; it was so much more! Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent. (I've never seen him in a movie I did not love, even though the script is bad because he's so talented). Kathy Bates is the presumptuous mother and does a great job. The real surprise is Emilio Estevez, who was not always involved in the best films, but was also the director of this film. Please do not stereotype it from the "Breakfast Club" movie. He is so much better at it, and I wish he would do more non-commercial, atypical Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The film is realistic as we see Emilio coming from Vietnam during Thanksgiving. Kimberly Williams is passable as the sister who feels she is "shameful and embarrassing" by the returning soldier, her brother; He's quite alienated from the family, and just at this time in US history, this story is very relevant. <br /> <br /> I've learned a lot about post-traumatic stress, and you will really empathize with that sense of being; This is not a violent, journalistic account, such as "Platoon," but rather a character study that makes us all the more fascinated and concerned about the effects of the war, especially considering the young age of the soldiers. In today's violence, it's rare for a movie to make you feel really sad and shed a tear; that does it and deserves recognition.
