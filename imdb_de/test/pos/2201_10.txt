I own a copy of this movie and have always loved it. However, I comment here because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. This production was staged by the San Francisco Opera with George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early 1980s, Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou had won Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) perform Sweeney on Broadway. You must have shot the movie at about the time I saw the show. To this day, the most moving moment that I can remember in the theater happened when Hearn sang "These are my Friends." ("These are my friends, see how they sparkle." "My arm is complete again!") <br /> <br /> Hearn's appearance in the San Francisco Opera production convinced me that he was in the near Twenty years ago, I saw him first on Broadway and later in the movie. What a talent! He is sympathetic, funny and scary - all at once; and he can sing, boy he can sing. It all reminded me how great the movie is. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.
