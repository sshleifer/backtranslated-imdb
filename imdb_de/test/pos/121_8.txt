Now I understand that this movie was not meant to be an indictment of all Indians, but it is an amazing movie because it dares to examine the hypocrisy that some Indians have about their wives and their sexuality. I know for some time that sexism is very prevalent in this society (women are murdered because the husband's family no longer wants them after his death, or because she had a small dowry, as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses, because) they will seen as a curse and not as a blessing. I'm also aware that some of this culture will be very offended by the movie, but the bottom line is that the subject is a bit of a truth - even though the film was so heavily attacked on its debut a decade ago in India. As a result of the extreme misogyny in the film, most Western viewers are shocked or at least emotionally involved in the plight of the ladies in this film. <br /> <br /> Although I'm male, I'm not crazy feminist and I'm honest, the movie had a strong positive impact on me and it's NOT an agenda movie that only lesbians and "man-hate" can enjoy. I do not believe that the film promotes hatred of men or homosexuality, but instead makes a credible argument, as was the only reasonable alternative for these two ladies because of their evil husbands. Yes, I use the word "evil" and mean it because both husbands who live in this big household are very selfish and do not take into account the sexuality of their spouse. In many traditional societies this is indeed the case, and women are condemned to an empty emotional existence. A husband married a lively young woman, Sita, for a family engagement. This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for both, but at the beginning Sita tries to connect with her sullen husband. However, he sees himself as a victim and could not have cared much about Sita - and he still has an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese woman. To make matters worse, he did nothing to hide the matter and did not apologize. In her dead marriage, sex was only meant to bring forth children, and there was no way for Sita to fulfill her sexual or emotional needs. And unfortunately he could not have cared less. <br /> <br /> Another husband was married to a barren woman (Radha). Strangely enough, after initially trying to have children, they went the next 13 years without any sexual contact! This is because this man has decided to become an ascetic (ie, in Hinduism, a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to attain inner enlightenment). Well, he wanted all this well and good if he was not already married and had obligations for his wife. However, since he was married, this was an incredibly selfish act, and like his brother, he assumed that his wife had neither sexual feelings, nor did he seem to care. Next, he would be sexually closest to sleeping next to him - as she helped teach him "to overcome the desires of the flesh." That must not have brought her anything but frustration. <br /> <br /> So you have two neglected and normal women who live in the same household, who long for emotional connection, as well as a connection for their sexual needs. Ultimately these needs bring these sisters-in-law together - at first only emotionally, later also sexually. The film was as brilliant as I was led to see and understand how homosexuality is sometimes inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolation. Later in the film, when the intensity of their sex life is discovered, it leads to a not entirely unexpected reaction from Radha's "enlightened" husband - a man who seeks for religious insight and peace, but is so self-contained in that true insight and growth are impossible. <br /> <br /> This is a very challenging and adult movie. Although there is very little nudity, the subject is very adult and this is not a movie shown to your kids. In fact, a small character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady is very disturbing - as I said, this is NOT a movie where your kids watch. For a mature audience, however, this is an excellent and highly erotic film that makes one think. <br /> <br /> The film is characterized by good acting, complex characters, excellent writing, pleasant mood music and a slow pace may annoy some, but I found this rewarding. The only serious negative that I can blame not for the movie itself, but for the idiots who have videotape this. This is because although the film is written in English, the accents are sometimes quite strong and it is not always easy to understand what has been said. BUT, and that's the worst part, there are no closed or open captions - that too is a must for the Western audience. If you watch this movie, check if you can find it on DVD or hopefully there will be a newer release on video subtitles - it certainly was not for me. <br /> <br /> By the way, director Deepa Mehta (a popular female director) has made some other wonderful films like EARTH and BOLLYWOOD / Hollywood. A consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and Westernism - with a strong emphasis on female characters. Not surprisingly, this Western-thinking woman lives in Canada and divorces - a truly unusual woman, to say the least. For another similar film exploring traditional culture and western culture, try another Canadian gem, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.
