The above line summarizes it pretty well. The best assets of the comics are the visual jokes and the jokes (the latter are almost impossible to translate, which is why the comics in their original language are the best). <br /> <br /> Both are pretty hard to capture in the movie, so they will never be as good as the comics. Movies are simply a different medium than comics. That's why this movie is surprisingly good at keeping the comic fun. <br /> <br /> The word gags are tolerable and sometimes funny (Debouze makes an Amelie reference!). I have to mention that I have seen the French version. If you do not look at the French version or your understanding of the French language does not limit you to the subtitles, the word jokes will probably shit. <br /> <br /> The slapstick is fine too; It's a very simple form of humor and not really funny if you're older than twelve, but it captures the spirit of comic books. The other visual jokes are the saving grace of the film for the older audience, as they are often quite funny. <br /> <br /> The acting is totally over the top, but that's not annoying at all since it's the ghost of the comicbooks. Only Depardieu and Clavier do not affect the matter too much. This may be the reason why some people think they have not enjoyed their roles (I have not noticed). On the other hand, Jamel Debouze and especially Claude Rich turn Overacting into an art form. It's actually fun to watch. I'm afraid it would not be nearly as funny if the voices are dubbed. All in all, not a bad movie, much better than the previous one. It's not a classic and does not reveal Asterix's Twelve Tasks as my favorite movie from Asterix, but it's still worth watching. The French version is the. 7/10
