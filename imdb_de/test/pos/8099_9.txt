Chaplin plays a dual role as a Jewish barber confused with amnesia with the dictator Adenoid Hynkel (ie Hitler). A film made in 1940, when the war was in its dark days and by no means won by the Allies. Hitler was banned by Hitler in Germany and was in some way at risk for Chaplin, because if the war were lost he would surely have been sent away to be "transformed." <br /> <br /> A funny satire with the classic scene of Hitler whirling around a giant balloon of the world ... have fun, but with a message ... in the end a little preacher. This was the last movie with Chaplin's characteristic little mustache. on a scale of one to ten..9
