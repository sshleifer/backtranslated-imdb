When I saw the poster of this movie for the first time, I put it down as another low-budget movie for teenagers. After a few days, when it was finally released, one of my friends told me it was a good one. A year later, when I saw the commercial for the first time, Anand wanted to do that on TV, and the moment came when I turned the channels, and for a moment I stopped to watch, and in the end I got that seen the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And now, 3 years later, I would do that. I've seen the movie at least 7-8 times and I do not watch movies again and again. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it tries to be different, as all Telugu movies were composed of 6 songs and 4 fights. <br /> <br /> It's a simple movie, a bit slow, but a very thrilling script. There are no loose ends in the film, well-versed dialogues, which is really hard to find by. <br /> <br /> The music is both classic and soothing, great renditions of Radha Krishnan, some great kirtanas are also featured in bgmusic throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Cinematography deserves a mention. The editing is not smooth, but appropriate for a romantic movie like this one. <br /> <br /> However, what really blows you away in this film is two things: 1. The way every scene has been treated with respect, the now famous Shekar Kammula. <br /> <br /> 2. The beautiful lyrics of Veturi. <br /> <br /> And one more thing deserves a special mention: Kamalini, part of her success attributed to Sunitha for giving her such a beautiful voice, really tells you that the voice is causing miracles. <br /> <br /> The other actors are equally good, Raja in the title character and the little girl and the way she screams when she gets a new dog. <br /> <br /> Finally I can tell you that this movie will soon be another classic with these old classics, along with Kammulas other classic-romantic piece, Godavari.
