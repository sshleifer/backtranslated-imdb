LACKAWANNA BLUES is a beautiful play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even finer film when the author adapted his own life story for the screen. This brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors, fine music, brilliant cut, brilliant director George C. Wolfe and a cast that is so impressive that they force an extra viewing! Yes, it's just so good. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the author's life as the child "Junior" (Marcus Carl Franklin) living in the inimitable home of the soulful, empathetic Rachel "Nanny" Crosby (S Epatha Merkerson), a woman who devoted her life to supporting the disenfranchised, bringing her from the south, from mental hospitals, and from the streets to Lackawanna, New York. The boy remembers all the lessons he has learned from the inhabitants of the house about life - weird characters with a painful past - and the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family that Nanny saved. The innumerable characters of the house are too numerous to outline, but they are portrayed by some of the best actors in the industry: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, the beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr., Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson , Charlie Woodward, Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers and Hill Harper - the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, we become acquainted with the atrocities of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the contagious joy of the music contributions of African American music to our musical culture and courage a fine woman who has combated all the hardships that the world can muster the dignity of those with whom she came into contact. S. Epatha Merkerson is fully immersed in this role, a role that makes her shine like a mind in a world of chaos. It features one of the most impressive performances of recent years, and if this movie were to be screened as an HBO movie in the cinemas, it would undoubtedly honor the Oscar with their Golden Globe Award. <br /> The entire cast is extraordinary and Wolfe is treated the drama and the story like a master: like riffs in a jazz tune, he adds minute talk moments to every character and junior, along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance festivals in the local clubs, blues, jazz, dance and dance Joy to be fulfilled. The production team has assembled this little wonder of a picture with the utmost care, and attention always lags behind the moment of history. Highly recommended, almost obligatory visit!
