Loved this movie! Join the old school! Love the idea I love the script. Love the characters. I really loved the geeks! I was excited that the stupid slapstick horror movies were still honored. That was among my favorites like Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium. If you are a big fan of scary AND stupid, then this is your movie! Just a star off because I would like to have a better sound. Not a bad sound, but would have liked to have more. Great blood splashes. Big murder weapons. Great costumes! I love nodding at the awesome 80s teenage stereotype of a breakfast club. And I can appreciate the non-CGI tension. Really good camera action and light tension instead of cutting CGI. I'd rather have a good fake that's really wrong fake. <br /> <br /> Kisses to the actors and creators! Oh, the "making of" also loved!
