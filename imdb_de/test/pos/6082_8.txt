One of the most charming and strongest elements of Anthony Minghella's best picture winner, The English Patient, is the fact that Hollywood was in its early stages of losing its nerve in the mid-1990s. Big new projects created a film that left its mark - very powerful traces of the breathtaking majesty that produced films such as "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) and "The Ten Commandments" (1956). "The English Patient" contains a great deal of what made these films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, an extended duration that hardly seems long, and fascinating characters with history and past. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" based on the eponymous novel by Michael Ondaatje is like "The Godfather: Part II" (1974) in the sense of its structure. It's a mixture of two stories: past and present, all about the title character: an English patient in the post-war years of the Second World War. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who was killed in a plane crash for life and cared for in an isolated church by a single nurse, wonderfully played by Juliette Binoche. Apart from the fact that Binoche is allied with her clumsy, disturbed patient, Binoche learns of his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men seem to know each other. <br /> <br /> This is just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this movie. The other, which is told in retrospect, is the patient's past, before he was scarred and died in bed. The history of the present mingled with the patient's past and his love affair, which tragically changed his life forever. <br /> <br /> To be honest, "The English Patient" is a love story that mixes with a profound epic feeling and so mixes wonderfully. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate, obsessive, and how enchantingly she was portrayed on screen. In love stories like Minghella's later "Cold Mountain" (2003), the romantic elements seem far more pleasurable than obsessive. Some of the love scenes contain elements that may be associated with lust rather than love. However, since it is so well developed and not rushed and disproportionately exploited, we can believe that there is a sure, true love to these signs. It reminded me a lot of "Vertigo" (1958), in which it was convinced by the filmmakers and performers that these were two real people who really fell in love. <br /> <br /> The performances in the area were great. I was particularly fascinated by the performance of Juliette Binoche, who took home the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked that Willem Dafoe played a kind of cynical, questionable character that is always distinctive in the game. And of course I must not miss Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their depictions of two very passionate lovers. Despite my tremendous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I described it as "awful" perfect movie. There are two shortcomings that I can not look at. First, it's a bit too long and the reason for that is my second complaint, there are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not thrilled or particularly interested in the second love story between Binoche and a bomb expert played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to believe that this plot comes from the original book, and I'm sure it worked perfectly, but in the movie, it seems a bit distracting and the relationship between the two characters does not intrigue me. I was much more interested in Fienne's character and his relationship with his two leading ladies. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, these two mistakes are easy to forgive, even if they are a bit slower. "The English Patient" is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking. For me, it was a kind of crazy mix of "Casablanca" (1942) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), two notable and better films, and this effective mix was worth my time. It is a pity that Anthony Minghella left us. Because he was a really talented filmmaker. These are all the proofs that everyone needs.
