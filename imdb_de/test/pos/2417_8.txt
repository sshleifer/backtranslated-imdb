This is the fourth movie in the Karate Kid series. But it has nothing to do with the previous 3rd. The only character left is Mr. Myagi. This time around, Mr. Myagi is known for the troubled teenage Julie Pierce (Julie Pierce), who has all sorts of problems, including bullying at school, from a man who belongs to a pseudo-military campus club. Of course she is trained in combat. Anyway, Julie Karat learns through Myagi and mentally becomes a better person herself and in the end she regains her respect. I like the unique idea that the antagonist is a woman and has a husband as her enemy. There are also some fighting scenes that are pretty well executed, very reserved and minimally violent. The fights are graphic. The end is good too and a bit surprising. It's predictable, but not a typical ending to this kind of movie. The movie obviously has echoes of the original, especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons he has learned as well as the 1st mov. That is, and certainly not as good as the 2nd.it, however, is a huge leap forward versus the disappointing third Entry. This is a very entertaining dog movie film suitable for the whole family. 8.10
