I could see a preview of this movie through the UCLA Pre-Screening Program, and I'd like to tell you: THIS FILM IS AMAZINGLY GOOD !!!! I have seen many films, but few have made me laugh so seriously or talk about it as much as this one. I had a good respect for Tenacious D before I saw the movie, and now I'm MAD because of them. I'll definitely buy her album when it's released on the 14th, and see that movie again. <br /> <br /> If you were on the fence watching this movie, GET OFF AND GO SEE IT !! It is worth the extremely expensive price of movie tickets these days, as you will surely get a delicious laugh throughout the whole thing. Aside from the comedy, the magnificent and divine music that's made by KG's guitar and JB's voice is impressive. The audience is stunned that such beautiful harmonies and amazing riffs can be created in connection with such ridiculous (and witty) lyrics. If only for the music itself, this film is worth the price. <br /> <br /> With a wonderfully coherent storyline that combines almost all aspects of traditional "D" history and branding, great new songs, hilarious comedy and some pretty awesome cameos, this movie is rated there with the best ! Look at it !!
