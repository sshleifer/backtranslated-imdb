Bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now defunct American animation company Filmation on the back of He-man: Masters of the Universe and She-Ra: Princess of Power 1983 and 87 '. The plot of the cartoon was about an Indian cowboy named Marshall Bravestarr who has the strength of the bear, the ears of the wolf, the speed of the puma and the eyes of a hawk, and his faithful buddy, a talking horse named Thirty-Thirty , who carried a weapon with the fitting name of "Sarah Jane" and with the help of Deputy Fuzz and Judge JB serves to protect New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his band of Outlaws The futuristic Texas was and still is one the few cartoons that are filmed in a particular city in the US - in the southern thousand light years of the future. Given that this was done in the '80s, the creators have done an impressive job trying to create the wild west look for a sci-fi look. Not only did Bravestarr conjure up morality and good verses, but also teaching children about life, it also highlighted the issues of culture and community, and we should not take things and life for granted. And though this is an action-adventure cartoon, many of the storylines, themes, and topics it addresses address in a meaningful way for children and adults. In addition, Marshall Bravestarr was one of the first major (ethnic) minority cartoon characters to have an impact on television. <br /> <br /> The sound effects were amazing, the music was great and the song theme equally memorable and the animation was wonderful. The characters were well designed and the stories were varied, teaching the children morality and the importance of right and wrong. Something the same can not be said about today's cartoons. <br /> <br /> Although Bravestarr has been overshadowed by the success of He-man, it is still a personal favorite for many cartoon fanatics of the 80s. Suffice to say, I preferred Bra-Manarr over He-Man because the storylines and characters were diverse, and the depth of the situations and problems confronting the characters was more what I would call realistic and identifiable. For some reason, they were more popular with humans, because in "The Pledge", where a child dies from an overdose of a drug, the fact that there was no happy ending was important - in the sense that children were watching this episode indeed, anyone watching this episode will be aware of even the devastating consequences of drug use and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs. <br /> <br /> Bold, brave and sometimes thought-provoking. Bravestarr is definitely so brave, brave and thought-provoking. An iconic comic classic who ventured for many years dared to take some risks, but in the end he really paid off. It will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting and best 80s cartoons of all time, and rightly 8 and a half out of ten
