Sharky's Machine finds Burt Reynolds as a drug cop who was killed after a failed buy and fail that was not his fault but a few people doing so, and is demoted to vice squad in Atlanta. <br /> <br The prestige is hardly as good as the narcotics, but it has its side effects. One night, after a compilation of girls dropping one of their books into their hands, the boys ask for surveillance from Rachel Ward's location. It is an expensive product and serves notorious gangster Vittorio Gassman as well as Gubernatorial candidate Earl Holliman. <br /> <br /> However, your surveillance records a murder, and the rest of the movie consists of Sharky and his new colleagues trying it. Solve this Prestige case. <br /> <br /> Although this is a Burt Reynolds movie and they usually have a sense of humor, the comedy is kept in check as the movie becomes as deadly serious as Dirty Harry. It has indeed been reported that Clint Eastwood was offered this movie. <br /> <br /> Look for good services from vice-policemen Bernie Casey and Brian Keith and from Henry Silva, the cranky brother of Gassman, who does the dirty work of the organization and loves his job. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, a mix of Dirty Harry and Laura. Why Laura? You have to see Sharky's Machine for this answer.
