We saw this movie in Austin Texas at the Alamo South Lamar yesterday afternoon. I laughed out loud many times! The scene about Albert Einstein's thoughts about humanity hit me again and again and I could not stop laughing. It is a pity that there are no more theaters, I know many friends who are dying to see this movie! "Welcome to Costco, I love you." ... great work for everyone! If you see it, you should stay until the end of the credits! I will bring my family safely to see it again this weekend! If you're a fan of OFFICE SPACE and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, then you need to watch this movie. It's a classic and nobody knows it's out! So if you feel like seeing something funny this weekend, you should definitely try it.
