I discovered this late night on Turner Classics. I kept saying, "I'll turn it off as soon as it stops being funny," but it's needless to say I've been looking all the way through. <br /> <br /> I'm a movie junkie, but I did not even have a HEARD from this movie (or when I did that in 1971, I forgot). It's worth it just to see the performance of Goldie Hawn as a harsh tongue. Her acting is a revelation in this film. Yes, the script is sharp and excellent (when did you last do a Hollywood comedy with a smart script?), But their acting is extraordinary. I've never realized how funny Goldie could be, and that makes her a bit sad later in roles like Laugh-In and Private Benjamin. In her later career she is far too exaggerated compared to her minimalist, viciously funny appearance. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to see young Matthau, the great Bergman and the outstanding cast, but that's it. Goldie Hawn will make this movie worth seeing again.
