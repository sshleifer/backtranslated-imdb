After watching this movie, I have no choice but to write a review in the hope that there will be others like me, the rocket driven Ninja action and the hot, hot Ninja sex kick III: The Domination blown away /> <br /> We all know that Sho rocks Kosugi. That's a matter of course, but what about Jordan Bennett's ultra macho interpretation of his police officer "Billy Secord"? Bravo Mr. Bennett, Bravo. They prove early as you try to seduce the buxom Christie (seduced by a Miss Lucinda Dickey of Breakin 'celebrity) that you are not afraid to venture your craft. I especially enjoyed that you do not feel the need to intervene and help her while 4 thugs try to rape her outside of her gym. Oh, you could have helped, but by standing there and watching, she let you know who the boss was. Secord will wear the pants in this regard. I also enjoyed that Mr. Bennett did not fear having his shirt pulled out repeatedly despite his gorilla, like shoulders and back. Back and shoulder hair are hot and Secord knows. And how about Lucinda Dickey? All I can say is "KABOOM" - I see a bombshell ready to explode. She has all the right moves as a temptress and martial artist. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is why this movie is ticking. You would think that she would hate him because he is a bit cheesy, but no friends. The animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they connect like crazy glue. Sho Kasugi is not as prominent as you might think, although it is still a main character, which is fine with me because I wanted more Bennett and Dickey. He seems to wear a lot of eye make-up, which was nice to see. The special effects? Impressive. That's all I can say. I will not reveal the end, but let's just say it will not disappoint. I love Ninja III: The Dominion and can only hope that there is a Ninja 4. I give 5 out of 5 throwing stars. disappoint.
