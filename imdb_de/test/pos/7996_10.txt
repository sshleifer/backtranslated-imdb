"Batman Begins, THIS" is the ultimate Batman movie you do not want to miss. This movie has it all and surpasses the first mega hit of 1989 totally first at the box office, but this is certainly a much better movie. The picture quality is amazing, Burton works as always in his films. Gotham City, the hunting ground of Batmans, is an amazing sight. The story itself is pretty good and the two villains in this game are VERY interesting, much more interesting than their comic counterparts. Tim Burton and screenwriter Daniel Walters go a step further to give you a really emotional connection with these characters. The Penguin, played perfectly by Danny Devito, is a kind of tragic character abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denies him. Very disgusting to see sometimes, but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever express in a single movie. The other villain is Catwoman, so brilliantly played by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time, and she gives a WOW performance and she steals the show in relation to the past and present live-action Batman villains. She also has a tragic background. Her name is Selina Kyle, and she's a very pushy, lousy secretary to a clever businessman named Max Shreck, who later murders her by shoving her out of the window. Somehow, she survives and is "woken up" by cats, and she decides to become the legendary Catwoman, not before, of course, the amazing sequence in which she completely lets go of her entire apartment in one of the finest Oscars worthy of rage and fury that I have ever seen in an actress. Michael Keaton pulls on his cape and hood as Batman and as Bruce Wayne and also as Bruce Wayne and THIS time he is much darker. There is not much else to say except that Keaton is simply the best actor Batman has ever played. He's just cool and he has a kind of Clint Eastwood's approach to playing Batman, and he's very dark. He does not talk much, and when he does, he sounds cool and does not sound too stupid, and fake IE-Bat's "Batman" voice starts in Batman. He sweeps around Gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons. he is pseudonymically disturbed, and you know it. On this trip, he records two of the most famous villains to grace the Batman comic world. <br /> <br /> Despite the incredible action scenes I have to say, as the scenes with the coolest Batmobile EVERYONE driving down the street hit the floor and Batman glides over Gotham, it's the romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton, who really makes this movie classic a first choice for anyone who wants to see the REAL Batman in action, would have more if I could.
