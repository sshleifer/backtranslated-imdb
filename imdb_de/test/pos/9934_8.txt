After the opera's leading actress died in a car accident, her young colleague Betty is taken to the top. This is a great luck for her, with one problem: she has an admirer who has decided to kill all her friends and watch her. What is his connection to the opera and what fascinates him for Betty? <br /> <br /> I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. And I'm not an Orthodox fan, I think. Many people, especially critics, praise his earlier works ("Suspiria" and "Deep Red"), but they frowned at later films like "Sleepless" that I liked. My favorite, "Phenomena", is usually severely underestimated. "Opera" falls somewhere in between. Some see it as one of his last major films, others see it as part of his so-called decay. I loved it. <br /> <br /> The image is crisp, the music is great (unlike other critics I love the metal soundtrack), the female lead is someone I can feel (similar to Jennifer Connelly from "Phenomena") And the pictures ... wonderful, great cinematography and some amazing kill scenes, the concept of sticking needles to a person's eyes so they can not blink ... brilliantly, my assistant Tina says it looked wrong but even if, the idea is more than enough to spread, and some great effects, like a knife blade coming in the mouth of a man? Awesome. <br /> <br /> Jim Harper calls the movie a "Breathtaking" and draws attention to "innovative cinematography, well constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders." I totally agree with that - a shot follows the camera through winding tunnels and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story. Mike Mayo also calls it "visually fascinating eye candy" and praises the "crisp editing and flowing camera work". It's really a miracle that this is not one of Argento's more acclaimed works. <br /> <br/> Argento returned to the opera with "Phantom of the Opera" which, despite his casting, had failed a bit. Daughter Asia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting is that Michele Soavi released "Stagefright" in the same year, which (like "Opera") has a murderer in a theater who kills those involved in the presentation. Both are great movies, with Soavi more on the Slasher side. (Soavi was actually a second unit director at Opera ... You can draw your own conclusions.) <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this movie is the length and the tempo. It's shot very well and the kill scenes are gorgeous, but they are not as common as they should be. The first takes more than half an hour, and then there are breaks between them. The lead actress should be in constant horror, but she has time to calm down, as if everything were back to normal. Not cool, Dario. We have to keep the tension low and the intensity high.
