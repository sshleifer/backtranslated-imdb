This movie blew me away. I'm one of those who take a risk with films that sometimes do not particularly appeal to me, and I have to say this film paid off. I mean, wow! Even my boys enjoyed the movie (then 5 and 6), although I'm pretty sure it was not geared to their age groups. <br /> <br /> This movie was also clean, which is great plus. It's so great to put yourself on a movie that you can enjoy without obscenity, violence (except for a very brief scene), or anything else you may feel morally inadmissible. Journey you so want to believe because of the great acting , They feel the manifold emotions that are presented together with the characters. <br /> <br /> I never thought that I would have a movie on the edge of my seat, but I have no interest in how much it would be interesting to turn out I have nothing to compare as I have not been golf before seen in reality in the movie, but everyone has done a great job keeping the pace and emotions here. The score has also worked wonders; excellent, excellent score. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not believe that this would be your kind of movie, have a look at the movie. You will be pleasantly surprised. I was sure.
