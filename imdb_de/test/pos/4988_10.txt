It's also the best book I've ever read. Karl Urban and Steve Zahn are great together. It had drama, adventure and sweetness and sadness. I laughed. I cried. It's hard not to laugh when Gus speaks. I wish Gus had beaten Clara the way he did with Inez. Clara has been leading Gus all these years without ever marrying him. She just liked to play with him. It was sad that he was looking for her all his life. It would have been nice if Woodrow had married Maggie, but she would have died from him anyway. Woodrow was a man who could not express his feelings and put them in bottles. It was obvious he loved Maggie after the Austin attack when the Rangers returned and he ran to hold her. Val Kilmer is very good at playing strange characters. I loved his portrayal of Captian Inish Skull. I loved the whole Lonesome Dove saga. Comanche Moon is the best of the best.
