"Any Gun Can Play" (1967), directed by Enzo G. Castellari, is a very good pastiche of spaghetti westerns, especially Leone's. The first half is great, which, apart from the opening, is a direct allusion to "For a Few Dollars More," with Monco, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and El Indio running into a ghost town and then promptly killed by a bounty hunter Called "The Stranger", it's absolutely reputable, with great shootings (especially the engaging scene), fast and furious action, and good gigs by Gilbert Roland, George Hilton and Edd Byrnes (who does well, considering he has one) has a bad reputation). But then, when the movie has reached the middle, there's a funny fist fight between Hilton and Byrnes. It's not very funny and it's the weakest part of the movie, but it sheds a new light on everything you've seen so far. You realize that the whole thing is actually a spoof of western spaghetti conventions, and in retrospect, the first half is so well done that you'll miss that spoof undercurrent completely. What follows now is an obvious parody, with even some acrobatics jumping in front of Brynes, all of which were older than those circus westerns of the 70s. The end, a complete dispatch of the climax of "the good, the bad and the ugly", has been very well done, as it could have been very stupid in other hands. Well, a pretty funny spaghetti western who does not take himself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Spaghetti Western.
