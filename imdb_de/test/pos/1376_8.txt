I had a terrible day, but this movie grabbed me, and I could not lay it to the end ... and I had forgotten my terrible day. and the end ... by the way ... where is the sequel !!! <br /> <br /> the budget is obviously extremely low ... but ... look what they did with it! it reminds me of a play ... they basically work with a tent, a 'rescue capsule', a few weapons, uniforms, camping gear and a 'scanner' thing. that's it for props. Perhaps this is even a good thing to force acting and writing to take their rightful place in the film as the center of the work, instead of having an excuse for CGI (starwars) retrospectively. <br /> <br /> The CGI is fine. It's not exactly 'seamless' ... but imho still works. Why? because it is not too much of it and what is there is not 'taking over' with an army of effect house people trying to stuff everything they can. it stimulates imagination ... it's a relatively simple stuff with decent composition (especially the heavy freighter shot ... there's a wide angle shot that takes at least ten seconds ...), the full length of the ship It must be a record for sci-fi battle sequence filmmaking in the last 10 years to have an action sequence that lasts more than .75 seconds, and a sense of history. it may look old or not "state of the art", but it does not look stupid and does not take the story with it. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, except that the characters die too fast to get to know them. The captain was great, but a few of his scenes might have needed a different shot. I also got confused when his character lost his coolness and stomped on a corpse. I like it when captains are calm and laid back and in control ... what was going on in this scene? Did the other crew worry that he lost it at that moment? Did he feel himself losing control? <br /> <br /> Well, as far as the plot is concerned ... mostly it's good ... why? Because it does not try to explain itself. It just happens. It's called "the planet", it's a mystery. Nobody knows why a statue exists, and they do not know it. The mysterious cult? The funny scientist with the tattoo? What do you expect in less than 90 minutes? This is not war and peace. And thankfully, it's not a Star Wars / Trek either. No Midichlorians, no 5-minute boring dialogue that makes no sense in history. The characters are stranded and can only find out a few basic things ... it's not a Star Trek episode where they find out it's Leonardo Davinci or a kid like Space Walker. It is mysterious and I liked that. I do not know why, maybe I can identify more with these guys because they do not know what's going on, and neither do I ... they do not talk much about space man or have magic boxes that tell them what's going on. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the "traitor" appeals to the crew and tries to "explain" the reason for the planet, the cult, and so on. This happens to have some of the weakest dialogues, imho, throughout the movie, interrupting the flow and some of the characters seem unnatural in this scene. <br /> <br /> OK, sometimes it was a bit too mysterious. Why was the guy being flashed through his eyes? That was strange. Just funny. The 'hamlet' ends ... again I would like to know some of these characters better. And would it have been so hard to end up with a 30 second rescue scene? This is not a serial show, it was a movie and we like to close movies, even if they have a sequel. Imagine Hamlet, without angel flights sing to your rest. Anyway. What can I say. That was worth the dollar I paid at the "red box" machine in the supermarket. It was also, imho, a better piece of storytelling than Starwars parts 1 2 or 3. As I said, it drew me in, wanted to know what was going on, and I could not stop watching until the end.
