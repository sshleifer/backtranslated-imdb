Let me first check the movie. This movie sneaks me out and I do not even believe in aliens! However, the film has its weaknesses. <br /> <br /> There are three acts to this movie. First act is perfect. It sets up the movie and builds on the creep factor. I have to say, the score is great! Everything is prepared and perfectly decorated. Act Two begins as Jillian, who plays Sherry Burton, shrinks. They hypnotize her and she remembers the kidnapping. Act II ruins the film as the aliens emerge. "Screaming Mad George" has the implications for the aliens. I have to say that they have done a good job except with the portrayal of the "gray" aliens. No offense, but the Grays looked like inflatable door prices. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I liked how they treated one and two hypnosis in Acts. If you paid attention, you would find that the husband and wife had two different memories. In the version of the man's event, the blue light zaps her and his wife says, "Someone is here" or something like that. It makes sense. The man is worried about his wife. "Someone" can hurt her. That's his topic. However, in her version of the events she says, "Help me!" She does not say "Someone is here". That makes sense, too. The aliens are after her. Wanting her husband to help her and save her is her topic. Now back to the movie. <br /> <br /> The third act makes the film a big party. It starts with a "strange" ultrasound procedure. It's a typical gore feast, but it comes to a surprising end. I will not ruin it because it is actually an interesting development. <br /> <br /> The DVD and the comments take themselves too seriously, but if you think that Wilford Brimley says "Horsesh **" is funny, you should check it out in the cast interviews. Now to my praise of Jillian McWhirter. <br /> <br /> I could only hope that Jillian will read this. I've never seen them, but wow, what a performance! Let me tell that to the rest of you. First of all, this should be a serious movie. The details that I'm going to describe now may sound funny and funny, like "Humanoids From The Deep" (1980), but it really is not. Roger that? OK. <br /> <br /> Jillian is hot and looks good, of course. She is naked for many movies, a good thing. Unfortunately, she is usually attacked, terrorized and raped, which is very bad. However, she has to be naked in many of these films. She gets points to overcome that. She has to hurt herself in a few moments, happy, sad, horny, anxious and physically. The turnaround is amazing! She must rejoice when she learns that she is pregnant. She has to scream in fear when the aliens get her guts out. She must be very angry if her husband suggests the baby is not his. She has to behave as if she were denied and said that nothing is wrong with her baby when her husband says otherwise. A refusal, I should note, which is really imposed by the aliens they control. I'm talking about Oscar-caliber performance here! <br /> <br /> Then there's the rape scene. It's disturbing, but since it's just some alien, it's not that bad. In this scene, the alien is not a "gray" alien, so I'll describe it. The alien has tentacles and it's a bit of a table. Jillian lies on the table-like part and is held back by the tentacles. At her head is the stranger's head. The alien's head is long and it falls down so that the head is now above Jillian's legs. Then the alien-He-Nanu-Nanu comes out of his forehead. It's the forehead! Sounds pretty good, right? Well, Jillian is playing it right now and she's pulling it off! She has to behave like an alien when Hey-Nanu-Nanu gets off her forehead and rapes her, and she pulls it off! It's a very intense scene, but that does not matter. You see, this scene is done in a flashback. What sets the scene is the performance of Jillian reminiscent of these events. She is hypnotic only in a hospital bed, reminiscent of alien abduction, but her acting here is more intense than the actual rape scene! How many actors can do a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene with the rape? Not many! Jillian does it though. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. Jillian, if you ever read this, I want you to know that I (Name withheld) as the alias of MegamanX-1 thinks you are the best actress. You're the best actress ever! I just hope you read this and always take it with you. <br /> <br /> "Progeny" (1999) is a movie by Okay to Good for everyone else. I would recommend it.
