"Japan takes the best of the whole world and makes it his own," though this may be true, it applies to everyone except one thing, this being, ..... Major League Baseball ... but do not worry "Baseball" is there to change it all. But who exactly will change who is the part of the film that makes it really rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and shines in his comedic roles. The plot may be lifelike, but the subplot is dead. The Japanese people are a meek, respectful people whose ways and traditions are very different from those of the Western Society. All these elements and obstacles make a really funny and funny movie. It's definitely worth it!
