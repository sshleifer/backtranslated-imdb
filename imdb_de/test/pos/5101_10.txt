I wish I had seen this for the first time in a movie theater when it was first published, as some of the commentators had done. It's really a sweetheart. To be fair, I have not seen another version of Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and I do not want to. For me, this is a perfect version. I first saw it on TCM years ago and never forgot it. Yesterday I had the pleasure to see it with my girlfriend, although I had taken it from TCM a few days ago. There were parts of the movie where we both were with tears in our eyes, it's really a moving movie. <br /> <br /> And should not that be what films are about? <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful, the movie was filmed wonderfully. The acting is first class. And the story is delicate and timeless. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite movies of all time.
