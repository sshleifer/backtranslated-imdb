Right, the scene with Holly and Shannon in the hospital was great. It started with Piper On A Gurney, who looked very badly injured. The doctors took her to a room for resuscitation. They took her from the Gurney to a bed and Prue holds her hand It is obvious that Piper has a lot of difficulty breathing and her lungs fail when she intervenes to Prue so as not to leave her side. "Do not let me go, I love you and then her pulse goes down and she goes into cardiac arrest and the monitor shows a clear, flat line and the nurses go into trauma mode and bring a defibrillator." Prue steps back from bed in horror As the doctors desperately try to shock the heart of their dying sisters, but there is no reaction is tragically pronounced great good scene girl well done girl
