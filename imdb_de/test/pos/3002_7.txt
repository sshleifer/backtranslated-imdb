Husband-wife medical team Carole and Niles Nelson are modest in their careers, but Niles has a gambling problem. His fortune changes when he (unknowingly) rescues the life of a mobster from Joe Gurney's mob and gets a big bonus from the Gangleader himself. Niles loves his luck shift (and the chic new apartment) and continues to receive rewards when putting together other injured members of the gang. Unfortunately, his dodgy businesses come to light in a police raid that also overshadows his wife's career. At this point, the conspiracy takes center stage, as Carole Nelson must save her career before her license is suspended. It is about putting the gang more or less single-handedly in court. <br /> <br /> This is not a hardened gangster image, but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There are some tensions, but the mood is made easy by Bogart's humorous performance of a stupid gangster who calls himself the "Napoleon of Crime". His other gang members also act more than henchmen as rogues. And there's a snappy dialogue between Bogart and Francis, especially when treating his injuries in his hiding place. Of course, as with all gangster films, there's a big end to the shootout, but with a humorous twist. This is a good short film showing Bogart on his way to glory.
