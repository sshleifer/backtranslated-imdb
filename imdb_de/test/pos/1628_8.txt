This is an OK adaptation of the stunning book by Dan Brown. I can not say it's new or very good, but they made a movie that you can enjoy. However, given the excellent history, the result could have been better. The movie is quite long, but in the end I had the feeling that some things were missing. Sound effects and soundtracks were very good. Acting was well done, but the character development phase was very weak. For people who have not read the book, things can happen too fast. In my view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff out of the book, they could have tried to make the important scenes better. What makes the book very good was the whole puzzle-like story, combined with the outstanding portrait of the Vatican. You do not see anything in the movie. Too much hurry and not using the time in a good way, these are the main problems of the movie. So it's worth it, it could have been better.
