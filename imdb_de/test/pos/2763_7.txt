Nearly 20 years before Frank Marshall's tears came to his eyes with his mesmerizing epic "Alive", legendary Mexican director of exploitation Ren√© Cardona used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film "Supervivientes de los Andes". The unforgettable flight of Fairchild 571, which crashed on October 13, 1972 in the Argentine Andes. This terrible accident cost many passengers, most members of a professional rugby team, life. However, 16 people were saved thanks to their strong will to survive and because they were feeding on the mortal remains of their unfortunate co-travelers. Of course, one can not say that this cheaply constructed and roughly edited film is better than the famous 90s version, but I definitely appreciate and respect this movie more. After all, a commercial film requires much more input from the cast and crew, while the large-budget Marshall movie, though intense, tends to be more routine. The sets and special effects, of course, can not compete with "Alive," but "Supervivientes ..." creates an equally impressive sense of hopelessness, creating an even more nightmarish snow cave. Cardona's film is ambitious, surprisingly convincing and by far one of the most notable Mexican productions ever. I'm really surprised that Cardona's story is not more exploitative and explicit. While the scenes of slaughtering and depleting the deceased passengers are difficult to digest, they only serve to enhance the credibility of the disaster and emphasize the inhumane conditions of the survivors. Rather praiseworthy for a devilish director who became famous with notoriously bad movies like "Night of the Bloody Apes" and the Santo series. The unknown young Mexican actors are doing a great job and the music is lovely. Of course the story is well known, so the script does not provide any unexpected shocks. Either through the story or previously seen as "Alive", you know what kind of dramas these people still have to endure before they are saved, and you can only expect them. Still, this is a good movie that should not be fought as usual.
