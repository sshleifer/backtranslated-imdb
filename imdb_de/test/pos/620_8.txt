Well, this movie was shot on a weekday at 230 o'clock. The cute little actress Billy played initially caught my attention and after the first 15 minutes I was held in my TV until the very end. They have you on the edge of your seat and then throw in smart comedies during the most tense sequences. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that the story was not material enough to fill half an hour movie to pull certain sequences just a little bit. Still, it was still entertaining and I recommended it to all my colleagues the next day.
