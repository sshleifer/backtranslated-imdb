This is a bizarre curiosity, led by the man who edited The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Chuck Conners does a hilarious job as the owner of a "waxy" roadside museum where our condemned teenagers accidentally collapse. The wax figures look "so real", emphasizes one of the young people. Heh, heh, heh ... Not so much a Slasher movie as a weird mix of psychological horror and old-fashioned "House of Wax" style. I can imagine many, many horror movies that are worse than this.
