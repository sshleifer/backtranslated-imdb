"The Cell" is a pretty difficult movie. If you read the storyline, "a psychotherapist travels in a comatose serial killer hoping to save his last victim," you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But the movie is not really fair. There is an imaginative subconscious aspect that is overwhelming, with elaborate visuals and incredible scenarios. There is a drama when the psychotherapist mentioned above (played by Lopez before becoming a purely romantic comedy component) comes into contact with the child and witnesses his terrible upbringing. And it's definitely a horror facet because the serial killer's evil characters are offensive. The film tries to function on different levels and exceeds the genre limits at will. Although I feel it's a pretty bizarre experience, I find it absolutely mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> Already at the opening credits, as Lopez rides a horse through the desert, you are dressed in a white dress will know that you have a visual pleasure. Each time the audience leaves the reality and follows it into the subconscious depths of its "patients", they are guaranteed a feast of visual and acoustic pleasure. The costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colors. The camera keeps regularities at the door and traverses a world where ups and downs are the same. The characters become rulers of their own domain and become creatures that deserve such stature. If you like nothing else about "The Cell", you will surely be impressed by the work that goes into these scenes. <br /> <br /> The casting is also first class. In her element, Jennifer Lopez takes advantage of her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities, combining her own eye-catching looks with lush surroundings, make-up and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and I personally wish someone would find a different role for her, outside of the Rome Com-world she was typed into, to continue experimenting. Vince Vaughn convinces as an FBI agent who will do anything to save the life of a young woman. But undoubtedly Vincent D'Onofrio has the biggest impression here. It is an extremely difficult role, as it has to produce multiple emotions within the viewer. We are disgusted by his actions, but sympathetic to the trauma he has experienced in his life. He looks great in his realm but is insecure and vulnerable in the real world. It's a great performance by an undervalued actor. <br /> <br /> While "The Cell" does not work so well on every level, it tries ambitiously (some actions of the characters are not believable) and though it does, all are based on a rather weak scientific logic and are one occasionally shocking, visually amazing excursion rewarding multiple considerations.
