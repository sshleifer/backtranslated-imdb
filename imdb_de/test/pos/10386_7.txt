First, the positives: an excellent job of depicting urban landscapes according to the mood of the movie. Some of the pictures could be paintings by De Chirico. Sophie Marceau, nice. <br /> <br /> The Negatives: The stories are hard to believe. Unreal, one-dimensional characters clean and position themselves 100% as if they were on a kind of catwalk. This is neither the Antonioni of his earlier, much better films nor the Wenders we all know and appreciate. Malkovich is in this movie an excess baggage.
