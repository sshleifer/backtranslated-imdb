The Railway Children was back on TV this weekend and I forgot how good it was. <br /> <br /> When I have a critique, sometimes it is that the episodic structure is a bit too clear, since there is little narration flowing from sequence to sequence. However, the charm and beauty of the film are so important that it does not matter. <br /> <br /> I will not return to the comments of others, unless I want to add my voice for the last scene on the platform, possibly the most emotional scene in the history of British cinema: as a cynical old git, who goes too fast through middle age, I also can not think of that moment without being struck by a hard case of "I got got" something in my eye. "In fact, it's not just something in my eye, it's moving also things in me, with that beautiful, happy pain we sometimes feel. <br /> <br /> And Jenny Agutter was extraordinarily beautiful in this movie, standing with one foot in her childhood and one in a young woman, and both bring qualities of both to her portrayal of a girl who tends to grow up too fast. <br /> <br /> Also a quick thank you for Bernard Cribbins, mostly considered a lightweight actor, he has geschic kt Perks created by great humanity.
