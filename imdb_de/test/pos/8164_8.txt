Four sacred young men from the Land of Mormon go to the US to preach the gospel to the urban pagans. But one of the young Mormons is a repressed homosexual who happens to cross with a very "out" young party boy in LA. (What would be movie presentations without coincidences?). These two, very different, young men become friends and influence each other, which in turn leads to an inevitable conflict between gay and Mormon cultures. <br /> <br /> This is the premise of "Latter Days," a 2003 film written and directed by C. Jay Cox, a former Mormon missionary. Of course, the story of the film is of great relevance especially in contemporary America. Variations in this story must be narrated and retold, and hopefully retold in future films, because the underlying theme expresses the hateful attitude that Christian fundamentalists too often show to gays. "Latter Days" is inherently provocative, and I doubt if the film was well received in Provo or Pocatello, though the script is intelligent, sensitive, and enlightening.
