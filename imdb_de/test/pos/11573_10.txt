This is probably the best movie to have been shot in at least the last five years. I've always believed that making people cry is harder than making them laugh. If you want to see 400 adults screaming loudly in the same room, watch this movie. It's breathtaking. Javier Bardem plays the role of his life. They will cry, they will laugh, they will smile ... The most well-deserved fact is that in Spain everyone knows Ramon Sampedro. Personally, I knew the whole story and even the end of it. The quality of the film is such that the story is told. And in this area, Amenabar is the master. <br /> <br /> This movie is a MUST.
