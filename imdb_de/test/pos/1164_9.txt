This was the favorite movie of my late wife. I'm sorry that she did not live long enough to have the video because I'm sure she would have worn it. What can we say A great romantic story and the kick of two great men, Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are great in these roles. While Connery is his usual sexy sex, it is the late Brian Keith who brings us a solid performance as mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. In support of the abducted American widow, Candy Bergen, in her early 30s, is greatly supported. A great support also comes from the great John Huston as Teddy's besieged SecState, John Hay; Geoffrey Lewis from the Clint Eastwood films is great as a hesitant US ambassador, Gummere; The late Vladek Sheybal with his demonic evil eye is great as Beshaw and more is given by Steve Kanaly and Roy Jensen, whose faces we have seen in different backgrounds. All in all, this is a movie full of wonderful romance reminiscent of a bygone era. Thoughtless story? Not at all. The problem of large nations using smaller ones for their own hegemonic interests is the same today as it was then. Overly romantic? Not really - certainly not maudlin in any way. Funny to look at? I bet I own the video and I will watch it again and again. I suggest you do the same.
