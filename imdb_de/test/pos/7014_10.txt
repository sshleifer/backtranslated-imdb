When young Frances 'baby' Houseman goes to a summer camp with his family, she never expected to have so much fun! One night, after moving away from resort activity, she joins Johnny Castle and other dancers for a full-day dance party. "Baby" is excited about the slippery dance moves and wants to know when to fill Penny just so she and Johnny will not lose their jobs at the resort. But the young 'baby' soon gets into a difficult situation. She has fallen in love with a man she knows will never approve of her father. However, if Johnny is accused of stealing purses, it is up to 'Baby' to confirm his alibi by admitting that she was with him the night they were taken. Johnny is fired anyway because he gets involved with a visitor, but quickly realizes what a mistake it was to leave "baby." He comes back with the famous line "Nobody lays baby in a corner" and they show the resort exactly what they are made of. <br /> <br /> An amazing movie perfect for a girls' night in. With groovy tunes, inspiring dances and a story to make you feel warm, this must be the greatest movie ever! **********
