This movie is a hidden gem. I can not understand why this movie does not get more airtime. Errol and Eleanor Parker make for a really attractive and gorgeous couple. And their chemistry is impeccable. I liked the touch of his daughters as Robin Hood. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Errol Flynn. It's nice to see that Errol plays a father, too. From all accounts of his own children, he was a very attentive and loving father in real life. The side occupation is also wonderful. You can not go wrong with supportive players like Hattie McDaniel and Lucile Watson. Hattie McDaniel makes a movie much better right from the start. This movie has become a holiday tradition in my home. Enjoy!!!
