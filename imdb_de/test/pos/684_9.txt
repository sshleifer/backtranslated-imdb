"Shivering Shakespeare" could be considered the first classic of the "Our Gang" - talkie era. Meanwhile, the Hal Roach Studios have taken their steps in producing talking pictures, and "Shakespeare" is the happy result. <br /> <br /> The Gang appears in a version of Quo Vadis produced by Kennedy the Cops Woman. The children do not find the game very fun and are distracted by the people in the theater and can not remember their lines. Among the funniest pieces is Kennedy the cop as a giant, who pulls off his makeup to fight against an overzealous man in a bull costume; and the terrible dancer (played by director Bob McGowan's daughter). <br /> <br /> Several filmographies mention that "Shakespeare" has the first pie fight in a talkie. This may be true as they have tried different speeds during the fight with the movie. Buster Keaton's brother Harry is at the reception of one of the pies. Very funny and an early gear talkie classic. 9 out of 10.
