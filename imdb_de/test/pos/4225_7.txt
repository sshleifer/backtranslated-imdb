This reissue of the Child's Play series not only contains an eerie scene, but lots of funny jokes, like a stoner watching Chucky shake his finger and "rude doll" and lots of references to the series saying, "You can kill but I will come back, I will come again and again ". The title of the movie was probably meant before the script and was written for that. This is completely different from all the other films in the series. It does not even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones. Chucky seems to bother characters from another film, a soap opera in which two teenagers run together to marry. There's a cool, elaborate death scene that spills shards of glass and water everywhere. The movie is very bloody, very funny and has pop culture references from Martha Stewert to Jerry Springer. DO NOT SEE THIS BEFORE SEEING THE OTHER THREE. It will really ruin the effect, since the first one is really scary. Much guilty pleasure, fun and stupidity. <br /> <br />
