The plot of this wonderful, thought-provoking film offers so much more complexity than just unfaithfulness and cover-up of accident responsibility. I was impressed with the seemingly good kindness of husband Wilkinson, who wanted the driver when he thought it was Everett who was revealed to police, and the change of heart (and morality) when he learned it was his wife was. Was he really good and / or was he trying to redeem himself by allowing her to go with Rupert? Then things changed and she decided that it was right to admit that she had beaten him. Most importantly, the topic of salvation (for the accident - for infidelity - in its own, odd, erroneous way) in Watson's bedside care for Everett is the strongest. I think that's why she made that effort. <br /> <br /> This seems to be a common theme in modern British novels: Brideshead Revisited, The End of the Affair. Love it.
