I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I liked it as much and I was upset about it. What's great is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is definitely not there, but it does not matter in these movies. The tempo in slow and the settings are exotic. The movie has a lot to offer. Unfortunately, there are a few things against it. The first is that the beautiful Annie Belle and the pretty Al Cliver have no chemistry. Since the two play a couple and almost the entire length of the movie is on screen, the lack of chemistry between the two is definitely a problem. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they made this movie. They have retained their attraction on the canvas in any case. <br /> <br /> The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are simply ineffective or even ridiculous. There's a sex scene that stands out as one of the stupidest I've ever seen in a soft porn movie: our young blonde couple gets picked up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a crossdresser! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) And they have some sort of orgy in the helicopter in the air. And Al Cliver films it all with his 16mm camera! That's no joke. Ridiculous. Later we see that the 16mm material is processed on a Moviola. While the material is running, Al and Annie set off. This scene is actually good, but the footage on the screen behind it was too much for a while. When I saw the crossdresser's footage as he was flying the helicopter, he almost let me roll on the ground. Should that be erotic or somehow believable? The last thing I want to see is a woman who pleases a man in tow, no doubt when the man in tow makes for such an ugly woman while controlling a helicopter, no less. It was cool how Al and Annie did it, as well as the music of the whole scene. I just wish the footage on the editing screen would not be so stupid. <br /> <br /> Speaking of drag, another boring plot point in LAURE that really makes the movie crawl, these are all moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives. A married threesome is an interesting idea, but it is barely registered as hot or even interesting here. The two women are pretty boring and we rarely see that the three have sex. In fact, Orso retains his clothes for almost the entire movie, even when he's with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE: There is nudity, but it's not as much as other films of the same era. It just needed more skin to blow it. <br /> <br /> Apart from the minor complaints and the drag queen moments, LAURE is indeed very good to watch. I love this kind of 70's softcore movies when it comes to mood and atmosphere, not the rough stuff we see today. <br /> <br /> ps: Check out Emanuelle in Egypt, where Annie & Al, but also another famous film couple, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in this movie is great too.
