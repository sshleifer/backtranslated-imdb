Not a masterpiece by Larry Mcmurty, but it is a good Western in itself, each of the lonely pigeons. Anyone who ever takes the role of the Woodrow reputation makes a great statement in his own style. It's also easy to see that they wanted to use this as a springboard for the TV series (both versions) and that the writers knew how to keep the taste alive. The character he plays in it - this guy can do anything, what it seems, <br /> <br /> deserves to be enjoyed by those who like 4/5 western stars
