I almost had 'Hi-De-Hi!' Not seen. I think it was the title that scared me off. At that time, Welsh-language editions of "The Radio Times" printed only titles from certain shows, with no indication of what it was all about. "Hi-De-Hi!" suggested a bad quiz show hosted by Leslie Crowther, or worse, an inhumane US import. However, I managed to see a later episode, and I was surprised that it was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft. <br /> <br /> As with 'Dad's Army' and 'It's Not a Half Hot Mother' Perry was based on personal experiences, in this case his time at a Butlins vacation camp. Before cheap air travel began in the 1960s, these camps originated along the British coastline to entertain working-class families and earn millions for their owners. <br /> <br /> (Interestingly, I worked there as one of those camps in the '80s as a chef - Barry Island, South Wales - known as "Shag Land" for all sorts of reasons, for reasons I'm not into!) At the beginning of the 1950's, university graduate Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell) began as an entertainment manager for Maplin, a job for which he was poorly equipped. His associates included the resident comic Ted Bovis (Paul Shane), his buddy Spike (Jeffrey Holland), the miserable punch & judy man Mr.Partridge (Leslie Dwyer), the snobby ballroom dancers Barry (Barry Howard) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves (Diane Holland). and the unforgettable Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc), who longed for Fairbrother at every opportunity. Bubbly Su Pollard, however, stole the show as a cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw, whose ambition was to be a yellowcoat (all key employees carried her). A number of sexy women also occupied these coats, especially Nikki Kelly's "Sylvia" and the static Rikki Howard's "Betty". We never saw Joe Maplin, the owner. He told his staff in the form of ungrammatical letters that poor Jeffrey had to read to them. "Hi-De-Hi!" was the welcome of the campers, who usually go with the equally insane 'Ho-De-Ho!' was hit. <br /> <br /> One fan was the late Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Croft that he recognized most of the real-life characters. <br /> <br /> I always found Bovis most convincing. Like the most tragic, like Archie Rice, he was the comedian whose big break never came, and he was only made to crack crappy gags around the drunken late-night crowd to enjoy. He took advantage of his position to take some advantage, and in a memorable episode, Fairbrother's patience caught and he called out, "Read, Ted! All lies!". <br /> <br /> As with any other Perry / Croft series, the cast was excellent, especially Cadell and Shane. Ruth Madoc's' squishy 'Gladys got on my nerves (no wonder Anne Robinson hates the Welsh!), But Leslie Dwyer's misanthropic' Mr.Partridge 'and Felix Bowness' jockey' Fred Qulley 'compensated more than. <br /> <br /> The visual gimmick that everyone remembers is the drunken Mr.Partridge, who is riding a mime horse on a real one along the beach. When he looks at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to stick to it and instead throws away the banana he has eaten! <br /> <br /> With its frothy blend of 1950's nostalgia and cheeky gags, 'Hi-De'Hi' was a big hit for BBC-1 in the '80s, leading to a massive increase in bookings for Butlins and led Pontins It went downhill as Cadell went to return to the theater. I never thought of his replacement, Squadron Leader Clive Dempster (David Griffin). Worse, Leslie Dwyer's death robbed one of his best characters of the show. Kenneth Connor was used to replace him as "Uncle Sammy". <br /> <br /> Setting the period occasionally caused problems; In one episode, Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to rescue Peggy, who for some reason was dressed as a shark. The revealing costumes they wore were wrong at that time. Still, they looked great. Who complains? In another, Ted sang the Tom Jones hit "Delilah" for campers. It was composed (by the way not by Les Reed and Barry Mason) until 1968. Maplins closed its doors in 1988 and the last shot was that of Peggy (now a yellow coat), who was alone in the camp, jumped in the air and screamed (what else?) "Hi-De-Hi!". <br /> <br /> I do not value it as high as the other Perry and Croft shows, but its popularity is undeniable. It was probably one of the last British sitcoms that sparked tremendous affection in public, mainly because she had likable characters in a recognizable environment. Good night campers!
