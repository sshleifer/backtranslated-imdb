In the 60s / 70s, David Jason was known for his many supporting roles in television comedies such as "Do not Watch Your Set," "Hark At Barker," and the "Doctor" series. In 1974, he received his first starring role in "The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs" by London Weekend Television, written by Richard Laing & Bernard McKenna. Edgar Briggs is a secret agent of the "SIS" ("Secret Intelligence"). He really tries to do his job well, but always seems to mess things up. Surprisingly, however, he always manages to get to the bottom of the case, much to the amazement of his colleagues - "Buxton" (Michael Stainton), "Spencer" (Mark Eden) and "Cathy" (the charming Elisabeth Counsell). All respond to "The Commander" (Noel Coleman). Briggs is married to "Jennifer" (Barbara Angell), a woman who, as well as Michele Dotrice's "Betty" from "Some Mother's Do." "Ave 'Em!", Has the patience of a saint and stands next to her rabbit brain (but well-meaning) husband, no matter what. <br /> <br /> Like 'Some Mother's Do' Ave 'Em' and 'The Baldy Man', 'TTSLOEB' has been completely adorned with slapstick. In each episode, Jason stunts were performed. B. fall from a high window sill or fall off a ladder while decorating his apartment. It was really "custard pate" stuff. <br /> <br /> 'Edgar Briggs' was due to poor scheduling by I.T.V. Too bad, because it was an amusing and enjoyable show, which is well served by her star and the good support cast. The leading man, however, did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show. David Jason vetoed the show's reruns because he felt his acting was not refined. Granted, David Jason, who played "Del Boy," "Inspector Frost," and "Pop Larkin," is very different from the one who played Briggs, but his acting was by no means insignificant. Most actors had made Briggs into a ridiculous caricature, but Jason's performance made Briggs a credible, realistic character. Strange maybe, but not unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Jason's next vehicle was 'Lucky Feller', where he played the boy of mom 'Shorty Mempstead'. Also the rating failed. His happy break came in the form of A. T.V's "A Sharp Intake Of Breath," in which he played the catwalk "Peter Barnes" for four series between 1977-1981. The Briggs is not outstanding in itself, but is a simple and worthwhile watch. Also a nice "James Bond" style!
