I loved this movie because of the dialogue and outstanding acting of Candace and Jacqueline. However, never before did I know how to watch a Bette David marathon on TNT that this movie is a remake of a 1943 Bette Davis classic called Old Acquaintance. Bette plays with Miriam Hopkins, who had a terrible feud with her during the shoot, because Bette had a relationship with Miriam's husband, who staged her in a movie before they made Old Acquaintance Anyway, both are worth every minute, to look at her. I highly recommend this movie if you like a lot of dialogue and drama. In my opinion, this is a study on the psychology of women and their relationships with each other.
