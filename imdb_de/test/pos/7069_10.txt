<br /> <br /> This kind of movie challenges the audience too much and disappoints most of them. I think of the Mexicans who saw it (either in an attempt to support Mexican films or to watch a movie that plays the best Mexican stars), half of the people went out of the theater when I saw them is definitely not the kind of movie you could expect. I also think of people from other countries who dared to spend 2 hours until the end, "what a crap". To understand Cronica de un desayuno, you have to be Mexican, and you have to be familiar with (or rather, be a part of) the lower middle classes. There's nothing random in this movie that's family and has what many families, at least in Mexico, share. You have to look at it with an open mind to fully accept it. It's not the kind of movie that you completely understand after watching. The older brother did not let anyone sit on his RED couch, the sister stays, no matter how she wants to go, the younger brother goes on a trip and all he cares about is the yellow radio that the mother has to prepare for breakfast for the family, no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is. The father came back, who knows how long, and let the mother live a passionate night that turns out to be temporary and ends up repeating all her sons' attitudes ... The stories around the house are surrealistic (and is it the movie), a travesty looking for his penis, a factory worker and his attempted suicide interrupted by the kiss of his girlfriend, a fat man riding a bike after an interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? Wife? Mother? ... The music does not pretend so much, but it brings a lot, no more than a small drum, cymbals and some strings. Thank you for shooting and releasing a movie like this one. <br /> <br /> One of the best Mexican movies ever! And one of the lesser-known films, even by Mexicans themselves, no matter how much people have identified with them. <br /> <br />
