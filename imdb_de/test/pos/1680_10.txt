Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) can be superficially described as a French variation of John Huston's groundbreaking raid movie Asphalt Jungle (1950). The difference between the two films is that Rififi (1955) pays more attention to the robbery sequence in more detail. In addition, the police in Rififi are not so much involved in the aftermath of the robbery as on Asphalt Jungle. In the end, Rififi (1955) is in my opinion a slightly better movie than Asphalt Jungle (1950). Notable Noir image that defines French cinema of the 1950s. Although Spartacus (1960) was the one who broke the infamous blacklist, in my opinion Rififi (1955) was the film that broke tears and began an unbreakable Hollywood blacklist. First film for five years for Jules Dassin, who fell victim to McCarthy's communist hunt in the late 1940s to early 1950s. He got a kind of retribution when Rififi (1955) became a success in France and Europe. So it challenged the venomous Hollywood blacklist in an important way that probably inspired others to do the same. Rififi (1955) is the most important film of Dassin's career because he not only restored his name, but also gave him a second chance at filming. <br /> <br /> Jules Dassin gave the film world and its ever-growing audience an impression of a masterpiece of influential proportions. His handling of the material is extraordinary and the direction of the actors is impeccable. Build precise situations with precise craftsmanship. Dassin made the circle in the film Noir by staging his best and last Noir, Rififi (1955). It was the end of Dassin's time in filmmaking when dealing with noir images. Rififi (1955) is the number one in an arsenal of over thirty films for director Jules Dassin. A masterpiece in drama, cinematography, directing, editing and writing. No movie that leaves your place for a minute, because something memorable happens. Ingenious as everything from Jean Pierre Melville, who was a master of this kind of film. Masterpieces like Rififi (1955) are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in film history. <br /> <br /> The fascinating aspect of Rififi is the accurate planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up most of the 118 minute duration. The main characters plan and perform the jewel stroke the same way a director prepares to pre-produce, produce, and post-process a movie. Shows how difficult it is to commit a jewel robbery as in Rififi (1955), and why only a few would do so. The fact that the scene contains hardly any confusion like in other robbery films makes this scene even bigger. As close as you can get a perfect sequence in a movie. <br /> <br /> The absence of an unnatural sound in the truest minute of the heist sequence of landmarks places it in an area of ​​absolute realism. All dialogues and / or music would destroy any tension and tension the director is trying to create. The use of natural sounds makes the raid sequence a rewarding movie experience. Now filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in such a scene because the patience of a mainstream moviegoer is not enough. Provides a level of consistency that never fades. <br /> <br /> Maintaining a high voltage level causes the heist sequence to tick to perfection. The director creates excitement in the raid sequence that is rarely reached in most of the predator rape scenes. Jean Servais and the other main actors contribute to the tension with a somewhat restrained act. Getting tension into a scene is a task few are capable of. The robbery sequence of Rififi (1955) achieves a hitchcock level of tension and tension. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers from the years following Du Rififi's Chez Les Hommes (1955) were influenced if they were not inspired by it. One influential filmmaker was Jean Pierre Melville (original choice for the director of Rififi), who used variations of the heist sequence in Le Doulos (1961) and Le Cercle Rouge (1970). Another filmmaker was Stanley Kubrick, who shot a similar theme film in The Killing (1956). Also Quentin Tarantino, whose debut "Reservoir Dogs" (1992), was inspired by this film. Other film directors who have been influenced include John Woo, Michael Mann, Paul Schrader, Ringo Lam, etc. The Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) is in many ways comparable to Bob le Flambeur (1955). One, Jules Dassin and Jean Pierre Melville, made pioneering films in Rififi (1955) and Bob le Flambeur (1955). Second, every movie is an aging criminal planning and executing a brave attack. Three, Bob le Flambeur and Rififi, are fatalistically finished. Fourth, each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as film sizes. <br /> <br /> Part of Rififi's charm is the colorful characters that surround the story. and Cesar le Milanais. Most violence is implicit but effectively brutal. The main characters, led by Tony Le Stephanois, adhere to a strong, outdated code of honor reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo. Jean Servais, with his cynical posture and tired appearance, becomes the role of Tony le Stephanois. Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) became one of my favorites when I saw him from start to finish on the big screen.
