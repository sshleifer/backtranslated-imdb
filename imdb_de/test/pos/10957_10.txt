It should be noted that this film was not "improvised" (as you probably remember), although the title suggests in the end. The film was heavily scanned and rehearsed - Cassavetes did not have enough money to cover the inevitably high production costs of an "improvisational" film, even if he wanted to produce something like that. The "improvisation" of the film is contained in the performances of the actors, and the emotions they draw from the lines. <br /> <br /> Let me say that this is an amazing job that I'm sure I keep coming back. The depths of emotion that Cassavetes can draw from the smallest gestures and interactions are incredible. I have no idea how he was able to deliver such amazing performances to the actors, especially under the conditions he worked under. This is really a great landmark of the movie that I recommend to anyone looking beyond the Hollywood form.
