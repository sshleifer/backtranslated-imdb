Oh my god, what a story! This movie is very good and it had to be God who did this! They did a great job. Acting was really good, you've certainly picked the right actors. This movie is so good, I'm really glad that you did that, otherwise I would never have heard about this story because I'm not a big fan of golf and I think it's a bit boring, so thanks. I really enjoyed it and that's why I gave the movie 10/10. I also liked Shia Labouf, he was perfect for the role of Fransis Quimet. I hope most of what you recorded there is true too. Oh and some parts were funny and others, I was just so happy.
