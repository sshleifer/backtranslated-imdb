If you're reading about this movie, you want to be scared. I've seen it countless times, and I'm scared myself! So what is the appeal here? I think that's the offbeatness of romance for me. I find it refreshing to have a funny connection between this Jimmy-Breslin-like columnist in NYC and a balloonist. They feel embarrassed for Paul Sorvino for attracting this woman inconspicuously. Like the guy in the bar, who can not take any hint. He's a bit overweight (at least as a wannabe admirer for a ballerina, I hope that does not sound unfriendly) and maybe a bit too old for her. Nice change from the Greek god who courts the supermodel. The Bill Conti score has settled in my head all those years later, which is a pretty good sign. But part of the acting is just terrible. A subplot of a young Puerto Rican boy friend of Sorvino's character is simply hilarious. But the opening scene, in which Ditchburn warms up with Carole King, draws you right into this story. Good luck finding. You'd think Lifetime would re-broadcast this, or even WE, but I have not seen it for several years.
