I guess Bud and Lou just enjoyed messing up classic stories (though they had some interesting results). In this case, they are a bad boy, and Lou tries to read him "Jack and the Beanstalk", but falls asleep, dreaming that he is Jack and Bud's butcher, and they climb the beanpole to rescue Prince and Princess from the giant (Buddy Baer). <br /> <br /> I think my favorite scene was when Lou tried to turn the giant into an omelet and ... well, I'll let you see what happens. Since this was a movie by Abbott and Costello, they had a few unnecessary songs, but otherwise it was pretty funny. For other interpretations of classical history, "Bewitched" and "Gilligan's Island" had episodes in which it was portrayed.
