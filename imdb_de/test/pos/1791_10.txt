Just as Margot falls prey to her ambitious husband in "Fear of Fear," Fox is "suicideed" by his friend in "Fox and His Friends," who took away all his money, like Xaverl Bolwieser in "The Stationsmaster's Wife," Too prison to give his fraudulent wife the chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann, who seeks refuge in madness to flee his stupid wife and his bankrupt society, so is Hans Epp a victim of the German Wirtschaftswunder-Gesellschaft after the Second World War with RW Fassbinder "The merchant of the four seasons". Just because Fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women and between heterosexual and gay couples, it should be clear that he does not favor sex. In Hans Epp's case, there are women who drive him into despair, disease and finally death. When he comes back from the Foreign Legion, where he flew because he could not bear the pressure of his mother, she complains that he is still alive while the good boy from his neighbor was killed. Then Hans gets a job as a police officer, but is surprised by his foreman while being seduced by a prostitute. After losing his job, he works as a low-income fruit grower and goes from garden to garden to "scream" his products. His mother, one of his sisters and her husband are ashamed to have such a "street worker" in their family. "The love of his life" (she has no name in the film) refuses to marry him because his job does not match her social status and her background. So he marries Irmgard, whom he does not love and who does not love him. From her constant pressure on him he flees to drink. One night, after his wife pursues him, he explodes and hits her. She flees to her family, to whom this event was exactly what they had been waiting for. When Irmgard calls a lawyer to divorce, Hans suffers a heart attack. Imrgard decides to stay with him, but from now on he can not do any more heavy work and drink alcohol. So he feels more and more redundant, is quieter and more depressive. When he discovers that Irmgard is cheating on him, he decides to end his life, but not like Hermann Hermann by a journey into the light of madness, but he drinks himself before Imrgard, his little daughter and his drinking buddies, to death. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. But the question is: did Hans just kill himself because he could no longer endure his miserable environment, or did he justify himself?
