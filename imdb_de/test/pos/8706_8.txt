I saw this one night on Sky TV because I'm a vampire fan. I have to admit, I half expected that it would be a B-movie disaster, but I was pleasantly wrong. <br /> <br /> The subspecies is a family of vampires. When a vampire lord dies, his two sons, handsome and noble Stefan, and his brother, the evil, the heinous Radu, start a war because of their birthright, the bloodstone. The Bloodstone is a holy grail for vampires and it bleeds the blood of the saints, giving the vampire who drinks it an ultimate high. <br /> <br /> The battle over the bloodstone takes an unexpected turn with 3 college students Arrive on a school trip in the territory of the brothers, and Stefan must protect them from his brothers' lust. <br /> <br /> As I said, I went into this movie and did not expect much, but it was one of the best low budget movies I have ever seen. The sets and venues (Romania, I believe, has been a while since I saw it) are very nice and the music score has done the movie justice. <br /> <br /> Most acting was appropriate, but it was Anders Hove as the nasty Radu stealing the movie (and all subsequent sequels). Hove's performance as a twisted vamp is truly breathtaking and just brings the movie from okay to pretty good!
