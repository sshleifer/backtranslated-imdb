I can not imagine why it has not yet been theatrically released. It has a great cast, with Sutherland, Lane and especially Chris Evans performing spectacular work. Wake up, studio executive! <br /> <br /> The story is based on the experiences of the author / screenwriter, who grows up as a "poor child" in an extremely affluent community where teaching is all about and makes a difference in all areas of life, from the world of life Clothes to justice. <br /> <br /> During the Q & A of the film, the author was asked about his experiences and especially about what we do not know about the ultra-rich. He said that they are not stupid, they are very smart (contrary to their portrayal), they have plans and are a threat! <br /> <br /> In many ways, this movie is extremely current.
