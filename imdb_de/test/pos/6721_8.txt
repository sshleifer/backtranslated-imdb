** and 1/2 stars out of **** Lifeforce is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, so ridiculous, but at the time it's strangely captivating and never boring. Whether it is the incessant nudity, the great amount of violence and action, it creates an entertaining 2-hour cinema. <br /> <br /> The Space Shuttle Churchill was sent to investigate Halley's comets as soon as they discover something hidden in the coma of the giant rock. A small team led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback) was dispatched to search the area. They discover hundreds of frozen, bat-like creatures and three naked and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings in strange crystalline containers, two male and one female (Mathilda May). They decide to take all three, which leads to a disaster. <br /> <br /> When London receives no response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what's going on. When they dock at Churchill, they find the remnants of the crew, all of which are unrecognized. The humanoids are still in perfect condition and bring them back to London. After various tests, scientists still do not know what these beings really are. Later in the night, a security guard in the facility feels compelled to enter the room where the woman is being held. He touches her shoulder, and she awakes, gets up, and smiles seductively and wickedly at him. She walks up to him and starts kissing him, realizing that she is actually taking his life force and sucking him of all his energy (the effect is a bit cheesy). <br /> <br /> She fled the resort and started to leave a trail behind. Another man, Colonel Caine (Peter Firth), is called in to track her down. Then the men discover that the life force process has a pattern. The body of the guard awakens in two hours and takes on the life force of a doctor. It seems that every two hours this process is repeated by a victim. With the help of the only survivor of Churchill, Carlsen, they try to track down the girl before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a pretty good late-night entertainment. It has all the elements you can look for in such a movie, lots of nudity, blood / blood and lots of special effects. This is certainly better than the similarly plotted movie Species, which is largely due to a gripping final. <br /> <br /> The performances range from decent to terrible. The worst is easily Steve Railsback, who overreacts to no end. Much better are Peter Firth, who comes through convincingly, and the beautiful Mathilda May (she is as beautiful as the French actresses Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner). May goes through practically the whole role without wearing clothes, and there have been reports that she found it difficult to shoot, so it's impressive that she can go through any scene without fidgeting and discomfort. There are times when she can be quite scary and just seductive. Most of the movie works because of her. <br /> <br />
