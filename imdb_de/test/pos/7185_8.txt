This movie is just great ... It starts very slowly and boringly, but as the movie progresses, the fun keeps coming. The film's might perhaps be in its subtle references to a lot (and I mean a lot) to other films. For me the best was perhaps the scene of Bruce Lee / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. How the two actors switch from French to Chinese or another Asian language was great. Then the jokes by name, they are weird, but maybe you do not understand all if you are American (no offense). Overall, a great movie
