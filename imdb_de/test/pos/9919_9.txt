Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Cristina Masillach, Ian Charleson, Urbano Barberini and Daria Nicolodi. The only other Argento movie I saw was Suspiria. Next, I chose Opera because I was told it was one of his best. Man, I think I discover what will ultimately be one of my favorite horror directors. Opera is about a young opera singer who gets her big break when the star of a scary modern opera attracts attention. Mc Beth is hit by a car. Betty is the undergraduate, so she can take on the role herself. Too bad for her is a psycho after her that lets her watch the brutal murders of her friends and colleagues. Wow, I heard good things here, but I was not prepared for the degree of size this movie would bring me. Yes, the film has its shortcomings, which I will come to later. But for the most part, the movie blew me away. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is not as colorful as Suspiria. I expected it to be a bit like suspirie in this department, but to my surprise it had its own look and feel. The movie is somehow free of color. In certain scenes (such as the masterful kitchen / living room sequence) in which Argento fills the screen with rich greens and blues, there are many colors, but the film usually has a greyish, black tone. that it had its own distinctive look. <br /> <br /> The true stars of this show are the incredibly well orchestrated death sequences. Impressive. Every death scene was like a work of art. Beauty in destruction. These are not just your typical hack and slash death sequences. These deaths have been carefully designed to shock and optimize the situation. Loved every second of them, there is a lot of blood and chaos here, but with style. But you will not spoil them. <br /> <br /> Then there is the direction. Man, there are some really original and beautiful shots on this one. I found the inventive use of the camera very good in this case. They thought that Tarantinos in Kill Bill vol. Where do we see the bullet coming out of the weapon's chamber? Well, that's the movie he got it from! I firmly believe that Tarantino of certain films with certain scenes in Kill Bill. 1. Heck, in the Making of feature, he mentions that the entire scene with Beatrix in the hospital and Elle Driver killing her were influenced by Italian Giallos. Here are my friends proof of that. Anyway, Tarantino points out that this movie has some amazing camera images, like the scenes of the crows flying through the crowd at the Opera House ... great stuff. And a major reason why Argentos became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The acting of most of the actors was fine, but the best was Cristina Marsillach as a tortured young opera singer Betty. The glances in their eyes when the murders were committed were great. The rest of the cast was a bit wooden and stiff, but nothing that would stop you from the movie. <br /> <br /> There were very few things I did not like about this movie. At first the logic was thrown out of the window in certain scenes. Especially those who took Betty's reactions saw the murders. It seems to me that for the longest time she was just doing her thing and not telling anyone about the whole thing. Not even the police. I mean, if you see someone brutally murdering you in front of your eyes ... you do not just go away from the murder scene and continue your life. Someone would have linked them to the killings. She might even have become suspicious herself ... but no. The end is a bit anti-climactic. You have to see that to understand it, but it seemed a bit unnecessary as the movie ended. It felt like he could have ended earlier. It would not have felt so superfluous. But that was it, not really big issues for me since I enjoyed the rest of this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I still have a lot of Argento territory to discuss ... but it's me I devoured every step as if I was eating a plate with the most expensive caviar. These guys are really good. I regard his films as works of art, and I have only seen two of them! I can not wait to see the rest of his films. Argento, you the man! <br /> <br /> Rating: 41/2 out of 5
