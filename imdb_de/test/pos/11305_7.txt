My 5 year old daughter is very interested in the Barbie movie series. I had mixed feelings - I did not want her shopping in all the Barbie Doll image of things, and realized that the movies are a marketing ploy to convince young girls to buy more dolls and more money to earn for Mattel. This morning she asked me to see this movie with her, and since it's a lazy Saturday morning and not much else to do, I agreed. I do not know if the films were made to market the dolls. The dolls seem to lose some of the appeal I've heard, or if the puppets are marketing the films (or rather a bit.) But whatever the case, I have to admit - to my surprise, that was not half bad. <br /> <br /> It's a funny and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters (both good and bad.) In essence, Annika ("played" by Barbie) must find a way to make a "magic wand." from light "to reverse the evil spells of the magician Wenlock, who among other things turned her sister into a flying horse and her parents in stone. The animation here was pretty good - not Disney caliber (if you look at Disney as a standard), but generally pretty good, and although the movie is obviously designed for young girls rather than middle-aged men, I still found there was enough twists and turns to ask me how everything would turn out. It is true that there were some gaps in the story, or at least some logical inconsistencies, but again you have to remember the target audience who would not really think of such things. This is a completely decent family movie. 10.7
