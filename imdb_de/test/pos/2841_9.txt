Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually charming and witty Plot Twister one of the best American films I've seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction make this film not too sentimental, while Ren√©e Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give him a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear, Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney give unobtrusive performances. The biggest parody of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.
