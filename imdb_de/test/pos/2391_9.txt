I found the movie very interesting. I really enjoyed the movie, the actors were great. It was entertainment. Benny, the uncle, was wonderful. He was real in his figure. The end took a wonderful turn. I would recommend you to see it. Eddie Mores girlfriend reminded me a little of Sandra Bullock that she was as sharp as a nail. I also like the little girls who play in the movie, she was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend of mine who grew up all his life in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tried the sauce in the pot, because that's how most people cook. I actually saw the movie twice and learned more the second time.
