I can only agree with many observers that trafficking is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. I saw traffic when it was on TV, and I just saw it again. I am particularly touched by the haunting original music of Tim Souster and especially by the painful sounds of Dmitri Shostakovich's Chamber Symphony in C minor (the music about the end credits and parts of the film). The music intensifies the desperation of the characters as they pursue their sad fate. The music is very emotional. This arrangement combines two of the movements from the symphony, but I recommend listening to the symphony itself.
