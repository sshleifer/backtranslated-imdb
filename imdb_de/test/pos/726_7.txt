What can I say? Not as bad as many have done here. The only reason I saw this movie, which I had never heard of before, was exclusively for IAN McSHANE. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role. He is always good to look at and for my money ... an extremely underused actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the movie ... Every other actor in the film delivered strong, solid performances. These people certainly did not pay huge sums of money to participate (as this was a relatively low budget movie), but this did not mean one of them "sent" their performances. Everyone convinced and convinced with the given parts to them. <br /> <br /> I was even pleasantly surprised by ADRIAN PAUL's performance, though I have to admit that I only saw him in the HIGHLANDER Television series before this film. <br /> <br /> The plot was well thought out and the story intriguing and, like in real life, not everything ends up in a nice little package for you at the end of the movie. Anyone who has expected a clear number after the numbers, connects the points "conclusion" or "answer" at the end of the film ... CLEARLY did not see the film exactly enough! This movie will not tell you what the "meaning of life" is! The idea is that after watching the movie, you can discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee. I certainly did. <br /> <br /> No chases ... No explosions ... No brawling in the bar room .... (sounds pretty boring, huh?) But the reality is that I totally fell under the spell of film and movie it's just a well-written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character benefits from everyone involved. <br /> <br /> ****** WARNING ... ****** If you like the kind of person who does not like movies, who dangle a tremendous "question" as the central engine of the story then finish the film without directly answering that specific question ... <br /> <br /> YOU CAN NOT ENJOY THIS FILM.
