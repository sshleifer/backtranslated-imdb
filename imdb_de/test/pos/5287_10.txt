Few would argue that Hayao Miyazaki, the main animation director, is one of the few who has this ability. <br /> <br /> (No, too many focus on John Lassiter's "amazing" ability to steal other feature films, make them pretty puppet shows and then be praised as a genius ... but I digress.) > <br /> Miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important topics of maturity (usually ecological), and a smart script has made sure that even the most confused spectator who would normally despise every animated film through the Nevertheless, Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these films - children. <br /> <br /> That is, I do not think of another filmmaker with this ability - where else will you be have a movie in which a three-year-old (my nephew link) sits quietly throughout the move, a 7-year-old (my niece Amber) who loves it all by himself (and appreciates the "star" power "by Frankie Jona s and Noah Cyrus, a 12-year-old (my nephew Aaron) whose review read, "Of course it was good! Everything Mr. Miyazaki does is good! ", a 32-year-old animation fan who was moved to tears by the powerful, directing and great animation (er, that would be me), and a 58-year-old woman (my mother) who can connect with the mother characters (and I bet and the "cuteness" of the child loves characters. <br /> <br /> And that's what I respect the most about Miyazaki-san. He seems to be in a very different way with his audience Wise to speak as the average filmmaker Superficially, "Ponyo" could be considered a "ponyo" a simple story about a little fish girl who wants to get a taste of the human world and join in, and the friend she makes there , a little boy ske (something like "The Little Mermaid"), but here's another level: Miyazaki fills his movie with his strong female characters Ponyo's mother and Soske's mother Nursing homes are all real characters with their own spirit and extreme will. <br /> <br /> But the girl who takes the cake is Ponyo herself. Having decided that she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to make her dreams come true. Her father tries to keep her innocent and make her a magical fish, but the young ponyo knows what he wants and becomes human out of sheer determination. <br /> <br /> Once human, she works with her friend Soske, whom she loves very much (though maybe not as much as ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (at the age of five) when his mother, Lisa, decides she must help the people in the rest home she works in during a typhoon accidentally looking for Ponyo was caused after a human. Frankie Jonas (yes, he's related to the Jonas brothers, can we just overcome that?) Is the best performer in the movie as a young soske (which is good since he has the most lines). His character is also strong-willed, but also very respectful and friendly - qualities you probably will not find on this side of the Pacific. <br /> <br /> In the end, Ponyo's father Fujimoto has to cope with his daughter's decision and the wishes of his wife so that she can be human. He hopes that Ponyo and Soske "remember him lovingly". And again, Miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical "villain". Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) received criticism for it, frankly, what makes his films magical yet proportionate. No one in real life is completely a "bad person". All humans have different shades of gray. And that's exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. <br /> <br /> And then there's the animation itself. At a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the amount of effect shots in this movie, especially in the water, Miyazaki chose NO CGI. Although the hand-drawn animation was digitally colored, every film was hand-drawn, and I was extremely grateful for it. The animation of the characters was extremely fluent, and there even seemed to be some lip sync (quite unusual for an anime movie). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and affected the audience. That's how the animation looked like earlier - and that's what it should look like. <br /> <br /> In the end I found Ponyo very pleasant. Certainly not the best of Miyazaki (in my opinion, this award is still held by Kiki's Delivery Service), but still a 10-star fun movie for the ENTIRE family.
