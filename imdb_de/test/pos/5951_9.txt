I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good spy opportunity and who found Johnny English embarrassing. This is the movie JE should have been. But it's based on an old French film series and therefore not really related to Bond. <br /> <br /> The production is brilliant, it is almost believed that the film was shot in the 60s. It even has the same pastel color films as it did then. Jean Dujardin plays his role with just the right amount of stupidity and naivety, not ham-masculine stupidity like Rowan Atkinson. And even if you do not like the movie, you will want to see it for Berenice Bejo. Ooh la la! She is the sharpness ...
