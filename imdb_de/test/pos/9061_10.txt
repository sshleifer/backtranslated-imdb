With whom would you have a suicidal mind in a way that is tangible to everyone? I saw the movie at SXSW at its premiere and proves to be by far the best movie there. Yes, it is distorted and it is bizarre, but it makes sense in the world that the filmmaker (Michael Parness) creates. If you did not laugh (most did), then you just can not get it, and that's a shame. Most notably, Guillermo Diaz steals a series of scenes as Hector, and the chemistry between Natasha Lyonne and David Krumholtz is intense. The film is reminiscent of Harold and Maude, but not really, it requires one bizarre twist after another, and everyone makes sense in this crazy, jumbled up world in which we all live behind and what's great was to hear that same thing I thought in my head why things "happened" were the reasons why they did that. I do not think you can judge the film badly if you did not understand it. I think I got it and it seemed like most of the others did as well. The film is called a suicide comedy, but it has a lot of heart, a lot of laughter and a lot of hope, but it does not shy away from the horrors of suicide. A nice little movie that should attract attention when it's released, which hopefully will happen sooner rather than later.
