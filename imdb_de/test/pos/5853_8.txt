It's hard to believe that could happen at all. We do not know if Justin and Richard were concerned in the past or committed crimes. The film seems to imply that they were not in trouble. The first crime they commit is murder? Just to play with the cops and jostle? How do you get a girl and just say it's you? Richard, too, seems to choke the woman with little or no effort, and the women do not seem to fight. Hmmm. This whole concept is really hard to believe. That said, let's move on. I really hated these punks, and I would have loved to use my firearm with tactical police ammo to see what their plastic suits are doing. Cassie, who was a victim of Carl Hudson, has a terrible time to survive. The memory of being stabbed 17 times by Carl leaves her in an emotional mess. Sandra is doing an excellent acting job. She made me believe that she was an angry policewoman. I loved doing the crime. This movie planted me on my chair. Loved the spectacle of everyone except Sam. He did not get up and leave. The only thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should I say the rape scene.
