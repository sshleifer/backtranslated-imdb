This is a great movie and if you have not seen it yet, you should go to the video store now and rent it. First of all, the cast is outstanding. It has not only current stars like Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but also yesterday's stars like Judge Reinhold. There are also numerous cameos by actors such as Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second, the story was pretty good too. It was interesting how they made a conspiracy for a Stoner movie and made it almost dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in "Half Baked", it has a true, fun-loving image like "traffic". So watch this movie. Being a stoner gives you insight into something you love. If you do not use drugs, you will get a more realistic view of drugs than is desired by both sides.
