It is particularly difficult for a director to capture the movies without being valuable, inbreeding, overly dramatic or all three. Breillat skilfully demonstrates the instinctive lizard-brain methods of a female author when she extracts a love scene of scorching intimacy from two "cattle" (as Hitchcock's actor calls them). Her main fight is with her captain ("an actor is really a woman," she says), though of course the lead actress will steal the show. I do not agree that this is Breillat's first comedy. "Romance" was hilarious in several places, but I accept that French humor is elusive to foreigners. In fact, dozens of IMDb reviewers found no romance comedy. In contrast, Sex Is Comedy makes for a lot of laughter, especially by using the prop of an actor who goes back thousands of years to Plautus and the ancient Greeks. We asked ourselves, as we walked out of the theater, if Roxane's "beard" was a wig. A nice performance by Anne Parillaud as Breillat, wrestling with her own script and looking ten years younger than she is old.
