I was really surprised to see this movie directed by Iain Softley for the first time. it is different in many ways from the usual mass production in Hollywood. The storyline itself is simple - Kevin Spacey plays a mental patient prot, who claims to be from the planet K-pax, who has come down to Earth through a beam of light, while Dr. Powell, played by Jeff Bridges, tries to help him solve his delusions. First of all, I have to admit that the cast is perfectly chosen: Kevin Spacey is really brilliant at portraying the intriguing nature of Prot. He always goes in fine line to convince us that he really is, and then lets us ask whether he is a delusion or not ... Some of the gemstone scenes include the scene in which Prot innocently eats the entire banana (even the Peal) while talking to Dr. Powell is in a session; or the observatory scene, in which he confidently shows his astonished astronomer his knowledge of the K-Pax system ... Jeff Bridges, on the other hand, is the subtle, rational side of this film, and he delivers it perfectly. There are plenty of other great actors (like Saul Williams' compelling performance as Ernie) who make this movie work. <br /> <br /> K-pax has everything, elements of the comedy; Sci-Fi, even psychological thriller (regarding the identity of the prot), but above all, it can be classified as heartwarming drama. The main premise of the film is quite complicated, but the director never lets go, he always believes it to be believable and yet interpretable in two directions. The camera and photography play an almost crucial role here, as they continue the main idea of ​​light travel, the light-shadow play and the setting of the lightning take a high priority. One of the memorable scenes is where Dr. Powell holds a crystal figure in his office, which breaks light in a beautiful way, while all the time he suspects the idea may be true? <br /> <br /> The subtle and slow, fascinating and enjoyable K-pax is truly a gem to behold. A movie that may not be for everyone, but those who see it might fall in love with it.
