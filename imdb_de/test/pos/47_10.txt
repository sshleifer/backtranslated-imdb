Lackawanna Blues is an excellent movie. The casting was perfect. Every actor and actress was perfect for the role they played. Their chemistry together was amazing. The acting was great. I felt like I knew the characters. I could almost "feel" her. They reminded me of people I knew as a kid in the 50s and 60s. Oh, the memories !! My personal belief is that this movie should have been for everyone on the big screen. I've seen this movie so many times that I can almost recite the lines as the characters say. I can not even list my favorite part because I have so many favorite parts. Thank you for bringing with you a part of my youth that I have never seen in that time ... and that means black people are loving each other, respecting each other, respecting each other, taking care of each other and whatever we can do to help each other , I have to go now. I have to take a look at it again.
