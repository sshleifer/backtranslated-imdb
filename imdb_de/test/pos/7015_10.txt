SO good, the acting, cutting and governing may not be the best, but the dancing, the movements, the heat and the passion in this movie are definitely the best (well ... atleast for me ^^) it really touched me, inspired me to learn to dance. I even signed up for this site so I can vote for it and contribute my support for this movie. This movie literally gave me goose bumps when I saw it. I love it. Jennifer Gray is so pretty! Patrick is so sexy in there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The first thing I'm going to do tomorrow is on the way to the university, drop by the video store, buy a copy of it, watch it again, until I'm old and no longer wrinkled and unable to dance with the movie. before, when I have to learn the whole dance class there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
