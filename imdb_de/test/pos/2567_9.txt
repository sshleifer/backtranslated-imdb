I have to admit, I did not expect it to be as good as it was. I did not expect Samuel L. Jackson to play Dia and sing blue. Cinemark from Beaver County PA does this frequently. They promote movies in the lobby, make everyone excited to see them, and then disappoint you by not showing them. <br /> <br /> I expected that with such a great cast of Jackson and Ricci and even a former N'Syncer (Timberlake) that this movie would have shown at least a week. But no, at that time, if I recall correctly, MI3 showed up on three screens (the one or another kind of supposed blockbuster). <br /> <br /> Like Blues Brothers and Crossroads, this movie contains the mystic and the legend of blues. Passion and hard times. Religion and sex. Hellhounds of the past. Salvation. I mean, there are so many elements in the blues to make it work. <br /> <br /> This was just a good story. Of course, not many people will see it because there are no pirates or swinging spiders. But there's Samuel L. Jackson ... <br /> <br /> Think about what happened to Jackson's character from Pulp Fiction after he went through the earth and settled down. This essentially describes him as "T" /> <br /> Great and underrated, but are not the good ones too?
