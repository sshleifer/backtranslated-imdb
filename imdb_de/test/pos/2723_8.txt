Well, it's a great piece of work by Aparnaji and some where these people make us believe that there are now many more concepts that need to be expressed and the film is a great medium to do that. Well, all the big actors together, so nothing to say about acting or directing, but the movie has given us a great message. It has well predicted the conditioning of the human mind with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own view, and we want to solve the problem accordingly. That's why we've tried everything from professor to maid in their own way. When JOydeep discusses with her wife, he says, "She's looking for a cause she'll never get," and the woman replies, "Are not we all?" So that was a great comment that asked me a big question after the movie: Are we all sick?
