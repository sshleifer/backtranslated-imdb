"Christmas In Connecticut" is a gem of a classic Christmas movie. Although less known than others, it is still a nice way to spend an evening during the holiday season. I watch it every year. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is perfectly staffed as Elizabeth Lane, the only career woman. Even before it became popular, Stanwyck personified the single girl on the rise. Her New York apartment and her friendly "uncle" restaurant around the corner mark the single girl in town. She can not cook yet and writes a column for the housework for a magazine! <br /> <br /> Dennis Morgan is also perfect as our war hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane. After getting lost at sea, he just wants to spend Christmas in a "real" home. What sets up the delightful, crazy story that is developing. It's fun from start to finish. We should also have an uncle Felix!
