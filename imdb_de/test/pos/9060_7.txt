Not since "Harold and Maude" was suicide used as a motive for a love story so successfully. The acting by a first-class cast is terrific. With a well-structured script, the development is proceeding at a pleasant pace. There are moments of black comedy, but I would classify "My Suicidal Sweetheart" as a unique romantic comedy with a touch of dark humor. The relationship between two psychologically challenged lovers is both touching and captivating. The movie actually lets you ask, what is a normal relationship? I highly recommend "My Suicidal Sweetheart". Search on DVD under the title "Crazy for Love". You will not be disappointed. - MERK
