To sum it up: A young girl (Amy) uses her hot body and the "alleged" virginity to lure a young, disturbed man (Matt) with a potential football scholarship to "Full Ride" out of town. Come and find out she has a good reputation and slept with many football players in the past, hoping that they would offer her the same deal. Both children came from troubled and badly functioning houses. Matt's mothers are alcoholics who repeatedly embarrass him in front of his friends. Amy's mother had a bad reputation herself and became pregnant with Amy at a young age. Matt falls in love with Amy and tries to improve her life for her. Very predictable end. The actress who plays "Amy" is actually 33 years old and is trying to play a teenager!
