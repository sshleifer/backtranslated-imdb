A beautiful and pleasant film full of Mediterranean landscapes (Cephallonia is a very beautiful Greek island) that preserves many of the features of the novel. I think that Greek landscapes add something special and magical to a movie. What I did not like at all is that the main characters like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's dad were not Greek actors but foreigners. I mean, the actors tried to express the Greek way of life, but for me that was not successful and it was pretty clear. Even their pronunciation when they wanted to use Greek words was terrible and that was bad for the plot of the movie. Irene Papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother who lived in the 40s on an island that has lost her husband and is trying to live a child by herself. Even John Hurt, Pelagia's father, was great. In many of his reactions he reminded me of a Greek.
