Whatever you do, do not stop watching if you think the movie is over! Stay stuck on the first batch of credits, or you'll really miss something! We saw this movie at the Savanaah Film Festival and thought it was the best of the best. Dreya Weber is really a miracle, not only because of her performance, but also because she can pull it so far across the floor. In the questions and answers she said that there were no wires or effects. Everything you see is really her. Addie could not make it to the festival because she danced with Madonna. She was excellent and, my God, so beautiful. I was amazed that the movie went so well with the blue-haired crowd.
