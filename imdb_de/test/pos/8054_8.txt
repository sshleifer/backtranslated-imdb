** SPOILERS ** Shocking but true story about the horror that befell the frontier town of Phenix in Alabama, Georgia when it was taken over by a group of organized thugs who turned it into the Sin City of the South. <br /> <br When the crime explodes and no one turns to a group of concerned citizens, you'll get a respected Phenix lawyer, Albert Patterson, John McIntire, to apply for the prosecutor's office. With Phenix's criminal element doing everything from intimidation to murder, Patterson holds the nomination he still wins in the state's other 86 districts, without Phenix's Russell County polls. <br /> <br /> Terrified by what Patterson would do if he takes over the office of Phenix Mob Rett Tanner, Edward Andrews has a blow to him. Patterson is gunned down while driving to his office, but his killers are discovered by Ellie Rhodes, Kathryn Grant, who soon becomes Tanner's next person targeted for murder by an informant in Patterson's office. What Tanner & Co. did not expect was that the late son of Albert Patterson, John Kiley, received the message from Ellie about his father's murder before his boys silenced her! This big miscalculation by Tanner will ultimately put an end to both his criminal organization and his freedom! <br /> <br /> Powerful documentary documentary with the actual people involved in the events, about 15 minutes. at the beginning of the film to tell their stories. This, despite the fact that they were still in danger of being murdered by the Tanner Mob, who was still at liberty at the time their interviews were filmed! History of Phenix City on the front pages of both state and national newspapers, which gives Tanner the extremely negative public he was trying so hard to avoid. With the now Alabama National Guard flooding Phenix City with the bloodthirsty and despondent unwilling to defy people with guns in hand, Tanner Mob faded like a morning mist after the sun had hit it! And now that John Patterson has taken his murdered father's place as the new Attorney General of Alabama, you can be sure that the Patterson mob has seen its last days pushing and murdering people. The only thing they'll see in the future is the gray prison walls and bars that will be their home for the rest of their lazy and miserable lives. <br /> <br /> Probably the most graphically violent movie from Hollywood that came from Hollywood at the time "The Phenix City Story" did not show how a group of lawless and powerful criminals are making a pretty American city hell for everyone can. No one was impaled by these ruthless gangsters who had not even considered killing even women and children when it came to keeping them in power! As for the Phenix City Police Department, they should better enforce the law they have sworn in and paid for. They drank coffee and donuts while their city was burned down by gangsters like Tanner, who had them in their hip bags!
