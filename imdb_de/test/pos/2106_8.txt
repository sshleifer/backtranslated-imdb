I have picked up on this lovingly remembered bit of film madness from the past and must ask you to steal or borrow it. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a duel between a righteous Shaolin priest and our villain Abbot White, it is needless to say that Abbot White steps on the Buddhist ass and begins his campaign against Shaolin with the help of his new ninja Ally (a gold-clad fighter fighting a golden ring, a black-clad fighter fighting a spear and my favorite, one fighting a pair of knives that can disappear and reappear as a flying rug). The rest of the story is about the education of Shaolin monks who were killed by Abbot White. One of them is Alexander Lo Rei. As we face the punishing training sequences, the two young avengers must learn the Shaolin Finger Jab technique required to defeat Abbot White's invincible armor technique. However, we see some ways in which our villain keeps in shape ... mainly with Taoist magic to extract the blood of naked ladies. We all know how this will end, but it is the psychedelic journey in between that we are here for. In summary, this is a good example of what Taiwan did when Hong Kong was fed up with the martial arts films, and that's just making more and more disgusting martial arts films. This film is very well choreographed, has some nudity, a bit of gore and enough balls on the wall to entertain even the most miserable spectators. Visit your local Beewise today! <br /> <br />
