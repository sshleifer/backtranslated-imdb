As a fan of the old Doctor Who and after the mediocre Fox movie, I doubted this new series of Doctor Who. I gave him a chance and I'm so glad I did. <br /> <br /> Yes, some episodes are not as brilliant as others, but they're all enjoyable, and yes, Eccleston's Doctor is far from anyone But before that ... Eccleston's Doctor is pretty much the best thing there are. His performance is sometimes funny, to others dramatic, sometimes completely crazy, but always fantastic. <br /> <br /> This and Bille Piper as Rose make this series a hit (Camille Coduri is also fantastic as Rose's mom)), and there's a depth to this line that did not exist before. This series is incredibly powerful, especially in terms of sci-fi. I mean, who would have thought that you had ever apologized or even cried for a Dalek, how many times in the history of this series we had moments like those with Rose's dad, the ambulance and the 'you were awesome ... so I the last speech? I can tell anyone, whether a fan of Doctor Who or even a TV drama, to buy this set on DVD, it's really "Fantastic!". <br /> <br /> Now only 4 episodes left from the latest series (and look forward to The New Cybermen) I have to say that David Tennant's Doctor is just not that good. Of course you can not agree with that, but I do not think his doctor has mastered the emotional moments of the previous series. I have to say that this series was not as good as the previous one in my opinion, but the return of Sarah Jane & K9 was a fantastic episode, a true gem. Not to say that this series is not good, just not so good. <br /> <br /> So, whether you like it or not, and whether you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, The Doctor is back and he is here to stay. "Fantastic!" - Almost as many "Fantastic!" Like The Doctor! -
