Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been! I love to watch him !! I was 10 years old (1979) when I saw him for the first time. I look forward to everything and everything he will act on. He is very hypnotic and mysterious and this voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning !!!! In my opinion he is the biggest actor I have ever seen! I worshiped him in "Dracula" (along with many other girls) and in "God Created Woman", "House of D", "Jason and the argonauts" and many more. I thought he was a genius !!!!!! can not wait to see him in "good night and good luck"
