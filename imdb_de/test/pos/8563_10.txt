This picture was released in May 1979 with Playboy Playmate Susan Kiger as Honey Shayne, Playboy Playmate Lisa London as O'Hara and Playboy Playmate Pamela Jean Bryant as Terri Lynn. In one of the most delicious Sec comedies in drive-in history, a whole series of young, loving boys meet in a story about battling bikini sisters who do nothing to show it all. What does H.O.T.S really stand for? You have to watch the movie to get the answer. You see, the girls have problems with the social girls on campus making them nothing but sex addicts. Therefore, the girls began to discredit the girls of society, regardless of what they need to do to get the job done. In addition, the dean of the college, who wants to dismantle the group of girls before they get out of control, is disassembled in this mess. I loved this movie, especially Lisa London. I thought her acting was fantastic and I'm disappointed that she did not get any other acting jobs. Alone because of the three playmates I give this movie 10 weasel stars.
