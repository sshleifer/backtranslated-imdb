The show starts with the boat. Desmond was. Then they tried to save Walt. And lock the things that pushing a button is a big joke when Desmond found out he's the one who crashed the plane. Eko tries to open the door Jhon has locked in, and Charlie helped him find the bomb. While Sayid and Jack's plan is so, Sasyid should first find the others and see who and what the others are. And find out if there is armed and weapons. <br /> <br /> Micheal traps Jack, Swayer, Kate and Hugo in a trap. And they get caught. <br /> <br /> After the show, there were more questions than answers, but that makes the show great. And can not wait until the 3rd season
