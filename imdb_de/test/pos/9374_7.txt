I did not read the source, Richard Brooks's novel "The Brick Foxhole," which I hope is not as unreasonable as the title, but I understand that the original villain was a homophobe and not an anti-Semite. (And to be honest, Sam Levene is a gay guy picking up a drunken soldier.) But okay, you have to go with the river. Consider 1947. Not even anti-Semitism was dealt with on screen. Many of those responsible for contemporary films were Jews themselves, but anti-Semitism had been banned for years because it was considered unpleasant. Therefore, we can hardly blame the creators of this film for not having left the victim homosexual. Well, that is REALLY unpleasant - and besides there have been many among the listeners who have got Robert Ryan to get away with it. We are by no means free from prejudice, but we have come a long way since 1947. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this for years, I was impressed by the rather slow tempo of the first half of The Movie, the many shots of two people talking, the shadows, the time that passes between the question and the answer, the uninspired cut. But I could live with that, because of the theme of the movie and a few other things. <br /> <br /> One of the things that keeps me from the events as they unfold on purpose is Robert Ryan's performance. The guy is doing a great job. At times he may seem thoughtful, happy and helpful to the police - "How can I help you, sir?" Then the seething hatred rises alone or with another soldier, not so much by what he says, but by the way he laughs. That dark look, that piercing look, those dark eyes glitter. Wow. <br /> <br /> The film has taken a lot of heat because of Robert Young's preaching speech about the murder of his grandfather. That does not bother me at all, though I think Dmytryk did not have to push Young's face into the camera while talking about "MICKS and PAPISTS". However, considering the context, this is one of the most shocking moments in the film. Part of the influence comes from the fact that Young almost accidentally delivered the message, and part of it is due to the fact that the message was not heard on screen before. <br /> <br /> Another feature of the movie that almost transforms her The surreal is the Paul Kelly character and his relationship with the whore Gloria Grahame. Holy Guacamole, which elliptical conversation is given to Kelly. "Do you know what I've told you, all that I've just told you are all lies." His character cuts through pathos with eeriness. It is impossible to know what he should think of him. He adds practically nothing to the plot, but the film would be much less without his presence. <br /> <br /> It's a moody, dark movie. His people live in the dark. And there is murder on foot. Practically, nobody is screaming or screaming. The horror these men have experienced and some of them still carry like malaria seems to be below the surface. <br /> <br /> See if you have a chance.
