This version did not move me so much as the later Hollywood version with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. While the BBC version was beautifully filmed and excellently played, it offered more dialogue and information that intrigued me. It gave me a detailed insight into the intellectual, theological, and moral considerations that motivated C.S. Lewis. It was therefore more interesting and inspiring than the Hollywood version, but not nearly as numbing or visceral. Although I had not left a pile of sodden Kleenex drenched in the theater, I used it periodically. I liked this movie as much as the Hollywood version and I was grateful for my better understanding.
