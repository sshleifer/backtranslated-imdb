This movie comes from Turkey, where you can not find a tradition of horror movies. At first, I was afraid to just look at an adaptation, but after seeing them I changed my mind. It has an original scenario. A love movie with a horror theme. Most players are not famous young people, but their performance proves that a new generation is coming. Perhaps this is a sign that Turkish cinema is coming back after 20 years.
