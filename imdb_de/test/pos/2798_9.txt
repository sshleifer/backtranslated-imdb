Clich√© avoidance is one of the main achievements of this film. If you hear a vague outline of the story? Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing an apartment in Barcelona ?? They predict a collection of Euro stereotypes in an absurd tangle. Pas you tout! In fact, it is a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, who tries to understand human relationships. There are some superbly watched supporting roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the unbearably irresistible brother of the Englishwoman, Xavier's Abandoned Mother) and some visual humor, especially in the first scenes where the bureaucratic complexity of the petition is mocked. What is Xavier learning about relationships? Nothing positive Instead of a traditionally happy ending, there is a regrettable final on "identity"? Xavier has become all the friends he has made. Nevertheless, this very entertaining movie deserves great success. I saw it in Luxembourg with a mixed Euro audience that was amused and even applauded in the end.
