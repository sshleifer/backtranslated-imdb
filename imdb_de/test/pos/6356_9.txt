This movie is a great example of what an independent movie can be. The director does a great job of overcoming the borderline between emotional and physical violence. But in the end, he remembers what so many indie films forget - he tells a good story. Watching this movie, I was reminded of how scared and banal most Hollywood movies on a big budget really became. <br /> <br /> Particularly noteworthy is the extraordinary performance of the film's lead - Jorge Cordova. As a wicked criminal (on his way to the top of the crime heap), Cordova plays a brutal, brutal, conceited, deceitful and devious S.O.B. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that these people were part of the New Wave of Latino filmmakers in Los Angeles - called La Nueva Obra or something like that. In any case, you are looking forward to seeing more of her work in this film. <br /> <br />
