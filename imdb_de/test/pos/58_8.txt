Excellent editing, excellent acting, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and very entertaining musical soundtrack. This film goes back to the 1940s to comment on the racial differences between races and the effects of desegregation, while telling the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays the young character of Terrence Howard does a wonderful job that reflects the life and times of his upbringing in the small town of New York. The audience laughed, cried and burst into applause for the movie and its director. <br /> <br /> Soon to see HBO (February 7th, I think) - Start the TIVO and enjoy a great story!
