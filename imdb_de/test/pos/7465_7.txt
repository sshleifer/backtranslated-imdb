This movie starts a bit slow, but it quickly becomes comedic. Each of the three "teenage girls" offers its own credible, diverse, assertive and entertaining personalities. I particularly enjoyed the dialogue and interaction between Keith and Lisa. Looking beyond the superficial "action," Keith's figure treated Lisa's "defloration" with tenderness and consideration. The following comic development was drawn in my opinion also expert. David Boreanaz does a wonderful job as a grown man who obviously gets more in trouble than he can handle. The dialogue was sharp, fast and fluently good. The director and author of this film showed clearly that none of the main characters could claim the moral climax after all the phenomena they drew. Although the film appears bright on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of an adult, human emotion and desire.
