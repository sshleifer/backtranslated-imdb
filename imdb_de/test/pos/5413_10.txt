This movie is a strong commentary on today's family life in North America. The story is so well-structured that it's almost like the other side of the street, right now! If you are in any way connected with your family and community, this film will take you and bring you to the houses of Travis, and you may not go until the credits are finalized. Innumerable innocent circumstances lead us unconsciously on a path of sadness, confusion and isolation. The Travis family invites each of us after a terrible tragedy. Father, Mother, Brother and Sister, in their respective lives to share their experiences in a dynamic set of circumstances that just will not stop. We see all this and, ultimately, the joy, in powerful performances of the main actors and the rest of the cast, making this film an absolute treasure for the film visitor. Normally it is difficult to find something special, but Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Sandy Travis was outstanding , I would be surprised if others did not recognize it as such. <br /> <br /> Clear a 10. Well done!
