I searched the TV Guide for movies coming from Germany, and I found a movie called The Bunnyguards, so I looked at it and laughed silly! I wanted the DVD, but it is not available here (I could order it from Germany, but it has no subtitles). It was played again, so I recorded it and watched it from time to time. Anyway, I searched for information and found out that his real name is Erkan & Stefan, but I know him through his Australian title: The Bunnyguards. <br /> <br /> Some people I know from Germany do not like Erkan & Stefan because of their accent, but not being German myself, I did not notice. The jokes are good, but some Germans may find their accents repulsive. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is funny and if the DVD contains English subtitles for all extras (with a 2-disc edition only with the subtitled feature would be bad) I would buy it fast! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story.
