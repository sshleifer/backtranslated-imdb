One day, a red alley cat is tired of being kicked by humans and attacked by dogs and muses that life would be better if he were a skunk. Then he paints himself black with a white stripe on his back and adds some Limburger cheese to stink him. Life might not be better for him in the beginning, the dog flees and the butcher leaves his shop and lets the cat run away with a bunch of meat. Just when he thinks everything is perfect, he is perceived by a real skunk, not by every skunk, but by the overly in love Pepé Le Pew. Pepé confuses the poor cat for a female skunk and persecutes him because he thinks his protests are only shyness. Our poor cat says he escaped when he throws a skunk fur out of a tall building, so Pepé thinks he's dead. At first it seems to work. However, when Pepé sneaks him off, he sees him and immediately forgets the dead skunk. At the end the cat realizes that it was better to be kicked and attacked than to be coveted by a horny skunk. There is also a nice end to the skunk when his wife finds out what he's up to. <br /> <br /> This was a pretty funny introduction to Pepé Le Pew, who was just overly in love at the time, but now looks like a horny sexually assaulting stalker, even though he was eventually punished for his behavior.
