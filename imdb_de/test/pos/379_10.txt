This is one of the best films by Alfred Hitchcock and one of his most underrated. I think it's certainly a "psycho" or "the birds" for technical art and brilliance. It's a macabre, tense, darkly humorous product that will amaze you for a long time. Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable villains as the father-hating, motherly-fixed (but not.) Not most of Hitchcock's badmouth boys?) Bruno. It's a disturbing, breathtaking performance that sheds light on the entire movie. His character is obsessive, apparently homosexual (look at these intentionally feminine relationships and hear what he calls "European"), strangely charming and dangerous to cross. Farley Granger certainly knows that, as he gets tangled in Bruno's filthy web after the couple meet. Bruno, who knows some insider information on Guy's affairs, suggests the two "swindlers" for the benefit of the other. Walker will kill Granger's sloppy, pathetic wife, who inhibits his marriage to beautiful Anne, while Granger will murder Bruno's father, whom he so much hates. Everyone is happy, right? A win-win situation, as Bruno claims? Not correct. Granger does not forget the indecent proposal, but an obsessed Walker. He commits his murder and is determined to persecute Granger until he has also completed his side of the deal. "Strangers" turns into an exciting cat-and-mouse game in Hitch's capable hands. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock was absolutely amazing when it came to creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes. We have the whore Miriam, Granger's estranged wife, who is pregnant with another man. She slurps a phallic ice-cream cone while eagerly eating Bruno's eyes. Barbara Morton, Anne's sister, is a deceptively cute, but clever and smart girl who can be heard with the most brutal utterances of a bespectacled girl in the '50s. Senator Morton is authoritarian and selfish. This is one of the most daring films Hitchcock has ever made, and it's typical of a hitch movie, subtly sexual in detail. <br /> <br /> This fits into the film noir category with its focus on murder, lies and deceitful and shadowy cinematography. Walker's nut is forever, and Granger convinces with a troubled protagonist. Roman may be weaker than the other two, and I never believed in her relationship with Granger. However, the overwhelming positive effects cancel out the slight negatives and it can be said with certainty that this is one of the BEST American films ever made. <br /> <br /> Just look at what Hitch is doing here - the originality, the technical ability. We see the murder of Miriam in her broken glasses. A game of tennis is one of the most exciting and intense scenes you'll ever see. An innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and disgusting events. Walker abruptly pops a boy's balloon (Hitch apparently liked what he saw in "The Third Man!"). The joy of children riding the carousel becomes a screaming, terrifying horror. Hitch infiltrates ordinary, everyday events like no other. <br /> <br /> The camera work here is one of the best ever seen in a Hitchcock movie, and the premise is to die. It is smooth, exudes sophistication and devilish charm. The cross section between the characters of Walker and Granger is great. Granger's Do-or-Die tennis match is as important as the Rogue Walker, who saved an insulting piece of evidence lost in a drain. Hitch rebuilt his villain into a disgusting, disgusting, but likable and oddly charming piece of work (did anybody else find him oddly more than Granger)? from the drain. We need him anyway. He has the key to the story. <br /> <br /> You'll never see a stranger approach like this again after seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> Amazing. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
