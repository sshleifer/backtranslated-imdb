One of my favorite movies of all time. It is unbeatable to watch this movie for the first time. If I go back in time and clear my memory or suffer from a brief amnesia, I would enjoy this movie as much as I did the very first time. It is still a pleasing second and third time, but I appreciate the humor more, as the shocks and the thrill were not unexpected. If you want to watch a movie that you really can not predict, then I highly recommend this movie. It's cool, shocking, full of excitement and there's plenty of humor to help you with it. If you see this movie and do not love it, I really ask your sanity!
