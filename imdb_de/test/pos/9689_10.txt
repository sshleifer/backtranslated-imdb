Seriously, people need to lighten up and just accept that funny is funny, and this movie is damn funny. Better than the first, and Knoxville really became a couple for this movie, doing far crazier stunts than the first. If Ebert and Roper (who do not say I'm a big fan of them) can look beyond the sheer idiocy of this movie enough to be two thumbs up, then I think other people can. I was not sure what to expect, but I had flooring and it's rare for a sequel to be better than the original. I think the new one surpasses the first big time. So do what I did, just relax, do not try to laugh in some places and laugh your ass.
