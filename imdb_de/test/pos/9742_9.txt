One of the most famous of all film series! Still interesting today, although it has an "old movie". The second series looks better, but does not match. Actors have a good time, especially Middleton and Lipson. Great editing by the Universal Expert Crew. The score was recorded by Universal's "Destination Unknown", "The Invisible Man", "The Black Cat" and "Werewolf of London". And what a great action music! If there was a choice for the best series of all time, this should be # 1.
