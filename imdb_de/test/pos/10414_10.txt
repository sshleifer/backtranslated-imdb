This show must be my favorite from all 80's horror TV shows. Like Tales from the Darkside, also by the same creators, this show is a rare gem. If you agree with me, PLEASE sign this petition that I started to distribute monsters and get out on DVD. Here is the petition address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes would have to be Glim Glim and Rain Dance. I also loved the opening with the monster family. That scared me earlier! One of the things I have to add to the DVD makers is the organ sound that was just heard before the commercial break. I do not know if any of you remember this part, but that's one of the most important things that brings back memories. I mean, come on! War of the Worlds, the TV series has already been released on DVD, so I say Monsters and also Tales from the Darkside. On Friday, the 13th, the series should also be released! We, the fans, have to say our opinion! We need this great show on DVD, so please spread the word !!!
