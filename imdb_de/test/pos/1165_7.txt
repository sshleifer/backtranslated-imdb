The lovely Candace Bergen, widow of Perdicaris, is kidnapped by the sheikh Raisuli, played by a dashing Sean Connery, and held as a ransom. The incident occurred in 1904, when Theodore Roosevelt ran for the presidential election on his own. Brian Keith as Roosevelt needs a good example to demonstrate the muscular foreign policy of the United States. He makes an impressive statement to the Sultan of Morocco: "Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead." But in this adaptation of this incident, the famous explanation is the only true to this story. The Perdicaris in question were actually Ion Perdicaris, a Greek immigrant and amateurs playboy. Indeed, years ago Perdicaris gave up his American citizenship and returned as a Greek citizen. That does not matter, his predicament was already reasonably usable at that time. <br /> <br /> The distressed girl makes better footage, though it is a widow woman and her two children who are in danger here. Of course, as shown here, some of our European powers use the incident to gain a foothold in Morocco. The intrigues go far beyond the ransom demand of a brigand. <br /> <br /> The wind and the lion are hardly history. But it's an entertaining movie, and Sean Connery is always fun. Brian Keith also fits my idea of ​​Theodore Roosevelt, and the scenes in the White House of Roosevelt sound faithful to all stories. John Huston plays ever-patient Secretary of State John Hay, whom Roosevelt inherited from his predecessor William McKinley. <br /> <br /> But children do not use this movie to skip reading a story about Theodore Roosevelt.
