Three words: artwork. This movie is just great. It's beautiful, sad, frightening and thought-provoking. The music always stays in my head, the acting is wonderful, at the same time the scenery is scary and beautiful. <br /> <br /> It was just a coincidence that I saw this movie. By the time I decided to watch this movie, I was just bored, reading lists of Asian movies that may be good. Well, I saw the title "A story of two sisters," which sounded very interesting. Then I read the summary of the plot and decided: "Not only do you see this movie, you have to buy it". Said, done. I bought this movie and loved it from the first minute. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy stopped me from start to finish; The spin at the end of the movie made me scream. I really did not see such a thing coming. And the final scene made me cry ... it just made me cry. It was so sad. <br /> <br /> Well, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie that combines an interesting plot with scary scenes and atmosphere. However, you should be aware that the end, as I mentioned earlier, is very sad. But that just suits the mood of the movie, right?
