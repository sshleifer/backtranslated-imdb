I'm sure people from the US do not know about the rest of the world, but I think they should not talk about what they do not know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocritical as the US. The only places where consenting sex between teenagers is illegal are the US and the Islamic nations. In France, for example, the consent age is 15 years. It's 14 years in Brazil. In Spain, it is 12 years. The actors of the teenagers, who are 16 and 17 years old at the time of production, do nothing illegal. Nudity is not considered a big deal in almost all civilized countries. And only a freak can consider the love of a teenager as child abuse.
