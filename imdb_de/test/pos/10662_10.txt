Sergei Eisenstein's most famous film has really survived the test of time. The story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 has the feeling of Soviet propaganda, but shows the conditions that led to the uprising. The scene on the steps of Odessa should be remembered by everyone. <br /> <br /> Okay, "The Battleship Potemkin" was not the first movie the montage was done in, but they did a great job here. Surely every film history lesson should show this movie. It's a great historical drama (though I have to admit that I do not know how accurate it is). A 10/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and by now we should have known that "Potemkin" should be transliterated as "Potyomkin".
