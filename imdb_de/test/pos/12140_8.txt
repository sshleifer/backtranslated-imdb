This is a black and white film from France, <br /> <br /> Simple plot, gangster on the run, seeking help, etc. We have seen this movie many times over the years. What makes this movie special is its acting and style. All actors play softly, nobody screams and hardly anyone loses his temper. There are some deaths, some surprising. There are also beautiful women, but no sex scenes. No chases. <br /> <br /> ONLY talking / It's so refreshing to listen to people, and here we also have subtitles to read. <br /> <br /> The acting is almost perfect. especially the lead played Lino Ventura & in a smaller but decisive role Jean Paul Belmondo. These 2 actors were among the best. <br /> <br /> I said above about the movie is flawed. In some places there are a few scripting flaws. They are minor. Acting is the thing in this movie. The production is also first class. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (from 4) 88 points (from 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
