I was surprised and impressed to discover that this film was released in 1940 before the United States entered World War II. On the surface, satirizing something as serious and dreadful as National Socialist Germany might be misinterpreted as a rash. But Chaplin's glamor is not limited to making a joke of everything. Indeed, the seriousness of his message would not have been nearly as valid unless the excellent use of humor in this film along with the dramatic drama moments had been added to the film. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) may be the best way to attack him, while laughter with someone (the Jewish barber) is the best way to love him. In the closing speech of the Jewish barber, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that have meaning now and at any time of the war. For that reason, I believe that the movie was much better than damage, as it still has the same profound effect today.
