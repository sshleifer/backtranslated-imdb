I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is lying but that's why she's called "big fat liar". Although this kid flees to Hollywood, children do not have the idea that they can. Besides, he does not just do it for fun or to get away from anything, but to gain confidence. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was just a big advertisement for Universal Studios, because I liked to give some insight into the way kids look like, who do not know how cool the movie is is. <br /> <br /> It has good music and funny characters. This family / comedy is fun for kids and parents alike. It has humor, excitement and real life difficulties like lies. <br /> <br /> In the end, Big Fat Liar sends out a moral: do not expect lies to be easy.
