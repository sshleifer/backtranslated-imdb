In the early 19th century, a young woman with a harelip came into conflict with the ambitions of her family and the superstition of the local community. However, she does meet a man who may see her differently and possibly change Pru's life forever. <br /> <br /> Precious Bane is an adaptation of Mary Webb's critically acclaimed novel by the British Broadcasting Corporation. It's a beautifully filmed piece played at an incredibly high level. The story {Maggie Wadey's script} is excellent and the details and use of dialects are unique. It's a shame that this movie has not received a DVD release yet. It would have been thought that Clive Owens {great here as Gideon} would become a star, the BBC would get it out of it, but unfortunately, no, it's the only way. It's in the rare instances where TCM shows it. The lead performance of Janet McTeer as Pru Sarn is just brilliant, courage and real emotion go hand in hand as McTeer gives it all. Pru does not just have to put up with her facial disfigurement, but also with the constant coming and hurting of the ignorant villagers. This was a time when people believed that when a rabbit ran in front of a pregnant woman, it was a fate, a time of bull baiting, a time of superstition, and talk of witches. Despite constant setbacks, Pru is strong and resourceful, even her own family recovers her dreams without realizing it, but this road may be a terribly bumpy road, but hope is everlasting, and Pru abounds with hope. > <br /> 8.5 / 10
