Whenever I do not give 150% to my dreams or goals, I think of Mark Borchardt, the real subject of American Movie. Mark's stubborn insistence on producing and making his first feature film is so intriguing that it makes you laugh, shakes your head with sadness and roots it. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a documentary movie on R. Crumb since then. The supporting "cast" (Mark's real family and friends) are all great. Give this film a chance and you will see a great movie and a wonderful portrait of what the American Dream is made of.
