I saw this movie on a screener and it's the best movie I've seen in a long time. I loved it!!!! James Franco is so hot and he and Sienna Miller are the perfect couple. I do not want to reveal what's going on, but they're playing a couple of bridal couples who are making their honeymoon to Niagara Falls, and some wild stuff is happening along the way. I can not even say what it reminded me, but look at it! I cried so much but I really loved it and want to see it again as soon as it comes out! My friends were crying too. I hope it comes out soon - does anyone know when? I would really see it if I were you
