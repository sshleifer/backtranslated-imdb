Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in character-driven studies in naturalistic films about the kind of little people who pass by every day without anyone ever realizing that they're in New York. <br /> <br /> These are people who have been pushed to the margins of society. They exist in a kind of gray world, many of them are migrants whose legal status in America seems somewhat doubtful. Where are you from ? How did you get there ? How do you manage? Where will they end? These are not good stories as such, but stories about survival at its most common level. <br /> <br /> Ale is such a street kid. He has no education and no hassle, he can, to save money, not too small theft. Mostly he strives to be reunited with his older sister. We see him calling a safe house in the early scenes that she seeks but has no real success. Carlos, a young friend, gets a job in a chop shop, in the shadow of Shea's baseball stadium. At some point, his older sister comes to live with him, but he is jealous of the motives of her friends and suspicious of how she earns extra money. He dreams of buying a food cart and starting a sales business with his older sister. <br /> <br /> Bahrani shoots all his films locally. There is nothing shiny or shiny about them. This is life, as these people have to live in the raw state. It's not pretty, though it's never threatening, and the somewhat desperate air that hangs over the entire movie is the same one that hangs over those people's everyday lives. <br /> <br /> The script is also very natural and the characters are given a lot of leeway and space to work in it. Polanco is outstanding in the lead role, and Gonzalez gives solid support as an older sister.
