Send them to the freezer. This is the solution two butchers find after discovering the popularity of selling human meat. An incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror movie. The complex characters resist a superficial classification and make the story interesting and rewarding - if you can stand it. Definitely a dark movie, but also a bit redeeming.
