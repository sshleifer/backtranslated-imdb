Like most sports movies that have come out in the past, this film is similar in terms of fact that it is based on facts. What distinguishes this film is that it is a rugby team, a sport that not many Americans know. Apart from that, this movie is a very rewarding piece of film noir. It reminds me of "We Are Marshall", but with a smaller budget and an independent film feel. Director Ryan Little brings us a story that tells us a story about a rebellious teenager played by Sean Farris (Never Back Down) as Rick Penning, who is in a strange location on and off the field. Despite some holes in the storyline, this film has a heart and rewards each of its viewers with good characters we can identify with. Good performances also through the support of actor Gary Cole as coach Larry Gelwix & Neal McDonough as coach Penning (Rick's father). I felt like I went through many different emotions in film watching. In the end, I had a sense of trust in humanity and a hope for the future for my children, especially when there are coaches like Gelwix.
