Simply one of the greatest movies ever made. It is worthy, in addition to European masterpieces such as THE RULES OF THE GAME, GRAND ILLUSION, NOSTALGHIA, ANDREI ROUBLEV, 8 1/2, WINGS OF DESIRE, VIRIDIANA, THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS, LA STRADA, ORDER, THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC, THE FOUR HUNDRED BLOWS and MADAME DE ... A blessing ... as well as an almost perfect work of art.
