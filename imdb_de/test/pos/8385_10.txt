... "Inglorious", when our local theater decided to play its title on the marquee, minus the second word. It is a terrific cinema. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this film to all the exaggerated ones. Never let them know what they are missing. <br /> <br /> I was reluctant to award ten stars because I worked in Tarantino's previous films. In any case, save "Reservoir Dogs", they have improved with additional observations. <br /> <br /> Although I gave him ten stars, I reluctantly did so. I can not go "up". <br /> <br /> Yes, Christoph Waltz is the Nazi, of whom we have all imagined the worst. He is cultured, cultured, confident and very sadistic. He's a man who can make a glass of milk a threat and suddenly expels his cigarette in a whirlpool by grinding it into the whipped cream, as if he's grinding his heel into a mill sacrifice. <br /> <br /> To understand Tarantino's films, all you need is a sense of dialogue, color and speed. The colors are as light as necessary and even lighter if needed. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but overly. Outside, a bright sun shines, but in the one room of the house everything is bathed in shade and black. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliant backdrop for Waltz's interrogation as "Jew Hunter" the SS, who dangles his French farmer on the slope of disclosing what he can not often reveal, then pulls him along repressive lines of friendship and understanding. A second sadistic German, well played by August Diehl later acts as an important actor in the final plot. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz ... almost. <br /> <br /> Film lessons will learn a lot from this film. You should look lovingly at the excellent pace. Tarantino knows exactly how long he has to draw a scene by building up the tension in the manner of Hitchcock and then suddenly comes to a solution at the break point. <br /> <br /> To find color, look for a recent setting at the French Theater, where his secretly Jewish owner provides a surprise for the upper class of the Nazi leadership. <br /> <br /> We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, on the hated German dignitaries who will come to a film premiere of the latest German film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious achievements. <br /> <br/> Laurent stands on a balcony and is reflected in the glass mirrors of the beautiful theater, her red lips and low-cut dress reflect the intensity of her designs throughout her guests. It's a single shot that would be worth a whole movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are many more such images, many more moving scenes of exquisite dialogue and excitement. <br /> <br /> In short: see it I'm sure you'll see it again and again.
