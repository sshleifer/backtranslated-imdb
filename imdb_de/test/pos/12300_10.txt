I saw this movie for the first time in Austria when it came out and I was thrilled. It is a passionate and deeply moving work that all connoisseurs of film art should experience. What a shame it has never been released in DVD format. Maybe one of those days will be corrected, since it would be a shame if one of the best movies ever made was forgotten and should disappear forever in a vault. Why is that? "B" films like "American Wedding" and "Eurotrip" receive widescreen and full-screen releases and often a special edition with several commentaries and extras, while great works of art like "The Dead" are almost forgotten?
