I thought it was an excellent movie. Gary Cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and dissatisfied with his wife, who fabulously pretends to be dead! Overall, I found the movie great, definitely not a boring plot! It is sad to say, but I think many men may feel that way. I think he should have just divorced and asked for transfer instead of reaching the extreme he had gone to, but he felt there was no other way out, so he faked his death. I thought it was nice that Cole's real wife played the woman he was not satisfied with in the movie. I think what the guy did was a bit extreme, but the movie was great anyway! In any case, recommend!
