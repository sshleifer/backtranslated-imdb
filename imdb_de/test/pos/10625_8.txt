Overall, I found this movie good: extraordinary spectacle with disturbing scenes (some indispensable, some useless) and weak second half. CONTAINS SPOILER The movie is divided into 2 parts. I loved the first half of the pianist. We meet Erika Kohut (wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher, and get to know her world. She is single and struggling to find her place against an overprotective and cross-border tyrannical mother. We know that she has lost or seldom experienced love as a physical + emotional chemistry: she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people, solving her sexual tensions in sex shops, as a voyeur, or in sadistic self-mutilation. This first half is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film that is almost unbearable. Then comes Walter, a young, handsome and open-minded man (superbly played by Benoit Magimel). Although he feels Erika's coldness in the beginning, he seduces her and slowly moves through Erika's fortress. He loves her very much, but she needs him to fulfill her sadistic desires. Then, when she falls in love with him, he is disgusted by her world, and in the end we discover that Erika is unable to love or even feel at all (especially because Walter is portrayed as someone who is impossible, not to love). This is the second half of the film, very touching, when we see that Erika's inability / inexperience to love her leads to self-destruction. This second half seemed less mastered by Haneke and sometimes had unreliable (ie shocking) scenes that paradoxically diminished the drama. <br /> <br /> Of course, at least in the French version, this is a raw movie: you see porno sequences from the sex shop, brave mutilations and sex scenes. The much discussed fellatio scene between Magimel and Huppert was pretty good, I thought, and is central to understanding Erika's diseased relationship to love. With regard to the actors, Huppert is wonderful throughout the film, Magimel is getting better and more perfected, and Girardot (the mother) is excellent. <br /> <br />
