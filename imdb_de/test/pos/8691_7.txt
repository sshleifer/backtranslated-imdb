Why Jessie Matthews, one of the top British stars, is a good question in this film between her sparkling "The Good Companions" and the classic "Evergreen"? When I saw it for the first time, I was really disappointed. I wanted to see her singing and dancing - she was referred to as "Millie - the nonstop variety girl", but there was more support than variety. Now I see it as a good little drama br /> <br /> It's about a bus crash and the stories that lead to the bus drivers. <br /> <br /> Apart from Jessie Matthews, who's great as Millie - Sir Ralph Richardson plays her fiancee (yes, that's right). Edmund Gwenn - who went to Hollywood to star in Lassie films and plays a grumpy businessman with Natalie Wood in "Miracle on 34th Street." Gordon Harker is his annoying partner. Emlyn Williams - who wrote the "Night Must Fall" - was the black villain and Frank Lawton who went to Hollywood and "David Copperfield" and "The Devil Doll" is the young man in trouble. Sonnie Hale, who was married to Jessie Matthews at the time, played the conductor.
