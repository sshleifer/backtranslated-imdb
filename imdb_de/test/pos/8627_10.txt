The duo of Abbott and Costello lives on in this version of a legendary classic. In "Jack and the Beanstalk" you can see everything, music, magic and comedy in one. Costello plays Jack after he once heard the story a boy once told. We know that Jack was a poor boy selling his cow "Dolly" for 5 magic beans. Well, he plants these 5 beans and they were really magical. He climbs into heaven, sees a big castle there and would sing a song. Unknown, he would meet the giant (Buddy Bear). Not only he, he danced with the woman, who was also a giant. She would beat Jack with his elbows during the dance. That was funny! You have the playing harp who knows how to make the giant so easy. The goose laying golden eggs. And my favorite, as Jack gets rid of the giant. He picks up the ax and starts hacking the beanstalk. It is funny, too, where the ax got stuck when hacking. The graduation party takes place as people dance around the footprint where the giant fell. Have fun and fun for the whole family. We recommend! 5 Stars!
