Jennifer Montgomery's "Art for Teachers of Children" is an impressive, disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's edged cinematography and cinematography, coupled with the brilliant, emotionless performance she brings forth from her cast, reinforces the feeling of a shocking, raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifer seduction of her married boarding school counselor. The scenes between the amazingly sinister actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful I've ever seen in the movie. The lesson that was learned here at the end? "There is nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art." Well, I would recommend this remarkable piece of "art" to anyone who is looking for an independent cinema to think about.
