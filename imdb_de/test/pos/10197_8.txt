as a fan of robocop i always loved this movie. I saw it when it first came out, and finally I bought it on DVD from Brazil. It was never released on DVD in the US. I like the movie, but like everything else in the world everyone has their opinion, loves them or hates them. No matter what a movie does, someone will always say, "Why did not they do it differently?" In other words, you can not please everyone. If you love Robocop, you will love this movie. For me it's so unique that it's not cheesy or stupid like many movies on a smaller budget. This movie has always interested me. I can see some scenes that Robocop borrowed here, but tell me which movies do not? Many films use other ideas from other films and sometimes change them. funny movie!
