As an avid reader of Clive Barker, I really expected this movie to be released ... I was not disappointed. "Nightbreed" is a horse of a different color. Rich in the underlying decline of Western civilization and in a way we have never seen before. Barker is best when he gives us an insight into his world of unprecedented horror and shows us the other side of the coin. Here, the "monsters" are the abominably beautiful creatures, while humans are the deceptively ugly creatures of self-enjoyment. We soon learn that we were wrong all the time. By far my favorite performance from the often understaffed Craig Sheffer, and the added bonus of David Cronenberg as the "Decker" is a cast that you see best. The "monsters" are flawlessly portrayed by a host of English creature masters who brought to life many "Cenobites" in "Hellraiser", including "Pinhead" even Doug Bradley. "Nightbreed" is an absolute must for any fan of the horror genre and for anyone who just needs something from his horror story. This is Clive Barker at its best.
