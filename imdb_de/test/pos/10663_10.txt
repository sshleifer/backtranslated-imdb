Potemkin, which was originally only part of a great epic The Year 1905, in which the revolution of 1905 is presented, is the story of the mutiny of the crew of the Potemkin crew in the port of Odessa. The film begins with the crew protesting against the meaty flesh and the captain ordering the execution of the dissidents. There is an uprising that kills the revolutionary leader. This crew member is brought to the shore to lie in the state. As the citizens gather on a huge staircase overlooking the harbor, tsarist troops emerge and march down the stairs, shattering the crowd. A naval squadron is sent to retake the Potemkin, but the moment the ships get within range, their crews allow the mutineer to go through. The non-historically accurate end of Eisenstein is open, suggesting that this was the seed of the later Bolshevik revolution that would flourish in Russia. The film is divided into five parts: Men and Maggots, Drama on the Quarterdeck, An Appeal from the Dead, The Steps of Odessa and Meetings with the Squadron. Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but a genius level. Not wanting to make a historical drama, Eisenstein used visual textures to give the film a newsreel look, giving viewers a sense of eavesdropping on an exciting and politically revolutionary story. This technique is used in Pontecorvos The Battle of Algiers. In contrast to Pontecorvo, Eisenstein relied on the typography or casting of non-professionals who had striking physical appearances. The extraordinary faces of the cast are reminiscent of Potemkin. This technique is later used by Frank Capra in Mr. Deeds's Goes to Town and meets John Doe. In Potemkin, however, no individual is used as a hero or heroine. The story is told through a series of scenes combined in a special effect called montage - the editing and selection of short segments to give the viewer a desired effect. D.W. Griffith also used the assembly, but no one mastered it as well as Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic shots of the crew sleeping in their hammocks are complemented by the graceful swinging of tables attached to chains in the galley. In contrast, the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity, and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their anger with injustice. Eisenstein introduced the technique of showing and repeating an action, but from a slightly different angle to the intensity. Breaking a plate labeled "Give us our daily bread today" marks the beginning of the end. This technique was used last year in Mariánské Lázně. When the ship's surgeon is thrown over the side, his pince-nez dangles from the rigging. With these glasses, the officer inspected the maden-infested flesh. This sequence binds the punishment to the corruption of the tsarist era. <br /> <br /> The most famous sequence in the film and perhaps in the entire film history is The Odessa Steps. The vast expanse of the steps is filled with hundreds of extras. Fast and dramatic violence is always suggested and is not explicit, but the visual images of the death of a few will remain forever in the minds of the beholder cleverly accented with long menacing shadows from a sun on top of the stairs. The tempo of the sequence is intentionally varied between the marching soldiers and some civilians, who muster the courage to ask them to stop. The face of a woman frozen in the terror of a soldier's sword is the direct forerunner of the Bonnie bank clerk in Clyde, and gives a lasting impression of the tsarist regime's horror. <br /> <br /> The death of a young mother causes a stroller to descend the stairs, in a sequence copied by Hitchcock in the Foreign Correspondent, by Terry Gilliam in Brazil and Brian DePalma in The Untouchables. This sequence is repeatedly shown from different angles, highlighting the event, which is likely to last only five seconds. Potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit, does not convert it for the ones already celebrated and propagated for the film. It burns with fire and roars before the senseless injustices of the decadent Tsarist regime. The biggest impact came from film students, who borrowed the techniques invented two generations ago in Russia and only slightly improved.
