I love this program. It is smart and played very well. David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry. The writing is clever and subplots generally give a great weird relief. After each new episode, I'm always amazed at how thoughtful and entertaining this show is. My only complaint would be Donna Murphy's absence at this time in the second season. As the ex-wife of David Morse, Heather, she added such a character to the show. I think this show is a merit of the crime / drama. With these words - I can not understand for the life of me why this show has such a low rating. Would someone please rate this show as 1?
