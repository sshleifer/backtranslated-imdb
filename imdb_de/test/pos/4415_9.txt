I was junior in high school when "Flesh" hit the big screens, but I was fortunate enough to see it in New York's midnight cinemas just two years later, a so-called "trilogy" of movies starring Joe Dallesandro Desire. It bears the name "Warhol", but is more the work of Paul Morissey. In essence, the story deals with the exploits that one day surrounds the life of a male street artist (played by Joe Dallesandro). Joe is young, pretty and a bit na√Øve ... but he manages to bring bacon home to his wife, for reasons that should not be explained to the film's fully appreciative film fans, that this film ( along with the remaining two of the trilogy) had no script per se. Warhol's superstars just got a premise ... and the words and actions the viewer sees are quite natural (even sometimes ridiculous or nonsensical). But all in all it works ... "Rolling Stone" stated in its review that the film was better than "Midnight Cowboy," a film of the same year polished by Hollywood (An Academy Award winner for Best Picture) became great name talent (I admire the movie as well), but FLESH, which was improvised, was somehow more exciting and realistic, without the need for complex undergrounds and "ce de celebre" ... or any reason whatsoever! <br /> <br /> The film brought in more than $ 3 million and was an absolute sensation especially in the German market (which ironically said they had received a "censored version" of the film post-production .... see note below). <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, the movie "Pops" is very "cut and paste". "clicks", "blinks" and the dialogue literally truncates the sentence. It's almost as if Warhol / Morissey is telling a simple truth that it is a "day in the life" of a superstar who is a snippet of your voyeuristic tendencies. Far better than in previous Warhol works with 8 hours of sleep and the Statue of Liberty as a 20-hour film. FLESH, in my opinion, is the first of the Warhol films that is actually digestible ((a wide range) and Warhol's / the Factories first legitimate answer to the Hollywood phenomenon "stardom". <br /> <br /> First of all "Trilogy," she shows a young, desirable male icon, naively sought, responding to invitations to please his family, and subsequent films would show the same character with different values.
