Leslie Carbaga's excellent book about the Fleishers tells the whole story of the big move of the entire animation unit to Florida and the subsequent ejection by Paramount. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bug Goes to Town did not destroy Paramount's recognition of the animation pioneers, though it was often said that way, and this was the favorite version of Paramount. According to Carbaga, the big studio wanted to get their hands on the animation studio and get the famous brothers out of the picture. Mr. Bug gave them the excuse to do just that. - The sad conclusion of a great, quirky, innovative chapter in American animation. <br /> <br /> I also wanted to comment that the film actually debuted on December 4, 1941, not on December 7. That may have been close enough to achieve the trick in terms of the national mood that is detrimental to the film's success. Another part of the legend of this troubled little film is that he was killed when he was unlucky enough to be in the cinemas at the same time as Dumbo (released October 23, 1941) was still making very lively holiday deals. I did not do the research for the box office, but I would say that Dumbo's simultaneous presence in the movie theaters probably had an impact on Mr. Bug. The visit to the cinema was at its peak at this time, and successful films could run for months in theaters. - Something unimaginable in these usually short DVD days.
