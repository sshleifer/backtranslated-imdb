How did you get the cinematic attitude in which the car collides with the back end of the semester? And then Roy sits up - great! Looks like the DVD is scheduled for May 2006 - time! See this on a big screen or movie revival in a theater if you want to fully capture the entire aspect ratio. My other favorites in this category are: Original Italian job with Michael Caine; Bullit with Steve McQueen; Live with the CSI guy in LA and die when he was young; French connection with Gene Hackman; Ronin with Robert Deniro; Vanishing Point with Barry Newman; Public Enemy back with Hackman - What are your favorites?
