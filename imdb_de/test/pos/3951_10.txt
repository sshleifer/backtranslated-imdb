It reaches the thoughts and feelings of everyone who drives them deep into the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world explored by memories and offbeat sound and score layers. The landscape develops its own personality and adapts to the inner geography of all three figures as their stories unfold. The clear emptiness of lost love, the fear of the unknown and then the transcendence of emptiness through the openness of this devastation. Three misguided souls struggle to find something absolute and positive in this negative space. The drama is captivating. James Franco and his co-stars deliver skillful performances. Naive schoolboy, suicidal blonde, embittered car thief - all meet unexpected twists. Together they create an explosive portrait of broken love - one that unintentionally disappears to heal in the midst of the hardest forms of adversity and illusion - the blindness of human emotions.
