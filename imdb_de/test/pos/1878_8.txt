a great movie for the sci-fi channel that far surpasses many of the efforts it has made so far. Bruce Campbell is in excellent shape as a potential investor involved in a bizarre experiment led by Professor Delirious, Stacey Keach, and his semi-spiritual aid, Ted Raimi. The movie is pure movie gold and it's great to see Keach and ram Bruce on the screen, and the fact that much of the film is based solely on Bruce's comic slapstick drama makes him weird and leaves ask me the question: why does the guy not get more scripts in order? Definitely worth a watch.
