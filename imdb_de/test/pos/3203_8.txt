The Killing Yard is a great movie, even if it is sometimes irregular. Morris Chestnut represents a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and imprisoned prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defender is nothing but genius. The emotions and raw reality portrayed in the "Flashback" scenes of this film have the ability to place the viewer right in the middle of the depicted events. I was not even born when the Attica uprising took place. However, through extensive research, I find that "The Killing Yard" does the whole story of the just judges. I would definitely recommend this film so that it can be viewed by all education or activist groups as a much needed learning tool.
