Witchery or Witchcraft, as well known in Europe, creatures where Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) wakes up from a nightmare involving a witch. Jane's mother and Father Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying, renovating and reopening an abandoned old hotel on an island about 80 km from Boston. Together with Jane and her little son Tommy (Michael Manchester), Rose & Freddie are planning to travel to the island with architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to see how much work they have to do and also meet with them Estate agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) & hire a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to bring them to the island. Once there, they enter the hotel and begin to inspect the property while Sam is killed on the boat and the boat is let loose to sail into the distance. They discover two unexpected guests in the form of a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) and his virgin fiancé Leslie (Leslie Cumming), who is researching a book that she writes about the cruel legends and superstitions around the notorious island and the hotel , As night draws before a raging storm, she isolates her from the mainland, while a mysterious "Lady in Black" (Hildegard Knef) keeps popping up, while the age-old evil living in the hotel makes new victims of demonic possessions, human sacrifices, and satanic Rites looking for ... <br /> <br /> The director of this American-Italian co-movie is a little bit mysterious, as the IMDb lists Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin, but there are rumors that Joe D'Amato has done the honor Um To be honest, despite its bad reputation, I found Witchery entertaining in such a bad way. The script attributed to Harry Spalding and Daniele Stroppa in the IMDb is also confusing, as the real thanks for the film itself are Daniel Davis. No matter who wrote the thing has done its decent job, please stop laughing. Basically it's a haunted house horror, but it adds some bloody deaths and a surreal feel to everything. The different character sets have sensible motives and did not annoy me as much as I thought, it's not very well drawn, it does not make much sense and the dialogue is not exactly top drawer stuff, but as a whole Witchery has me for Entertained for 95 minutes uncomplicated. It's reasonably cheerful, a little slow, but maybe there are many surreal, bizarre attacks and cruel deaths that will amuse you. Part of Witchery, which destroys some of its credibility, is this so-called storm. There is no storm in sight and the sea is probably calm enough to swim in it. Witchery's alleged "twist" end did not really work for me either. Watch the stupid look on Cumming's face in this last still image. The hotel offers a good isolated location and adds a sense of atmosphere to the film, which conveys the unmistakable undefinable "horror" feeling, and cheap horror. Technically, Witchery is not all that bad, it was obviously filmed on-site, so it looks good all over and even though it's not the height of movie finesse, overall production values ​​are a little better than expected. The violence is a typical Euro expert, a woman has his lips sewn and hung in a fireplace, so they can not scream while the others are lit, someone is crucified and then burned alive, skewered on a swordfish, stretch some veins A woman is raped by a man without lips. Witchery was filmed in English, so there is no synchronization as far as David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair are concerned in the same movie. What else can I say? Yes, ladies Hasselhoff takes off his shirt and for the guys Cummings pulls her out. Both Hasselhoff and Blair are a shit about this, but the little kid is very annoying and can not act at all. I'm sure most sensible moviegoers will not agree with my opinions, but I still like it and I'd like to see it again. Witchery is pretty fun and definitely worth watching if you're into "bad" movies or your films horror fan in general.
