Two college buddies - one a stern nerd, the other a rude slut - set out on a journey through the country. Along the way, they encounter a vicious vehicle that looks like an army tank in combination with a monster truck trying to roll its car. They avoid that, but they only annoy the mysterious and dangerous driver if one of them gets a leak in a top hatch. Later, they get a sexy hitchhiker who meddles in their life-threatening situation. MONSTER MAN is an extremely entertaining horror comedy that has both some exciting moments and some good bloody moments. The two main characters and their constant quarrels are fun to see on their own, and the ending takes a TCM-like turn, which is very well done. Absolutely worth a visit.
