Clayton Moore made his most recent official debut as Masked Man in director Lesley Selander's epic adventure, "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold," in which he played Jay Silverheels as the loyal Indian scout of Tonto. Selander was an old hand in the Western helm during his 40-year film and television years and has directed more than 100 Westerns. This fast-paced opera included a revisionist perspective on Native American portrayals, which had gradually gained prominence in Hollywood Oaters since 1950, after director Delmar Daves pioneered the Broken Arrow by James Stewart Western. Racial intolerance figures as the main theme in the screenplay by Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald. Schaefer and Freiwald were already well acquainted with the formula with 13 episodes of the television series "The Lone Ranger", but determined the commitment for this theatrical trip. Our Vigilante heroes save the Indians, who are murdered by white Hombres hooded for no apparent reason. The mystery of the identity of these assassins and the reason for their murder behavior is revealed early on, so you do not have to guess what's going on. <br /> <br /> Although the violence in this Selander saga seems tame Contemporary standards, the fact that the Lone Ranger kills a villain in a scene, rather than hurt him, and that a deceitful lady kills a double cruiser by he hurled a tomahawk, sinking in the back between his shoulder blades, was quite bold. The television series never got that far and when the Lone Ranger swung his six-rifle, he shot the gun out of the villain's fist instead of blowing it away. The other discrepancy is that the Indians lynch one of the robbers and torture him for information, but they are never charged with hijacking this henchman. Douglas Kennedy did not have the rogue statue of Lyle Bettger threatening the masked man in director Stuart Heisler's The Lone Ranger, but he can assert himself well enough as a cowardly criminal who kills one of his own followers when the rogue threatens his To reveal the name and identity of his cronies to a gang of vengeful Indians. <br /> <br /> "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" begins with a repeat of the masked protagonist's origins as an ambush in Texas Ranger and his transformation into the Lone Ranger with Tonto as a buddy. This two-minute refresher is a great way to start a serial character, giving everyone, including non-Lone Ranger fans, equal rights. The primary conspiracy against a group of ruthless white hoodies, not surprisingly called the Hooded Raiders, begins by killing Indians and stealing medallions worn around their necks. The lonely Ranger and Tonto arrive too late to intervene, but they find a baby nearby. With the baby and the dead Indian, they ride to a nearby Spanish mission, overseen by Padre Vincente Esteban (Ralph Moody of "The Outsider"), handing the child and the body to him. First, the padre of an Indian maiden, Paviva (Lisa Montell of "Gaby"), must assure that the masked man does not harm them and is her friend. Padre sends Tonto to the city to see the doctor. James Rolfe (Dean Fredericks of "Gun Fever") picks up, and Tonto immediately gets into trouble in the form of the sworn city law Sheriff Oscar Matthison (Charles Watts of "Giant"). ), which abhors Indians. Tonto tries to see the doctor treating prisoner at the sheriff, and Matthison's men begin to roust him as Rolfe intervenes and rides to the mission. Finally, Lone Ranger and Tonto Can Do It Conquer one of the Hooded Raiders, but an Indian Redbird (Maurice Jara from "Drum Beat") and his fellow humans kidnap the henchmen and bring him back to their village. They stick it out and shoot arrows at him to loosen his tongue. Chief Ross Brady and his cohort William (Lane Bradford of Devil's Canyon) ride into the village and Brady uses his Winchester to kill his trapped henchman. Little does Brady know that his henchman has been talking. The Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive not long after and reprimand Redbird for his perfidy. Redbird tells them what the man said before he died, and the Lone Ranger decides to take a disguise so he can learn more. He masquerades as a gentleman bounty hunter with a mustache and a southern accent. <br /> <br /> Despite the tight 83-minute run, "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" lacks neither excitement nor surprises. Selander stops the action at full gallop. The dialogue is more exponential than memorable, as Sch√§fer and Freiwald drive the plot more often than spring surprises, but there is a big surprise related to the good Indian theme. There is also a scene in which the Lone Ranger asserted his own creed on justice for all under the law when Supreme Court Supreme Court Judge Earl Warren had taken the seminal rulings of the Supreme Court that recognized the conditions of racial segregation and tempered. Civil rights, separation of church and state, and police detention in the United States. What distinguishes "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" from its predecessor is its epic scale, with a look back at the age of Spanish conquistadors, which contain a bit of sci-fi science fiction. In general, the stories of Lone Ranger were limited to the 19th century, without being in European history. No, the Lone Ranger was not the first movie dealing with Spanish conquerors. Robert D. Webb's "The Seven Cities of Gold" (1955) concerned the Spaniards searching for the homonymous places in the southwest, but in the west of Selander, Gordon Douglas suggested "The Gold of the Seven Saints" (1961) in front of the screen.
