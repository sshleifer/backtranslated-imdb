This seemed to me to be a lackluster movie that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not too much editing effort. It may be interesting for those who are familiar with Second World War submarines, but I recommend everyone else to be careful. Many of the scenes in this film were shallow and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story of the men who returned to work during a short vacation seems realistic enough, but there is no real tempo or tension in the story. I also had a difficult time understanding what the actors were saying, partly because of some strong English accents and maybe also because of inferior sound recording. I give a 55/100. Most people want to "steer" clearly.
