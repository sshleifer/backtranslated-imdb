I have always been a big fan of "Homicide: Life On The Street". When I heard that a reunification movie was coming up, I could not wait. <br /> <br /> Let me just say I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the strongest 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was great to see everyone again, but the biggest pleasure was to have Andre Braugher back, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss has always been the strongest part of a great show.
