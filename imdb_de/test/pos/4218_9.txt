The movie was surprisingly wonderful, especially considering the last sequel. The third was dark and half-interesting, but it was not nearly as funny or enjoyable as this one. It contains comedic lines about Martha Stuart, the anatomy of puppets and masturbation, and it was actually made during cruel and disturbing pictures. The movie was neither scary nor exciting and I'm sure it was not the intention of the director. It was fun because of the stupidity, Jennifer Tilly's exaggerated and sexy performance. The doll puppetry was handled so well, the movement of mouth, lips, tears in the eyes, knives in the chest and the costumes. The dolls were just wonderful and made the cruel deaths all the better, considering they were made by wonderful dolls. The new Chucky look was great and Tiffany was very cute. A few scenes in which Chucky embraced the man even made my father smile. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly good - very attractive and the special effects were cool. The end was so unexpected and the fact that they could do another is unlikely. It may not be as exciting as movies like Halloween H2O or Urban Legend, but it's definitely more fun !!!!
