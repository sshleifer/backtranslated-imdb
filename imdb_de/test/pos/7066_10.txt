"Meatballs" is an ode to the summer camp. Those of us who had to go to camp will see many scenes if we remember or wish they could have been. Bill Murray plays the experienced boy consultant, Tripper Harrison, who really runs the camp. He reminds us of the funny cool employee everyone loves. Young campers go after him and when he speaks to you, you feel like a family. This is one of Murray's best roles. He drives the movie with his one liners and ad libs. Chris Makepeace plays Rudy, the loner who is taken under Tripper's wing and breaks out of his shell. <br /> <br /> The rest of the campers and the staff of the film was also excellent. <br /> <br /> The overarching theme of the film is the underdog who must overcome obstacles to finally win. From Rudy to Spaz to the camp to gonorrhea itself, the underdogs of the movie are the stars. The movie has a heart. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun and weird, without being cruel or over the top, as some teenage movies are today. The actors look and act like real people. <br /> <br /> The comedy and the heart go so far that in the end, just like in the camp, you are sad to go. <br /> <br /> In my summer camp experience, we had lingerie with flagpoles, mysterious flesh, trying to catch a glimpse of the girls' booth, pulling the crazy stories with the hooks on the campfire and the sleeping people out of their cabins and to stick it elsewhere. But we also had a dedicated warehouse staff that made us be the best we could be. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the CIT over night, when they canoe across the lake and sing a silly song. The one line that bothers me every time is when Tripper announces bursts of light the evening before the parents' day and ends. "Tomorrow is Parenting Day and you have to look rested or Morty will be sent to the state prison."
