I really enjoyed this movie. It effectively combines humor, fantasy and a few moments of horror with a solid film production by Higuchinsky. Brilliant pictures and a very original story about spirals. My only complaint is that it had boring moments and was not as daring as it could have been. Nevertheless, I give here a solid 8 out of 10 points. The US should be aware of this and other good Japanese horror / fantasy movies that have recently hit the market and are available on Region 1 DVD. In fact, Asian cinema generally has some of the best films that have not been heard by American audiences because they are hard to find. I urge people to look for those treasures that are hard to find, but once you find them you will be glad.
