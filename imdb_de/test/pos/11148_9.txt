The film opens in a stuffy British men's club where gentlemen in leather armchairs smoke cigars. This is the world of Denistoun. A messenger delivers a small box, which he opens to find a pair of gold earrings. The side of the earrings is reminiscent of the time spent in the company of Gypsies. The rest of the movie is a flashback. <br /> <br /> Golden Earrings has long been my favorite and is probably the most romantic movie I know. Dietrich plays against her usual type. Here she is dark-haired, earthy and not in the least secretive. Instead of being a femme fatale, she is a tower of strength and is committed to using all her resources to help Denistoun survive and achieve her goal. To make sure that he is a really convincing gypsy, he pierces his ears and lets him wear the golden earrings of her dead lover. With his clothes and some fat, she transforms him from a strict British gentleman into a wild and sexy-looking man. <br /> <br /> When I grew up, I heard the song "Golden Earrings", which is sung in the movie. I think the melody is being humed a bit by Dietrich. / There is a story that Gypsies know to be true / When your love wears gold earrings / She is yours.
