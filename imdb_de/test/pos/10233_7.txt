If you're looking for an original horror movie, this might be right for you. It's weird and sometimes stupid, but it's just such a good-looking, good-sounding and original movie that never fails, except perhaps during the extravagant climax. "Nightbreed" is a must-have for horror fans or fans of Monster movie make-up. <br /> <br /> Boone (Craig Sheffer) has always dreamed of a city called Midian that is full of mutated creatures. In therapy, his psychiatrist is Dr. med. Decker (horror film David Cronenberg) has come to the conclusion that Boone is a murderer, giving him hallucinogenic pills and telling him to give himself over. After nearly getting killed, Boone lands in the hospital where he meets a mental patient who also knows about Midian and tells Boone where to go. Midian, buried in a graveyard, is inhabited by hideous creatures that Boone does not let in. After Boone escaped with only a nasty bite, he was shot dead by the police. Decker was guided to his place. But Boone is not dead. The bite lets him live and he goes to Midian. In the meantime, Boone's friend Lori (Anne Bobby) tries to find Boone and get to the bottom of it. As Dr. Decker also learns of this place, creates chaos. <br /> <br /> The plot seems long and complicated, but it's really not difficult to understand. The story makes the movie very interesting. The makeup effects are amazing. The creatures look unique and fantastic and make this movie a very appealing movie. To appeal to even more senses, we have a music by Danny Elfman, which is both lush and springy and fits the film like a glove. The footage in the film are also nicely decorated. The cinematography is sexy and the movie creates an atmosphere that is never broken. Even acting is good, with the biggest surprise being that director David Cronenberg does a great, threatening performance because of the man who for some reason wants to see Boone dead. It's strange that a horror movie is done so well. <br /> <br /> The problems with the movie ... Well, there are a few, but the positives outweigh the negatives. The script occasionally contains lame jokes to add some humor, but almost everyone falls flat. The mutated creatures look and are mostly well played, but sometimes it feels like they just make their fantastic makeup for the camera. The worst part of the movie should be the highlight. It takes so long and is just a constant mess. It's the part of the movie that moves from single characters and beautiful tight knits to fiery explosions from every direction and violence that happens on characters we do not know or care about. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is amazing to watch. It's a well-made horror movie, but even that said, it occasionally has a failure in character lines and a messy climax. Nonetheless, this is one that you should check out. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** from ****. 101 min. R for strong violence and language.
