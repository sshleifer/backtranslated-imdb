This is truly a documentation of love for a fascinating personality, her attitude to life and her extended family. The filmmakers spent three years bonding Sister Helen in their home and managed to capture so much wonderful material that you can not help but know that you know Sister Helen and her "boys". The house contains 21 restorative addicts, each with a story that is almost reminiscent of Sister Helen. The final scenes are particularly poignant and emotional. Sister Helen's story of marriage, addiction and loss reveals a very complex character whose hard-hearted love is always funny, touching and endearing. <br /> <br /> The film is an amazing way of telling its story in wonderful episodes of life sequences that evolve into a story that is almost as clear as if every scene were scanned by the best and been played. The honesty (and obvious dishonesty) of the "customers" is very involved when you learn about their fears and watch their efforts grow. <br /> <br /> You will be sister Helen, Robert, Moe or poor Ashish (spelling?).
