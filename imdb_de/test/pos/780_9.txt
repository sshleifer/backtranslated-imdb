I can not argue with a previous comment that "Driving Lessons" is more than a little bit, but a man's accusation is the confirmation of another, I suppose. In my book this film succeeds with pure charm, no small achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> I just wish the story would be a little less conventional considering the amount of acting talent, as the end of the storyline seems to be more of a backdrop for character interaction anyway. Julie Walters' Lady Evie is a towering actress. Although Evie has not had a permanent job for years, it is unclear when she last visited reality (when Edina is first visited by "AbFab" at age 65, she is even forced to deal with her kitsch factor) ). Some may find it annoying, but I think that's the point to emphasize how much she pushes the reserved Ben's (Rupert Grint) buttons to push him out of his shell. Ben is also isolated from reality and lives his whole life under the thumb of his overly dependent mother, who succeeds in letting Laura Linney breathe life, even though she is a fairly one-dimensional figure (old overbearing religious mother). I was pretty impressed with Rupert Grint, who had done a very honest and credible job (not to mention love). I can not imagine many young actors I can say that for. <BR /> <br /> The heart of the movie is what happens when the worlds of Ben and Evie collide. Ben is understandably tentative, but also intrigued, because Evie is essentially the exact opposite of everything he has ever known. The combination of Evie's persistence and Ben's helpful nature creates a real sweetness between them that leads to an unlikely road trip that gives Ben the first sense of independence. <br /> <br /> The sound is easily short melodramatic pieces even for a few things, but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance, a merit of the lead actor. All in all, I would say that "Driving Lessons" should not disappoint if you sit back and let yourself be enchanted by beautiful performances. If "cute" is not included in your film vocabulary, it's best to stay away from it. <br /> <br /> Another little note: The soundtrack features the music of Sufjan Stevens prominently, a nice touch.
