Let me first say that this film is not for everyone. It has a very strange theme. A spinner who lives alone and leads a boring life, discovers a young man in a park across from her townhouse. She notices that he is sitting outside in the rain and invites him to dry and warm up. The man does not speak and the woman assumes that he is deaf. Nevertheless, she is fascinated by him and sexually interested in him. He finds her strange and continues his silence, though later we find out that he is not dumb at all and that he tells his sister everything that happens between him and the woman. I will not reveal the rest of the conspiracy. If you can find this movie, look at it. You can not avert your eyes. What makes it so interesting? Well, it is absolutely unique. I've never seen anything like it and it's very uncomfortable to see these two together. Especially if you find out what this boring, boring, obsessive spinner is capable of. You will not forget it so soon.
