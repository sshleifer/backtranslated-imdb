One of the other reviewers has mentioned that you will love watching an episode of 1 Oz. You're right, because that's exactly what happened to me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that impressed me about Oz was their brutality and the intrepid scenes of violence that came out of the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint-hearted or timid. This show does not hit anything in terms of drugs, sex or violence. It's hardcore, in the classic use of the word. <br /> <br /> It's called OZ because that's the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses primarily on Emerald City, an experimental part of the prison where all cells have glass fronts and are inward facing. So privacy is not on the agenda. Em City is home to many .. Americans, Muslims, Gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish, and more ... that's where brawling, death-wreaking, dodgy business, and dodgy agreements are never far away. <br /> <br /> I would say that the main attraction of the show is that it goes where other shows would not dare. Forget beautiful pictures painted for a normal audience, forget the charm, forget the romance ... OZ is not going away. The first episode I've ever seen seemed so evil that it was unreal. I could not say that I was ready for it. But when I saw more, I developed a taste for Oz and got used to the high level of graphics power. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards sold for nickel, inmates who kill on command and get away with it, middle-class middle-class prisoners who become prison-thugs for their lack of street skills, or jail experience) If you watch Oz, you can feel comfortable with the uncomfortable looking. That's when you can get in touch with your dark side.
