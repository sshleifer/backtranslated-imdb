Man, I had my doubts. I love Kathy Bates, but I thought how good that can be, I had never heard of this thing ...! You know, it was one of those things, we gave it "20 minutes and we turn it off when it's annoying" and we were locked up from the start. This is a very winning, funny movie. It's quirky, you know? I mean, you have a lounge singer, a murderer (and a credible one), you have a farce, then Kathy Bates in all her acting glory, Rupert Everett is finally reaching for his real potential, Dan Ackroyd, and a dwarf who that will make you laugh I tell you, you will laugh / you will cry. <br /> <br /> Maybe I had a weird week, but I think this movie is on the level of Fried Green Tomatoes. If you do not like this movie, you may not like it, but I think it was a great movie. I went out and bought the DVD.
