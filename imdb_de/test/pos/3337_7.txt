Excellent entry into the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good direction for some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the river constant, and good acting. George Sanders is polite and funny. Jonathan Hale is just Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a gangster who is just walking (and drinking milk) because he can not stand the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. The story begins with an ocean liner to the US, where the saint meets but can not connect to Wendie Barrie. Finally, she succumbs to the charm of the saint, but in the end breaks his heart. The saint helps inspector Fernack to erase his name from a frame. A few bodies fall on the way. Good entertainment and above average for this type of movie. Look at it.
