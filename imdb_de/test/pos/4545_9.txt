Well, of course the critics hated it. This is not a movie intended for the great critical success. But the fact is that it is really good. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the Chris Farley brand of physical comedy or the overly dry joke of David Spade, you will not like it. But for the rest of us, the movie has a lot of funny, and in this respect, quotable sequences, and the plot is not half as stupid as "Black Sheep." The parts that are not meant for humor are really well done, not what you'd expect from a movie of this kind, and acting is really pretty good. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is without a doubt Chris Farley's best movie. I enter an A and suggest that you give it a view.
