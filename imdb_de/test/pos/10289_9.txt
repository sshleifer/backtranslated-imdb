This is a clever story about relationships and a representation of three main categories of players in the relationship game: Playboys (Max), manipulative women (Alice), and the fools who may be in love (Lisa, Muriel, and Lucien). <br /> Max and Alice are very unlikely and despicable characters, but always in control of the game and leaving their partners in the dark. But as the endlessly discussed ending says, as veteran players like Max and Alice, they would be happy if they thought it was right, as if the game had just been announced as over and each one of them would be no less interested in his own life and play another Play with other anonymous persons when another opportunity presented itself. Lisa, Muriel, and Lucien were perhaps the ones who felt they were investing something real in a relationship, only that they could not see that they were the bait in the game and the ultimate losers (as far as we were shown ... who know if they are any advanced players in their worlds that are not shown on screen. <br /> <br /> This is a very fast paced, carefully executed and seductively funny story with a tantalizing execution It also deserves a deeper reflection: How much is really in a relationship game?
