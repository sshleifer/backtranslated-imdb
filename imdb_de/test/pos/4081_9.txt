As a former sales secretary, I was really interested in this film: I was personally involved in a blind search when I left Kingston Jamaica, where a person was found. We managed to get him ashore because we were within territorial limits. On another ship I had been found on the Stowaway and we could not land him anywhere because of passport / nationality issues. In fact, he stayed for almost a year as a "volunteer" crew member and worked for his keep. Africa is notorious for stowaways. At the beginning of the film, there is a great scene as the bulk carrier enters the African port: its size is all dwarfs. The crew lands ashore for a bit of traffic and intoxication. So far normal. The drama begins when the blind passengers invade the huge caverns of the ship. Joss Ackland is brilliant as a captain with a drinking problem, which is brought into shape by his Nemesis Suchet as the company's representative on board. The blind search is classic, but we had no weapons. I ask about the use of weapons in this movie. This ship seemed to have a huge armory. In my experience, rifles at sea are severely restricted due to customs regulations. Even carrying a dog on board was unusual. Anti-rabies legislation, especially in Europe, severely restricts the transport of animals. In any case, Pertwee is brilliant as a fierce comrade. The horror that follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable: the dark metallic background of the ships and the feeling that there is no place to hide contribute to the drama. Some of the freighters are not involved in the murder and those involved. Gradually, they are drawn into a world of violence from which there is no escape. The chase by the ship, especially the engine room scenes, are "edge on the seat": the feeling of extreme claustrophobia is too great. The feeling that metal invades and death is just a rifle barrel. The movie is brutal: my girlfriend had to stop seeing him during the shoot and beat the scenes. As this continues, Suchet gets drunk in his well-equipped cabin, unaware of the Chaos 3 decks below. It is a tense film that is partly flawed, but the real message is that we can all be so involved in violence. Slow and safe. Think of the train drivers who brought the Jews to Auschwitz, the employees who made the timetable. I always remember someone who had visited the Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war, and he said that one of the S.S. Guards had put a bird table in front of the camp crematorium. This movie is like this: ordinary people are suddenly in a world of unstoppable violence!
