The Twins Effect - Chinese Action / Comedy - (Charlene Choi, Gillian Chung) <br /> <br /> This vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for the fact that I was thoroughly entertained throughout the movie. First, the characters are memorable and contribute to a variety of classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are by nature cute, charismatic and humorous. This movie was my first encounter with them, and all I wanted to do was grab through my TV screen and give them a REALLY GREAT HUG. The remaining cast was good in its supporting roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mok, The Duke, Josie Ho, Edison Chen, Anthony Wong and the Vampire Evil (one of whom is incredibly familiar to Will Ferrell). Even the hideous disgust Cheng was good in this case. Of course, good characters are important because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences. <br /> <br /> When talking about action, this movie has a lot of it. More importantly, combat choreography focuses on quality. One aspect that has helped is the weapon of the protagonists. a sword with a retractable rope with spear end. This weapon in and of itself opened a variety of movements that would otherwise have been impossible. In particular, Josie Ho and Gillian Chung perform with these devices from evil air maneuvers. <br /> <br /> In addition, the swordplay is excellent and is highlighted by two great sword fights. one during the opening of the train station and the other in the church final. In fact, the blade movement maneuvers shown in this film are very embarrassing to other highly overrated fan favorites, and I'm really sorry for those citing the horribly choreographed garb seen in Ashes of Time, Storm Riders, or A Man Called's hero with the well-planned , precisely executed sequences from The Twins Effect. It is not even close. I can not understand why this movie gets so much criticism. I am sure that hardened apologists for the "Golden Age" in Hong Kong will hate this, as they do not fit into their narrow vision of Hong Kong's activities. We should learn from the downfall of John Woo - a trick pony who has never learned to reinvent himself. We do not need another clone. We need something else. The Twins effect is a good example. <br /> <br /> This movie was so good that it really disappointed me because I was disappointed in other Chinese films with the same actors and actresses. This is especially true for Ekin Cheng, whose other films almost always suck. and yes, this includes the obscenely overvalued and exploitative Wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even the twins were never able to achieve the value of this film when both were leading actresses in a film, though they managed to make some good films when either one or the other plays the lead role (e .g Beyond Our Ken, Good Times Times, House of Fury, or if one or both are in supportive roles (eg, Color of Truth, New Police History, Just a Look). The Twins Effect 2 should be a direct sequel rather than a family fantasy. I still long to see Charlene and Gillian together and kick butt in another movie, but the fact that The Twins Effect hits all cylinders optimizes their charisma and avoids relegation to anger (as in Protégé de la Rose Noire) All in all, this movie has everything you need to be entertained. And may I remind the reader that's exactly how it is? ENTERTAINMENT ?? That judges the size of a film, more than artistically dramatic elements or meaningless awards from established academies by critics who usually have no idea what they're talking about. In the end, the Twins effect is a CLASSIC effect not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Rating = 5/5 Stars <br /> <br /> PS ?? The Hollywood executives decided to slaughter this film when it was released in the US by renaming it "The Vampire Effect" and cutting out 20 minutes of footage, including portions of the action scenes. However, the final battle of the US version has a better soundtrack than the original version. So I bought both versions so I can first watch the original up to the 1:20 mark and then change shots to see the final fight on the US version.
