I absolutely loved this movie! It's my favorite number one. Although there were some flaws (which movie has no flaws?), This film was very well written, directed and produced. The characters in this movie are very real and believable. They let all the characters fit into a specific role. I think the most obvious thing about "Here On Earth" was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations that were introduced to the movie. It's not one of those movies that seems to have nothing to do with anything, because in situations where everyone is or was. I am only 18 years old and can even refer to it. It was the heart that warmed and contracted at the same time. "Here On Earth" will make you laugh, cry and sometimes angry. I give this film an excellent rating and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!
