As long as you do not mind paying a little more attention than you would normally do for other films, this is one of the best "thrillers" you'll ever see. The film is an incident that could occur in real life; Nothing really seems to be fictional. It also shows how people could react in real life. <br /> <br /> In fact, it does it so well that it looks like real life. Combine that with the lack of a soundtrack, and you have almost the best movie you've ever seen. Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are particularly good at this masterpiece of the late seventies, which at the end provokes concern and sincere pity at its end. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes thriller.
