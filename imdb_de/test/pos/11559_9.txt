I would like to know if anyone knows how to get a copy of the film "This is the way of the world". It's been about 30 years since I saw this movie, and I'd like to see it again. Earth Wind & Fire transcend the nation with their inspiring music and themes. It was unfortunate that this group did not replace itself like their colleagues in the early 1970s. As mentioned earlier, in the United States there were racial tensions that prohibited balancing the African-American music groups. It's nice to see Earth Wind & Fire continue their success. I want to add this movie to my collection. Please help me if possible. Thank you for your attention. Milton Shaw
