People with a dislike of blood may find it hard to see some scenes, but The Thing is far from being just a horror classic. The fact that the extraordinary special effects are facing most modern CGI is only a small part of the reason why this film is rightly considered a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in camera work and editing, excellently scanned and played, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tension and paranoia that has remained consistent (with countless visits), an excellent soundtrack and open to multiple readings and analogy just not enough superlatives to meet this movie. Absolutely indispensable consideration.
