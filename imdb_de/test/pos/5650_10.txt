Fires on the Plain (1959) **** <br /> <br /> You do not see movies like this anymore. 'Fires on the Plain' is an incredible depiction of the life of the soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army. Kon Ichikawa's masterpiece follows Tamura, a tuberculosis soldier who wanders through the Philippine countryside in the last year of the war. He is sent to the hospital by his commander, only to refuse treatment, and he is sent back. His CO tells him to go back, and if they refuse him again, his last order is to kill himself with his grenade. He is again denied, but meets a group of squatters who sit in front of the hospital. The next day they are shot at by American troops, and Tamura flees, decides not to kill himself, and from there he wanders from place to place, trying to get to Palompon. He discovers that some men have eaten human flesh to survive while others exchange as much tobacco as possible for whatever they can get back, devastation with a touch of madness. Everyone we see is skin and bones, covered with dirt and torn and ragged rags. Ichikawa uses his camera to take some beautiful shots of the ruined landscape and Japanese soldiers running through them. Kon Ichikawa was famous in Japan for his many comedies and satires, and there are moments in Fires on the Plain that are wickedly funny. Take, for example, a view of a seemingly dead man lying face down in a pool of water. a soldier leaves, but asks aloud if they will end up like this, whereupon the man lifts his head out of the water and answers, "What was that?" and then his face falls deeper into the puddle than before. Another funny sequence is that a man finds a pair of boots along the trail. He takes the boots and replaces them with his old ones. Another man comes by and sees the pair of boots and changes to his old boots. The scene continues until Tamura finally finds the changing place and examines the boots without a sole. He looks carefully at his and those on the ground and decides that they are both broken, he takes off his own and walks barefoot. The movie is full of incredible scenes, one after the other. Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ichikawa also knew how to paint beautiful and impressive pictures with his camera. There are many stunning shots of men in barren, empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on the broken earth. There is another incredible scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers try to cross a Yanks-monitored road in the middle of the night, crawling on their hands and knees while the camera is watching over them from above. <br /> <br /> The film takes its name from the smoke columns rising from fires in the levels of the entire movie. They represent something more ordinary for the life of the soldiers; The lives of Japanese farmers who burned at home burned corn husks. Their hopes for normal life, however, are in hostile hands. <br /> <br /> The film caused a stir with its graphic content. There is a lot of emphasis on the horror of war, not only in the enemy, but also in your ranks and in yours. Kon Ichikawa's Fires on the Plains is an incredibly authentic and moving and somewhat disturbing portrait of the horror suffered by men in the lower ranks of the imperial army. Clark Eastwood's letters from Iwo Jima, though a very good film, do not come close to the horror of the Fires on the Plain war. (Eastwood was undoubtedly influenced by the film, claiming to be such a classic Japanese movie fan.) Many war movies show that war through the eyes of the winners is hell. Fires on the Plain shows that the war is even more hellish if you finally lose yourself. <br /> <br /> 4/4
