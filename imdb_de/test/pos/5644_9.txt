I released this movie a week after the death of Ichikawa Kon. I think if there's a way to mark the death of a great director, it's to bring him a glass of wine while watching one of his best films. Ichikawa had one of the best careers in Japanese film, but since he never had a distinctive style or theme, he often seems compared to his close contemporaries like Ozu and Kurosawa (he was a little younger than her, but not much) ). He is one of those directors who oppose author's theories. Probably his wife (who wrote the script for this and many others of his films) was just as responsible for the quality of the films as he was. But at his best, he was as good as any Japanese filmmaker at the time. In particular, he had great technical skills, so that he could tell complex stories in an understandable way. But in terms of the subject, this film could hardly be easier - war is hell. No, that's really hell. <br /> <br /> Fire on the plane does not follow the normal rules of the war genre. There is no real beginning - we start as the wretched Tamura who is regularly private (though he implies that he is more thoughtful and educated than most others) - at one level he is shown to understand English, but he works on The others ask him how he knows it) is ordered to the hospital because his unit is already in terrible condition. The soldiers are defeated and starving. They are no longer an army, just a flea pack of refugees - hunted by the locals and quite ignored by the Americans, who have bigger fish to roast. Hunger and despair drive the soldiers to the brink of madness and beyond madness. <br /> <br /> In the typical Ichikawa style, it's not all grim - it's oddly funny in parts (of course, very dark humor). <Br /> <br /> The highlights of this film for me are the outstanding achievements of the leads and the vibrant photography. The characters in their whole humanity, but also their complete loss of humanity, are all too credible. This is the rare movie - one that can not be deleted from your head, even if you want to forget it.
