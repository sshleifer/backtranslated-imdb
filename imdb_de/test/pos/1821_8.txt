I really liked this movie, it reminds me of my high school days. The soundtrack is great. I'm a big fan of Nic Cage and this is my favorite movie he's in. I love the story, it's a total love story, against the things that are unlikely. I think anyone who graduated in the early 1980s (1980-1984) should see the movie. It brought me total memories of high school.
