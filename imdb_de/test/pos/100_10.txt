The most beautiful short film I have ever seen. Some commentators suspect that it may have been extended due to the density of evidence it provides. There is irony in this comment and little merit. The acting lies entirely with Noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly. I would have preferred that the narrator would be less "recognizable", but the lent gravitas is perfect. This is an abbreviation for people who read, for those whose "bar" is set high, and for those who realize that life in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can fake opposing and bitter defenders of beauty. A nice short film. FWIW: I was happy about the Picasso reference, as I once thought Picasso was just an art whore with little talent. I suppose most people - until the day I saw some drawings he made at the age of 12 years. Picasso was a fine draftsman at this age and a brilliant artist, as many artists will ever be in life. I immediately understood why he had to do the art he became known for.
