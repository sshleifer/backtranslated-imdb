Clouzot followed Le Corbeau, where no one knew who wrote the poison, and so everyone was suspected, along with another masterpiece, the Quai des Orfevres, four years later, in which we know from the beginning (or think we do) , Louis Jouvet does not appear for forty minutes and by then Clouzot has built up a rich milieu of music hall, music publishers, etc., and a fine cast of colorful characters. Angela Lansbury's doppelganger (Lansbury appeared the same year in Woman of Paris) Suzy Delair scores as the Chanteuse, whose desire to improve her fate, inspires the jealousy of her husband / companion Bernard Blier, who leads her home to an old Letch To find him is already dead From here things are seriously wrong, his car is stolen before he leaves the grounds, so his pre-arranged alibi comes out the window, while his wife, who is unknown to him, the murder of the Neighbors of the photographer, a love lover in love, confess you who volunteers to return to the scene and pick up Delair's scarf. As long as she's there, she wipes her impressions of the murder weapon thoughtfully, a champagne bottle. At this point, the investigator Jouvet is involved, and from then on it's about keeping the plates in the air. Clouzot's production was relatively low, but practically everything was, as Spencer Tracey said, in another context, "cherce", still to come with Le Salaire de peur and Les Diaboliques. In short, this is a must for French cinema fans.
