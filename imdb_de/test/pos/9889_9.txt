This movie is funny, bright and enlightening. Although history might work well with just about every ethnic group, the inherent Judaism adds an extra meaning to the characters of the splendor of wonderful dialogues. The plot had so many social issues that it would be worth seeing for that reason. - but the true treasure lay in the warm laughter that spread in the appreciative audience. The mix of complex characters, with their different strengths and weaknesses, plays their role with all the pathos and humor that is expected from the Shakespearean drama that seems to parody their lives. This is a movie about the family; - about the often fragile, sometimes invisible connection of different personalities and lifestyles, first among siblings and parents and inevitably among the larger family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film have given the film a tempo and a development that fascinate the audience until the final scene. As always, Peter Falk is amazing in his role as family patriarch Morris Applebaum. Among the strong performances of a good cast is a surprise guest. Do not miss this movie!
