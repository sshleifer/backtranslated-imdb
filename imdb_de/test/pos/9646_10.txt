I felt compelled to provide feedback on the film I had rented from Blockbuster. This movie has it all - comedy, drama, crime, suspense and "realism". <br /> <br /> This movie also had a lot of action with just the right humor! I will definitely see it again! There were some funny parts as well as action-packed dramas. I like movies that make you wonder what's going to happen next. <br /> <br /> Travis Milloy, the writer / director, should make more films !!! In my opinion, this movie was great! I'm looking forward to his next! Travis Milloy has a true talent as a writer and director.
