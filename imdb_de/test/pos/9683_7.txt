Despite the obvious structural resemblance to The Simpsons - loud fat father, housewife, 3 children, a pet, a typical suburban home, Family Guy actually faces the Simpsons in terms of function and style. His eager dedication (and sometimes too much) of cutting baits has been the main stay since the first season. While some hit the nail on the head (The Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito in the fifth season are snappishly funny), others are less successful and seem to introduce themselves. And they can be annoying, especially if they do not push the plot forward. (The Jesus bits are utterly unhappy and offensive) <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin lends itself to pure comedy gold, so Chris and Meg can only fulfill the obligatory youth role in their typical dysfunctional Family. <br /> <br /> However, the feature film Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story MINDNUMBINGLY is awful. Luckily, it went straight to DVD. <br /> <br /> Contrary to lengthy comparisons with the multi-year Simpsons, Seth Macfarlane's approach to Family Guy is actually very different - it's much more politically incorrect and, surprisingly, much more audacious. <br /> <br /> The creator of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi, criticized Family Guy for having "extremely low" graphics standards from the cartoonist's point of view. I do not think it looks so bad, the details and accuracy of some parodies are quite successful. <br /> <br /> All in all a great series that is fried with a big big bowl of french fries, ranch sauce and ass jokes.
