(May contain Verderber) I am disappointed with the criticism this film receives. It is certainly not perfect, but it is much better than it is granted. Acting and photography are excellent. Some of the music numbers are great. including the track number "Where do I go?", "Easy to be hard" and "Black Boys / White Boys". Although I have not musically seen the stage, I think that this tarnishes the judgment of many people. This is not the musical you see in the cinemas. Do not try to compare them. The theatrical musical might have been sensational, but it would never have had the same effect on the film, so an action had to be added. And the added end is just incredible. In the film, I felt that I had actually seen something important, unlike most of today's films, which satisfy only one level.
