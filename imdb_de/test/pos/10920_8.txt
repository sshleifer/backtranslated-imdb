In & Out is a comedy with a simple premise. It succeeds admirably in the mission to be funny and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The comedy in this film ranges from ridiculous to sublime, physical comedy alongside dry humor, with a cute veteran of Bob Newhart. Kevin Kline is expected to be in excellent shape in this film, alongside Tom Selleck, who does not match his expected "square chin" man-man. Mr. Selleck plays his humor well and shows a good sense of comedy timing. The cast makes this movie successful. <br /> <br /> Not all homosexual-themed movies are designed to promote an eerie, hidden, liberal Hollywood agenda. In fact, this movie was just for entertaining, if any part of this movie makes the viewer think, then it was a byproduct of the well-performed work of a great cast of professionals. I was often winking and laughing at the right moments. A solid "B."
