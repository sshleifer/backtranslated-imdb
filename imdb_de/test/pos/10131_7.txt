Can a mentally handicapped black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a South Carolina town? The answer seems to be that despite his handicap, James Kennedy understood far more than what he was respected and became a fixture in the sports scene. Also, the film says how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if we just have the patience Coach Jones showed the young man because of his own guilt in his heart. <br /> <br /> "Radio", directed by Michael Tolllin, is a formal film inspired by a true story, but the film is not an absolute failure because the director's stagings were inspired by his wonderful cast. Coach Jones is instrumental in attracting the young man named Radio because of his passion. Gathering them in sports eliminates a passion he finds in this backward man who only had hard blows in his young life comes from poor backgrounds and lives with his mother, who protects him and questions the intentions of the trainer.The radio is considered by the schoolchildren as a mascot, and only then does his sunny disposition gain the acceptance of all, because he is a good person, who is in The film owes much to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr., who as coaches and radio are a great couple Mr. Harris, one of the greatest actors of our time, never gets bored with anything he graces with his presence. He gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the opportunity to compensate for something that bothers him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr. also shows the mentally handicapped young man at his best. <br /> <br /> The side occupation is outstanding. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, performs interesting work as the mother of the radio. Alfre Woodard, another good actress, plays the high school principle in style. Debra Winger has only a few scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> "Radio" is sentimental, but it warms up every heart, because it shows how some people in our society are inclined, and they know nothing and how quickly we can judge them. Michael Tollin brings many ideas into the right perspective for us.
