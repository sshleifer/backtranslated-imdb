For the first time I saw this movie on a flight between Guangzhou, China and Los Angeles. It was a real shout and made the journey happen with less discomfort than the normal 10-hour flight. I tried to find a copy of it without success until I found a copy for sale on eBay. Now that I have seen it twice, I recommend it as a good conversation. My only real criticism is that the choice of English translation words for subtitles is irrelevant even by normal standards. In addition, the subtitling is too small, it fits into the film too often and often travels too fast to read it well.
