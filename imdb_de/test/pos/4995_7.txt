I think the consensus is pretty unanimous on this new TV miniseries: It's okay, but a long way from "Lonesome Dove." It is simply compared to the latter, because this is a prequel to this famous story. <br /> <br /> "Commanche Moon" is definitely worth watching for any western lover. Just do not expect it to be as intense as "Lonesome Dove". Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play are not as strong as Duvall and Jones portrayed the same two boys. Some say it's unfair to criticize this movie for comparison, but you have to compare it - it's the story of the two leading Texas Ranger characters: Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae. <br /> <br /> The main difference was that this prequel is at times much slower and more relational (the two Rangers and their wives). But that did not bother me, because the two main women were pretty ladies and generally sympathetic and friendly people. They were played well by Linda Cardelini ("Clara Forsythe") and Elizabeth Banks ("Maggie"). They helped to make this long film tasty. If you've seen pictures of women in the Old West, none of them looked half as pretty as Cardelini and Banks. They were a pleasure for these male eyes. Maggie's son "Newt" was also a wonderful kid - the boy all parents wanted. <br /> <br /> The most interesting character, I thought, turned out to be "Inish Scull", played by Val Kilmer Like in the western movie "Tombstone" Kilmer nearly steals the show from the leads. "Scull" is really an original, if I have ever seen one: a strange guy. <br /> <br /> Actually, all supportive actors have done a good job here, from Keith Robinson's "Deets" to Wes Studi as "Buffalo Hump." I always find Studi fascinating, no matter what role he plays. I wish he had played a bigger role in this miniseries. <br /> <br /> One thing this movie has in common with "Lonesome Dove" and other good westerns: landscape and photography. It's just beautiful sometimes and it's a pleasure to see it. We also have an outstanding director of this film: Simon Wincer, who was director of "Lonesome Dove," and another outstanding western TV channel, "Crossfire Trail." He also shot two of my favorite films, both filmed in his native Australia: "Phar Lap" and "Quigley Down Under." Unfortunately, although I liked that, "Commanche Moon" is not as good as the above mentioned movies. Nevertheless, I have looked at all this and I'm sorry that it came to an end, if that makes sense. I wanted to see Woodrow and Gus again, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. <br /> <br /> Note: This is 360 minutes on the front page. That must have included the TV commercial. The DVD version with two CDs had about 4 hours and 40 minutes.
