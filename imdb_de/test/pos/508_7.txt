"Blade" would be an extremely above-average comic action, vampire hunter action / horror, if not two minor bugs. # 1 I've loved seeing anything but invincible Blade / Snipes cutting and dicing, but the whole "Yes!" Fist / Blow was literally a flop. # 2 Bad, do not do that awful, CGI ?? even for 1998 standards. This is mainly the case in the last third, but some are scattered everywhere. Okay, despite these minor violations, I really liked this movie. All the actors did a suburb job, and the fact that this looks like another "Matrix" citation is hilarious, considering that this was a year earlier. Maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade'. In any case, it's a movie for several genre geniuses: comic freaks, action fanatics, and horror / vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half-man / half-vampire or "day-walker" and his consummation, Whisler (a la "Batman and Alfred") fighting against the undead, who seem to be almost no humans. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade is more of an antihero), our Ninja / Vamp sword rescues a newly infected (random) blood specialist / physician. Meanwhile, trouble among the vampires brews (you guessed it) the highest power and somehow needs Blade to gain it. It is not the most original concept to read what I have just written, but it is still very enjoyable. You will want to see the success of Blade, you will root it in spite of its imperfections and behaviors. And you will know what's coming, as this is the typical 1-2-3 act of a comic book introduction. Watch it anyway, without wanting to go too deep. How Vampire SPF-1000 "sunscreen"? "Really?" What about the scalp? Would not that burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Okay, I'm going too deep. Sit back and enjoy the techno-charged driving pleasure.
