That must be my favorite movie. The script is sharp and is played to the limit by an excellent Miller and the fantastic Carlisle! Sharp joke, excellent narrative and no Hollywood polishing; a totally immersive movie that will get you excited for the bad guys! Stott stands out as a hideous opportunity again, while Liv Tyler surpasses her other, lighter feat than exciting Rebecca! The soundtrack may not be familiar to you, but anyone who has ever seen Top Gear, seen football, or seen a TV action sequence is probably familiar with it, especially because of Craig Armstrong's "Escape" who gave it to him never have to allow it to work again! The soundtrack on the first piece may seem out of place in a costume drama / action / comedy game, but watching it again shows it's perfectly at home when it comes to giving the drama the drama this movie is that he is not shown enough on TV! Where is it? Really excellent, sharp and stylish - you will not regret it - over and over again! (ends to turn on the DVD player!)
