Seeing the debut film by John Cassavetes is a strange experience, even if you've seen improvisational films before. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is the roughness. It is obvious that some of the characters misrepresent their lines. But then you step back from the situation as you sink deeper into the intimate exchange of these people, wondering, "Am I ever stumbling over my words?" The answer is of course safe, we all do. It is unfortunate that most gaffs appear early in the picture in this respect, because you are so deeply immersed after about twenty minutes that you would not know if a bomb dropped behind you /> The next thing you notice. .. or maybe you notice it hours or days after the end of the movie, is that you've never seen a material action, but you never leave the themes and the poetry of dialogue and characters. In fact, the treatment of the role that race plays in the daily lives of these characters is always there, but it is so short-lived that even they are unaware of how they share their opinions about themselves, their self-esteem, their perceived status , or the fate of their relationships. <br /> <br /> The title is appropriate because you get a full spectrum of blacks, whites and grays ... and not just in the skin pigmentation of the characters. Leila Goldoni (really remarkable here) is African American / Caucasian, her two brothers are white and dark African American. The irony is that they exist in the undoubtedly "hippest" most tolerant atmosphere of the time ... in upper East-West Manhattan, and there are still conflicts in and around them. <br /> <br /> I do not think I have ever seen a movie with such subtle technique or technique. It's almost like taking in a really great piece of gallery art and then just nodding in bliss, remembering the pictures it evoked days later. <br /> <br /> Great mastering and extras on the Criterion disc. The first truly experimental independent film ever made.
