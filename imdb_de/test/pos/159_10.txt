If you love Chan-Wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic and artistic, with a very grim humor. THIRST is clearly park style, and I've loved every second of it, from cinematography (each shot is great and creative) to the story that blends Shakespeare's tragedy, murderous love, gothic horror, and multi-layered character drama. The characters are complex and there are many moral ambiguities to be avoided. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy. The direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, there are too many subtleties to attract attention at first glance. Chan-wook Park is an intelligent, courageous and always surprising filmmaker. It's unpredictable - scenes turn from brutal and heartbreaking to laughing, weird moments. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE than to SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE so far exaggerated and funny. But like LADY VENGEANCE, it's incredibly rich, thought-provoking and rewarding. <br /> <br /> If you like to tell vampire stories (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or are a fan of Chan-wook Park, you will see THIRST should be obvious. Easily one of the best films of the year 2009.
