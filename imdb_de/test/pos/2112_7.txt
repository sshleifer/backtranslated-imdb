I have already seen Grand Champion at least twice. I enjoyed the story of the movie, the characters and the actors were not bad. It's refreshing to see a G rated movie. This is a movie to feel good. The story is mostly from the children's point of view. The interactions between the children and the adults make the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family movie. If you liked the little crooks, you will probably enjoy this. I saw this movie over cable. Either at Encore or Showtime family. This is not a movie I would have seen in the theater. But I'm just going to the theater to see the effects of the big screen. Therefore, most comedies, romantic films or dramas do not go on big screen. Bring your kids together, popcorn and enjoy it!
