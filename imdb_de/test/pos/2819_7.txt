------ spoiler ----- spoiler ----- spoiler -------- just a few small <br /> <br /> I have seen this on Satilite channel and the first one 30 missed min of movie, will keep this comment short and informative. <br /> <br /> The movie basically consists of 5 characters. Acting is very bad for some characters. 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people, but it fails and the 3 abduct the 2. This is one of the types of films in which the scriptwriters are thoughtful or philosophical, mysterious and ... point; But do it with their own personal lack of thinking that they are terribly short-circuited. Like one of the prisoners, who is supposed to be a kind of psychology nerd, the part looks but his tongue can not speak it. The authors believe that if the nerd is amateurish - unconscious - I believe - a set of 8 letters - the onlookers will be ignorant enough to believe it. I wish I could set an example, but I can not remember it - just as it was said. The end was bad, too. But the one female prisoner played her role as an old and relatively wise lady, though she, like the rest, had many clich√©s. So why would I give this movie 7 stars if I thought it all? Quite simply, I give LISA KELLER the entire seven stars - a sexy one $$ Momma. She is good lol. I'm an esteemed beauty, and that's what she is. But do not mess with me because I'm not a pervert and this movie is NOT porn. I can not explain it, but I like it. I remember the scene in which a prisoner was released and when he looks for a way out, he comes across Keller. She tries to prevail, but has no chance. He throws her down, kneels on the stairs and pulls down her pants, no panties;). Well, even though she has an amazing ass - and that shot lingers fantasy for long 30 seconds, I think - it was her expression that aroused me. She wanted it, and that look made me think I was behind it. I would have torn this prey! After that expression I could no longer objectively look at her, I was in love. lol. I am glad to have seen this movie, but if Lisa Keller had not starred, I would have changed the channel. Well, after seeing the scene mentioned above. I'm a fan of LISA KELLER, but it seems she's not a consistent actor. The movie from 2003 is her latest movie. But I'm looking forward to another movie with her.
