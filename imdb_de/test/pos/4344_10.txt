One of the greatest movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself has often been quoted as saying that this is his masterpiece. The plot was often copied, but never exceeded. Wildey J. Moore, the weapons maker, has often claimed that its brand growth has been fully replicable to DW3 since the mid-1980s, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, but an art that many generations will admire and appreciate. Although this film has never been properly appreciated in the US, it has found a large following in Europe and Asia, where the film is regularly screened at film schools and is still popular in student cinemas across Europe. All in all, a true classic.
