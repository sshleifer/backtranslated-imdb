The BBC's Blue Planet is simply mind-blowing. I do not think I exaggerate when I say that it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever recorded in the film. From familiar creatures on and near the surface of the sea to something more unrecognizable and simply bizarre in the murky depths, next to nothing. After eight hours, some people should review the edited highlights in the form of the movie "Deep Blue", but I would highly recommend starting the series. I do not think it will be disappointing, and if your kids enjoyed the water world that Pixar Finding Nemo brought them, I'm sure they'll love it too. I just wish TV was so entertaining.
