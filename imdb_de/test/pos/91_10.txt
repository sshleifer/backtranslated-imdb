Made by the NFBC, this film was filmed in honor of the Montreal Canadians in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my eleventh birthday in 1987 and also in 1986 to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury. I have been a Canadian fan for 29 of my 30 years. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this movie a 117. All hockey fans should see this, as I hope that he placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and in the Bell Center will be shown in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall. Watch this movie with your family, it's a great movie. I also recommend the book in French and English. Go Habs Go.
