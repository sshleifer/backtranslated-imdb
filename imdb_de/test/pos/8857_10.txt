The stupid saying "That you can not touch" certainly applies here. As all clone horror and sci-fi movies hit the market and all inferior remakes appear, it's hard to find something worth 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that startled me when I was a kid. Undoubtedly THE THING is the greediest, craziest, screaming sci-fi horror classic John Carpenter or any other director (sorry, you, Mr. Spielberg) ever did. But what really gives it power is not the bloodsucker (there is mud and blood and God knows what other fluids there are), but the feeling of fear, isolation and mistrust that it promotes in the characters and the onlooker. > <br /> You can not be further away than the Antarctic, and in this howling, ice-cold white setting, the story takes place. There are several Americans, researchers and military stationed. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog ​​who runs for his life from gun-making Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is fighting a mysterious creature that can mimic any creature it wants. It can turn into disgusting slimy, bloody creatures before it's done, but when it's done, if you have not seen it, you can not distinguish it from humans or other normal creatures. Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just some of the best cast members. This movie is the reason why horror can be a great genre. It still scares me. The alien blood "jumps" out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it, and it still makes me jump !!! <br /> <br /> Still the scariest of all.
