This is a great James Bond movie. Although it is not part of the original series and is more famous and is a standalone film, it has done very well. It was a stroke of genius to make Sean Connery return to the role he had made famous, and the movie was named so that his vow not to play Bond again. Connery was as great as he was in 007's previous performances. The script is superb, as are the photography and the performances. It's the first movie I remember with Kim Basinger, who became much more famous after this movie. Barbara Carrera was excellent. and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. The frequent references to the aging of Bond and the changing times and attitudes of British intelligence were extremely humorous. The 007 gadgets were the same as other Bond movies. The only thing missing was the famous music theme 007, which of course could not be used by this competing production. It was quite amazing to me that I saw two excellent James Bond films in the same year, this and Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is the emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The early 80s were the first heyday of such things, and their use in this film made it a very contemporary film. The movie is actually a different version of Thunderball that has been updated with newer technologies. Regardless of the recurring theme, there are enough differences to make it entertaining. I will see this often.
