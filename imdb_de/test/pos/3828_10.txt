I just thought I would add another remark here. While there are some visual sub-references to the possibility of unspoken feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand in this episode; There is a special, physically tender moment towards the end. When the Enterprise returns at an emergency warp speed to overtake a potentially deadly Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that her life will have a dramatic ending, seeks solace by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as she does so watch the approaching instrument of their imminent demise for the main viewer. I thought it was cute (and of course Janice is great!). <br /> <br /> (P.S. Goof: - Several times, while allegedly phasors are being fired, the movie shows photon torpedoes being launched.)
