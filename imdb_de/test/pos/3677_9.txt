Below I quote the words of my favorite author Paulo Coelho as a commentary on this film. <br /> <br /> "If you really want something, the entire universe conspires to help you" <br /> <It's too easy to forget who we really are and what we want to do in life , Because there are always too many comments and advices that bring us to safety. I almost forgot what passion feels like. Despite the adventure that leads me out of the security zone, I really believe that fear is just the price I have to pay for the upcoming brand new journey in life story. It is the blessing for me to realize what unconditional love is. This is the most precious love from the light of the soul.
