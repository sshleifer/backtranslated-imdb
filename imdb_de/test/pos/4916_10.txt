L'Homme Blesse is not intended for an impatient, adventurous audience. There are no explosions and the drama is not easy. As in Lynne Ramsey's films, the director works more with mood than storytelling in an effective and incredibly moving way. Because it does not rely on a groundless nudity or superficial pop cult. Narratives, frankly one of the best gay foreign films I've ever seen (see also Francois Ozon, Pedro Almodovar). Nicolas Roeg's "Do not Look Now" gets a lot of bad press because it's sold as a horror movie. Like L'Homme, this film is more than what the box could have made you believe. If you are in the mood to sit back and be absorbed by the subtle, transformed forces of cinema, you will love this movie.
