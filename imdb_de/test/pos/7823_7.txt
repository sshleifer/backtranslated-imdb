This is a movie made by Hallmark for TV. Hallmark has always made quality films that are family-oriented. Just Desserts is a boy and a girl who fall in love while filming. Two bakers fight for a price of $ 250,000 against a professional bakery field. It's fun and carefree. The desserts look great. The film has a catchy, happy little song that is played during the contest. I assume that this is a song made for the film by Roger Bellon. Too bad that no soundtrack is available. I really would like to have a copy of the song. I do not even know the name of the song because the credits are squeezed at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of promos. Nevertheless, the cast is great. It is always nice to see Brenda Vaccaro. She is very bubbly and optimistic. Lauren Holly is always a plus and Costas Mandylor completes the good ones with a wonderful performance. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck has a guest appearance. The movie is worth seeing.
