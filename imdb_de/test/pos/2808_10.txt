Really, I do not care that nobody here likes this movie, I do, and that's what this post is about. Lou Diamond Phillips is great in this weird role. this line on train and c is for me an instant classic, the cg is great, yes, the train looks a bit imitated, but the aliens will ever rock it, Todd Bridges, where is Arnold and Mr. Drummond, Wow , he got out of the loop. I think that's what the prison does to you. A high-speed train is on its way to Las Vegas with the Senator to make a big speech, a meteor has just hit, and now all of a sudden we've got aliens on the train, and our hero cop has to save the day make things worse, and his ex-wife is on board to argue with him. I just thought that this movie is so wonderful, a must if you like action.
