Ingrid Bergman, the faithful receptionist of the dentist Walter Matthau, who has a crush on her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this film. She masters the witty counterpart in the script brilliantly and steals a grandiose scene in which she and Goldie Hawn speak in a record booth (Ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells you that she wholeheartedly believes in it). Matthau is a strange choice for the lead man (he's too old for Goldie Hawn and unrefined for Bergman, not to mention a tooothless dentist), but I like the way he tries to satisfy Goldie and stumbles while trying to liberate yourself from a lie. Hawn (who won a Supporting Oscar) is as fresh and bubbly as he is today. This bedroom farce is not terribly chic (and a bit reminiscent of "Every Wednesday"), but it's a welcome relief from the loud, teen-oriented comedies they show today. "Cactus Flower" is a beautiful sigh! *** from ****
