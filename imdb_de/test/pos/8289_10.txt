Until today, there is no film that I have seen more than The Chipmunk Adventure, nor has a movie brought me more luck. This is by no means the best movie or even the biggest animated film, but for an 8 year old girl in 1988 it was the coolest, funniest and most exciting movie of all time! I'm just as impressed today by the musical numbers, each of which is an outstanding song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic 80s pop tradition (think of Pat Benetar on helium, just catchier). <br /> <br /> The controversy has worked on the obvious suggestive tone of the Chipette song "Gettin 'Lucky With You", which seemed a lot more innocent to me at the time. When I consider it a rational adult, I can fully understand the concern. They have three young girls in skimpy harem outfits who passionately proclaim "having luck is what it's all about". The Chipettes were definitely sexualized tenfold for this movie. <br /> <br /> But this controversial theme does not come close to overshadowing the otherwise fabulous animated adventures of the chipmunks out of this movie. Especially if you were a child of the eighties / early nineties like me. :-)
