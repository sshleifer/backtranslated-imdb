Jim Henson always seemed to produce wonderful television programs. This was unfortunately one of the shortest living. It was lovely to hear every story with its charming manners. Each episode was a new story with new characters. John Hurt did a wonderful job playing the storyteller, and the sarcastic tone of Brian Henson as a dog has always been enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes were very well done. The Muppet factory is, if necessary, a classic Jim Henson work. You know it's a Muppet, but it's more than forgiveness. They find themselves enchanted and forced. When every episode comes to an end, you find that you were pretty entertained. An entertaining, fulfilling, not the kind that wears off after a few moments. They sit back and think about each episode. They realize that every story is indeed timeless and represents a strong history of morality. <br /> <br /> I do not have to show this to my own children yet, but this is actually a series that is more than family entertainment. I implore you to find it on DVD and snap it. If you can not do that, you'll just find it a bit like.
