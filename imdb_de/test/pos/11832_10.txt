I loved this movie - the actors were wonderful and suited their roles. The story itself was great (and true, the scenery was perfect, and the message about human response to war, danger, and risk was extraordinary.) The person who wrote the music also made the music for Life is Beautiful other favorite of mine) - His comment was apparently: "... it was not an English movie, it was like an Italian movie." I think he's right! Callum Blue is perfect for the role of Eric Newby, I recommend this one Film to anyone who wants to see a story that is true and morally uplifting, as well as a beautiful love story.
