First ignore the commentary on how South Park should make fun of the Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, this episode is just funny. Al Gore's portrayal must be one of the best cartoons a politician I've ever seen, original and based on people's opinions. I do not want to reveal anything, but I had to roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> There are also some of the best Cartman / Kyle moments of all time. All in all, I would say that this is one of the best episodes the show has ever had, and I highly recommend them to everyone.
