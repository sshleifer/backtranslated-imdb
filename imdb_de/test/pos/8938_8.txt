Recently seen on cable-on-demand, "this is the kind of movie where Alec Guiness and Glynis Johns would have starred if shot in the late '50s." A farce in the English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are very nice and sincere in their depictions. Naomi Watts sizzles on somber Jayne Mansfield-ish (if she could have acted). The rest of the cast has some great twists and turns. The Welsh countryside is charming. An absurd premise, in fact and not credible at all, but that does not stand in the way of enjoyment. Not a great movie, mind you, but a really funny watch. And walking is the craziest. A pleasure to see!
