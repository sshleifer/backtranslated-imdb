I went into this movie and expected a Slasher, and although Mute Witness has an influence on the style of filmmaking, this is much more than just an average Slash movie. There are a number of thrillers that focus on a specific disability - blindness occurs more often (blind terror, waiting for it to be dark, Cat o'Nine Tails, to name a handful), but the effects of a silent lead role in one Thrillers like this are well-presented and actually an integral part of the plot, because the fact that the main character can not speak is often the reason why she is in dangerous situations that everyone can easily solve. Our mute witness is Billy Hughes, a make-up artist working on a horror film production in a studio in Moscow. After an hour she is locked up after hours, and after she tries to call her sister, she stumbles over what at first glance seems to be an illicit sex movie, but soon turns out to be a snuff movie! She tries to convince the authorities of what she has seen, but realizes that no one believes her story ... Lately, Hostel has made the headlines to show snuff films in a foreign country, but this movie has it done first and actually does a better job. It may not be as uncomfortable as Eli Roth's Opus, but the Gore is more effective, and since then director Anthony Waller (who staged one of my favorite modern thrillers with The Guilty), he puts a good sense of humor into the process Mute Witness is both bloody and funny to see. The director certainly has a talent for exciting rides, as they never stop. The storyline is swiftly put into action, and Waller is constantly introducing spins that will greatly help the movie's overall entertainment value. Acting is not bad for a B-movie. The young actors Marina Zudina, Fay Ripley and Evan Richards perform well. The atmosphere is bleak, and the Russian venues are unfriendly, giving the film an amazing atmosphere. Overall, Mute Witness is a much better movie than you might expect. The action flows well, and the atmosphere and excitement are perfect.
