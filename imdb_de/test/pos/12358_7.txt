It is a mistake to call every film of this era a horror movie. Most early German films with supernatural themes are less horror films than dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German romantics such as E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In Fritz Lang's "The Mude Death" (also from 1921), personified death takes away a young man from his sweetheart, but in Lang's film, the fate of the characters can not be diminished by behavior. None of the young lovers deserve to die, but the circumstances are reunited only in death. <br /> <br /> However, in Victor Seastrom's "Korkarlen", remorse is always an option. Fate can be changed by the choice of characters and death can be postponed. Although scenes from the Phantom Carriage that collect souls are truly scary, these terrible images of death become the great guideline for offering the death of salvation to the real monster of this story, David Holm, a brutal drunk because of his perverted hatred is endangered, humankind affects widespread tuberculosis and emotional distress to all with whom it comes into contact. <br /> <br /> New Year's Eve Holm is knocked down in a fight with a drinking companion. As the first person to die at midnight, Holm must become driver of the Phantom Carriage and collect souls in the New Year. The Phantom Carriage, driven by an old friend who had brought Holm on his way to destruction, comes for his soul and takes him on a journey of discovery. Along the way, Holm sees the horror he inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my disappointment at the end of the film is a critique of the Selma Lagerl√∂f novel on which the film is based. But I would have preferred not to let David Holm escape from his fate and to see that his remorse comes too late to prevent his wife from poisoning both his children and himself, and that Holm is suffering from the consequences of his sins must collect their souls It would have been an appropriate punishment and a horror that was greater than the witness he had mistreated others. In the film, however, the immutable nature of fate is not the message; Salvation is. The coach driver lets Holm's mind return to his body and he saves his family in time. His remorse smells of Scrooge's remorse in "A Christmas Carol." <br /> <br /> If the banal and sentimental end does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the pictures of the movie. The special effects are amazing when measured by the standards of the day, and they continue, which is a miracle, considering that these double exposures were made in a hand cranked camera. Also the restored movie on the new DVD from Tartan looks fabulous.
