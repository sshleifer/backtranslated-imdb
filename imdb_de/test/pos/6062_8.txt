'Rejseholdet' is one of the best new Danish television series I've seen. <br /> <br /> The series is about Unit 1 of the Danish Police, an FBI-style team that helps with the resolution of murder cases, the country and the cases in which they work, and the influence theirs Have jobs on their personal lives, and the price they sometimes have to pay to be part of a first-class police team. I did not do it I did not expect much when I started watching this series - I was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes funny, it has both drama and excitement, I love it.
