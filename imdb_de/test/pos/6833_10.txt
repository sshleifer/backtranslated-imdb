Surprised to know that the director (Sebastian Gutierrez) was a young Venezuelan (28) and bored with so many predictable films, I was delighted with the script, which showed so many little stories and clues here and there. Guided with black humor and taste, I loved the tension between the very smart Boggart Rickman and the very natural but beautiful Thompson. Every member of the gang deserves attention, Gil Bellows at his best. Gugino is remarkable.
