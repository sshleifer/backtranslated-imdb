This must be the ultimate chick movie. We recorded it years ago with the TV and I've seen it about 30 times over the years. I had not seen it for about 12 years and have recently seen this movie. I do not lie, I cried from the opening to the credits. This movie really takes your heart out, even if you have no children.
