In America, Saturday morning would give way to new cartoons once a year, usually in America. Around the time the school started. <br /> <br /> I think this should not make the school more bearable on Saturdays. <br /> <br /> A Friday night before the premiere of the new cartoons on Saturday morning, a movie started. <br /> <br /> "At the Earth's Core" I had no idea who Cushing or McClure were. Obviously they were not from the same country, so I could not understand why they were traveling together. I remember seeing the mechanism in the mouth of the fire-breathing monster. <br /> <br /> What connects this film for me is the opening with the molten metal, and then suddenly we get the band while we see the factory. <br /> <br /> How do you end a movie like this? Again the music and two confused policemen while the drill appears behind them. <br /> <br /> Whatever the reason, I remember seeing this movie more this Friday than any other cartoon that came out the next morning /> <br /> These were definitely the late ones seventies. <br /> <br /> It would be during Jurassic Park-Mania, Cicra '93, I think, before I see this movie again. <br /> <br /> Yes, people in costumes. There was the fire breather again. <br /> <br /> Still loved the end with the two cops. <br /> <br /> Finally, it would be almost a decade before I would send the movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> Now I would only see the beginning and the intro. <br /> <br /> Oh, I love the movie a lot. Of all these Sci fi Jules Verne, HG Wells, ERB movies, this one is my favorite. <br /> <br /> What I notice now is that one of the policemen turns around a bit too fast and then turns back, then he and the other policeman are dubbed as they turn inward to look at each other to watch the exercise. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie is for me the best that shows Saturday morning Why I like it so much.
