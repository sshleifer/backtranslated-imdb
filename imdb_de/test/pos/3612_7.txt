Here is a well-made war story, beautifully filmed and well played. The representation of the Italian and German occupation of the Greek island Kefalonia is well done. John Hurt as Pelagia's father and the island doctor is outstanding, Nicolas Cage does a good job as captain from the title. Penelope Cruz is a good job to be beautiful and hit her eyelashes on Cage. There is heroism and humor, there is drama and romance, and it is all settled on an idyllic island. Oddly, a very similar, or should I say, almost identical plot, with the same characters. The same series of events is told in a novel of the same title written by Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of the beautiful Pelagia, the daughter of Doctor Iannis, and her life on Kefalonia during World War II. Pelagia's fianc√©, local fisherman Mandras, logs on when the Italian army invades Albania, under false pretenses. Finally, with the help of the Germans, when the Axis are victorious, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and Captain Corelli is instrumental in keeping the occupation peaceful. When Mandras joins the partisans, the charming Corelli and his mandolin are housed with the doctor and his beautiful daughter. That of course makes it a novel about love. But it's also a warrior novel, a summary of Greek history, a history of communist revolt in post-war Greece, a portrait of Mussolini's madness, and above all, an ode to island life on Kefalonia. <br /> Some of these elements return to the film, but in general it is impossible to film a book. I'm glad nobody tried. <br /> <br /> The movie 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is worth seeing though. Just make sure you read the book * after * you see the movie.
