Barney is about "IMAGINATION". What you guys do not have, if my preschooler never pretended to pretend to play this show, I would be worried. What is 2 or 3 years old, has everything that has to do with the colors and the vocals. For those who say they do everything on Barney, junk food is to eat and recommend the sesame street better. What about "biscuit monster"? That's all he eats, but I have not yet seen anyone comment on it. I agree that sesame is a better educational show, but Barney is like a show of fun. Do not be too serious if you do not want your child to watch TV and worry about understanding things that you do not believe. You should not support them in front of the TV, because everything is wrong. Everything is wrong. Actors are wrong. Why do not you take your wrong brains with you when you have a problem with it? Fake TV show for kids, then turn them off and play with them yourself and show them what they should learn, not BIG BIRD or Bert & Ernie or Barney anybody who saw all those shows and went well.
