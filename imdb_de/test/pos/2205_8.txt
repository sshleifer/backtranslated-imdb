I only have praise for this movie. From start to finish, it captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim's musical. I'm not a big fan of musicals, most are over the top. This changed my opinion. I'm an actor myself and played Sweeney acting and I know how hard that role is. George Hearn gave a stunning, masterful and well-rounded performance that deserves the highest accolades we can give him (he won an Emmy and that's something.) Everything he does becomes gold. He is so good that he will blow you away, which is why he is not awarded Oscar awards in movies. Lansbury is also very good and very funny. Sara Woods is scary and wonderful as a beggar. All in all, a great video. Pick it up if you can.
