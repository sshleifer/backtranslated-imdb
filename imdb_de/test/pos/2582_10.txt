When I saw the first trailer of Black Snake Moan, I knew I had to see it. I was not the least bit disappointed in the film, written and directed by Craig Brewer, the creator of Hustle and Flow. It tells the story of a broken blues man and a nymphomaniac, whom he wants to heal not only for himself but also for himself ... but there is much more. It's complex and rich, and you manage to put it in a pebbly, sticky, muggy-blue Memphis without feeling like you need a bath well written and performed. The accents and dialogue were flawlessly supported. However, there was one weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best I can say for him is that he can cry ... it's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. However, Justin's Ronnie was flat, but as an actor he made a great effort. I would definitely give him another chance. <br /> <br /> Lazarus and Rae (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci, respectively) have great chemistry and respect for each other. This is one of those movies where it does not matter how good an actor is, if the other is not up to the task and luckily both actors did the job. <br /> <br /> The music was a bit better than expected, especially when Samuel L. Jackson sings the blues. Phenomenal. <br /> <br /> On the technical side everything was brilliant as far as I could see. It was well cut, well shot and mixed ... everything was great. The character and the scenery were just right, the casting of the supporting characters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was just the thing.
