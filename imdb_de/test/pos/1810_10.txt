What can I say?? This movie has everything ... romance, separation, rich kids, punks and preparations. This is my favorite movie I can recite line by line. I remember when I came out, I was 14 and could not get in ... so I finally saw him on cable ... I was addicted! Wanted to move to California and be a Valley Girl. (Hey, I even remember the song of Moon Zappa, right?) For years tried in vain to get the never-produced soundtrack ... now you can find it on rhino plates ....
