I only live on the highway from Georgetown, Co ... I remember this movie well and thought it was great! The story seems to be something that John himself would do in real life, but there's something I'll always remember the most. For those of you who do not live in Denver ... every year at Denver City's Civic Center in Denver City, Denver stages amazing lights and decorations. Well, there was a crib needed during the filming of this movie. So ... it was borrowed from the Civic Center Display ... with permission, by the way! Someone had forgotten to advise the powers, and it was reported that it was stolen! A hectic search began with law enforcement for several days. Finally, someone spoke and remembered borrowing it to the Georgetown film crew! It was returned and taken where it belonged! It turns out that it did not happen too often in the movie ... You can barely see it during the Christmas show with the kids. However it caused a disturbance ...
