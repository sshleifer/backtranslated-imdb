Why do I give this 1974 porn movie 7 points? Because I saw it. And I thought it was funny! Aliens, their strange spaceship, their strange helmets ... my God, that was a sight. And all these desperate extraterrestrial women need is sperm from the earth. <br /> <br /> And where are you looking for it? In Upper Bavaria, Germany. And here comes the greatest fun: In Europe (and especially in the German-speaking area), Bavaria is considered a traditional and backward region. And then the actors are so helpless with the alien women. Well, there have been films about people who are unable to deal with women like the "American Pie" series. <br /> <br /> But what this film has achieved is a true, weird comedy. They constantly wonder how they came up with these ideas. But it was 1974, and when you look back 35 years, you have a kind of nostalgia. You have never seen such a movie. <br /> <br /> And if you do not like the casual pubic hair and breasts, have a look at the movie. It's basically a comedy, not a pornographic movie.
