Well, I enjoy this movie, even though sometimes it becomes too stereotypical. I did not understand at the time if "Punishment Park" existed in the past, but I think it's not really here. It shows how much violence you can find in our world. It reminds us that we live in a violent world and can not escape anyone. If someone refuses to "take his responsibility," you will be thrown out of our society ... Our entire history is marked by wars, we should never forget this. In fact, it is only when we finally accept the truth that we may change and understand that our "intellectual capacities" have improved. So we could use it to find other ways to solve our problems. <br /> <br /> In two words this film is a must, maybe it helps us to accept the truth ...
