This movie appears every now and then at 3 am on the ABC in Australia. <br /> <br /> It starts with the accident of a bus accident in London. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, there are flashbacks for every character and the backslide photography of Big Ben, which symbolizes what happened 13 hours ago, until the bus crash. <br /> <br /> It took a while to understand, but it was still nice. <br /> <br /> If Sean Cunningham and Quentin Tarrantino got together and made a film, that could be the result - because of the flashbacks and little stories involved and the deaths. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure the main characters, since it's been a while since I saw it, but in fact a rare gem.
