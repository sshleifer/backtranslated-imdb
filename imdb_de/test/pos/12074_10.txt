Ann-Margret has done the best she has ever done in her film history. I felt she was Mrs. Frey. There may be one or two films by Ann-Margret that I have not seen since making her film debut in "Pocket full of miracles" starring Betty Davis in 1961. Although she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this role in Who Will Love My Children, she was overlooked. As if she had been nominated for an Oscar for her roles in "Carnal Knowledge" and "Tommy", she was disappointed. I think that everyone has done an outstanding acting job, including all the children in "Who Will Love My Children". Yes, it is a sad movie (as true stories can be), but time is worth it. Many Thanks.
