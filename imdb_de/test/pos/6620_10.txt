If you have ever been, have a friend, or a kid who is or was skating, then watch this movie! I have seen it several times and every time I get something new out of it. It reminded me why I first went skating (a long time ago). It reminded me of skating a person and I found that it will also help a person who does not understand why skaters, well, ice skating. Sure, there is a very dark side of the whole thing that the movie touches. However, it focuses more on the essentials of skating. Only one person on a blackboard who does it because she likes to do it. This movie was so inspiring for me that I'm skating again (I'm 32) and I have not been so happy with myself for years?
