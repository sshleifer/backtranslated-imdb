I believe that there are two aspects of the story: First, it is the worldly satirical view portrayed in an obvious Kafkaesque manner, underscoring the filthy spectacle behind some of the most common, but also pleasant or pleasant moments and elements of life that normally enough to make people function in society. For example: a good job, a good home, a good wife, a good car and even a good mistress. Apart from this so-called ordinary happiness, there are some who can not help asking more uncomfortable questions, such as where they come from, or if they can have some other form of bliss, if there is a reason for them. The weather could be something that they have missed, or even weirder weather. There could be something that the system itself withholds from them. Secondly, the most interesting aspect of this film, I believe, is the fact that it attacks the natural compulsion to investigate the world around us from the outset, challenges us through our personal judgment, and usually condemns it because it does not better is because it is not tailor made for us person. <br /> <br /> The symbolism behind the train accident suggests that our own will can be overwhelmed by a fate or some other universal greater power, even if our so-called decision-making power decides when to get off. Instead, the man is rejected by this greater power (let's call it the SYSTEM, because the authors clearly avoid labeling it as GOD, perhaps emphasizing that the SYSTEM is man-made and, unlike FATE, man-ruled a concept that is closer to religion) can not be killed by killing, but by showing him that there is a place for the man who wants / desires too much, perhaps suggesting that true fulfillment does not come from the outside, but from within, and when the outside world "decides" to give you some comfort, you should learn to accept it without questioning the substance of each aspect. <br /> <br /> Uncomfortable, however, is reassessing some of the existential issues that have become mainstream in the last century, such as the human being in a world increasingly suffering from substance, a consumptive world in which People can be exchanged without making a big difference to the overall picture, but only as long as it is useful for the system.
