Countdown in Kung Fu (1976) is an early underrated early work by director John Woo. In the film, Dorian Tan (Tan Tao-liang) plays important roles with Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and James Tien. Many people believe or have been led by misleading advertising that this is a Jackie Chan movie. This is not a Jackie Chan movie, Dorian Tan is the star, but Jackie gives one of his best (most serious) early performances. The Hand of Death is about a Shaolin student named Yunfei (Tan), who is sent on a mission to kill a Shaolin traitor named Shih Xiaofeng (Tien) and protect a revolutionary named Zhang Yi (Woo). During his trip, Yunfei encounters a young woodcutter named Tan (Chan) and a nefarious swordsman (Chang Chung) known as "The Wanderer." Both men have suffered from shih and want to take revenge. The three fight together to defeat Shih and his eight bodyguards and bring the revolutionary to safety. <br /> <br /> The martial arts action is above average under the direction of Sammo Hung. Dorian Tan uses his typical high kicks as "Northern Eightteen Styles Kicks" along with some "Southern Five Styles Boxing". Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan also offer outstanding martial arts achievements. James Tien is not the best martial artist on the jade screen, but does an acceptable job. Some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem to be overly choreographed, but the last showdowns with Chan, Tan and Hung are very good. <br /> <br /> Director John Woo offers a lot of interesting character development in the movie refreshing. The camera of Leung Wing Kat is very stylish, unique and beautiful for a kung fu movie of this time. Joseph Koo's Music: A combination of soft flutes and orchestral pieces in the style of the 70s "Shaft" is kung fu cinema at its best. Hand of Death is not the usual kung fu comedy by Jackie and Sammo. Hand of Death is a serious, revenge-based story. <br /> <br /> Hand of Death or Countdown in Kung Fu is an underrated classic in the old Kung Fu genre. The movie is one of the best of its time and a preview of the great things of Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. Hangs great choreography is shown here before his directorial debut and Chan's early charisma and talent are clearly visible. Hand of Death is a solid, stylish kung fu movie from the old school and a brilliant early work by the legendary John Woo. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Rating 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Wanderer to Tan (relative to his new weapon): "The Little Eagle Wing God Lance." <br /> <br /> Tan: "Just a bauble."
