Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches English at high school in a small town in Indiana. He finally marries Emily (Joan Cusack), much to the delight of his parents. The city is also confusing because Cameron (Matt Dillon), one of his own, was nominated for a drama Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, watch the Oscars on television while Cameron is declared the winner! In his acceptance speech, Cameron announces that he has been able to play his role as a gay military man, partly because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school. You guessed it, it's Howard! But Howard never "came out"; he actually believes that he is straight! Howard and Emily are waiting with the whole city and the media, waiting and watching, going on and getting married? Or is Howard really gay and realizes that he can not go through the ceremony? This is a wonderful, funny and humane film about a gay man and his situation. As the man who did not know he was gay, Kline is excellent and touching. The rest of the cast is also fine, with Cusack mixed as a fianc√©, and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck, and others who also delight audiences. The costumes are very beautiful and the scenery in the charming heart of Indiana is beautiful. Also the script, the direction and the production are very, very nice. But the enlightening, humorous and thoughtful look at the gay population is undoubtedly the best asset of the film. For those who are offended by a movie with gay topics, just skip it. But for those who want to laugh heartily and understand the gay situation better, this is definitely the best movie on the market.
