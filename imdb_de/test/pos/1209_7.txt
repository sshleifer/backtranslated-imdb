* SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> Great Wrestle Manias were still several years away. But this was certainly good, there were many good matches and a great match. <br /> <br /> The demolition was always the best at WrestleMania. I am glad that their last World Cup Hoorah (I refuse to include the other version) wins a victory over the Colossal Connection. I liked the gag of Andre, who was never there. <br /> <br /> Few fans know this was the first time anyone had defeated Mr. Perfect. For some reason, Brutus Beefcake's performance was never recognized. Or the fact that he made it pretty easy. <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation's victory against the Bolsheviks was the shortest in World Cup history, including the 24/9 second match between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Jake and DiBiase were able to fight at WrestleMania. This made up for the fact that the feud had to be put on hold for so long. <br /> <br /> I expected the Big Bossman Akeem feud to heat up, but the Bossman just babbled. As good as Bossman was as a heel, he was as tall as a face. He was always intense and obviously loved his job. <br /> <br /> If the warrior had just had a better work ethic and maybe tried to learn wrestling, he would have been a great WWF champion. <br /> <br Worth a watch, especially as the boring matches are too short to complain. And the tag team matches are all very exciting.
