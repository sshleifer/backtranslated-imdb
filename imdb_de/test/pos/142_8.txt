We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you have not seen Oldboy (or the sympathy trilogy for that matter), you're missing out on some of the best movies made in this century. But I'm not here to talk about her. I am here to talk about thirst. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what you would expect. Yes, it's a vampire movie, but at the same time, it's also a very twisted romance between a priest and a young girl. I will not go into the summary (you can read that above), but instead tell you what this movie has to offer. Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception. With some very surreal scenes with intense lighting he sets the mood in almost every scene perfectly. The movie starts a bit slow, but I thought it was necessary to build a relationship with the characters. Once things start, it's almost never going to go off until the credits roll. "Thirst" is mostly a love story, but not in the sense you would think. The relationship between the main characters is intense but almost disturbing. As we know, Chan-wook Park is no stranger, and this movie touches taboos almost as much as Old Boys. The final scene is by far the strongest in the movie and perhaps one of the best conclusions of a movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is an extraordinary movie that all movie lovers should see. It's an exciting (and admittedly different) attitude in the world of vampires, and romance is anything but juicy or boring. This movie is pithy, selfless and beautiful in all wrong ways. Of course, it's not for everyone, but if you're reading this review, you're probably already interested. Do not hesitate
