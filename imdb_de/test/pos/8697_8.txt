Absolute eye-catcher of a film and its age years ahead. I saw this for the first time in the week when my dad came home with a neighbor TV that the guy threw on the scrap heap. A hobbyist with all the electrical stuff, his father had it working within two days. That was July 1955 ... and then probably just the third house in the street to have TV! Pretty much the first thing we've ever seen on this grainy and flickering old 12-inch canvas was THIS movie. "It's quite old, sweetheart", I remember that my mother told me. <br /> <br /> Nearly 50 years later, and it does not seem to be older - more like World War I in this regard! Terrible little fantasy about a London bus carrying thirteen passengers crashing and killing one of its numbers. In a flashback, we pick up on these people's lives and find out what made them get on this bus that day. <br /> <br /> Crashes at the end of the film reveal the identity of the victim, perhaps the inspiration for the 1960s film THE LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER. <br /> <br /> If you ever come across this little gem, I suggest you have a look!
