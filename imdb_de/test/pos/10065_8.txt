If this film had been shot in the 50s or 60s, critics and fans alike would have praised it. I myself enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It's not a timeless piece and has not aged well over the years, but it's still nice to look at. As for Mrs. Ritchie's acting? Not the best on the planet - but it adds to the film's unique slapstick comedy aspirations and shows Madonna's (often underrated) sense of comedic timing. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a former convict committed for a crime she did not commit. Griffin Dunne plays the unlucky future groom / puppet, who escorts her from the prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occur and thus the action ensues. (And there's * one, people!) Give the movie a chance. You'll be pleasantly surprised how funny it really is.
