I like movies that show real people "Americans" and tell the truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be great. It played well here in Norway (Amazon says it's USA / Canda above, but the box says "All Regions." I have to say it's not for the American audience, it was starring in World Raw Views, one of them Theater I saw it I ordered it and later I ordered it The cut was different and much better See it and you'll like it or maybe hate it I'm sorry, Bush Lover, but this movie drives you crazy Because it makes sense Everything in me, but I stand for one It's not for the empty heads It's long and too hard to keep up, but the second time it makes more sense I loved Owen's words and the poem brought me crying.
