This is a shattering movie, and he moves relentlessly. Nevertheless, it is absolutely unique among war films that it focuses exclusively on the civilian experience, the loss of humanity that ordinary people go through during the war. The two young, married musicians go through a slow, grueling process of humiliation by both sides of a civil war. Completely without sentimentality, the film offers a grim vision of the modern world, which in my opinion is particularly recognizable to many Europeans. With courageous, intense performances by Liv Ullmann (never better) and Max von Sydow (also). For my money, the most compelling film Bergman has ever created.
