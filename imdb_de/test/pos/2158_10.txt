Yes, indeed we have a winner - a winner of the best action silly movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I chose to make a 10 for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad that it actually becomes fun. <br /> <br /> "Night Hunter" is essentially about Jack Cutter, a vampire hunter (vampire hunters have apparently been in his generation for centuries), and his mission is to kill the last of the rest of the vampires. <br /> <br /> This movie contains one of the coolest scenes I've ever seen in my life. Not to mention the really bad shooting scenes. When people are filming, blood splattering - as thick as ketchup everywhere - the movie looks so cheap and lame that you lose interest. A constant shaking of the camera annoys me most in the fight scenes. I suspect that this has been done to create an "action effect," though in my opinion it has no effect. It is completely ridiculous! <br /> <br /> All stunt scenes are done extremely badly. For example, a scene where the dead vampire leader is thrown from the roof. When the body touches the ground, it jumps like a shaky rubber doll. A scene where Jack was sniffing the ground and getting a vision was so lame that I laughed hysterically. Lame music, cheesy scenes, bad drama and simple stupid movie techniques are obviously the features that make up this movie a malfunction claiming that this is a good movie would be the same as finding that atomic bombs are good for humans. Obviously, those who say that this is one of the best action movies have not seen many in their lives. <br /> <br /> This is basically a B-class vampire action movie that earns 0. 10 but what I'll give 10/10 just because of his ability (because I'm the worst action movie I've ever seen) to make me laugh and because I just can not live without it.
