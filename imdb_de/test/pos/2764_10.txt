I saw this streak as a kid on the big screen and was thrilled - Cheeziness and all that. Recently I found a copy in the video and checked it again. Badly done, sure ... definitely fun. It's still a fun beat. It's much more fun than the boring Disney version ("Alive"). The only thing that made "Alive" better were the special effects. If you're a b-movie lover, I recommend Survive, not to mention the other Rene Cardona Jrr movies ... and the Mexican wrestling movies his dad (Rene Cardona Snr) did. "Survive" is long overdue for the DVD Special Edition treatment. Are you listening to Anchor Bay?
