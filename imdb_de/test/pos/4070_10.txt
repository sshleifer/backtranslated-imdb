It's exactly what I expected from it. Relaxing, humorous and entertaining. The acting pair was great, as was the scene selection. Personally, I recommend it. It's a kind of movie that can be seen by the whole family at the same time, without anyone feeling uncomfortable or boring. This cute movie will make you smile and laugh too. And the action scenes are delicious. Classic of modern American comedy. And very well done.
