It was fascinating. I just could not look away. As the movie progressed, I got the feeling that it was powerful and confronting, but I had no idea how much more intense it would become. <br /> <br /> The film gives an insight into what is unfortunately everyday life for many students. Some of us live outside of this environment and would pass by and not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Parents need to watch this movie just to catch a glimpse of what their kids are going through. Often parents reject the problems of their children as insignificant, but unfortunately they are massive for a high school. And unfortunately the problems can escalate into a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Definitely a must for everyone.
