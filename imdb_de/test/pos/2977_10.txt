The soundtrack scored by a very young and still famous Elton John, whom I had seen at a club near Houston, put on "Friends." I had no idea of ​​the emotions and effects that the movie would cause. Recently, I was brought back to the movie from a song called Heart Seasons. Then I found the Elton John song Friends, who thought it was the same song ... it's been 35 years. Anyway, the deluge of emotions from "Friends" returned as if you were seeing an old photo of your first true love. I remember more of the way the movie hit me than the actual details of the production, the plot, etc., so forgive me for a rather bad review. I remember meeting some special friends on a date to see how the movie ended up moving with tears in my eyes like mine. I'm worried and nervous to find a copy and see it now. So many movies that seemed so important to me at the time (ie "The Graduate" "Easy Rider") now seem stupid and I do not want it to fall into the same category. But I'll find it and if it turns out stupid, then I can at least turn my wife into a great ... no great soundtrack. When we met, we went through with "Last Tango in Paris". The young people I work with (I am 56) respect my opinion, but it is hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the films and songs that reflect such strong emotions but now seem a bit "old". I just can not figure out if the aging process is the movies ... or me. "Friends" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. I'm sure it will bring back many special feelings. Rent or buy a copy anyway ... India was not close to the strong genre that they are today.
