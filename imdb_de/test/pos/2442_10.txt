This is the Australian TV series. It is a classic. The stories and actors are excellent. Who can forget that Picker and his gramophone or Chet are ambushed? This is cult TV. The Australian actors of the series were the best of their time and have immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say, timeless adventure. The music and the song are just fantastic. The credits begin with the close-up of the wheel, then Keir will sleep and push around, and then the Long Shot just can not get much better. All 13 episodes are equally solid in depicting the Australian myth, and I think that's what this series has. It does not matter that the two main characters were from overseas, I think that's the key to the series and why is it so good.
