.. especially from Lambert. This is the essential Burroughs Tarzan I read in my childhood. I read a few negative reviews about this movie and could not wonder what its edition was. They obviously did not see the movie I made, or they expected something more akin to the Saturday afternoon series. <br /> <br /> This was the Tarzan that appeared in the novel, and the filmmakers should be applauded to tackle the source material and take it seriously. Lambert was excellent. I still think he's one of Hollywood's worst rated actors. This is a movie in which he shines. <br /> <br /> The photography and monkeys made by Rick Baker were amazing. You definitely felt the feeling of the jungle. In the second half, Tarzan's attempt to be civilized really draws you into the emotional conflict that he had to force to solve. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie
