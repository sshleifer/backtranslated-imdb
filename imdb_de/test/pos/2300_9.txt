This title is very interesting. The whole movie was like a ninja RPG, which is really cool. Three magic swords, three clans, a terrible demon, a political power, Yotoden has everything. The animation is decent but a bit grainy, the story is top notch and the fight scenes are really cool. What looks really good in this movie are the monsters. They are pretty freaked out. If you like blood and love Ninja scrolls, Yotoden is for you.
