The characters of Ma & Pa Kettle were very popular and controversial. The films in which her brood was located paved the way for downstream TV sitcoms who wanted to imitate their winning formula. An obvious clue is "The Beverly Hillbillies," where the new house was bought with oil money and was not won in a contest. You could even say that the sitcom 'Newhart' from the 80s borrowed the idea of ​​backward rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the author from Washington who created these characters, does no more harm than good. Her portrayal of Hillbilly characters makes her the butt of many jokes regarding her alleged sloppiness and laziness. (The real family on which Macdonald founded the Kettles sued successfully ... she claimed they had been ridiculed and humiliated with these less than flattering clues. Sure, it's a comedy and the situations bring a lot of laughs and funny Moments ... and political correctness, as we know it today, did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s, but I think Macdonald could have made these characters more sensible, and Universal International would have been more dignified by its screenwriters The more realistic moments are when the eldest son, Tom, is ashamed of his rural heritage, but he learns to accept his parents and siblings who they are, and the cauldrons must recognize themselves that they do not fit exactly into a modern world, that's no joke ... that's a sober truth.
