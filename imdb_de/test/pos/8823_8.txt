Much of my childhood was spent lying in front of the radio listening to Round the Horne or Hancock's half an hour or watching Carry-On movies. Probably the most famous line in the comedy "Infamy! Infamy! They all have infamy!" still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> This is a rare glimpse into the man behind the cartoon character, and the entire production is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy, right through to the closing quote of the Coroner Court, which is read in four different voices Michael Sheen. He was brilliant in the role. Most other members of the carry-on team were so-so and their Kenneth Horne was very good, but Michael Sheen wore the show and there should be some kind of prize for him. <br /> <br /> It left me feeling "wow". To quote Kenneth Williams, the cynic who says, "life is a joke," the only answer may be, "Yes, let's do it well."
