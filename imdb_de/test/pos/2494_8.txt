Some time ago I bought the Chinese set Faust of the North Star, which was delivered with the entire fist of the North Star, the Fist of the North Star 2, the New Fist of the North Star and the Fist of the North Star movie. While there is an American and some European versions, they end halfway through Fist of the North Star for the movie. <br /> <br /> The series is about the successor of an ancient martial arts art called Hokuto Shin Ken Kenshiro or Ken for short. In every generation there is only one successor. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where martial arts is the most powerful weapon. The two most powerful arts are Hokuto Shin Ken and Nanto Divine Ken, as my version calls it. Nanto is actually several styles, but they are all the same because they allow a person to hack someone to pieces. There are six Nanto Masters and everyone has their own star. Hokuto is an art that allows someone to damage, kill or heal someone by hitting a spot on their body. Every art has its own constellation. Hokuto - Big Dipper, Nanto - Gemini. Kenshiro saves the world from evil by pursuing his two brothers and three of the Nanto masters and their armies. Every army captain has his own way of fighting, which makes each episode different and the number of soldiers bloody. Kenshiro is also looking for his girlfriend Yuria, who was stolen by Nanto master Shin. On the way, Kenshiro accompanies his brother Toki after rescuing him from his brother Rao, who calls himself Kenou or Boxing King. Also joining him are two Nanto masters Rei, who are looking for his sister, who was kidnapped by Ken's brother Jagi and Shu. Both and Toki die on the way. Other characters who join Ken are two kids Rin and Batto who do not do much. That's about as much as I can tell for the story because it's so long and rich in detail. The series is also divided into four parts. <br /> <br /> What makes this show great is the fight. Normally, Ken meets a group of people who think they are hard and are then killed with a hit. Which is funny and bad, but makes for fast fights. Another big part is comedy / badassness. Ken beats someone and they think it's nothing. Ken says they are already dead. Then they die. Other parts are when he beats them and tells them that they have a few seconds to live. Then a counter appears. Or when he tells them that they are not worthy to know his name. Then there is a quick fire kick or blow, and he goes to the da da da da da etc .. Maybe you might find yourself with him. A great part was when a bad guy thought he knew Hokuto. He went to Ken and hit him. Ken stood there and said he was dead in seconds. The villain counted out and then died. It's not limited to Ken, everyone else kills just as fast. There has never been such a great character as Ken, and that will probably never be the case. <br /> <br /> However, there are some problems. One is the repetitive nature. Some flashbacks, which are mostly Yuria recordings, are played too often, and there are too many repeat episodes, especially in Part 4 of the series. In fact, the last episode is a summary of the whole. Another problem is the end. The last fight with Rao was not that impressive. Ken and Rao fought, then talked, and so on, until Rao came to a realization and killed himself instead of killing him. But it's better than the American and European versions, which are only halfway broken. <br /> <br /> For whom would I recommend this? This is for older teens and adults who like action. Since the styles cause people to explode or cut to pieces, the violence is very vivid and there are a lot of them, but they do not show much blood because they usually make death just a silhouette, but always the person's still less colorful resembles This was probably done to avoid censorship. If you do not like action, rent the American version. If you like action, then I say, go to import, since you can see all the series, but they do not have the best English translation, as they are subtitled by the Chinese. Note: My import did not have everything I said at the beginning, some imported versions, but you still need to get an import to see all the series and the Fist of the North Star 2. If you do not think you can handle the subtitles for some reason then go pick the American version. One more note: In the version, I did not get subtitles on the last disc for New Fist of the North Star; New Fist of the North Star is not that good. <br /> <br /> I give the show 8/10 for their high action, good story and incredible impact of Kenshiro. <br /> <br /> **** UPDATE **** <br /> <br /> Toei Animation has published a english subtitle version. You can download the episodes as well as Hokuto no Ken 2 from IGN's Direct2Drive or watch it for free on the FUNimation site.
