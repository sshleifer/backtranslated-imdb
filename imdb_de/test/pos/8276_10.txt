Unlike most reviewers, I was not born in the 80s. I was born on May 14, 1994. Nevertheless, my life was in the style of the 80s. When other kids had playstations, I played Zelda on my NES, and so on. Well, this movie has a special place in my heart even though I was only 15 at the time of the review. Because of my 80s-style early childhood, I've seen a lot of TV shows and seen a lot of movies that other kids have not seen, and this movie was one of them and one of the biggest. <br /> <br /> It begins in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, Chipmunk's adoptive father, is in a hurry to get to the airport while traveling through Europe on a business trip. His taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him packing. As they speak, Alvin expresses his desire to come with Dave and see the world (although technically Dave is only going to Europe, so Alvin seems to qualify only for America and Europe as "The World"). David leaves the chipmunks in the care of Miss Miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. Soon Dave goes to the airport and the chipmunks stay at home with Miss Miller. Later, the chipmunks play in a local cafe in 30 days "Around the World" against the Chipettes (Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the game against Brittany after his hot air balloon was devoured by a crocodile from the sky, Alvin quarrels with Brittany as to who would really win a race around the world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, Klaus and Claudia Furschtien, eavesdropping on their arguments. Since they have to transport their diamonds safely across the world, they decide to get the children to deliver them for them. They have started a race around the world, where each team has to deposit a doll in its own image (secretly filled with diamonds) to deliver it around the world and get a copy of the opposing team (secretly filled with the payment for the diamonds) to "change that they were there". The winning team would then receive a reward of $ 100,000. They do this because they think that Jamal (an Interpol agent who has been on the heel several times) would never suspect them because they are only children (though this seems superfluous because the children are on their own) I do not have to go through security checks and I'm not asked about the dolls either, I suppose Klaus and Claudia would not do it if they took the diamonds there personally.) And so a big adventure begins. This movie is a classic and I see no reason why someone would not like it. It offers great animation and first-rate speech, not to mention the kick-ass music (Pardon my french: P). My favorite song is undoubtedly: '' The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll '' An amazing rock song that is unbeatable. It's also my favorite moment in the movie. Other notable songs are "Getting Lucky" (Art of Suggestive for a children's movie or?) And "My Mother" as well as "Wooly Bully" and "Off to the World". Not to mention the main theme of the movie that was heard during the opening speeches of the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra The scene with "My Mother" still brings me a tear. At first I did not think about the song '' Getting Lucky '', but as I got older and learned about life, I realized that this song was a bit suggestive. This song along with the fact that the animators insist that the audience knows the color of Chipettes panties. This is particularly evident in the scene in Egypt, when the Chipettes are being chased by the men of the Arabian Prince as Eleanor leans over the edge of the hot air balloon basket and her rock completely defies gravity. While this has nothing to do with the overall quality of the film, this is one of the unexplainable things why no one in the world seems to mind that four-meter-tall chipmunks walk around and speak with incredibly high voices and treat them like any human Child would do. A bit after this scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to look for the chipmunks and come home. Directed by Janice Karman, the movie is perfected when she and her husband Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the characters better than anyone else. They even make the voices of the chipmunks and chipettes. Ross makes the votes for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Nancy Cartwright (The voice of Bart Simpson) speaks of male characters spoken by female speakers. She plays the role of the Arab prince, a very small but important role. Of course the ending is a happy one. The Crooks were caught, the loose ends tied and the movie ends as the Children, Dave and Miss Miller ride into the sunset. Alvin complains that he did not receive his $ 100,000 reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he finally screams '' ALVIN! '' And the screen goes black. <br /> <br /> Classic end, by the way. I hope you found my review helpful for this movie, and if you have not seen this movie, take a look at it. He is worth the money. This nostalgic classic from the 80s receives a solid 10 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> '' Headin 'to the top, you do not know! we never stop believing ''
