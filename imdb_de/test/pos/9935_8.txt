Although not called a Slasher movie, it contains all the elements. The fact that Slashers are known for their low budget, lame plot, cheesy effects, and anything you can add does not mean there can not be a good Slasher movie. "Opera" fills the description. Although it is part of the Italian Giallo; Dario Argento proves that he deserves the award of one of the best directors of horror. "Opera" is one of the most stylish horror movies of the last 30 years. Although the film plays in a beautiful, shiny place; The situations and the Gore make it one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I think of "Opera" as a stylish slasher, though there is a profound evolution of plans and characters. The cheese factor that is commonly used in most slasher flicks does not exist here, but in return we got an exciting, visually stunning story. The plot of the movie is simple (as with any Slasher). There is a psycho in the opera that is somewhat obsessed with the lead actress / singer and forces her to watch cruel deaths. The death scenes are extremely cruel and the best thing about the movie. The notorious "peep-hole" death scene is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie. It's a terrific death scene that none other than Argento could release. The knife through the throat (and mouth) is another cruel scene, but less violent than the death of the scissors. The bustle in "Opera" will please the evil and lovers of violence. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the movie is the lack of coherence or logic. I mean, after seeing the first death, the leading bitch, reassured as if nothing had happened, is driven home and does not care much for what she saw. She is also alone at home and takes no security measures. Nevertheless, the tension in the film lets forget the lack of logic. Argento knows how to create tension and scare the subconscious mind. For example, when Betty's girlfriend tells her that someone has been watching her from the outside, she freaks out and makes tension if something happens. <br /> <br /> The direction of the movie is great. For an Italian giallo it is outstanding. Argento's creative POV shots are impressive. The ravens also added a scary feeling to the movie. Argento adds its unique spice. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is in my view one of the most underrated but popular in the horror community, in my opinion: -the peep-hole death scene (brilliant) -the ravens end up attacking -the opera cast - the knife through the throat and the mouth - the heavy metal score combined with opera music (this music never freaked me out) - the wildness of the killer <br /> <br /> The only thing I like about "Opera" "It's OK to disturb the audience, but I think opera music could have made it a bit scary, but the 'shocking' use of heavy metal is one unique, disturbing aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> Look at "Opera", even if you do not feel like it, there is a lot of tension and suspense that could scare the most skeptical person, this is not "Suspiria "but it deserves to be one of the best in Argento.
