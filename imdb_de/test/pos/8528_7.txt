Producer Kevin McLory, who owns part of the Bond film rights, is a partner of EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) when he shot 1965 Thunderball, the fourth film of the 007 series. The star of course is Sean Connery. <br /> <br /> In 1982 McLory won a lawsuit and can produce an "independent" Bond movie. "Never Say Never Again" (NSNA) is one of the two "unofficial" 007 films filmed outside of EON (the other is the 1967 comedy parody "Casino Royale"). NSNA is a remake of "Thunderball" and stars of the original Bond, Sean Connery, who returns to the role after many years of absence. <br /> <br /> The movie is released several months after "Octopussy" starring Roger Moore, the 13th episode of the EON series. By the time the press speaks of "War of the Bonds," both films are a great success in 1983, even though "Octopussy" earns more money at the box office. <br /> <br /> NSNA is a Luxurious Film Made by Outstanding Technicians - Director Irvin Kershner, who directed "The Empire Strikes Back", Douglas Slocombe Cinematographer of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" - and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr - The cast is excellent with Connery, a then relatively unknown Kim Basinger, Barbara Carrera, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max von Sydow, Edward Fox ... <br /> <br /> Although everything what the movie is inferior to the original "Thunderball". There are many basic ingredients missing for a real Bond movie: There is not the traditional gun barrel sequence, there is not the "James Bond theme", M and Q are not played by the traditional actors ... It's a copyright reason: Only EON is it allows to use these elements. In short, NSNA lacks the classic cinematic atmosphere of 007. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the movie is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and the women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and beautiful. But the most important highlight is Sean Connery! He is once again wonderful in the role, he is older, but he looks fitter and more beautiful here than in "Diamonds are forever", his last performance in the role of the British superspy before NSNA.
