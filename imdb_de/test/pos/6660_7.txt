I did not manage to completely forget this movie, though I did not see it until two years later. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong - I've forgotten the main story for a long time - The relationship between Kidman and Law did not impress me, but it was the torture scenes in the movie that really impressed me. I cried for two hours directly after the stations. <br /> <br /> I had never imagined how people in wartime could use something as pure as a mother's love. Here are some examples - both in the scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence, because they are hiding their son at home. I was shocked by these scenes and will probably never watch the movie again, as the scenes themselves are now completely clear to me. However, I'm glad I saw the movie just because it made me aware of the horrors of war and cruel cruelty that humanity alone can inflict. <br /> <br /> The blond albino character is on my list of the most vicious villains since I saw the movie. His terrible grin and the lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit me. At some point I wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself (see the movie that pushed me beyond the edge of reason, it occurred to me that I would only hit a big screen - that shows the power of the film and intensity at least). <br /> <br /> I recommend the film for pure experience, not because of the intricate love story, but because of the way it depicts war without needing a battlefield.
