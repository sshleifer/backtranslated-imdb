Intruder in the Dust (1949) Director: Clarence Brown <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> Excellent "Southern Gothic" story from the novel Faulkner about a black man being accused of Murder of a white man asking a young boy with whom he is friends to help him prove his innocence. Lucas Beauchamp (Juano Hernandez) is something out of the ordinary in this small town. He is a black man who owns the land in which he lives, and he does not care much for the sickness of the social order that masters peace here and in many similar small towns. When Lucas is found holding a gun over the corpse of Vinson Gowrie, who was no less shot in the back, the young Chick Mallison (Claude Jarman) (whom Lucas had once saved after Chick hunts on his land) fears through the ice) The city finally has the chance to "make Lucas *****". Arrested, and with a real chance of being gynecated before the night is over, Lucas goes to Chick for help, as he is the only person he knows "not overflowing with ideas." Chick asks his uncle John, a lawyer to defend Lucas, and while the man is initially disturbed by his own ideas, he agrees and they fight the mob to save Lucas' life. The film has a film unusual openness to his time and is largely free of moralization. The lawyer's character tends to speak incredibly confident dialogues that usually sound like something on the printed page, but have minimal impact on the tone. This is a merit of the rich characterization of all others. Juano Hernandez, who starred in Oscar Micheaux films, is a proud Lucas. Porter Hall as the father of the murdered man, perhaps the best role I've ever seen him in, and Elizabeth Patterson as a brave old lady sympathetic to Lucas's case. The setting is perfectly implemented. It is actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, the hometown of Faulkner. Brown also effectively uses the crowd, it's always an anonymous mob against a single person (like Lucas if he's arrested, or John if he goes to his office), which is very threatening. Or the grotesques of the whole city gathered in jail to watch the lynching as if it were a parade. Noteworthy is an absolutely fascinating scene in which Chick and his friend Aleck collect evidence in a cemetery. Robert Surtees (THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, THIRD SECONDS ABOUT TOKYO, BEN-HUR) took the picture. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of 4
