After a somewhat slow start, I thought that this film was about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during the Second World War and became quite a pleasing watch for several hours, mainly from two angles. <br /> <br /> The love triangle is interesting and believable, because I know that it happened in different places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the beginning, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece and Mandras went into battle. After a German intervention, Greece is conquered and the island of Pelagia lives under Italian occupation, in which Pelagia meets and falls in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage.). This, of course, was a dilemma that many young women experienced in occupied countries. When they first met their occupiers, they began to see them not as enemies but as real people, and sometimes fell in love - often to the rejection of their neighbors. I have just read an interesting book about the German occupation of the British Channel Islands, in which this was a big topic. As Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. <br /> <br /> The second background theme is the Italian occupation itself, which in my opinion was portrayed quite realistically. At first it was the contempt with which the island treated its Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy (from a historical point of view quite true) and was really conquered by the Germans. The city's refusal to surrender to the Italians and instead insist on surrendering to a German officer seemed to me something that could have happened (and that was pretty funny.) I loved the line: "We would "Dog as for you Italians.") The representation of the Italian troops also seemed credible to me.The Italian army was never in love with their German allies and never thrilled to fight them, although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt, Italians are more interested in singing than in fighting (which the German troops on the island just can not understand) and are thrilled when Italy makes peace and leaves the country War retreats - until they realize that this could make them prisoners the Germans - it was all pretty well done, I thought br /> <br /> In the end, it breaks with an all too predictable finish, but still deserves praise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
