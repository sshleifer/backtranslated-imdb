When I saw this movie, the first thing that came to mind was the acting of Kelly Overton, a young (and Op and Coming Star) actress whom I first saw totally blown away. She's amazing on the screen and I'm so excited to see what the future holds ... <br /> <br /> The movie itself was good in the sense that it made Kelly Overton do her things and that Wiever takes for a ride ... not I felt like I'd seen it all before ... but a good experience :) I would recommend this movie ... if I just saw Kelly Overton .. This stage actor conquers the screen .. I give this movie has a voice of 7 ... 5 for the drama and 2 for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> And one last time ... I'm sorry for my bad English ... if this is a hoax you: P plz ignore me ...
