Remember - before Sidney there was Dudley. <br /> <br /> Dudley Digges is barely remembered today - his heyday in the sound films was in the late 1920s and 1930s. Apart from a great performance: The good-natured, though tipsy doctor of the ship MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY from 1935, most of his films are hardly revived. More is a pity, because he was a wonderful actor. In 1931, he played Casper Gutman (the original actor who plays this villain) to Sam Spade by Ricardo Cortez in the first THE MALTESE FALCON. At about the same time he was playing the recording angel in Leslie Howard's version of OUTWARD BOUND - the same role that Sidney Greenstreet took ten years later in BETWEEN TWO WORLDS. Digges may be sympathetic and loveable (again this ship's doctor), or despicable (in CHINA SEAS, as the convicted First Mate taunts poor Lewis Stone and then proves he's a big coward in times of crisis). He was able to compete with Paul Robeson in THE EMPEROR JONES. He is the Chinese freedom fighter working with Gary Cooper in THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN. Digges could do anything. Here he is Mr. Thompson, the hypocritical and thieving overseer of a reform school to which Frankie Darro and his friends are sent for having made a robbery and injuring a Greek-American shopkeeper last incident for most of them). Digges is just as bad here as in CHINA SEAS, but it's about to totally like him. He is able to transcend his roles somehow ... more on that. <br /> <br /> Darro has a gang of urban criminals (including a Jewish boy and "Farina" from "OUR GANG"). As highlighted in another review, it is a prototype of the Bowery Boys. We see them shaking off the car owners to pay them to "watch and protect" their cars. If a man does not, he quietly ruins his car. The robbery and robbery in the store of the Greek-American is also quite graphically represented - his skull is broken upon bumping. <br /> <br /> The boys are rounded up and taken to the stern but decent judge Arthur Byron, who declares that he can not let the children stay with their parents: their parents can not watch them or are unable to. Unfortunately, there are three racist stereotypes in this order: a Jewish father who cares more about his business than his son, Farina's stereotype "Yassum" father, and an Italian father whose willingness to co-operate prevents his son from reforming the school. <br /> <br /> Once there, the boys find the regime oppressive. Occasionally one of the guards or the nurse (Madge Evans) tries to work for her. But Digges has no time to indulge. His regime is determined to break the boys so they behave. Unfortunately, Digges and his accountant partner are greedy. They served the boy inferior food and put the profit. <br /> <br /> One day a new state official comes to see the Reform School. It's Jimmy Cagney who is a hacker whose band got the choice for Edward Maxwell. As a reward (he could not get the job as a park commissar) Cagney was appointed deputy school inspector. He is supported by his hanger and factotum Allan Jenkins (in his first Warner Brother movie). <br /> <br /> The irony is that if Digges was a little more cautious, Cagney would probably keep him running. But Cagney comes to see Darro being brought to Digges for fighting. The Warden and Darrow had previously had respect issues, and Digges now intends to punish Darro, who flees - but is severely injured by the barbed wire fences of Digges and his free use of a whip. Cagney stops Digges and has Evans treat Darro's injuries. And she explains to Cagney the reality of the situation and her own idea of ​​a real reformatory reform of the boys, building their trust with responsibility. <br /> <br /> The film follows this to the end and shows Cagney and Evans are on the right path, making the Reformation a "republic" so the boys can walk properly. This conflicts with Digges, whose profitability is reduced because it no longer receives supplies. The system, however, is derailed when Cagney himself states that he may have serious legal issues. Digges sees his chance and uses it fully. But then he goes too far ... far more than he had ever expected. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, there were many films in which children took steps to do wrong and change things. Darro appeared in WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD. Cecil B. De Mille made THIS DAY AND AGE in which the children teach a mobster by Charles Bickford a lesson that scares hell out of him. This is what happened in the 1930s. The mayor of hell achieves a similar intensity of seeking revenge and juvenile justice. But that's the only problem of the movie. Digges' character is a boy and a hypocrite, so we never really cheer him, but if he was not a thief we could follow his view (even if it's counterproductive). The scenes at the beginning of Darro and his gang who fall victim to people actually make the hardness of Digges quite understandable (even if his theft is not the case). Plus, he has a moment when he is rightfully mad at Cagney - at the time he hid from his own clash with the law - he gave orders to a confused Digges on a phone from far away. When Digges learns what actually happened, he is rightfully angry when Cagney informs him of the right behavior. It's what makes Mr. Thompson likeable in this beautiful movie.
