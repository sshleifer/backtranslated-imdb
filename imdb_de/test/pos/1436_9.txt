STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Once the heroin addict Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) comes out of prison his limping jailbird partner Sparrow (Arnold Stang), the needy cripple of a woman Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and on the page Molly (Kim Novak). He tries to grow up as a drummer in a band, but until his big breakthrough By the way, he's busy doing the only thing he could otherwise do, other than being a junkie who spends cards in high-stakes games. And try it too, maybe the prison did not cure him of his addiction to the devil's drug, which caused him to lie to and deceive everyone around him, causing him to take desperate measures to feed his habit , His longing for it is his only motivation for a happy ending. <br /> <br /> When you think of Frank Sinatra, he generally thinks of classic, high-quality songs like Under My Skin, New York, New York, and It Had to Be But you will not forget that he's one too was famous actor. If his performance in the acclaimed album From Here to Eternity is not enough, he will also be remembered for this drama that focuses on what was the ultra-taboo topic at this time was drug abuse. <br /> <br /> The film is often listed as one of the first to provide graphic heroin use (probably the reason for the 15 credential) at a time when it was a topic that was still very much promoted became underground. In his portrayal of the main protagonist, Sinatra is fine, conveying the desperation, desperation, and sincerity of a man who loses every second chance given to him. His cold turkey scene is much more intense than Ewan McGregor's in Trainspotting. The first co-star who leaves an impression is Parker as Machine's demanding, needy cripple of a woman who uses her husband's guilt and sense of duty to do whatever she can. Novak as his secret lover still creates some strong moments, but is less a star than Parker. Stang does his usual comic relief as the hobbling buddy who leaves the lead man behind with his lanky New York accent. <br /> <br /> Director Otto Preminger sometimes slows down a bit, but this is still a bit All the way with a strong absorbing film, with many unexpected twists and turns that should be admired as one of the first films, who brings such a dark motive to life so powerfully. ****
