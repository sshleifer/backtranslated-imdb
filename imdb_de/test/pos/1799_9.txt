"Valley Girl" launched Nicolas Cage's career and was an 80's version of "Romeo and Juliet". It is a clear example of a classic of the 80s. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portrayals in this film, but it will never cite "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as the ultimate '80s movie of the' 80s, because if it were not "Fast Times" then The generation of '80s teen rockers would just be a big blow to the head. That's for sure.
