Exactly there. Good, entertaining and accurate sense of time for most scenes. Enough personality variations to capture the real people of those days without distracting the stories from the exceptions. The credits show Peralta from Mar Vista, California, up the hill from Venice and south of Malibu. I've lived there in the Heartbreak Hotel days, pre-beachboys, next to the surfer boy Bob Cooper on Wasatch Avenue, where the lane was used for burning surfboards that did not work. Old roller skates were used for plywood cutouts to roll down the sidewalks. Things were different in each decade that followed, as the cool innocence of the fifties plunged into the warmth of the sun and the amusement of the electric sixties, and then into the convincingly innovative gameplay and imaginative evolutionary insanity of the weird seventies. The film gives you a piece of this magical moment in time. in a place where the imaginary wave was real ... the source of culturally significant influences. By the way, there's another movie that has a similar American roadside and the same truly unique quality with a relaxed reality that helps to refine the disgusting eternal feeling of cool. "Two Lane Blacktop" (with one of the best examples) of freesouldoit attitude in the history of the west coast of California (Dennis Wilson). As for Monte Hellman, SP thank you for being here with this one. GWR
