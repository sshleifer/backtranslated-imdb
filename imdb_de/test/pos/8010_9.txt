"STEP BY STEP" is in my opinion a pure ABC hit! I can not remember every episode, but I liked it anyway. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred at school. I always laugh about it. I actually think about every single one of J.T. (Brandon Call) and Cody (Sasha Mitchell) were funny. It would have been nice if Penny (Patrika Darbo) stayed on the show throughout the run. Everyone has always done well, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. Finally, I hope that Syndication never stops airing.
