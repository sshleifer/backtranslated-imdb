Although I thought that Black Snake Moan was a great movie playing in the South. The story tells of a man named Lazarus, whose wife throws him off for his brother and finds Rae left on the side of the road and beaten up. Lazarus learns that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child. He decides to take matters into his own hands by tying Rae with a chain to heal her from her wickedness. Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry and their performances make you believe that Lazarus and Rae become best friends through their struggles and the search for salvation. I was also amazed at Sam's ability to play and sing an electric guitar. S Epatha Merrkensen is great for Lazarus' love interest Angela, Justin Timberlake plays Raes boyfriend Ronnie, who is not used much in the film but does the best to perform well.
