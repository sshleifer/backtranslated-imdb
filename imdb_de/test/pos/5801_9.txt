That was okay. It was one of those we got, but we do not have enough evidence, but action. In the few movies I've seen in her, I've never really seen much of Stephanie Zimbalist. As a professional television actress she is nothing really outstanding. Here she was definitely above average because she was the former profiler. Her character got on well with the motley crew of Special Investigation Unit police she was assigned to. There was not really a stupid character you would roll your eyes to, and just despise what was good. It is also good that it takes a while to know who the killer is ... but when I found out I was not so surprised. Well. Another thing that was good was the locations in Los Angeles. If this were done today, they would probably use Toronto or Vancouver, but here they have actually filmed in downtown L.A. I do not know if I would ever see it again, but it was not that bad. My grade: B-
