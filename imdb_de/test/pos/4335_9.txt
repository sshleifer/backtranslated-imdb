This is a hilarious action / exploiter 80's seesaw. Charles Bronson rules as Paul Kirsey. The bad guys are weirdly bad. The soundtrack of Jimmy Page is ridiculously bad. Alex Winter (Bill of Bill & Ted) is great as one of the street punks squandered by Bronson and his crew. Crew? Oh, these are the rundown citizens who band together with Bronson to regain the streets. The whole movie is enjoyable. The last half hour explodes in action and chaos. 9.10
