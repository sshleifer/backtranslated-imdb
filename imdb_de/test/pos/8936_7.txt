Looking at "Plots with a View" (called "Betty" in the US) I got the feeling that more films had to be made in Wales. It depicts a woman (Brenda Blethyn) in a small Welsh town trying to escape her cheating husband. Well, she and the funeral home (Alfred Molina) have a plan ... but there are probably some problems along the way. <br /> <br /> I would really say that Christopher Walken's character is the finest in the movie (how could he not be?). But on the whole, the whole idea is just a really clean moment, stacked with a few "oh" moments ... especially the haunted house scene. It's the kind of movie that I wish I could join just to see it happen. <br /> <br /> Also with Lee Evans, Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyles.
