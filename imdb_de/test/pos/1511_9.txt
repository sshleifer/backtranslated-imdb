"Cat In The Brain" is a series of extremely violent sequences that are joined together by an action that feels more like an overview. She describes the most famous years of director Lucio Fulci in filmmaking. The film could also be seen as a kind of dark comedy that falsely fakes the various allegations that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes even further, he is himself the star, the central figure of the film, and shows the audience, who is the man who stands behind the movie noise. Cat in The Brain is not about presenting a clear story and following it. Instead, he makes fun of some clich√©s that have surrounded the horror genre for years. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci plays himself as a horror director who strives to keep his humanity intact. Years of violent film art have finally reached him. It starts slowly, steaks and meat in general start to disgust him, his colleagues assure Fulci that he just needs some rest. But that does not help and soon overwhelm the grotesque ideas of his films his daily thoughts. In an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously insane state of mind, Lucio goes to the local psychiatrist. Unfortunately, this is more wrong than good and Fulci is thrown into even greater confusion as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who mimics the murders of Fulci's films in real life. The movie retains all the hallmarks of Italian splatter cinema, whether good or bad, they are all here. Any comments on the drama or on the technical aspects and budget constraints are therefore completely irrelevant to the quality of the film. It's a visual experience, no doubt about it. Fulci is throwing in an incredible amount of violence, surpassing everything he has done. Amputated by chainsaw limbs, cannibalism, infanticide and beheading these are just a few of the many grotesque acts seen in "Cat In The Brain". Some of them seem to be recycled from some of the director's less prominent films, but they are not out of context and really feel at home here. As I have already mentioned, the film as a satire of the genre exists much better than a serious piece. The way violence is portrayed helps to establish this idea. Such sequences are rejected shortly after the climax of the film's reality, as it turns out that they are actually scenes in a film that Fulci's character directs. This kind of "film in movie" presentation slightly reduces the influence of the blood. But it does not make it any easier to watch movies. Oh no, that's way beyond the Gore levels found in mainstream horror, and Gorehounds will undoubtedly settle for this fact. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci was a very polarized figure. People either hate his work or love them. "Cat in the Brain" can not convince Fulci's critics on the contrary, but is still an interesting part of his filmography. One that fans should really try.
