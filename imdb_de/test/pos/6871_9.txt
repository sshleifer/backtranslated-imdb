One late night on Tom Snyder's "Tomorrow" show, I saw Tom asking his guest Henry Morgan what he thought was "perfect." Morgan replied, "Everything with Glenda Jackson." And though I do not think this movie is perfect, it confirms this idea very well. I just wanted to use the stereotype that Hollywood does not make any more pictures, but then I just saw "Up in the Air," another smart movie about two people over 35 who fall in love. Here, however, the similarities end. "House Calls" is just fun seeing two pros like Matthau and Jackson and seems to be completely natural while they're at it. I saw this movie in the theater in 1978 (at the age of 18), and it took me another 20 years to joke all over. Any movie that can make headlines from 1920's tennis giant Bill Tilden and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain would not play too well in the Megaplex these days. Another thought: The original theatrical version included a "Walk on the Beach / In Love" montage tuned to the Beatles / George Harrison melody "Something." It seemed a little forced at the time, but this song has since been replaced with a more generic Henry Mancini music queue for later home videos and cable releases. Too bad, because this scene is just here, another victim of hell's music license.
