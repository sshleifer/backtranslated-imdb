No matter which country you need to buy your show in, Sure It's Australian, and if you've ever seen a try of our comedies, they're pretty shitty, but they're not boring with the pursuers. A team of people who care about topical issues talk (a lot in Australia), make fun of our Mistanzeigen, about our politicians, etc. <br /> <br /> The boys also had a show called Cnnnn in 2002. Not as successful as the war that started this year. Therefore, everything they talk about is current news. This is really good, considering how boring or tragic it is to try to throw a humorous light on things.
