I love the Thackeray novel on which this film is based. And while this modern version of Becky Sharp's story is a B-movie, Loy's casting in her first star-studded role is pretty intriguing. Before Loy became MGM's regimented, good girl, he had a whole host of privileges and odd roles, she was an actress. VANITY FAIR was Loy's follow-up film about EMMA, in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroyed the loyal housekeeper (Marie Dressler). <br /> <br /> Loys Becky is much worse than Miriam Hopkins version 3 years later in BECKY SHARP. Loys Becky is a pre-code movie character with her deep cuts and amoral behaviors. It's the kind of character Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could easily have played, but Becky is still supposed to be top-notch here. That makes her fallen character so tragic. <br /> <br /> Unlike Loy's understanding of Becky, Goody Goody Amelia (Barbara Kent) is simply not an interesting character. Mary Forbes is icy good as Mrs. Sedley. Most other actors in this version are pretty pale: Conway Tearle as Rawdon; Walter Byron as Osborne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others are almost Dickensian is their bizarre: Billy Bevan as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; Montagu love as Marquis; Lilyan Irene as Polly the maid; Elspeth Dudgeon as housekeeper. <br /> <br /> Loy is in front and in the middle. While the ending is quite shocking, she has several excellent scenes, such as the casino's gaming scene, in which she tries to steal another woman's winning roulette bet. The more Loys Becky descends morally, the more beautiful she becomes, until she is finally "caught". The bottom line is that this is a very solid performance by Loy in a movie that should be seen.
