Michael Kehoe has done a remarkable job, especially considering that this is only his second start as author, producer and director. In general, the "first timers" lack vision and direction in directing a major production, but "Dominion" proves that Mr. Kehoe is in Hollywood! Dominion has beautiful scenery and features experienced actors (notably Thomerson & James) who communicate Kehoe's grand vision with exceptional clarity. Few movies can combine the slasher / horror genre with a real action / adventure feel, but Dominion has done it all. This movie is undoubtedly one of the best films in both categories. If you are looking for a fast-paced action with more than a degree of tension, look no further. I am looking forward to the future projects of Kehoe with great enthusiasm. Well done!!!
