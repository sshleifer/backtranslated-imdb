I saw this movie for the first time in eighth grade, and I remember it had a profound impact on me back then. I looked back about a year ago (I'm 29 now) and it moved me in a similar way. This is a great movie that embodies the struggle between "principle vs. pragmatism". Voight's character is the idealistic teacher who does not yield to any pseudo-racial leanings of the superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. This story also embodies the struggle as older people often defend themselves against change and, in particular, against cultural change. Often at the expense of children. When these battles finally come to a boil, Pat Conroy loses and pragmatism wins. Or does it The children he has to leave are better suited to know him, more exposed to the "real" world and classical music. The other teacher at the school gained respect for him and he learned a lot from himself. A great movie with a heartbreaking ending. I would recommend anyone who enjoyed the movie to read the book "The Water Is Wide" by Pat Conroy. It will stay with you!
