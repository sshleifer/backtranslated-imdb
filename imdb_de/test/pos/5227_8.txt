Nobody said that in "The Big Trail", and I thought it was natural. Still, this was one of the best westerns I've ever seen and I'm a big fan of horses and gunsmoke movies. The scope and feel of this image is simply mind-blowing and, as someone mentioned in his commentary, it feels like the 3-camera triptych of "Napoleon" (1927). Nowadays, the cost of production and, above all, the occupation of thousands would be unaffordable, but Raoul Walsh has made it. The cast was excellent, though John Wayne was better if he had no lines whipped around. In particular, Tyrone Power, Sr. was a perfect villain - I'd never seen him before and this was his only talking picture. Ian Keith was a snake, but El Brendel is an acquired taste as a comic relief. It can be funny or annoying, but mostly the latter - and it appears at the most inopportune times. <br /> <br /> It's a bit too long and it took a while for the Indians to show up, but this is so close to a documentary about Manifest Destiny and as lifelike as you'll see it, and a must see for movie fans, regardless of the preferences of the genre. When the settlers came to California, I was exhausted.
