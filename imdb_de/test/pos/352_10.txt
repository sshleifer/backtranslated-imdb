As other people have written, I'm a diehard Mario fan and I loved this game. <br /> <br /> This game starts a bit boring, but believe me, it's worth it. Once you start, you are addicted! The levels are fun and exciting. They will tie you up until your mind turns into mush. I'm not joking. This game is also orchestrated and is beautifully done. <br /> <br /> To keep this spoiler clear, I have to keep my mouth shut on details. But try it! It is worth it! <br /> <br /> Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (That's it!) Hardness: 10 Attention Grabber: 10 Average: 10
