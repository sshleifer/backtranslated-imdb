I went to the cinema to see Claudine, and I loved every minute of the cast and soundtrack. Diahann Carroll was never better than in this role. We saw Mrs. Carroll looking down, barely looking naked, smoking a cigarette, drinking beer and cursing her. Whenever this movie was shown on TV and cable was finally coming, I called my friends to watch it. Only the soundtrack from the beginning is fantastic thanks to Gladys Knight and the Pips. We have seen a black woman trying to raise her children, to deal with the pregnancy and everyday life of the teenager, and a man she later learns has problems. Finally, this movie has made it to DVD and deserves.
