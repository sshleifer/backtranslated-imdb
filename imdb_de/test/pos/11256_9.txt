This movie was amazing. Never before have I seen such a movie that has brought me into the harsh reality of drug use. There are no glamorous, sugary or glorifying heroines. This film shows the real struggles, the pain and the loss people go through when they use this medicine. Good movie, decent, emotionally charged acting and a great storyline. A lot of clock! <br /> <br />
