Last but not least!! Sandra Bullock is a beautiful woman, but I finally found a movie where she becomes an actress! Forget the predictable Keanu lining from SPEED, forget about the predictable Kleenex lining DURING SLEEPING - that's what you're testing! <br /> <br /> And she is great! A technofeminist role that works really well on the screen, on a subject that is very close to the bone. The issues raised do not seem at all far-fetched, and the whole experience, with the help of a good supportive cast, makes for pretty annoying hours. <br /> <br /> You can never get into another chat room -room again, in fact I get pretty nervous when I write this report ... er ... bye!
