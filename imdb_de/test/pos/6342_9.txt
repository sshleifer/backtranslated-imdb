At first sight of this mini ... I was a little disappointed that Tommy Lee Jones and Anjelica Huston did not come to the cast anymore. Both John Voight and Barbara Hershey were notable jobs in continuing the saga of this legendary Epic Western. Cherokee Jack Jackson (Haysbert) played a superb villain, and Louis Gossett Jr., as always, was loyal to his outstanding acting skills. <br /> <br /> The drama that In many scenes he seemed to be true to life, including one of the best in which the brave firefight ended with the death of Ranger Walker. I felt like I was actually in the movie. Return to Lonesome Dove was almost the quality of the first series for me. The next 2 Follow Ups with James Garner as Call just did not make it for me. And that Lorena marries Pea Eye? How the hell did that get into her? That was a total difference of characters. The first 2 of the series made the Epic story, the next 2 were by no means of the same quality. <br /> <br /> Well, if the first 2 could be remastered in Dolby Digital and an anamorphic presentation the films could be where they should have been like the movies of today.
