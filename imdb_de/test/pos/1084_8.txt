From Tak Chhappan is a fictional story about a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a hardworking, hard-hitting policeman who leads up a plain-clothes crime squad that has made a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in police raids rather than arresting them in jail. His loyal officers obey him without question, but a split forms as one of his officers, Imtiaz, is frustrated by Sadhu's senior status and secretly competes with him for criminal killings and status. A new recruit is also being pushed into the Brotherhood and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead in his first case. Further changes are being made by a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu's tactics and is all involved in domestic politics. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such a well-directed action thriller from India. The camera work is excellent, the story is well told and the excitement is high when the drama unfolds. The acting, the tempo and the political subtleties persuade the viewer that they are a fly on the wall, watching blood, sweat and tears at close range and from a personal point of view, and that events are based on reality, which is no doubt why It is not the beginning of the film, though it is likely that director Shimit Amin has adopted freedoms with de facto reports. Nevertheless, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film.
