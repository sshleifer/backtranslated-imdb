Do not be put off by the very different reviews of the movie. You will love it or hate it to your own taste. However, unless called "Greystoke" for no other reason, you will experience the excitement of a great actor who is gripping your heart as he breathes life into his role. Ralph Richardson was not a great actor, how perfectly he could handle Shakespeare; Rather, he is to be remembered for his sensitive handling of every figure he portrays. He was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. His reading of the last part of the Sixth Lord of Greystoke is appreciated by all who love the theater.
