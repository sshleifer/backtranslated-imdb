When Melville's "Pierre, or The Ambiguities" hit bookstores in 1852, his first publication since "Moby Dick" a year ago, the public reaction was similar to the IMDB's "POLA X" reviews. Newspapers even published headlines like: "Melville Insane!" which of course he was not. However, if one compares the writing styles of "Moby Dick" and "Pierre," one finds in the latter a sharp deviation from the simple and often declamatory style of the former. Obviously, he mimicked the overly florid style of forgotten Victorian romances, slightly outperforming his immortal "Moby Dick." However, he was not content to find out the kind of product his publishers wanted and certainly would have sold. His version of a Victorian romance was perhaps a twisted, cynical, but brilliant synthesis. The alternative title: "The Ambiguities" is quite appropriate. As Pierre searches and thinks he finds the truth, we become more and more uncertain about what and to whom we should believe. As he seeks happiness, he becomes more and more miserable. <br /> <br /> "POLA X" is a fascinating adaptation of this novel, which plays in modern or almost modern France. In a sense, the imagination is left to us and graphically shows us the incestuous relationships that Melville could only point out. The ambiguities that make the novel and its message so attractive are perfectly in tact. The questions that are raised are the few films that have been thought, but the answers are left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I recommend a read of the novel, which is much shorter than "Moby Dick" watch this movie I hope more people discover this tempting movie.
