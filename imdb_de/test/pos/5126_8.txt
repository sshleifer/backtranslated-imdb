In "Hoot" comes a new child from Montana to Florida. First, he faces the usual problems of involvement and dealing with the local tyrant. However, he soon becomes aware of a bigger problem: a franchised restaurant chain is trying to build a space in the city, right where a number of owls live. This film looks like a family movie, but it is more radical than it seems, since it shows sympathetic how Roy and a few friends are not afraid of breaking the law (including vandalism of private property and short abduction of the manager of the restaurant chain) in the name of environmental protection ( to save owls). One might or may not agree with these actions, but at least the film has the courage not to turn away from its beliefs. All in all a good, solid movie.
