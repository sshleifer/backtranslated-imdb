I love military comedies (Sgt. Bilko, Stripes, In The Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope is weird, but also has a heart. <br /> <br /> The Stingray SS-161 (The USS Pampanito) was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful, a work of art alive. So it was a diesel engine subwoofer, so what? I learned that the Aircraft Carrier USS Ranger (used for The Enterprise in Star Trek IV), a huge ship, was "conventionally powered", which could mean that Ranger was also a diesel. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Buckman, this can has been in stingrays since Korea! This may have expired in 1966! Buckman: (takes his finger and tastes it) What's up, sir? It still tastes of creamy weed. <br /> <br /> Pascal: (shouts) Unless it's DEVILED HAM !! Buckman: That would be a problem. <br /> <br /> It's a story, maybe a bit tense, seemed plausible. Winslow respected Dodge and seemed to take care of him, so he wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave him a battered but still seaworthy Balao-class submarine and assigned him the diesel submarine to dodge the Nuclear Navy and "attack" Charlston Harbor and Norfolk. The 2-star Admiral Graham (facing his third star and a grudge against Dodge) ordered the tattered crew, hoping they would mess it up for Dodge to lose. Can Tom Dodge bring the crew up to date and work as a team, and can he take an old outdated submarine and beat the best of the navy?
