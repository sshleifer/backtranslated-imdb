You see, this is a low budget horror movie that suffers from all the problems associated with low budget movies. But you have to see that to see Lisa Erickson as Julie. She is SMOKIN 'hot and a great little actress! This kind of horror movie has often found a rare gem and The Power has given us Lisa Erickson! I enjoy nothing more than sitting in my studio with a coke and inserting this film. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree. Lisa is not only brilliant, she is also a hot woman. The movie itself often trots along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in this regard. But as soon as Lisa reaches the screen, things bounce. The others are clearly not in their league. This is not the exorcist, but as I said, if you want to watch a funny little movie with a hot little actress, this is the movie you can see!
