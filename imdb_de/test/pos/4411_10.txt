"Meat" is hard to describe with a solid summary, because basically there is no action. The movie is just about the day in the life of a hustler called Joe (Joe Dallesandro, who is in the underrated Louis Malle picture "Black Moon") as he spins his rounds to sleep and tinker with money earn because of the abortion of his lover. Not much, and since the movie takes quite a long eighty-nine minutes, you would think that "Flesh" would be a slow and boring hour. You think wrong. The film consists of improvisation, not a screenplay, and the angles of the film are pretty pretty pretty on the ground as well, but behind every picture is a kind of truth that gives the film its accordingly entertaining vivacity. Everything makes sense and serves what Joe happens that day. He meets a normal John who obviously lies when he says he wants to see Joe again, a photographer who talks so much that it bores Joe, two drag queens reading from tabloids, while Joe gets his head from a maniacal addict Who later murmurs about getting a breast lift, an old friend of Joe showing him rape stories, and then a final scene with his wife and lover, who eerily echoes the film's scene (one of the best openings of a movie) Films that I have seen for a long time)? and completely tells what the film is all about philosophically. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how the messages and styles of the movie feel almost timeless, even though it's set in New York City in the 1960s, in real time, in the right place, and becomes like an obvious independent movie filmed from this era. It's certainly not a movie that could be shot today, which adds to its delicious mystique. <br /> <br /> Powered by unexpected jumps; and missing a score to present his pictures? "Flesh" is about as raw, coarse-grained as a movie about male prostitution in the 60s.
