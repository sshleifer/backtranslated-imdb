This is an action-packed movie that makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed every time I see it. The film (shortly before graduation) shows that despite extreme adversity it is still possible to prevail. <br /> <br /> This movie is very refreshing and can be banned at any time. Get a copy of it before the Thought Police burn any copy they can find. They do not want you to have hope for the future or believe you have a chance. <br /> <br /> However, if Political Correctness does not oppress them, this would be an excellent movie that could be released on DVD. Such a publication could include interviews with the author and the director as well as related treats. I'm sure it would sell some copies and I would be one of the first to buy it. <br /> <br /> - Mincka
