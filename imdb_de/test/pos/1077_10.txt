I expected a lot from this movie and I can say that I was not disappointed. First of all, this film, as a world tour through the winemaking process, allows viewers to enjoy beautiful places. The people interviewed are really interesting and funny, especially Hubert de Montille. The shooting can be confusing. The camera is always unstable and often focuses on secondary elements in the background. You may not like it, but I do not think it's a defect. <br /> <br /> The issues raised in the film can also be confusing, as not only is globalization discussed. Nossiter, however, succeeded in giving his film a consistency all the time. A great achievement of this film is to show all the characters of the wine industry as they really are and to avoid a clich√© of "good against evil". This could be the main difference between "Mondovino" and the documentaries of Michael Moore; Nossiter's point of view appears in a subtle way through the opinions of his favorite characters. The richness of this documentary film is mainly based on the characters, the history of long-time winemaker families such as De Montilles, Mondavis, Antinori and Frescobaldi. Nossiter lets viewers know that wine is somehow related to families and not just a business and an industry. You do not really want to drink wine in this movie, but you certainly want to discover vineyards and winemakers. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film as a student in oenology, and there are many opportunities to learn. I give the documentary despite its technical characteristics 10 out of 10 points.
