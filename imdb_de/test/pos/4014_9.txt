Nowadays, you rarely come across a children's show that is not 1) a youthful pop star as amused as drying the paint. is about unpredictable screaming and incomprehensible humor. About 95% of Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network shows meet the listed criteria. Put simply, they all lack good acting, originality and good storytelling. It's as if producers and authors think children are not smart enough to understand character development and plan details. You could not be more ignorant. Sure, kids enjoy a good laugh and unpredictable behavior (if done conservatively and properly), but since they also want to enjoy a story, see drama and see how people are challenged. They do not want people living in a pristine world where they get everything they want. They know that this world is not just fun and games, they also know that it's not perfect. Everyone has problems and we have to learn to deal with them. This show is about such things. Alex Mack is an average teenage girl who seems to have everything for her ingenious sister Annie. Her mother works in some office, but is sometimes at home at home. Her father, George, is a top scientist at Plant, a chemical company that employs most of the city they live in at Paradise Valley. Alex is unpopular and is favored by most of her peers. Her only friend is Ray (but she gets more friends during the series). On her first day out of Jr. High, Alex is not too happy about going home from school, but a truck that delivers chemicals from the facility hits a hydrant that's trying not to run over her and a weird chemical known as GC -161, there chemical leaks off the water and covers Alex in it. Soon after, she begins to develop strange powers. For example, turning it into a puddle, shooting lasers out of her hand, and moving things with her mind. It also keeps glowing when it's nervous (though we'll never see much of it later). Aside from her sister Annie and her boyfriend Ray, Alex decides to keep those powers secret from everyone, even her parents, for fear of being kidnapped by Plant whose corrupt owner, Danielle Atron, is looking for her secretary, Vince, for the mysterious GC161 child. Each episode is about Alex, who tries to lead a normal life as a child, while at the same time learning to live with their strange powers. The series may look like a girls show, but it is not. As a boy, I liked the show because of its great effects and dramas. The producers successfully add some elements of science fiction to the elements of teenage drama. In fact, some episodes were quietly violent and a bit scary. The unfounded factory directors Atron and Vince are good opponents to the series because the authors really use them as a threat and give them that horrible feeling each time they come to the screen. It's also a wise move to add David, the driver of the truck that spilled the GC-161, as Vince's hobbling assistant on the hunt for weird effects, but you can end up loving him too. It was interesting to see little Alex trying to live as a normal child, but he tried to perfect his powers. Sometimes you forget that they are children fighting an adult-run institution because they are passionate about the story. The show does a good job of dealing with kids by showing Alex that she can have superpowers, but she's still a kid and needs to be careful. Even in some episodes, you'll be upset by Alex's misfortune. My favorite episode, in which Alex wishes she was never born, shows most of these elements. Like I said, the producers never hesitated to add a few laughs, whether they came from Ray's One Liner or George's unusual habits, or from David trying to be a nice guy. Of course, you'll find crazy moments and a whole episode that has nothing to do with the plot of the show, but which good series is not? All in all a great show. 9.10
