I have seen Fantabulosa! Because in recent years, Michael Sheen has become one of my favorite actors, and if you've never seen him in anything before, be ashamed first, and secondly, get a copy of Heartlands or Dirty Filthy Love. This production did not disappoint - Michael Sheen almost magically transformed into Kenneth Williams and gave a performance that was as tragic as it was mobile. Not to take anything from the other performances, but like Kenneth, Michael really stole the show. I do not know how he does it, but with every performance I've seen of Michael, he seems to transform himself until the character he plays is truly and absolutely credible. I have to get my tea, have fun!
