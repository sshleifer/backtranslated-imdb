In the end, it is clear that the killers installed the murder weapon in Mrs. Columbo's car at the Police Police Station. <br /> <br /> But where did the weapon under the hood used in the demonstration come from? Had not the murderers cleared the stuff under the hood? You had a whole week? Or have the bulls of Columbo recreated the camera / weapon under the hood of the demonstration? How did you do that without breaking and getting in the car? Maybe that's why the murders ended up being surprised. But how could Columbo replicate her camera / gun device and have it calibrated on her key fob? Columbo had to recover the gun from Ballistics and replant it under the hood, and was fortunate that the rest of the device with the camera was still there and sent. That was a 10/10 show until the end of this blatant plot mistake.
