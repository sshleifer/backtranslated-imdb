Yes, it is "pinball". The author / director Alan Shapiro, however, has put together a gem from a version. Spectacular over- and underwater photography by "Jaws" veteran Bill Butler and the haunting music of Joel McNeely and Crosby, Stills & Nash make for a truly memorable family entertainment. Shapiro, whose last movie was unlikely "The Crush", once again proves to be an extremely talented and versatile filmmaker. Rent it!
