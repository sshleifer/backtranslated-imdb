This is an incredible piece of drama and powerful that hits you. I thought the movie was great and when I wanted to deal with the two main characters of disability, this was presented in a great performance by both Michael and Rory. Whether the story is a true story, I believe that the story has tried to convey to the audience a message that the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should have the same opportunity like every other person. On the whole, this film reaches into my soul and I too was touched by the actors and the director, who sent creativity there. All in all, some actors go beyond the character of their character and show only part of the character credible to the audience, but I think they were undoubtedly used as their gifted talents to portray a drama masterpiece , Certainly not to be overlooked!
