THE GREEN BUTCHERS (Anders Thomas Jensen - Denmark 2003). <br /> <br /> How come the Danes to these films, which are consistently funny, spicy, exquisitely filmed and filled with great performances? THE GREEN BUTCHERS is a dark and wickedly funny comedy, in many ways the Danish equivalent of EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSEN, but it does more than just laugh or parody. <br /> <br /> The film brings us the duo of chronic pothead Bjarne (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) and chronic swissman Svend (Mads Mikkelsen). The two buddies are ill and decide to open their own butcher shop in a small Danish town. However, business is slow at first and customers are staying out. When an electrician is accidentally locked up and freezes in his locker, Svend decides to turn the man's thigh into filets. He immediately calls "Chickie-Wickies". With this particular dish, everyone in the city suddenly comes to their bar, and Svend, who can not resist this sudden leap into popularity, turns into a serial killer, with Bjarne his reluctant accomplice. But soon many people in the city wonder what special ingredients the two men are using. Without the extraordinary performances of Kaas and Mikkelsen, the film might not have appeared above the level of the average black comedy. On paper, the character of Svend borders on the cartoon, but Mads Mikkelsen's portrait is that of a serious, insecure and deeply twisted man, but Mikkelsen manages to make him both scary, funny and moving. Kaas actually plays a dual role and also plays his comradely twin brother Eigil. When watching the movie, I never noticed that it was the same actor. The other performances are just as wonderful, refreshing every character in the city with some truly wonderful vignettes. <br /> <br /> The subject material is - of course - a bit morbid and the material may not be quite fresh. Some predecessors who have studied the same material have considered it, but director Jensen has a new one Turned around and managed to build some real characters with the weird duo of Svend and Bjarne, with this wonderfully bizarre story of two social misdeeds /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
