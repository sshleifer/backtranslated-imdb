If you have not seen this late '80s movie through the Network News Station Washington office, I highly recommend it. It's a sad comment on the direction of coverage in this country, but tells the story with a joke. The characters are well developed and Albert Brook's performance is fabulous. He delivers all his lines with entertaining, inconspicuous comedy. I'm not a fan of Albert Brooks at all, so this was a welcome surprise. I have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station, and he pointed out that this is close to reality, so kudos to the movie author and the director who did his research Insight into the World of Network News , It's not nearly as dark as another movie, which I also recommend in the same genre 'Network'.
