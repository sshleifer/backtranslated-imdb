After the six members of the Wonder Boys, better known as The Crazy Gang, were thrown out of their last job and barely got a job in the UK, they see a tender in the gold-mining town of Red Gulch in the Yukon Territory. It's from a newspaper clipping, and on the back there's a story in which Chamberlain says the country is better prepared for the war. Off to the Yukon and The Frozen Limits. By the way, it's the case of Chamberlains misplaced. The excerpt is forty years old and refers more to Joe Chamberlain and the Boer War than to Neville in the current crisis. But that's typical for this crew. I can see Stan Laurel making the same mistake. <br /> <br /> When they arrive there, of course, it's a ghost town inhabited only by young Jean Kent and her grandfather Moore Marriott. He was getting old and touched his head a bit. Marriott has a gold mine he lost somewhere in his sleep when he sleepwalks. The Gang helps him better to find that my or the otherwise pretty Mrs. Kent will not marry the brave trapper Anthony Hulme, but rather the salon owner Bernard Lee, a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> This was my first encounter with The Crazy Gang and I can both see why they have been so highly praised in the UK and why they have never worked all over the pond. The jokes came quickly and furiously and then there were a number of things that the code simply did not allow in the US. The jokes are also strictly British and many are simply not understood here. <br /> <br /> The visual agenda is universal, the last scene of persecution deserves everything the Marx brothers did in America. My suggestion is, if you look at The Frozen Limits, take them up if you're familiar with British history, and run them two or three times to make sure you pick up on everything. It will be worth it.
