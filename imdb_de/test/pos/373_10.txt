One of Alfred Hitchcock's three biggest films, along with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps," "Strangers On A Train," is as brilliantly out of control as a carousel in Metcalf and almost as deadly. It's the kind of movie you have so much fun watching that you can not even feel really guilty until you have time to catch your breath a strange, alien, strange person named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) in a train. Thanks to the gossips, Bruno knows all about the problems of Guy with his unhappy wife Miriam and happily proposes to do each other a favor: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno's father, who wants to bring Bruno to an asylum. Guy laughs, but Bruno is not kidding, as Guy finds out at his own risk. <br /> <br /> It's a great condition for a murder story, and Hitchcock gives "Strangers On A Train" a run for everyone It's worth it, with the help of Walker in perhaps the greatest performance of a Hitchcock movie, including Anthony Perkins in Psycho. While Perkins plays a bit against the grain, Walker as Anthony is one who pouts old ladies at a fancy dinner party or strangles a young woman in an amusement park. <br /> <br /> What drives Bruno? Many commentators suspect that his apparent homosexuality finds a match in the handsome guy. Yes, Bruno illuminates the old Gay-Dar, but Guy seems happy enough when the love for Anne Morton (Ruth Roman) recovers. Bruno's interest in Guy might as well be envy because someone making a mark at home in the world makes Mommy hone his nails. <br /> <br /> "Oh, I certainly admire people doing things," Bruno purrs and looks like a cat looking at a mouse. "You know, it has to be pretty exciting to be so important." Later, Bruno calls himself a "bum" who is accurate enough to be interested in him even as he ruins Guy's life with his murderous meddling. It's the ultimate perverted underdog story. There is a sense of integrity in Bruno, in his stubborn commitment that demands our respect and for which Hitchcock is so brilliant. Am I the only sick person in the world who was really happy for him when Bruno disappears from the crime scene? I do not think so, but Hitchcock keeps the story on a right track to see how deep we've fallen. We do not want Bruno to win exactly, but we enjoy his drive while he tries. <br /> <br /> Everything else is so perfect or at least close enough to make every shot unforgettable. Hitchcock always made at least 2-3 good set-piece sequences per movie; Here you can get a few of them in the amusement park alone. ("20 big shows," says the neon page at the entrance, and they're not kidding). Scripting, camerawork, a gripping tennis match, Ruth Roman's stunning figure, everything is too big, as if a movie were included. Even Granger does his Callow Youth thing here with more plausible plausibility than Gregory Peck ever did. <br /> <br /> One can call this a filmmaking clinic, but "clinic" sounds too boring. "Strangers On A Train" is a vicious fun all the way through, and you have a subtle sting on your tail as you find you have been searching for the wrong stranger all the time. Heck, I'll do it again!
