I always had the feeling that Ms. Merkerson never had a role that suited her abilities. She was as Lt. on Law and Order familiar with millions and has been seen in a number of theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. Lackawanna Blues of HBO is changing that, enabling this talented actress to shine as Nanny, a successful entrepreneur in a world that is evolving from segregation to integration. The story, however, is really about the colorful variety of characters they and their adopted son meet in a boarding school in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo - American community of the 50s and 60s from Sweet Auburn (Atlanta) to Harlem (New York). However, the split integration angle is just a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of people in Nanny's Pension. The story revolves around Nanny's relationships with all sorts of people, played by some of the best actors in the industry (I deliberately did not say black actors - this ensemble is an amazing array of talents who happen to be black, except Jimmy Smits, of course) I recommend This movie as a funny and colorful look on a past day.
