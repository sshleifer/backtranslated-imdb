A wounded Tonto standing alone to protect three innocent lives. A devilish woman presenting a deadly plan. Racial tension. Smart Indians. <br /> <br /> These are things that we've rarely seen in the TV series, but this movie puts them all in the mix. This is certainly a Lone Ranger movie, but it mixes the formula so well that those who tire of the series will probably enjoy it anyway. Definitely recommended for every fan.
