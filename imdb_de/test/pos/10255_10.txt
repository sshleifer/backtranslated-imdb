Cooley High is considered one of my best films ever. It certainly reminds me of days of my youth, which grew up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago in the beginning, middle and end of the 1960s. What happened to Brenda and Pooter? Someone has to find the two. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for his innocent joke. Both deserve to be recognized 31 years after the premiere of this film. I think many fans of this film would like to find out what happened to them, as well as others who have starred in this funny movie. I definitely think that this movie should be recorded in some form by MOVIE HALL OF FAME. The entire cast of this movie was great. In my opinion, "Cooley High" is turning back time, those were the fun years.
