Just a great soundtrack. Really nice music. Excellent cast, great lead performance. Worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Does not really explain what happened to the neighborhood. They feel that integration is to blame, or that with the departure of the main character, the neighborhood has been dissolved. <br /> <br /> This movie seems well researched and extremely well made. I especially enjoyed some of the smaller characters like Jeffrey Wright. <br /> <br /> The cutting during the opening sequence expresses what a lively, appealing and desirable experience at this nightclub with jumping music, eating, drinking and dancing, gambling and sex.
