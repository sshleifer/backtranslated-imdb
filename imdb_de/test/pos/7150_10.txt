I was surprised that "Forgiving the Franklins" did not resonate at this year's Sundance Film Festival. There were times when the laughter at the show I saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie. The film has some excellent plays and a story that really leads to exploring more encompassing questions. They know little topics like religion, sex and the truth. Many comedies seem to rely on the same old, crazy situations, many make you think, "I know that they've torn that from a sitcom." I really think that Jay Floyd did a fantastic job on a tight budget for this film.
