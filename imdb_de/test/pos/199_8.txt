When I saw this movie recently, I constantly had to remember that it was made in 1957 .......... and in the USSR! That makes it all the more remarkable. Many of the cinematographic effects in this film seem to be clich√©d in 2002, but were quite original in 1957. I saw this movie for the first time in 1963, when it was first released in the US. I did not see it until 40 years later and have no reason to change my mind.
