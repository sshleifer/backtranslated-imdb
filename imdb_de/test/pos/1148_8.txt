<br /> <br /> Average adventure film that brought a serious story and "Holywoodised" process. The dilution effect, which particularly affected the average script, robbed the place of this film as a solid classic. Why water down such a great story? Probably because they are "sensitive" colonial issues and producers do not want to create political heat, just quick profits. The direction, the cinematography and the soundtrack as well as the acting were good. The charm of Connery made up for his false Arabic accent and all scenes with President T. Roosevelt were masterpieces. The costumes / sets here were very good. Too bad we have not received a serious historical drama, as this is the case what the story demands. Only for big fans of leading actors or fans of exotic romance / adventure Holywood movies .....
