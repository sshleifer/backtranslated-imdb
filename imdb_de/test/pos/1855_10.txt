Return to Me is a movie you want to own. It's a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. Though seemingly impossible, history seeks divine intervention when a man loses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm-hearted performances as designated lovers who meet by chance. But the real story lies in the friends and family around them, who love and support them in difficult times. Carol O'Connor, the grandfather of Minnie Driver, is authentic in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as a friend, whose wit and encouragement Minnie underscores as a "sister" is funny in the scenes, but especially with James Belushi as her husband. Classic scenes and writing make this story so pleasant and touching that you can watch it again and again. Thank you for making a movie that shows families and friends as close-knit people who love each other in difficult times.
