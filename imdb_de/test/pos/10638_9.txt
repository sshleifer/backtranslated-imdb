If you believe that piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in Michael Hanke's film "LA PIANISTE" is the ultimate conclusion in the personification of derailment, perversion and darkness, I have news for you: the piano teacher in Elfriede Jellinek's novel "LA" PIANISTE "(on which the film is based) is twice as" disgusting "," disgusting "," disturbed "and even more intriguing - though there are not enough words to translate the level of artistic ability that Isabelle Huppert has achieved And who could have played this character with so much emotional power, with the best piano playing / dubbing that an actor can deliver? There are two great opponents in the novel and in the movie. "Heroine" Kohut: her own mother (wonderful, destroyed Annie Girardot, who was originally intended for Jeanne Moreau) and Austria herself. The mother embodies Jelline ks perception of their native Austria as a country that encourages racist / fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional suppression deceptive and perverse, and, let's say, superhuman ideals that are not without danger today to hold a mental collapse. <br /> <br /> "La Pianiste" also deals with a very powerful and sensitive topic: How dangerous is it to show your innermost fantasies to the one (you think) you love. We tend to think that our own sexual fantasies must be just as exciting to others as to ourselves, which can turn out to be a big, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake. Here Kohut (?) Learns the lesson in the most painful and humiliating way. <br /> <br /> It must be mentioned that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the most well-known and acclaimed authors in Austria and Europe. Now she has a Nobel Prize!) And that autobiographical passages can be derived in her novel, since she herself was a pianist and had an allegedly difficult relationship with her mother. The novel also contains long passages about Kohut's childhood and adolescence, so that somehow one understands how she has made herself what she is now. Haneke decided to hide this information in the movie and forced us to wonder how she got it (do not we all know an Erika Kohut out there?). But he does preserve the book's substance in his film: unbearable honesty, to the point where the most secret, "terrible" feelings emerge painfully - envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hatred, misery, sadism, masochism, egoism. Perversion, etc. All of them are unmistakably human. <br /> <br /> I thought "La Pianiste" is a very moving movie, very disturbing and thought-provoking, with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that's all I want movies for. It also made me feel excited and enthusiastic about the book, to discover a fantastic author that I had not read before, and to listen to Schubert again and again - so thanks to Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle !!! On the other hand, if you are looking for light entertainment, please stay away. My vote: 9 out of 10 points
