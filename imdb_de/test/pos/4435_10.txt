This is a profound and moving work on the creation of art that is uniquely human and can not be produced by nature, the cost of genius and the search for transcendence and what, in the end, family, d. I was very moved by the family discussion that Nathaniel had had with his sisters about their father's inadequacy, since she was housed in a beautiful house that exuded the warmth Lou had created. And while Esther's discussion of Lou's inability to make money seems so cold, you can see that in many places in her life she must have been a counterbalance to his impulses. Nathaniel has done a great job to show how all the people in Lou's life fit in, finish, and become part of his work like his own genius. Yes, or maybe just our failures make us who we are. And of course there are the buildings. I only knew Lou Kahn by name and did not really associate his name with his work, they bear witness to mercy. Maybe someday there will be a building that we will all fit in, and it will certainly resemble a Lou Kahn building, perhaps the undeveloped temple in Jerusalem. Maybe there is salvation
