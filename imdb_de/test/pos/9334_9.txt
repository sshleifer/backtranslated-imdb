For those who remember the initial effect of this video, it will never be forgotten, and Thriller is enough to make you feel twelve years old again. It's a great video, but it's not perfect, even if it seemed like it at the time. When this video first came out, no one had ever seen anything like it before. Now the music video medium has skyrocketed, and a new look at Thriller will uncover his mistakes. Why did the song have to be deconstructed? As Michael Jackson runs after leaving the cinema next to the girl, he sings all the verses of the song and skips the refrains. After becoming a zombie, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears when he starts singing again, and he sings the chorus again. This may be the first time that a song has been deconstructed to fit into a music video, but it certainly was not the last time. It was still a problem in the age of MTV. The best videos, like Jacksons Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way round. Nevertheless Thriller is a lot of fun and is an absolute must on Halloween.
