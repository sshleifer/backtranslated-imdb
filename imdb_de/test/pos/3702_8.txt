I did not have much faith at first, but as a citizen of Costa Rica, I can confirm that the film shows the reality we live day by day and shows many things of our culture, such as our way of speaking. Our music, our way of standing up for our rights, without fear, without weapons. <br /> <br /> I'm really proud of their work and the fact that they did not forget the message in the film. They wanted us to get it without worrying about the money, but actually working on a tight budget and let us appreciate the beautiful scenarios and the great photography.
