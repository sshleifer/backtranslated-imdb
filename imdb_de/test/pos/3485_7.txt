Due to his predictable, secondary title (which was at least expelled in Italy), I did not expect much from this film. I thought it would be another cheap movie about a haunted house ("LA CASA MALEDETTA" means "The Cursed House"). Well, I had to change my mind right after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the eerie atmospheres reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of his decent Italian rip-offs, but this would be something completely different ... This is more like Hitchcock meeting Italian thriller! Well written and directed, good actors, interesting plot ... OK, I tried not to disturb you watching "7 Hyden Park", which I highly recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> P.S. Am I wrong, or is Joanna crawling or trying hard to stand (she's paralyzed from the waist down), are her feet and legs moving a little too much? (... And I'm not talking about the "bad dream" sequence.)
