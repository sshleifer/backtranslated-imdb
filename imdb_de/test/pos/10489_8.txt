Tonino Valeri's "Il Prezzo Del Potere" aka. "The Price Of Power" is an outstanding and enthralling spaghetti western, which reflects the assassination of Kennedy. A great performance by Giuliano Gemma and an outstanding result by Luis Bacalof are only two reasons to watch this film. <br /> <br /> In 1881, Texas divides into those who value the abolition of slavery and just want to live in peace, and those who still want to re-install the Confederacy after 16 years. Despite the warnings, President James Garfield, who wants to establish a new policy of equality, decides to visit Dallas, where corrupt law enforcement agencies are planning his assassination. Bill Willer (Giuliano Gemma) and two of his friends, a black guy named Jack Donovan (Ray Shaunders), and a crippled guy named Nick (Manuel Zarzo) are determined to prevent the president's murder. <br /> <br /> Since James Garfield was not murdered by racists who wanted to re-install the Confederation in Texas, but in Washington DC by the mentally unstable Charles Guiteau, the history of "Price Of Power" is of course historically nonsense. However, since the film does not claim any historical accuracy, but tries to refer to the 1963 murder of Kennedy in Dallas, the fact that the story is fictitious is legitimate. <br /> <br /> Giuliano Gemma performs excellently as the main character Bill Willer, Benito Stefanelli is great as a vicious and corrupt Sheriff Jefferson. Some other good performances are those of Ray Shaunders as Bill's black friend Jack, Warren Vanders as Arthur McDonald, the adviser to the president, and Fernando Rey as Pinkerton, a vicious rich businessman. The score of Luis Enr√≠quez Bacalov is great, the cinematography and the locations are great (as in Valeri's earlier "Day Of Anger") many remind of Sergio Leone, for whom Valerii worked as assistant director for "A Fistful Of" Dollars "and" For a few dollars more. "All in all," Il Prezzo Del Potere "after" Day Of Anger "is another superb spaghetti western, featuring both the great talent of Giuliano Gemma as an actor and Tonino Valerii As a director, "The Price Of Power" is a must for western spaghetti fans, and I highly recommend it to anyone else
