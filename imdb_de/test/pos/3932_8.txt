I saw a preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a great time! After seeing the first peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (6/10), I enjoyed this much more! As seen in the trailer, one hit I had was the belief that a whole city could be "forgotten", but this is a kitschy popcorn horror movie, so I accept it for what it is. <br /> <br /> My only big complaint I suppose Paris Hilton would touch wax or be dipped, etc. and moan "that's hot", but they did not do that (how could they resist ???). <br /> <br /> There is NO nudity from the 2 girls, though Paris looks great in their lingerie! I am surprised that they did not put a third "hot sacrifice victim" in the film to achieve unnecessary nudity, which is the norm for this type of movie! I will not list any death or conspirators, BUT I will say that both Paris and Eliza are in a good mood! <br /> <br /> The characters are decently developed and a bit likable (not like Cabin Fever, where they wanted to die them) and the movie has a decent pace, although in the first 30 minutes, nothing happens, as in most horror films , <br /> I give him an 8/10 as it provided good fear and greed and I had low expectations. When you meet friends who like cheesy horror movies, have a good time. <br /> <br /> Noah
