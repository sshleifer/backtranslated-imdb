You will laugh, cry and feel on the radio. This story based on a true story is the perfect movie a couple can watch. There is enough for both. Cuba Gooding Jr. portrays the title character in perfection. His performance deserves an Oscar nomination. The sympathy of the movie is obvious. The movie arouses many emotions. I really liked this movie.
