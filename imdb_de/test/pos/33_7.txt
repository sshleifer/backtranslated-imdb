Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through. It describes the life of a strong woman named Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is called a nanny by anyone she knows, but she might as well have been called Wonder Woman. She embodied strength, willpower, confidence, and determination. She owned a house where she had housed almost every type of person the society would reject. Their tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a number of other tramps who scared the home away from the ordinary. At each additional event, Rachel took the step and acted flawlessly. She was not a dictator without pity, but in fact she was the opposite. She showed almost pity, offering so much protection and refuge that she seemed to stretch too far. Merkerson did a good job, but I think that role was in her alley anyway. The film had a straight keel that never turned away from Rachel. Of course, there were dramatic moments, but they were to be expected. Nothing was too shocking or profoundly different from Rachel herself.
