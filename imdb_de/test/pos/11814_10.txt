When the movie "The Cure" begins, we learn about a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenager who lives with his paranoid mother. Next to him lives a boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day, Erik and Dexter connect to the supermarket, where Dexter gets his first taste of butter fingers. When Erik learns that he suffers from AIDS, he tries to drink tea and tea to make it better. But when a New Orleans doctor found a cure for AIDS on the Cover Picture of the National Enquirer, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans. The Cure is without doubt one of the best friendship films ever made, showing the unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend and his best friend's mother, everything is done so well, nothing needs to be changed give not only 10/10 for a fantastic friendship film, but also a sad, but humorous and funny AIDS movie and the tragic finale with Dexter's AIDS contraction is enough to tear me down.
