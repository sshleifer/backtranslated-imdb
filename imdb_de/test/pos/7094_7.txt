One True Thing rises above his potentially flaky material and gives us an insight into a family of complex relationships and flawed, real people. It begins with Rene Zeleweger, who discusses the death of her mother with the prosecutor; save us the cheap filming of a "shocking" illness and death. From there it goes on to a family system in which everyone plays by unchecked rules and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. <br /> <br /> William Hurt as a self-important father and Meryl Streep as a Suzy Homemaker mother are both outstanding. nuanced and not as it seems. Zeleweger cooks, is angry and surprised by himself. Tom Everett Scott does not have much to do but he does it well. <br /> <br /> The story is predictable and takes at least one sloppy turn that she has not taken, but the performances and the family view as a place where anger and love merge equally are well worth it.
