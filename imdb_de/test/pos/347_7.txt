I love everything that the late Al Adamson has staged in his long and varied career, but "The Possession of Nurse Sherri" is head and shoulders above the fun, but admittedly class-Z hits like "horror of the blood monsters" and "Dracula vs Frankenstein". This movie is really scary! Should I say that you jump out of your seat when you see "Nurse Sherri"? No of course not. But these pastiche with elements from "The Exorcist", "Ruby" and "Carrie" is one of those beautiful, weird little horror movies that are common in the seventies. One can not say exactly what is so scary, but the film drips with the atmosphere. (And what an end! Do not worry, I will not ruin it for you.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really got on with it very well, and it does not matter if "Nurse Sherri" was a calculated success Accident. Jill Jacobson is personable, but not outstanding, as the unlucky nurse, obsessed by the ghost of a recently deceased cult leader (Bill Roy, shining in his short role). Geoffrey Land is doing well to her annoying doctor friend. There are some blaxploitative elements here (the bottom line being the profit on those cheap drive-in flicks), but they do contribute to the storyline rather than just a mannequin. "Nurse Sherri" was a "Poverty Row" production and sometimes shows (sets, special effects, etc.). Still, the film has a heart, mostly neat acting and directing, and some real chills. Sam Sherman also considered it appropriate to use the theme music of Harry Lubin for the late '50s / early 60s television series "One Step Beyond," which certainly adds to the scary atmosphere. The DVD contains two distinctly different sections of the film (the early version contains a lot of T & A that landed on the floor of the cutting room to make room for more horrible things), as well as the movie trailer, the TV commercial and a great commentary by Sherman , Does anyone know what happened to Bill Roy, by the way? Alongside John Carradine, he's the best actor I've ever seen in an Al Adamson movie, and he plays the cult leader, as he means.
