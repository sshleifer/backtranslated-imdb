This movie is probably the best new French movie I've seen so far this century. There were some great ones, including Noe's Irreversible, Green's Le Pont des Arts and Hadzihalilovic's Innocence, but none of them comes close to the timeless fame of Les Amants Reguliers. <br /> <br /> The film describes the events of May 68 and what followed, and it is also an update and homage to the Nouvelle Vague films of those days. As for the riots in Paris, the film is meticulously accurate (I'm only 19 and I was not there myself, but you know what I mean), and the almost real-time and very long troubled scenes set the stage for the stage Events in the streets of Paris. The riots are not, as in Bertolucci's The Dreamers (with whom the film is in many ways comparable) glorified or beautifully photographed. Instead, they are filmed with the excellent William Lubtchansky in dirty black and white shots. Filmed in stunning and far less hazy shots, the love story that dominates the movie after the riots of year 68, manages to create true feelings of love and youthful confusion in the otherwise politically troubled and seemingly cold environment. > <br /> This movie is a beautiful love story and it radiates that the director wants to present his own experiences with the mythical late 60's, which makes the movie all the more compelling. However, the film is also a tribute to the entire canon of Nouvelle Vague. Much of the dialogue is reminiscent of the early Truffaut, and the length, structure, and structure of the actions are reminiscent of Eustache or Rivette. There are even Godard-like alienation effects where people look directly into the camera and even address Bernardo Bertolucci directly. Undoubtedly a response to Bertolucci's The Dreamers, this film is a nouvelle vague homage that is still considered a beautiful and radiant love story. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This movie is unbelievable and unbelievable If you love French cinema, you should not sleep on it. It could be the most beautiful French film since Eustache's La Mamain et la Putain.
