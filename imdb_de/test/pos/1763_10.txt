Could this be one of the earliest color films? It's actually the second one. This is a very nice piece of film produced by Thomas Edison. This was one of many of his other films. <br /> <br /> I think this is the most beautiful Thomas Edison movie. It shows a girl who dances and wears her dress, which turns red with the movie. It's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> You look at the story when you see this. You see, what started making movies of the day great! This may not have a plot or something very interesting, but this is the second color film of all time. <br /> <br /> I can recommend it to anyone, especially if you are teaching students to film or something similar. You have to show them what started with the color films!
