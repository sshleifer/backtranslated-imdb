I saw this movie last night at Phila. Film Festival. It was an interesting and funny movie that had some lovely and moving scenes. Peter Falk was just like the rest of the cast excellent. They were believable and played their roles well. The movie may have gone a bit long and the conclusion was fine. The audience laughed in the right places. The family dynamics were great and although this was a Jewish family, they could have been Italian, Irish or any other, including the Greek. I recommend this movie if you want to laugh about a topic that is not treated that often. IOT lets you think about the consequences of your actions and how they affect others in your life and those that are ambiguous in your life.
