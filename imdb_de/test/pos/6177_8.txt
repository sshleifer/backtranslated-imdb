I am Czech and soldiers (not just pilots) who fled Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are for me true heroes and bravest men in our history. This film by the director of Oscar winner Kolya (1996) pays homage to these men. It is the first movie about Czechoslovak WWII soldiers since "Nebesti jezdci" (1968). I think "Dark Blue World" is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, nice music etc. The film is half in English and some actors are British. But the best part about this movie is its existence. It is a great opportunity to show people all over the world (and many people in the Czech Republic as well ...) that the Czechoslovak role in World War II is not only occupied but occupied as an active member of the Allied campaign. <Br /> Main characters are the older and wiser Frantisek and the young Karel. They escaped from Czechoslovakia together, they fly the same season and fall in love with the same woman ... Maybe it's a clich√©, but luckily this plot is not as aggressive and is in balance with other scenes (including great dogfights). , I do not want to compare "Dark Blue World" to "Pearl Harbor", someone likes PH more and somebody likes DBW. But if you like happy ends, DBW is not for you. I think it's a very good movie for those who like these kinds of stories and a very good movie that wants to know something about this chapter of Czechoslovak history. <br /> <br /> BTW, main theme "Dark Blue World" is the Czech composer Jaroslav Jezek from the 30s and 40s. He wrote this topic when he lost his eyes ...
