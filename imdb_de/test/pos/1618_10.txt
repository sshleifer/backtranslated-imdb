OK, I'm a jerk. I loved it. I had no expectations and had all met. It was a terrible movie. I loved it. I managed to erase a DVD of excessive use. Nobody can understand my obsession. I can not either, to tell the truth. For those who saw the movie, this is no surprise, but I asked the videotape employee if I could buy a copy and I could because there were two in stock and only one checked out and more than half of them were times it had been for me. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is awful. The special effects are terrible. Acting is awful, but I loved it. The actors are stupid, the plot stupid, the stupid numerous - as seen by the monsters. The "arachnids" looked like they were plastic bags (maybe they were) o deafening, etc ... <br /> <br /> You really need to love B-Movies to make a treat ... alcohol helps enormously for others.
