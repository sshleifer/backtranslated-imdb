In this movie, the Batman franchise should have stopped. I will admit that the ideas behind "Batman Forever" were excellent and could easily be realized by a competent director, as it turned out that this should not be the case. <br /> <br /> Apparently it was Warner Brothers executives Disappointed at how dark this second Batman movie by Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting something different from Burton and the conservative cowardice of her later decision to turn the franchise into a tribute to the Sixties television series, I do not understand how "Batman Returns" can be considered disappointing at all <br /> It's not quite consistent with the first movie - though it fixes all the minor style flaws found in "Batman," a weaker script that splits the opposition between not just two, but three characters that are not flatter comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Despite all this, it remains a gloriously dark film that remains faithful to the way Batman should always be, and most satisfying. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and his alter ego, Bruce Wayne, who gets tangled with him Max Schreck (named in honor of the German mute actor of the 1920s), his criminal Oswald Cobblepot, the penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant shape, the reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's "Richard III") and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), who loves Wayne both as himself and as Batman. The four leading actors perform well, especially Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of duplicate identities. <br /> <br /> There are some fascinating concepts in this film. The only weakness I can really point out is that in some places there is a certain lack of script, which, in my opinion, is mainly due to the way this film is a four corner fight. There just is not enough time to explore what's going on. <br /> <br /> Still, this is a damn good movie. I highly recommend seeing this in conjunction with the first, and then crying how good the series could have been if it continued under Burton and Keaton.
