To correct something in a previous report, I do not think this movie is for people who know London. This is a very specific situation in which general comments are made. Jack Rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that they should be characters who gain some self-knowledge as they go through this grueling knowledge test Most of the perfectly written dramas I've ever seen: Technically it is extremely adept at conveying quite complex details, but it's also a pleasure when it comes to you. In the beginning, you no longer know about the London Knowledge Test as the main characters, but you are taken straight away until it matters to you. You become incredibly proud of the characters that succeed, and you are crushed for those who do not. Especially one whose downfall, without giving anything, lets fly your hands to your face. <br /> <br /> Nigel Hawthorne's character, Mr. Burgess, is also referred to as a vampire, not Dracula. You do not have to know that, I'm not saying that's critical, but it's a measure of the drama: once you've seen that, you'll want everyone to do it and you'll explain every detail. <br /> <br /> I hope you will see it. <br /> <br /> William
