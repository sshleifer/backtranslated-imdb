Overall, I liked the movie Scarlett. I'm a big fan of Gone with the Wind. I've read the book many times and seen the classic movie. I even have a small collection of Scarlett O'Hara ornaments and other things. I have to admit that Gone with the Wind is my favorite book and movie. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are notable actors and two of my favorites. Unfortunately I could not read the book Scarlett, but I was excited to see the movie. To be honest, the movie is not near the callous of Gone with the Wind and not the actors either. However, Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were pleasant actors in the roles, and Joan often sounded like Vivian Leigh in her portrayal of Scarlett. Dalton also portrayed Rhett at times. It took some time to get used to the different actors, but on the whole I really enjoyed it because I'm the fan of Gone with the Wind. One big disappointment was that Joan had no green eyes and Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Leigh both. I also found Lord Fenton absolutely horrible and I did not like his character. If you are a fan of the wind and / or enjoy romantic stories, watch the movie Scarlett. However, do not expect it to be like Gone with the Wind. It is far from it, though it is interesting with the new characters and so on. I am happy that this is not a remake. Some of the events in the story were what I envisioned as a sequel to the love story of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. If you have not seen it today, get it tomorrow, but tomorrow is another day. :)
