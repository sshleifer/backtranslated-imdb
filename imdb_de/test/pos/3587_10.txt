The Blue Planet series is undoubtedly one of the largest documentary films ever shot on the ocean. For five years, filmmakers worked tirelessly on the series and received material that had never been seen before by anybody (ie, in the title The Deep.). I strongly recommend you to watch this series. Seeing the frogfish outside of the small pictures shown in textbooks is really a treat, but only a needle in the huge haystack of the sea that covers Blue Planet. The BBC takes the viewer on an almost magical journey through the ocean, from the open sea to the tidal pools, the coral seas to the deepest, darkest part of the ocean. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, one of my earliest dreams in life was being a marine biologist, and after seeing this series, the dream was revived. I have studied the oceans of this world for years and seen countless documentaries on coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. Overall, however, no one has managed to capture life under the waves as well as this group. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the series 'Blue Planet' in its entirety, I promise you that you will not regret it.
