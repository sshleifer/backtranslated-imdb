Nevsky is one of the big epic war movies. Sure, others, like Birth of a Nation and Napoleon, had come before, but it's just as influential. Acting is worthwhile, but anyone who knows about Eisenstein for the first time knows that this was part of his film theory. Unlike many of his silent films, this film is about the heroic individual and the group. This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that had come to the fore in 1938. Yet his film shows us the power that can be generated by people who come together to fight something they find evil. Nevsky is just one of many men. He is a prince because he is strongest, but not because he is somehow different from the rest. The romantic angles of the film give more of a personal story than Eisenstein had previously allowed. Not all elements work and the movie is probably a bit too long, but it still resonates.
