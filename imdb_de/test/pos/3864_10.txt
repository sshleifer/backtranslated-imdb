The retired rich opera singer, living in Paris in 1910, decides to give her luck to her beautiful cat Duchess (voiced by Eva Gabor) and her kittens, but the jealous butler Edgar has a plan to kidnap the cats and leaves them in the countryside , Luckily, with the help of streetwise and independent hangovers, Thomas O'Malley (voiced by Phil Harris), they help them get home, especially to meet some of his good friends, such as Scatman Crothers' swinging Scat Cat ) - and try to torture Edgar's plans. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and edgy post-Walt Disney death cartoon with some jazzy sounds like the memorable "Everybody wants to be a cat", good voice and great animation time even in these times of computer animation. Not one of the greatest Disney animated films, but a cult Disney animated film and one of the few gems of its time that works well and is highly recommended.
