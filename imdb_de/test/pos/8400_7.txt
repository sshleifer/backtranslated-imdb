This miniseries is a meaningful sequel to the original Gone With The Wind. If you look at this from your own merit (and not directly follow the original), it is pretty good. I'm sure most viewers will question Scarlett's and Rhett's ideas, but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better. Many of the characters here are new to the story, so comparing them in these cases (Rhett's mother, Uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen) is no problem. Nobody will be Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole production is the beautiful landscape of Spring Charleston and Ireland. Look at this alone. Of course, this was a TV miniseries with a high budget. It follows the book for a while, then it has a whole new storyline as Scarlett goes to Ireland. <br /> <br /> The drama is believable, if nothing special - somehow I feel Roger Moore following James Bond for Sean Connery.
