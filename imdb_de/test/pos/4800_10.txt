Nazarin is a kind of saint, he wants to live just as Christ taught man. But it is too late: now the Catholic Church is in the hands of a wealthy bourgeoisie, the bishops live in luxury and do not condemn the poor and the sick. Therefore our hero can not follow the way in which he is asked by his hierarchy to follow him. Therefore, he renounces everything, and on his way to purity joins a kind Mary Magdelene and a woman who sexually attracted to him (the scene between this girl and her fianc√© tells). In Spain (it was the late fifties), they thought Nazarin was a Christian movie! When he knew Luis Bunuel, that was almost incompatible. Compared to Nazarin and his "holy women" with Jesus is a nonsense. On Nazarin's path grow only blackberries and shrub grass. His attempt to help the workers on the street is a failure being chased as a strikebreaker. All his words mean nothing. At the end of the journey, he is arrested and offers a pi neapple from a woman (bambu sexual symbol). Thanks to "Nazarin" Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where the censors had no idea) and "Viridiana" guide.
