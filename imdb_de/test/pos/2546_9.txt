This is one of those movies, if you see it, ask yourself if it's documentary or fiction. After the film, Ramin Bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the film has a script. Bahrani's camera is dumb, he's not judgmentally organized to make the picture pretty, but do not get me wrong; There is a lot of preparation for this movie. Starting on a personal level, being part of the environment, ignoring the movie. <br /> <br /> The main character is in every sense a 'real' actor. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank the entire crew for this movie and show us another country in NYC. I strongly recommend it if you like stories from others. <br /> <br /> Bora Kizilirmak
