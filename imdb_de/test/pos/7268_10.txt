I am amazed that I have a real affection for this, as I am not an action and adventure lover. But hey ... It's pretty hard to go wrong with a Robert Carlyle movie. I have read several bad or moderate reviews of this film and pulled it apart because of its mistakes in periods or unlikely plot development, but no one seems to mention the more intriguing character transition that looks like a hardened, shabby villain (Carlyle) turns into one rather noble, selfless heroes and how the pretty, cowardly tramp (Miller) develops a real taste for the life of a street man as soon as he "gets the feel of it". Plunkett & Macleane is full of vicious humor, lavish scenes (especially the use of "firecrackers" by the former apothecary Plunkett) and a charming ekklastischen film music. It's definitely worth your while to see the time for ALL CLIMAX SCENES! Shoot them, boys!
