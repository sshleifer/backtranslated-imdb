Impressive! Fantastic movie in my opinion, I did not expect it to be that good! I was intrigued from start to finish - it is a very well made and instructive film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the issues that Darwin had to go through to convey his ideas to the world and to write his life as he " Origin of "Writes the Species", fighting both against personal demons and against the ignorant society of the time to do so, fights hard with his mind, body and soul as personal matters get to a breaking point and even His family seems to slip away while the rest of the world opposes him, as he knows that his findings literally shatter the foundations of their lives, culture and meaning of existence.There is a subtle film (in no way exaggerated in this typical Hollywood -Art, this is a British film produced by the BBC), but thankfully it is very powerful, thanks to the amazingly well-directed Scenes as well as the outstanding acting of Bettany. Connelly looks more like a minor role, but I enjoyed her very much and she's as good as expected, her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and loveable, you could feel the bond and her real husband. Her wife definitely shines through her accomplishments. But the star of the show is definitely Bettany and he does brilliant work, a very touching performance. I understood and sympathized with him as he struggled against his own humiliating health and impending madness, to understand what he discovered and what came to do with what is real and what he means found that his thinking contradicted his feelings and he lost everything, including his wife, who, of course, firmly believed in religion and was a strict Christian while in the field of science, two worlds that are not seen from eye to eye their relationship was at stake. Anyway - a really good, well functioning emotional drama and I dare to say I shed a tear during the tragic climax. It was really heartbreaking and wonderfully poignant and moving. The film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic. I can not wait to look at it again because the first time there was a lot to see what I missed. Easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.
