When I saw this movie for the first time, I did not trust my own eyes. Before me there was a great and well done parody of Valentino ... if Stan Laurel bullfight looks like that, then it looks like he's seeing an outstanding fencer! It is a very good, imaginative parody with a clever and charming stan ... old and good as whiskey. (or the schnapps afterwards)
