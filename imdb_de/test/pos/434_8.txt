Like classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. A must for anyone interested in the French Music Hall (including a song by Ã‰dith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10-minute finale. Dancing in the movie is not at all what is usually for cancan. <br /> <br /> Some may complain about the technicolor costumes and bright lighting, but it does give you a clear view of some great costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Think of it as Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris he grew up in. Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who dislike his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions. <br /> <br />
