I have to admit, when I saw Madonna for the first time many years ago, playing Holiday on Top of the Pops, I said to my wife: "Another US hit wonder that went wrong !! " She wore a terrible wig and was horribly dressed. I have never learned to love her like my daughter, but I have to eat my words. I like some of her stuff and sometimes enjoy her filmed concerts. This Confessions tour movie is great, even if the music is not (and not). I was impressed by the staging and the concepts. Madonna's own performance was backed by the incredible dancers she chose to support. My daughter was present at the London Gigs and was crazy about it. The lady (Madge) has proved my first assessment of her so much wrong !!
