Through the acting in this film, it is sometimes hard not to imagine that the performers are the ones they represent themselves to. Unrestrained passion and acting make this film a very entertaining and compelling film. Had not known HBO late into the night. And the main reason why I value UK movies much better than American ones is that the actors are not afraid to play the essentials.
