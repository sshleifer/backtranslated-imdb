Miles O'Keeffe again takes on the role of the mighty Ator in this first sequel to the original movie. What can I say about that? - That's pretty much the B-Movie Nirvana! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the script is awful, the acting is hammy all the time, the special effects .... well, let's not even go there! - All in all, this movie is a real pleasure! <br /> <br /> Among the highlights of the film are Ator and Thong (his mute companion, not his underwear) who are attacked by unseen invaders in a cave (certainly saved on the fx budget there!). Ator fights with what must be the most compelling giant snake ever committed to celluloid, and of course, the infamous hang-gliding scene! <br /> <br /> But I have a question ...... At the end of the film, we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator allegedly destroyed the geometric core (as the narrator says). .. how the hell did Ator destroy it and make it out alive ?! Did he do some sort of primitive detonation or something else? <br /> <br /> Well, such an illogical ending makes the movie even more attractive - they just do not do it anymore!
