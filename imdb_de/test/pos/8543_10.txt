I saw this movie for the first time in Papua New Guinea in 1967 and have since then been able to remember it, even though I have not seen it since the first time. <br /> <br /> How easy it is to destroy good human lives through pure evil At that time there was and still is a memory that will forever haunt me. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun and immensely sad at the same time and the role that Anthony Quinn played is outstanding. <br /> <br /> This film should be in all college studies about the inhumanity of man towards humans.
