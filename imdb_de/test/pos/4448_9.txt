Lucio Fulci's most famous film, "Do not Torture a Duckling", is well known for its nervous theme, gruesome imagery and powerful storyline. A small Italian village is struck with horror as young boys appear murdered, involving confused and determined authorities and a committed detective in a mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Unlike most fans, who are often on the violent content of the film, I consider it much more dependent on the plot; There is only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (with chains and boards). This in no way negatively affects the positive qualities of this film. Fulci is fully capable of delivering a damned dark and disquieting giallo with childlike murder, black magic and of course a nice full knocker. "Skin" and "New York Ripper" as well as "Do not Folure a Duckling" dominate the giallo Genre as capricious and captivating murder mystery!
