I can not quite explain why I find that so tempting and "The Leopard" not; It may be that the focus here is on everything that was great with this movie. These intimate moments that Visconti can render so magnificently. Like this movie, it is majestically slow, but this time it is not too long. It's a kind of movie where nothing happens, but twenty minutes pass. I think that's partly because of how the movie deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story. Like "The Leopard," he has a sympathetic track that expresses the same worn-out pathos - although Bogard's performance is more likely to turn out to be unlikely, especially in view: he has a really stupid grin that's easy to refuse. In the quiet moments it is often very nice. It is the opulence of Visconti's films, the size of the ball scenes that I find boring, as they exchange individual clarity with great accuracy. But this is part of the point - Gustav is surrounded by a visual noise. <br /> <br /> The way the object of Gustav's affection is presented to us is quite brilliant - the camera shows a girl, girl, girl, then this pretty, feminine boy. It's like an allusion to Shakespeare's sonnets and does not feel cumbersome. (Only when the camera completely looks at Tadzio, pulls back and we see his long, slender legs, we realize that he is not a boy, but a teenager.) First, we have to question Gustav's appeal in an inconvenient manner, Visconti must have known, and he is not afraid of it.) Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav; We get a feeling for the man, we know him. It is a largely silent idea, and when he opens his mouth, it is to spit poison; No wonder he wants the angelic boy with open faces to project on it. There is a difference to Tadzio (we never know him, just as we never know a handful of Fellini grotesques, but that's because his life is different, his own movie), but it's not as flirtatious as it seems ( there is a scene in which he whirls around a pole, that's too much). Tadzio does not necessarily list him - he looks at him; Visconti only zooms in. <br /> <br /> The film does not describe Gustav as gay - Tadzio is not even truly male, he is a handsome version of a boy (tender, pale, wispy, with golden curls) that everyone seems to love (including one) beautiful, slightly older young man with whom he wrestles). They best show what can be understood as referring to Gustav's homosexuality, the famous barber scene revealing his repressed vanity. <br /> <br /> It's not quite successful - the whole department with Alfred is a waste and some unnecessary scenes that people who carry long bags with could have been cut out. Some parts are clumsy, for example when Gustav's boat comes in and wild guys pass him - his expression is too obvious. (But during the same scene, Gustav throws a fit and wants a new rowing machine, something so inexplicable that it makes up for it.) However, there are some scenes - touching for the first time - that build a remarkable, calm intensity , Whenever Tadzio repeats a piano piece over and over again, trembling in the air, this may be the best example of the fear the movie has. There is a discussion that contains a debate that interests me in particular: can art be spiritual if it fills the senses, or does it have to go beyond it? (We can consider Tarkovsky, who appreciates both Visconti and Mann, as the best example of someone who goes beyond mere sensory perceptions.) I think he can do both. 9.10
