Since many other users have already explained and commented on the story, I do not do it. <br /> <br /> But I would like to reiterate that Bardem's interpretation is great, as well as that of the other actors and actresses in this film. <br /> <br /> Reading the previous comments, I've noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film does not stand up against euthanasia and that this little present is ridiculed. In my honest opinion, that is far from true. <br /> <br /> There are many characters moving in a gray area to love and let Ramón Sampedro stay and understand his desire to die. The most obvious is the family. For example, Ramón's sister-in-law never speaks for or against euthanasia. Another such character is Gené (the social rights activist), who instructs Ramón at the last moment to reconsider everything. The scene clearly shows that she does not want him to die. <br /> <br /> Then there are characters that are clearly against euthanasia. Ramón's brother is clearly against it, as is his father ("There is only one thing worse than the son's death, and there is a son who wants to die.") Other users have commented that the discussion between Ramón and The priest is ridiculed and filmed so that we think Ramón is GOOD and the priest is BAD. No doubt the scene is funny, but that does not mean that the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. In my view, the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince Ramón to continue using arguments that are completely alien to Ramón's mind. The priest's speech is "God gives and God takes", "We are not the owners of our own lives, they belong to God" ... and so on. The comedy comes from the fact that Ramón is an atheist and the priest tells him that it is nonsense. This film is the antithesis of Manicheism, it gives the viewer the opportunity to reflect on the subject, form his / her own opinion And above all else is a song of FREEDOM.
