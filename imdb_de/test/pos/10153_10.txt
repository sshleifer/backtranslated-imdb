Am I the only one who believes that this American version is far better than the 1934 English film? The English version is tensionless, looks antique and has a very low budget and looks extraordinary (except Peter Lorre). The 1956 version not only shows James Stewart as a top-notch "innocent" American abroad and gives Doris Day her best role. Particularly noteworthy is the music - the music of American film is almost classic; Compare the "Albert Hall" sequences of both and you'll agree that Bernard Herrmann's music is far more exciting than the original version (even though it's basically the same music!). The only mistake in the 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in I would be glad of any argument that proves to me that the English version is better.
