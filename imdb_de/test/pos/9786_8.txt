Milo is a late 90s overlooked and underrated horror movie, but the feel and atmosphere are more than those of a '80s horror movie. It looks like a few little girls in the office of Milos father, a gynecologist, brought to "see", and as a reward for seeing what's in glasses (yes, a gynecologist plus something else .. .), a girl plays "doctor" with Milo. Hmm, his first patient and he lost her. Now Milo is a creepy little kid who always wears a yellow raincoat, rain or shine, and he talks funny ... but that's not all that's strange about him. Fast forward to the present, where these girls are grown and one of them is planning a wedding, but a tragedy strikes and leaves a girl from outside the city to choose whether to replace her friend as a school teacher or not She does. And then strange things start again. Which of course involves this little kid in a rain sludge. This is not overly violent or graphic, but has a distinct horror that you will not find in many modern horror films, and it is well worth seeing. One wonders why it is so hard to find a good horror movie today, but here is someone who is criminally overlooked and definitely worth the time when you look at it. 8 out of 10.
