I expected this film to be a stinker, but I wanted to see it for myself, but I was surprised how good this movie was. I know that longer films at the box office are often not good, but why this was drawn and should not be viewed by the public, I am not. It held my interest and the landscape and photography is sometimes breathtaking. The plot was good and the moral game was good. I liked the realism, which was based on "unforgiven". I had to borrow this movie to watch it, but it was definitely worth it.
