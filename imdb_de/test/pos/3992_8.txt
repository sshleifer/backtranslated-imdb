Right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an extraordinary person. What strikes me most is the message this film can send to all people there. And the message is sad. It says that it is very difficult to do something that is amazing, or even awesome, without obeying the governments, the establishment, and other VIPs of the world. And even if you try, maybe you can not stand it. It's about the fight of a single person with a system. With many systems. <br /> <br /> A great movie by this wonderful Korean director. Please see it if you have an opportunity.
