I rented this movie without knowing what to expect, but WHOA was a treat for me! <br /> <br /> For anyone who, like me, was waiting for a good movie that combined horror and sci-fi, it's time to rejoice because the wait is finally over. Writing, acting, filming and staging - all first class. I hate to admit that, but I actually cried once (when Dracula talked to the crippled guy). Really an emotional rollercoaster ride from start to finish. The ship's corridors were the perfect scary scene for this story, and the actors could really bring their fear to life. And Coolio as a vampire .... very nice! <br /> <br /> And believe me .... as big as most of the movie was ... the end will blow you away! I know that for some reason this movie looks very bad on this page, but I know that NONE of you saw the end. Brilliant!
