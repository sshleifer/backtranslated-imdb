This movie is without a doubt the best I have ever seen and really shows what British talents can do. Its effects are exceptionally good, considering that the movie was set in the mid-18th century, and all the grubbiness and filthiness of England was captured very well at that time. The characters are developed and pronounced, from MaCleanes fornication and his development to the mugger and "The Gentleman Highwayman" as opposed to Robert Carlyle, who proves cynicism and honor that you can love a thief and a criminal has more honor in his little finger than each of you big bastards! '<br /> <br /> Of course not related to you! But it's probably the most exciting and emotional scene ever seen in a movie, but you just have to see it to find out that this is a rope around your neck. <br /> <br />
