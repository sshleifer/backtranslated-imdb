What impressed me most about "One True Thing" was how it was when the daughter mentioned her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie. The theme was depressing, it was a refreshing change, rather than being blind with the revelation about the fatal illness of a character 2/3 in the movie ("Love Story," "Tenderness Conditions," etc.). <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt are doing very strong things that do not go over the edge. The characters they play are human. They are not perfect people. (One can not say that Streep plays the character "Martha Stewart"), but throughout the movie I found that her character was not juicy noble. She deals with her fate as well as she can. ) <br /> <br /> "One True Thing" is an attentive, unsentimental family drama in which the tears were well deserved in the end.
