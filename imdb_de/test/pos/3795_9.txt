Telling the story would not be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, almost spelled out like "booné aww", is the title of this brilliant late-seventies novel that shocked many people, including myself. Kinderinsel is the title and what an island. In the book Raine, the main character has the Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he is interested in breaking even new records. Especially the youngest person underwater for three minutes. <br /> <br /> The story is, like most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, deliberately provocative and impressive. Bergman started his last movie, and Cries and Whispers was barely over. The expectations for a Swedish film were quite high. They taught us that great theater, great actors, great writers and gifted directors have created a true team of perfection in the cinema. It is also a story of alienation: cities alienate themselves and live in one of them that alienates most of us. It's a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny. It's a movie of overwhelming hope and despair. Feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and isolation from a world that could no less be interested ... <br /> <br /> This approach in itself is a rather difficult way to develop a compelling narrative , The masterful guidance of Kay Pollak to Ola Olsson's script of PC Jersild's novel turns it not just into an opportunity, but into one of those masterpieces of cinema that said this work was almost forgotten. It is not. As I write this in 2009, discussions about P C Jersild's story are being conducted around the world, and the film is being screened in many film schools and small theaters. <br /> <br /> Why? It would be difficult to grow philosophically, and many have already done it scientifically through writing and lecturing. The reason why Barnens Ö was and is a special story is the cozy feeling you get from the beginning when you realize that everything is being told through the eyes of a small child. And here it ends too. Maybe it's a clinical view, as someone else has pointed out. But deeply troubling, moving and satisfying. The concept is deep: as long as we do not have pubic hair, we can live one more day as angels. Then we become what Raine reflects as the colophon of his experiences: "Men are pigs". He finds his fears when he is fearless. He finds love when the world crumbles around him. He discovers a reason not to behave like adults because he commits crimes. He lets go of his inner purity and his confidence without reservation, only to learn how corrupted the soul of a man can be. Where love is expected, he finds hatred. Where compassion is needed, he finds mistrust and cold hearts. It's a movie of metaphors. A movie to think about and raise questions that are difficult to answer but harder to answer. <br /> <br /> In the end, the satisfaction of seeing such a great work (which has really kicked off any other Swedish film) is a ride of joy and hope. Be aware that this is a movie filled with the dark side of our nature. But unfortunately! A movie full of hope and deep joy. Pure will still be an island in Stockholm, but there is great hope to live fully today, even if we found our first signs of sexual maturity.
