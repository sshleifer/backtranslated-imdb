"Edge of the City" is another film that owes much recognition to "On the Waterfront". From the locations in New York, to the score, to the conviction that whatever is in trouble can somehow correct your mistakes. <br /> <br /> "Edge" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. In my opinion, the film does not succeed like "Waterfront". At 85 minutes, the film storms through building relationships, binding everything so fast that it's forced and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers **** The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. I do not think these two characters from two very different places would have built up a strong relationship so quickly. <br /> <br /> I think the entire love negotiation with cassavettes could be eliminated. He's so awkward with a woman it's painful to watch. The only reason it's in the movie is that it can motivate him to do the right thing in the end. There are other ways you could have done that. I would also have liked to see some of Axel's scenes in the army to show why he is the way he is. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is excellent. Poitier is great in a beautifully written role. His role as Tyler is interesting and complex and (especially for 1957) a man who is confident, respected and intelligent. Cassavettes, like Axel North, are very good, but they do not seem right for the role. Warden is the boss who knows Axel's secret (and his fight scene with cassavettes at the end is terribly staged - too many tear-off boxes). I thought Ruby Dee had a wonderful role in Poitier's wife. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Edge of the City" is a smart movie with a very good cast, which too much tries to achieve an interesting noir-style image, without taking the time to build the drama allow. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 points
