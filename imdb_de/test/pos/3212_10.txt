I saw this show from the beginning and am a 45 year old man. For me, this is so much more than a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but still a family. The focus is on mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two attractive, attractive and successful women. Lorelei is based in the fictional city of Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history and a population of people who may be unusual but appear as a dysfunctional family. The series also shows the relationship between Lorelei and her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, old money from DAR WASP, who disapproved of Lorelei's choices in life, although Lorelei does not care. The relationship history and the transit line make this show in my opinion the best in the WB network (soon the CW). Look at this show!
