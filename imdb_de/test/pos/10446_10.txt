"The Last American Virgin" is together with "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" one of the last great teen movies ever made. It is a delicate story of envy and unrequited love playing in the early eighties. The critics said it was a sophomoric, trivial attempt to recreate the magic of Fast Times at Ridgemont High. These critics do not realize that the two films were shot at the same time in late 1981 and released at low intervals. In any case, the studios would never allow such a bold and uncompromising account of the problems that many male teenagers face when they reach sexual maturity. Especially in the face of the daunting discovery faced by the protagonist Gary, he is finally confronted. American Pie is not. The story revolves around a trio of male teens and their mostly unsuccessful sexual activities. Gary is the least successful of the group, hence the slogan LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN. Secretly Gary craves Karen, who is involved with Rick, his best friend. Rick and Karen begin to have sex and Karen gets pregnant just to get ripped off by Rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility that lies ahead of him. Gary slides into Karen's help, leading to the above-mentioned unexpected conclusion. All in all, I find it very successful as a movie, as a comedy, as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men and as a remarkable emergence of an age story dealing with issues such as envy, unfulfilled love and abortion that are as relevant today as they are before twenty years. It also has one of the rockest soundtracks ever made !!!
