I can not really criticize this movie. It's literally the first movie I ever remember, leading to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films as well as prehistoric animals. Fortunately, when he saw it again years later, things were going pretty well. Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths. Nobody believes him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, whose brother was among the dead. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was filmed in India and has a good backdrop. Acting is at a high level. I do not think Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor have ever done a poor job. The mammoths are pretty effective when they finally arrive. The ending also has an unusual twist, especially for a science fiction film of the fifties. Definitely worth seeing.
