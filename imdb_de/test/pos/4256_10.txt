If you get the chance to get this (lost for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has a weird mix of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation - even hints of slapstick, but it's so strange that not only was it ahead of time, nothing has been seen since. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the people who say the movie is outdated, especially with Spike Lee's "Bamboozaled" (SP?) A few years ago, which was a misfire of the attempt, the same message capture. (Good movie work, incoherent script.) Robert Downy's direction is brilliant, so many of his actors can improvise, the movie gets better, and the joke wavers when the one-liner hits miss it forgive like those you find in a Mel Brooks comedy, though sheer non-PC 'I can not believe they just said' fun. <br /> <br /> Favorite parts, the commercials. The film changes from grainy black-and-white images of the advertising agency to beautiful (maybe 16 mm) colors and gets away with it. <br /> <br /> I refuse to talk to any spoilers, but if you have the chance to see the DVD version, be sure to check out the interview with Downey (but leave it alone) the movie.) <br /> <br /> My voice 10/10 - the most underrated movie of the late 60's, early 70's. Thank you, prince.
