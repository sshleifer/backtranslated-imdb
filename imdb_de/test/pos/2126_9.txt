I feel like this movie is so different from so many others that it shows a family of girls who really care about each other. You may have mistakes, but bitterness and defeat have no place with these girls. Try to find this on TV or in the usual movies. It's a breath of fresh air when girls are female - in beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. Unlike the garments in today's stores, d. H. Ragged and faded jeans and jackets, etc. The plot has a nasty thread that, however, becomes more realistic and interesting. I know it's animated, but it still gives you the feeling that families can stick together and get on well. I would recommend this movie to boys and girls alike.
