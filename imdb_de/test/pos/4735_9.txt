When I started to look, I thought I would see a pro-Koresh amateur documentary. However, I had never seen 3/4 of the material used. They interviewed people who said the FBI / ATF had instigated all these things, which sounds like run-down yet, but then continues with FBI video and testimonies. I was surprised. The documentary followed with the Senate investigation into the fire. After seeing the interview and video footage, you'll be shocked to see the Senate and Attorney General Davidians turn their backs on the FBI / ATF's aggression. When you start to look at it, you have to finish it. Otherwise you will think that it is propaganda of that kind.
