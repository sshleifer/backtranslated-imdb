The film Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedy films ever made in Bollywood, maybe even in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> When the movie was released, I was 8 years old and I heard it was a flop, but until now I never understood why it was a flop ... but leave me one say ... this movie would have made more money selling cassettes and DVDs at home and starring in TV movie channels as a popular feature film. This movie has been shown countless times in movie channels, and I think the public is still excited and TV producers repeat the movie over and over again. Personally, I've seen the entire movie more than 80-100 times and I still love it ..... <br /> <br /> The performance of both Aamir Khan as Amar and Salman Khan as Prem is mind-boggling, but most of all i liked the performance of Aamir Khan as a tight guy ... his dialogues in the movie are hilarious ... the story is simple and this one continues ..... <br /> <br /> Amar and Prem are poor, lazy fellows and come from a poor tailoring family, and Amar's father is a barber. Then they both get the news that a millionaire's daughter from London is coming to India to find a suitable match. Both Amar and Prem believe that this is a great opportunity to become super rich ... so both go to Raveena Tandon (the millionaire's daughter) ...... on their journey, they both hate each other and each other they try to fool the other one to marry Raveena ... the comedy scenes in between are so weird that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing ....... and then there is Raveenas uncle (Millionaire's similar brother) Teja, who wants to avenge Raveenas father ..... since he is broke and Raveena's father is a millionaire ...... his plans include the abduction of Raveena to blackmail Raveena's father What he does 2 Butler for ..... but <br /> <br /> Later we learn that there is a twist in the movie (get to know the movie) ....... then there is Shakti Kapoor as a thriller -Master Gogo, who is also incredibly fu nny ...... <br /> <br /> What struck me was the Dialo in the film, which have become a kind of legend. Aamir Khan uses his "Aaila" brilliantly and Salman goes like "OOima" ........ and for Gogo there is "Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Grove to Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi to Gogo Aa Jaega" .. .... and every scene is so funny ...... <br /> <br /> I especially liked the one in which Aamir Khan and Salman Raveena get from Teja and both go to a Luna, the "chillar" Has money in a bag .... This scene is so funny. <br /> <br /> I can watch this movie for anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu. This is a movie I would recommend having a DVD and you will never regret it. ......
