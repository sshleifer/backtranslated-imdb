This is really a great movie. Full of love and humor, it forces the audience to really care about the characters and take part in their journey. Michael Parness has managed to put together a great cast of top players, a small miracle for a first movie. Undoubtedly, they were moved to help him tell this beautiful story. David Krumoltz wears the film with its subtle intensity and honesty. Natasha Lyonne is unpredictable, annoying and yet totally adorable as Grace. Also a great turn of Karen Black (great to see her back on screen) as Grace's crazy but likeable mother. The joke is through and through, so we can make it easier to laugh when faced with the pain of life. The drama is impeccable, the editing is tight, the direction is inspired and the music creates a fitting mood background. With today's Hollywood blockbuster excitement, full of big budgets, big names, car accidents and special effects, "Max & Grace" is a refreshing descent. Treat yourself and watch this movie.
