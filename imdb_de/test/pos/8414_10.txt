James Hacker MP did not expect him to be the next prime minister. Unlike in America, the party is elected in the UK, while we Americans vote for candidates regardless of their party. Despite the differences, the performance of Paul Eddington CBE, as Minister almost became Prime Minister, is backed by his senior advisor, Sir Humphrey, who is played by another knight, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, and veteran Derek Fowlds returns as well. Instead of pleasing some people, he has to please the nation and not his constituency. Now he has a hard job, which is even more difficult than before. Now he has to approve the honor list and work regularly with Her Majesty. Hacker is not a hacking type. He is more than any man we like and do not want to reject and want to turn into a rogue or a vicious dictator. Now we see the Prime Minister's position and all the approvals that need to go on, as well as strikes.
