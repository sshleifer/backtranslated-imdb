Although both this film and the Signature Car Chase have been shown by many critics lack of respect, both are well above average. Roy Scheider does an excellent job with his best guy. a tough, courageous policeman who works hard to get the job done, despite the desk drivers and politicians who should support him rather than hinder him. (He played a suburbanized version of that role, like the Jaws tourist police chief, not nearly as grumpy, but the same as "doing the job despite the politicians") and brave. If a man can not swim and is scared of anything going out in the water on an old boat with an Ahab wannabe and a nerd meeting a giant killer shark, do not be brave, then tell me what is ...) , <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is well suited as a surprisingly complex villain; Most villains actually have some depth and complexity. This is one of those movies that gets better with repeated considerations. Overall, it captures the atmosphere of parts of NY City: grainy, impenetrable, often dangerous, but full of energy. The story is frugal, narrow and subtle; it does the job without any foreign elements. It's not one of the evergreens, but it's an exceptionally good movie. Everyone has an opinion about chases. In my opinion, this one is up here hunting for Mustang vs Dodge Charger in Bullitt. The Pontiac Ventura / Chevy Nova was similar to the Mustang, as it was a compact vehicle chassis with spring-loaded suspension and a powerful small V8 block in an engine bay intended for fade 6. The Ventura / Novas had little respect from the brake bar. However, with the right suspension mods, affordable performance cars were produced that could be used both on the road and on the track. The screaming of this GM V8's is, if they end up, music for the enthusiast. I have heard that this hunt was criticized for "imitating" the Bullitt hunt. The truth is that these are two works by the same master, Bill Hickman, who also choreographed and drove for French Connection persecution. In addition to performing most of the chases, he created a brutal, malicious presence and a good match with Richard Lynch as a pair of cold-vicious killer. <br /> <br /> Yes, the prosecution has "realism mistakes" that are often noticed B. the use of 3 different streets in New York to represent the Palisades Parkway, the end of the chase in an accident with an 18 -Rader on a road only for cars and the wondrous timing that escapes the damage to all pedestrians. That is not the point. Let's be honest: movie chases are inherently "unreal". In Bullitt, The French Connection and The Seven Ups, however, Bill Hickman and Phillip D'Antoni made chases far more realistic and therefore more exciting than the flying, rolling, exploding vehicle chases common in recent films.
