This is the last film of a trilogy by the brilliant Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose last film Mayis Sikintisi, who was a very Cehovian, was shown at renowned film festivals. Unlike its previous films, the story of "Uzak" plays Istanbul, one of the most densely populated cities in the world. In Ceylan's film, however, we see only minor traces of this huge crowd. Rather, he focuses on two characters, a photographer and one of his relatives, who comes from his small village to find a job on transatlantic ships. The photographer, whom we know to have immigrated to the city, does not seem to live on the customs of city life in a material sense. In his relationship with his relative, we first see him as caring and tolerant. However, when he could not find work, our suburban character is disturbed by sharing his private "space" with someone whose exit date becomes ambiguous. I will not disclose the tactics he develops to pull his relative out of his life to prevent harm to your viewing pleasure, but suffice to say that Ceylan shows us the tactics we have in life Acquire suburbs. "Tactics" to preserve our own private space, "tactics" not to communicate with other people, "tactics" to prevent our relationships from becoming complex (since our own experience is complex enough in our view). <br /> <br /> Ceylan's film shows a clear picture of what makes a human being within the boundaries of the modern (or postmodern?) city by portraying the two characters in different ways. But he does not condemn any of the characters for it, but he uses the power of film language to underline this difference. For example, in search of new possibilities, we always see that the character comes from the village in open spaces. Even inside the house he prefers balcony as his favorite room. On the other hand, we always see the photographer indoors and usually at home. Although there are more than 10 million people and many adventures to discover (or are there any) many interesting things, he prefers to sit at home, watch TV, etc. etc. His home is like his temple, a kind of Temple holy place. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lives in a big city and is aware of the experience he is experiencing will find something in Uzak that belongs to him. If you like this movie, you will certainly like Ceylan's other two films, Mayis Sikintisi (The Clouds of May) and Kasaba (The City). Go and find her!
