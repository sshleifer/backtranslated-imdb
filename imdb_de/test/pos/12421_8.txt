This is a surprisingly great horror / comedy on a low budget, it's funny and well done, with good performances and a really cool twist! All the characters are pretty cool and the story of Unoriginal is very good, besides Eric Jungmann (Adam) and Justin Urich (Harley) had fantastic chemistry together. One of the funniest moments in the movie is for me when Adam gets trapped in the bathroom and Harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there and decides to stay in the truck, and Aimee Brooks is just sexy! It's also one of the best low-horror movies I've seen in a long time. It's very bloody, but in a weird way, and I thought it was also very well written, plus Michael Bailey Smith is awesome as a Monster Man and had a nasty make-up! It is similar to movies like Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers etc. and there are some exciting moments here and there, plus The Gore effects are for the most part really well done. This is a surprisingly great horror / comedy on a low budget, it's funny and well done, with good performances and a really cool twist. I recommend this a lot! The direction is very good! Michael Davis is doing very well! Job here, with great camera work, good angles, good use of color and a great attitude, and he kept the movie witty and at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of Gore! , We get extremely bloody nosebleeds, bloody spits, bloody stings, the guy gets cut in half by a monster wagon, human remains in a cooked stew, guts everywhere. A group of people walking around without limbs, bloody squirrel, heads bruised, severed limbs, bloody and mutilated corpses, decent amount of bloodshed, a very bloody scene at the very end and more! Acting is very good for a low budget movie. Eric Jungmann is fantastic as Adam, he was a nerd, but a very likable, he had a fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, had some cool lines and I loved his character, he also seemed to enjoy himself and he was especially happy good at the end! Justin Urich is great as a best friend's ass, although I could just love him because he was very funny and often stole a lot of scenes. I really dug it. Aimee Brooks is great and has done great with what she had to do. She had a good chemistry with Jungmann and as Jungmann was in the end especially good, because I loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man, he looked very scary, had a great make up and is now one of my favorite slitters! The rest of the cast is doing well. All in all, I highly recommend this! *** 1/2 out of 5
