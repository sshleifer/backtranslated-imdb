I have to say I did not expect much with this movie, but it turned out that it was not bad at all. Of course, the most noticeable thing was Aidan Quinn's performance. I would never expect to see this good actor as an action hero. The great thing is that he really builds his character (Annibal). I mean, it was not that Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis would do it, he was sensitive and humble. For example, he is really upset if he kills someone. I also noticed that some clich√©s were avoided. If Annibal receives his education, one could easily expect him to be a rebel and act like an average American in such a situation. He would ask what is going on and refuse to cooperate. But Annibal is a professional naval officer. He does not give up and tries not to lose his courage, which he does very well, with the exception of a brief collapse on Christmas Eve, which in my opinion was very realistic. I am glad that Aidan Quinn had the opportunity to show a different side of him (in fact two, because he also plays the villain), although the film was not so successful.
