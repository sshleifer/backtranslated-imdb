A £ 3.50 DVD can be a gamble and this was one that paid off somehow. <br /> <br /> A decent Saturday Night movie that entertains the obvious mistakes in action. Special effects are a bit far and wide with a bit of repetition (and why does London always look like it's in the 60s?) <br /> <br /> If it had Armageddon's budget, let's say I am sure At the box office, it would have performed better, as the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> All in all, Tycus is introduced to B's film history, but if you see it for £ 3.50, it's worth buying.
