It's been almost 25 years since I saw this movie. I would consider this movie as an absolute classic in a drama category. Anthony Queen gives one of the finest performances of all time. In a few minutes he brings you from laughter to tears. This film shows a great picture of how humanity has changed since the Second World War. How much of this generation and the upcoming one has lost its innocence. It took me a long time to find this movie under the name "The 25th Hour". This type of film is not a money-maker, but for some it is a treasure. I am very surprised why this film is not being used more broadly for the media so that more people can enjoy this image.
