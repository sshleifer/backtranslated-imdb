Personally, I do not like big b / w movies, but this movie has something magical about it. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). "Liz" writes a newspaper section about how she is the Martha Stewart of Connecticut. Of course she is lying. This becomes a problem when their publisher, Mr. Yardley, asks them to play a NAVY sailor over Christmas. In addition, Mr. Yardley, who will be alone at Christmas, invites to the Christmas party at the farm. From there things get crazy. <br /> <br /> Since the film is set on a farm in New England, the film has a warm holiday feeling. Plus, the characters are weird. Mr. Yardley keeps calling orders, and Liz's friend Felix always calls "Disaster!" when things go wrong. Finally, the film ends as a Christmas movie should end; a funny fat man laughs and shouts "What a Christmas!" <br /> <br /> In short, no matter how old you are, you'll love this movie.
