Giant Robot was the most popular Japanese television series ever seen on Indian television. It was aimed at children and we saw a robot for the first time in our lives. <br /> <br /> Many Indian children have even seen a machine outside the textbooks. <br /> <br /> The series also featured a child in an adult organization fighting evil. No doubt many of us who have seen Giant Robot in our childhood long after our own robots and as a stopgap look in the same way on our computers. <br /> <br /> This show was also an ideal adult (referring to Jerry, Johnny's friend and Unicorn boss Azuma). We grew to respect Japanese progress, and still see Japan as the ideal Asian nation. At that time there were no satellite channels in India and the state broadcaster did not show much of Disney cartoons. I think that kids series like the Giant Robot were so appreciated. These days there are pokemon etc., but they are not as intriguing or seductive as a giant robot.
