044: The Big Trail (1930) - published 24.10.1930; viewed 05.04.06. <br /> <br /> BIRTHDAYS: Richard Harris, Harold Pinter, Robert Atkins. <br /> <br /> DOUG: In Hollywood, Raoul Walsh introduced his latest movie The Big Trail. a Western over the trek west across the border, with up-and-coming 23-year-old actor John Wayne. In 1930 we see many "first", but few "best". In addition to the first John Wayne movie, we have the first widescreen movie here (though we only saw the full-frame version). Interestingly enough, the decision to shoot in widescreen format was essentially the same reason why widescreen became popular later: to compete with television that had not yet appeared commercially but was still curious. Nevertheless, this movie was extremely good and gave us a shattering look at the hike to Oklahoma. The opening title cards let us know that this is a Western of the most traditional kind, about America, about the country, who is to live off of it, etc. and is an outstanding demonstration of it. Walsh gives us some amazing pictures of the car company in the wild (when they reach a cliff, they have to shut down each car individually), and we also get a revenge subplot where Wayne chases the man who killed one of his friends ( In Stagecoach I remember something similar). Wayne's hard cowboy routine is at least partially present and would certainly evolve in later films. Since this film is all the work of Wayne's early 30's for the Odyssey, we will not see his face again until Stagecoach, but if we do that we will see him until the end of the Odyssey and beyond. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Ah, our first sound Western and John Wayne's first starring role. It's Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail. This review will be brief, as I have not seen for weeks. I enjoyed this movie, but it was anything but a masterpiece. The most predictable adventure had some surprises, such as when the brain of the bad guys, Red Flack (Tyrone Power Senior in its final role), is killed halfway; I thought he was going to be the boss in the end, but that was Bill Thorpe (Ian Keith). I remember I did not like the way Breck (Wayne) kills Thorpe and in the end takes revenge. I understood that was what he was supposed to do in the story, but he did not like his reasoning when he told Ruth why he had to do it. I think he had a far greater responsibility to the hundreds of settlers he led through the hard west. <br /> <br /> Last seen movie: Animal Crackers (1930). Last movie chronologically: Soup to Nuts (1930). Next movie: L'Age D'or (1930).
