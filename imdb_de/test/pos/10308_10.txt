Regardless of the truth of the facts, Bandit Queen is a true story. It is true because the topics it deals with contain as much truth today as it did in 1994. This film is violent, powerful and thought-provoking. The protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood, whose adversity produced the best (or worst) of it. Leaving aside subjectivity, there is no doubt that Phoolan's character comes from a young girl of 8, married by her father to pay off a guilt (pun intended) of a gang leader who later becomes a leader of the lower caste developed into a champion. Her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer is even ready to give her a massacre. <br /> <br /> I can understand that if Western audiences do not appreciate this masterpiece, Bandit Queen must be 'studied' in the Indian context, not just clich√©s. While I may not be able to sell it in a universal way, it is certainly a must for the Indian public. It is a shame that the film in India had a late, openly censored release. Bandit Queen is the story of a woman who fought two contradictions in India, a woman and a lower caste, her rebellious character and her inability to simply give in, created the most terrifying experiences in her life that only strengthen her life constituted self-proclaimed goddess. She responded to violence by force and became the submissive women's society she wanted. Call it divine justice or a failure of the judiciary. Had she killed a single person, she would have been hanged if she had killed 24 and would be worshiped, respected, and glorified. PS # Who has found his character "psychotic", needs to be sodomized at 8 o'clock, suddenly set in motion by 10 men and presented naked. Then they should be asked. How normal do you feel?
