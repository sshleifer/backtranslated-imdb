I thought the movie started a little slowly and was incoherent for the first hour. In the last two hours, however, it has become more fascinating and surprising. Although it starts like a cheap horror movie, it turns into a beautiful and wonderful fantasy movie. Bridget Fonda is a snow queen. This was her best performance and it is sad that this was obviously her last performance as she has not played in the last 7 years. She embodies absolutely both the beauty and the cold of winter. <br /> <br /> My daughter, 14 years old, thought the movie was a bit scary. So if you show it as a family entertainment, please stay with your child and calm it down, or it's just a fairytale fantasy and not too serious. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the best fantasy movies I've seen in a long while, a bit better than "Eragon". or one of the "Lord of the Rings". It's about as good as "The Golden Compass."
