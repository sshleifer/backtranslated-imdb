The film touches the soul of the audience very much, some scenes in the film are ultimate and tears appear automatically. I'm surprised when I saw this movie that every director can direct this kind of movie in 1925 as a student of cinema I can say that this film helps understand the use of montage a lot. For the first time, when our teacher told us about this movie, the genre of this movie means that we thought there was nothing to understand in this movie, but when Sir explained it, we came to know how awesome this movie is. ultimately, I can say that he contributes a lot to understanding movies. And as a theatrical student, I can tell viewers that they can watch this movie.
