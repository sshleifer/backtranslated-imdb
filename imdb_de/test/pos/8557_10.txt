We do not know why this extraordinary movie was never officially released on DVD ... The performance of Anthony Quinn alone is a must. There are relatively few films in which an actor so deeply identifies with his character, a phenomenon that is always unique to us and to the cinema audience. <br /> <br /> But Quinn's strong portrayal of an innocent Romanian literally torn from his home and his everyday life. Living with powers he can not understand is only part of what makes this movie great. The script is based on a book published in Paris of a Romanian priest who had fled the Communist takeover of his country, and the film manages to delve deep into a little-known area of ​​Eastern European history. The mishaps of Johann Moritz (frankly and honestly, without the political correctness currently so valuable in Hollywood) are a consequence of Kafka-Esquire's blows of fate. They are indeed a laudation on the lost innocence of the Romanian people. it is devilishly ironic that this eulogy was signed by a French director who collaborated with the American money of an Italian producer and oversaw a multinational cast confronted by an extraordinary Mexican-born Thespian. I have seen VCDs of this film in various Asian Internet businesses and I was fortunate enough to take possession of a digital recording of this film aired on the British version of TCM. It is a pity that "The 25th Hour" is not on the future DVD release map of MGM Studios.
