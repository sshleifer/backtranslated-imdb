I gave this movie my rare 10 stars. <br /> <br /> When I started to look at him, I realized that it was not a movie with a strong storyline that I almost eliminated. I am very glad that I did not do that. <br /> <br /> This is a character-driven movie, a true story that revolves around the life of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, beautiful (inside and out) Black Woman and how she does it Lives of so many people in the parish of Lackawanna has touched. <br /> <br /> Very interesting, not only the strong qualities of Nanny and the people who lived in their boarding house, but also a look at how life and community for the African American in the fifties before Integration and the good and bad sides of segregation and how they ultimately influenced and changed the black community. In addition to the outstanding performances of all members of the cast there are some beautiful songs and dances from this period.
