After another robbery in an empty village, Vandan Timandahaf's boss misunderstands the statement by his consultant cryptographer that "fear gives wingers wings" and believes that fear actually makes the villagers fly. They decide to hunt down the Master of Fear in Gaul to learn to fly and turn them into invincible warriors. Meanwhile, the nephew of Vitalstatistix, Justforkix, is sent from the Parisium to the Gallic village to become a man, and Asterix and Obelix are tasked with training the adolescent. Cryptographer's silly son, Olaf, hears a conversation between coward Justforkix and Asterix and Obelix and kidnaps him. On his return to the Viking village, Justforkix meets Abba, daughter of Timandahaf, and they fall in love. However, the Machiavellian and ambitious cryptographer plans to marry his son Olaf with Abba and become powerful. In the end, Asterix realizes that there is no fear that gives wings, it's love. When I was a teenager, Asterix was my favorite comic and I read all the Goscinny and Uderzo stories. This feature film shows all the original elements and humor of comics in a delicious and wonderful animation. The romance of Justforkix and the beautiful Abba is delightful and the situations in which Asterix and Obelix get involved are hilarious. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Astérix e os Vikings" ("Astérix and the Vikings")
