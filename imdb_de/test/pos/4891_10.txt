As an American fan of The League of Gentlemen, I had to wait months to finally see this movie on DVD, but the (torturous) wait was worth it. "Apocalypse" is awesome - witty, freaky, clever as hell, full of jokes and cryptic allusions to the TV series; Basically everything you would expect from gentlemen. <br /> <br /> The plot has been discussed in other reviews, so I do not have to worry about closing it, though I'll say a little hesitantly when I first read it. Obviously, these device figures entering the real world to face their creators were used primarily in Wes Craven's underrated "New Nightmare" and Stephen King's "Dark Tower" books (where King himself was a character). The gentlemen, however, enjoy breaking through the fourth wall and even adding a new element: a second fictional world ("they days"). Soon all three realities are interwoven, and the result is exhilarating: Geoff tips that were knighted in the Middle Ages (and try to court Queen Victoria Wood); the true league of men in Royston Vasey, with characters like Pauline and dr. Chinnery faced; David Warner summons a homunculus outside the church of Bernice. I've heard that some people did not like the "King's Evil" role, but I thought it was funny, especially the figure of Reece (who apparently seemed to channel Judith the "witch" from the third series). <br /> <br /> Regarding the characters, I was relieved to discover that although Hilary Briss, Geoff and Mr. Lipp were firmly anchored in the core of the film, other, more prominent characters had received their respect. Bernice's confessional at first was hilarious and got to know the faster, more sketchy feel of the first series. Pauline and Mickey have cameos (no Ross, weird), though I would have liked to see more of Mrs. Campbell-Jones. Papa Lazarou is considered as well as Tubbs and Edward. All three are used very sparingly, giving their lean screen time an almost magical feel (and just like HELL did dad hack like an obscene hairball?) According to the DVD commentary, a "sponge of greasy pubic hair" /> <br /> The movie looks incredible, but what's new? The music is as breathtaking as always. I was delighted to hear Joby Talbot's new interpretations of theme music, revisiting his easy adaptation of the majestic, charming piece that precludes both the "Apocalypse" and the final episode of the third series. <br /> <br /> I have a few minor ailments - it would have been nice to see more of the old, well-known Royston Vasey, and I felt that the stop-motion creatures (nice by the way) were something were used too little. Both aspects, however, can be justified by the budget of the film so that they are understandable. As much as I loved the new church of Bernice, it would have been cool to see the final battle in the main street (the original vision of the gentleman according to the commentary). <br /> <br /> All in all, "Apocalypse" is amazing, especially if you're a fan of the show. I can not recommend it enough. 10/10.
