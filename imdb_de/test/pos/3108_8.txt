Both Jackie and Candice are great in this movie. They are well matched to their roles and have several chances to shine. Especially the way Candice pronounces the words "Puerto Rican" is very funny because she is as friendly as she can be, but at the same time condescending. I had seen the original of this movie called "Old Acquaintance" with Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They did not seem to be dating, and because this movie is about female friendship, it could have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have supportive parts and are both excellent, especially Bochner, who never got much decent parts in my films. George Cukor did not make another movie after that, so this was a good movie.
