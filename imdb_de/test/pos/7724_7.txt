There were about 60 different movies and TV plays, apart from the classic opera that story of a sex-crazy girl and her hapless soldier lover. This story has been played so often and in different ways. Vicente Aranda directs Joaquin Jorda's screen adaptation of Prosper Merimee's classic novel and play. <br /> <br /> This is the story ONLY of Bizet's opera Carmen <br /> <br /> Pas Vega is an exciting Carmen, full of passion and the ability to make simple men do horrible and tragic things do. Leonardo Sbaraglio is the unlucky soldier who is entangled in Carmen's poisonous web and has done bad things. Jay Benedict is the author of Prosper, who tells this story. <br /> <br /> There is not much action, BUT there are some very hot sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is almost an NC-17 movie. <br /> <br /> as I've seen this story so many times in so many I was not particularly impressed. <br /> <br /> It's a very well made film and will be of interest to those who may not know it. <br /> <br /> My not too enthusiastic review Could be that I miss Bizet's fantastic Opera score. <br /> <br /> See how you might like it, more than me. <br /> <br /> Reviews *** (from 4) 82 points (from 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
