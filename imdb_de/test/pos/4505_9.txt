THE KITE RUNNER is one of the modern epics that you can handle occasionally. This film spans two continents, several generations of families and many decades. He touches a variety of items such as friendship, love, loss and finally salvation. <br /> <br /> It is the engine of the young Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi), a native Afghan boy who often plays with the rented help; especially the young Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), a Hazara boy, whose family is allegedly inferior to the ruling Afghans. But the two form a friendly friendship alliance (Amir teaches Hassan to read), closeness to Amir's house and, of course, hang-gliding. <br /> <br /> But bad times are for the city on the way from Kabul. The Communists are intervening, and Amir and Hassan have separated from Hassan because of an incredibly brutal prejudice against an Afghan boy. The two may never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Amir's father runs to get himself and his son from Afghanistan and finally find their way to America. Here, the two set up a gas station and lived by hand in the mouth by selling on niche markets. And as Amir's father gradually falls ill, Amir will make a new revelation deeply; One that he can not ignore and return to his beloved Kabul. The Kite Runner is a study of friendship, war and reconciliation. He is really a fantastic piece of cinema. History is never inappropriately spoken in English when we are in a foreign country, and only broken English when we are in America. This was refreshing and offered a sense of realism. <br /> <br /> The acting was on par with the best that you will see. Particularly noteworthy is Homayoun Ershadi, who plays Baba, Amir's offending father and strong patriarch. Also lead Khalid Abdalla, as the older Amir is well played, especially if you return to Kabul to find him in ruins. The contrast to when he left. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of Afghanistan during Amir's escape and the ultimate return are breathtaking, with snow-capped peaks that cause your mouth to wane. I'm not sure what mountain range they used in the movie, but wherever I wanted to go there to film them myself! It is a simple story that is told very well and worthwhile for any movie viewer. Highly recommended.
