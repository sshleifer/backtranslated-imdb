Mike Nichols' movie "Charlie Wilson's War", set in the 1980s, tells how the title character (played by Tom Hanks) has staged a covert war with the Russkies to aid the Afghan forces. Of course we know how well this has turned out in the long run, but luckily the movie does not mask the unpleasant after-effects. <br /> <br /> The cast is starred with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts is one of Hollywood's most bankable stars. As a bonus, you will receive the versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman in a characteristically memorable supporting role, for which he received an unjustified Oscar nomination. I'm not a big fan of Roberts, but Hanks is always reliable. Nevertheless, I can not quite accept him as a drug user, although the real Charlie Wilson seems as likable as Hanks. Apart from the Big Three, there is not much to notice, even from a recognizable name like Amy Adams. <br /> <br /> The story is captivating and is underpinned by a beautiful script by Aaron Sorkin. The verbal interplay between the main characters is excellent and full of memorable lines. The later events initiated by the war are not ignored, although the scenes in which Wilson was honored seem too serious to me to achieve the bittersweet feeling that was probably intended. On the whole, Nichols directing is artisanal and admirably follows the plot of the script. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that, like Charlie Wilson himself, has shortcomings but is nevertheless disarmingly sympathetic. Recommended for fans of the three stars and for those who are looking for a committed political drama with a carefree feeling.
