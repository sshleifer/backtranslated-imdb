To make a long story short, the story is paper-thin and you can see the end coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an incredibly young Phil Silvers go through the film and sometimes keep it in Air. Some of the songs are terrible clunkers ("Poor John" is a train accident), but most of them are great fun and the scene in which Hayworth performed on the absurdly huge set of Kelly's rivals, you have to believe. Another treat is the perfect Faux NYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. <br /> <br /> Another attraction when considering such attractions is the screaming male "chivalry" towards women. The oily, laughing, and transparent obsequiousness that was then (at least in the movies) for the male charm is presented here in its boldest form. Some of the men are like a cartoon wolf. <br /> <br /> A small disappointment is Eve Arden, who is so small a role that she has little chance of doing anything. I can imagine many possible weird interactions between her and Silvers - a missed opportunity.
