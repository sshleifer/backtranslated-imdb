This film is about Xavier, an Erasmus exchange student from Paris who spends a year in Barcelona. In this time he changes and grows under the influence of all the new impressions. Upon his return, he has a much clearer view of his life and finally takes it into his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most moving movies I have ever seen, and the reason is probably that of me I was in a very similar situation. I'm from Germany, not from France, and for me it was Madrid, not Barcelona, ​​but I can assure you that this film is an absolutely accurate representation of what an Erasmus semester in Spain will do for you. From what I hear, the story is autobiographical and that's probably why it's so realistic. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some examples (mild SPOILER alarm) - Xavier shares an apartment with other students from Italy, Denmark and Germany Belgium, Spain and England. The apartment looks exactly like all the shared apartments I've seen in Madrid. The main characters are well-developed and some funny scenes arise from the usual clichés. The Spanish landlord is also 100% accurate. - The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine, who stayed in Paris, is also very typical. About 90% of all relationships dissolve during (or shortly after) an Erasmus semester. - There is a wonderful scene in which Xavier tries to convince Wendy, his roommate from England, who is somehow "uncool", to go out with everyone else. He finally succeeds, and Wendy probably has the night of her life. <br /> <br /> Another great thing about this movie is that it is really trilingual: the students in the flat speak Spanish or English and Xavier speaks French with his mother and girlfriend. There are subtitles so everyone can understand what is said. I certainly hope that this movie is never synced somewhere. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that this is just a fun comedy for non-Erasmus people, but for all my Erasmus colleagues, all I can say is this is YOUR movie! If you have not seen it, do it. But be prepared for some feelings of nostalgia ... <br /> 10/10
