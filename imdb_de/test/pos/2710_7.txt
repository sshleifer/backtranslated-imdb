One of the better ones for biopics on TV. I just wish it had told us more. I've read many biographies and seen other things about the carpenters, and this movie has done everything it could, based on the limitations imposed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was no further insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I made about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention), anorexia seems to be a control disease. Karen saw her weight as something in her life she could control. She had the feeling of being controlled in every aspect of her life. Do not get me wrong, I believe that she really loved the music, but she felt that she had little influence on her career. She really loved her family, but they did not express it well and she did not know how to be understood by her family. The movie could have done so much more. I appreciate the music I have from the Carpenters and I wish she was still alive to contribute more to the music today.
