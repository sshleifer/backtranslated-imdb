Lean back and let Director Bharatbala guide you on a visual and sensual journey of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say that you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us in directions that may only exist in India. If you did not want to travel to India before this movie, you will certainly want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene and the mafioso. But it has much more. Thank you, Bharatbala, for bringing us such a spirited and wonderful story. I loved the end. We women do not want illusions in life, we want reality. P.S. I was Carolyn's friend at the Sonoma Film Festival and met you shortly. Good luck with your sales efforts and I speak in the movie like a storm.
