One of the many speculations about Y2K was that the world would end at midnight on December 31, 1999. In "The Book Of Life," author / director Hal Hartley examines the potential impact of a new millennium Armageddon, beginning with the return of Jesus to Earth on New Year's Eve, 99. The story explores the mission of the Son of God, the remaining three of the seven seals which are contained in the Book of Life (now included in a Mac laptop computer), which also includes the names of the one hundred and two 44,000 good souls who are spared on the last day. Jesus (Martin Donovan) arrives in New York City along with Magdalena (P.J. Harvey) to make the necessary arrangements for carrying out the will of his father, but he begins to have second thoughts; Does he have to judge the living and the dead? Do they deserve what has to happen to them? It's a cup that he does not want to embrace right now, which encourages Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan), who fears the fruits of all his hard work will be washed away at midnight, because he can only continue his cup work as long as there are people who cling to their miserable hopes and dreams. Hartley is an artistically-crafted, high-concept film that presents the story in an intelligent, thought-provoking manner, carefully dealing with the sensitive issues in order to harm even the most passionate fundamentalist. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is fascinating and inspiring, as are the effects of their presence on those they encounter during their physical stay in the city. It is a profound meditation on the spiritual side of the fragile existence of man and a consideration of what was prophesied in the revelations of John in the Apocalypse, the last book of the New Testament. And there is a logic in Hartley's approach to the Second Coming. He preserves the aesthetics of the contemporary setting, using altered film speeds that visually give the film an ethereal quality. Christ inconspicuously wears a suit and a tie and fits in effectively with the populace, while Satan's dress is a bit more casual and his looks a bit worn. He has a bruise over his left eye. Donovan is well-endowed as Jesus and gives his character a benevolent air and a reserved urgency that is very effective. It is, of course, a unique representation of the Redeemer, and possibly the best, ever since Max von Sydow's The Greatest Story Ever. He successfully conveys a sense of inner peace and quiet, serenity, that is the core of the character. And Ryan is thoroughly involved in his role as Prince of Darkness. He has a certain way of speaking and a resonant quality in his voice that makes him absolutely mesmerizing to watch. His eyes are penetrating dark, a quality he effectively uses with stealthy looks and mesmerizing looks. He's the type who can sell you something before you know what hit you. It's a memorable performance that contrasts so well with Donovan's portrayal of Jesus. The minor cast includes Martin Pfeffercorn (Martyr), Miho Nikaido (Edie), Dave Simonds (Dave), D.J. Mendel (lawyer), James Urbaniak (truthful), Katreen Hardt (lawyer) and Anna Kohler (hotel employees). In his own distinctive style with The Book Of Life, Hartley has created a perspective of the last few days that is interesting, entertaining and truly unique. He has a way of grasping life as it is just off center, a method that works well with such a movie. For a feature film comparatively short (running time of 63 minutes), he is still one of Hartley's best and is the entrance fee more than worth. It's a movie that will stay with you and perhaps make you think about some things that you have hidden in a corner of your mind for later. And that's part of the attraction of this movie. One notices that "later" is most likely now. I rate this with 9/10.
