OK, so in all Wile E. Coyote Road Runner cartoons, we know that the WEC will set up all kinds of traps for RR, but always mutilates itself in different ways. That certainly happens in "Beep, Beep". Predictable? I think that's the case, but if you think about it, these cartoons show that the more you try to hurt someone else, the more you get hurt. Just as Daffy Duck always tries to undermine Bugs Bunny's integrity, but Bugs sees it around him. <br /> <br /> This is another classic from Termite Terrace. Sometimes I think that if we really wanted to reduce the tensions of the Cold War, we would have let the Soviet Union see the caricatures of Looney Tunes. I'm sure they loved her. Another great. <br /> <br /> PS: I got on "Jeopardy!" Learned. Wile E. Coyote's middle name is Ethelbert.
