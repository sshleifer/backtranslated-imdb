Hilarious, clean, carefree and worthy of a quote. What else can you ask for in a movie? This is my very first favorite movie. Since I was a little girl, I've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble. <br /> <br /> The clich√© characters in ridiculous situations make this movie so funny. The wonderful comedic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) forms the bulk of my favorite parts of the film. And who did not love the hopeless discomfort of Flynch? Do not forget the airport antics of Leon's cronies dressed as Hari Krishnas: dancing, singing and playing the tambourine - unbeatable! The hints are awesome, the locations are classic and the plot is timeless. <br /> <br /> A word to the wise, if you have not seen this movie when you were little, it probably will not win any Place in your heart today. But give him a chance anyway, you may find that "it does not matter what you say, it does not matter what you do, you have to play."
