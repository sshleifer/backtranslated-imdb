Yes. Watch this movie if you like brave movies. This is perhaps the best Mexican image since the Midaq Alley, just because of the excellent cast, the outrageous direction and a great soundtrack. Many people liked "Cronica ??" not, they do feel that they are very aggressive, but they did not understand that this was just a representation with a hyperrealistic image of Mexican society, albeit similar to all families in the Third World. I hope that Benjamin Cann and Bruno Bichir (who in this film is another example of his greatness as an actor) will soon meet again with a new movie. Remember how Los Olvidados (Luis Bu√±uel) was misunderstood on its release, but now let's look at one of the best films of all time. Please prepare and watch this movie.
