This is an above average entry in the Saint series. It holds your interest and, as the mysteries should, until the end guess and has several suspects to choose from. The Golden Age is not for everyone, especially for younger audiences. They date themselves with clothes, cars, attitudes etc. Who demands a highball these days? Or wear a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much easier - it had to be a shortage of lawyers back then. Honestly, there is a lot of value missing these days. <br /> <br /> In any case, you should go and enjoy. It's good - in an old sense.
