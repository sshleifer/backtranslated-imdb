Although "they died with their boots on" are not historically accurate, it is a very entertaining western. Flynn is not only the perfect custer, but also the character actor. In addition to the action section of the film, the love scenes of Flynn and DeHavilland are very touching and believable (Flynn and DeHavilland were very fond of real life). Flynn was always so tormented that he was not taken seriously, if only he knew that there were only a few actors who could play the characters he played, and they played well.
