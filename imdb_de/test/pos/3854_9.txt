This movie is great. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a mother cat named Dutchess and her 3 kittens named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kitten and tries to make her sleep. But he fails. The Dutch girl meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into a song. Everyone wants to be a cat with the song. Thomas loves the music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and I like the cats!
