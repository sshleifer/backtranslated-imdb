I saw this movie for the first time in 1959 at the age of 15 at the Hoyt Double Bay movie theater in Sydney. I loved it and still do it. The cast of the ensemble is great - at that time the actors acted "naturally" and they "felt" in the respective roles. A "brilliant" film of the epoch - the relationships in it are still relevant to today's world, but now the sexes are at the same level. Women would or would not allow the type of treatment shown in the past or not. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a pleasure that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January 2005. Pity scenes were cut before publication - even after two hours you want more! I registered with Amazon for the DVD (they now have a special page). Watching this movie in CinemaScope after forty-six years of scanning and scanning will be great. Twentieth Century Fox, please look into your catalog of 50's CinemaScope DVD productions - there's a big market there. I'm waiting for the arrival of the US in March 2004. Vanity Fair Special article on the film, which is supposed to be fifteen pages of many photos on set. Cheers.
