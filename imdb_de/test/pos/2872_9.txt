Finally a real horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I'm a horror fan and recommend this movie, but it's pretty bloody. I'm not a big wrestling fan, but Kane has really pulled off the whole monster thing. I have to admit that I did not want to see this movie, my 17-year-old dragged me to it, but I am very glad that I did that. During and after the movie, I looked over my shoulder. I have to agree with others that the entire remake horror movie is enough. I think that's why this movie gets good reviews. It's a refreshing change and brings you back to The Texas Chainsaw (first), Michael Myers and Jason. And no CGI crap.
