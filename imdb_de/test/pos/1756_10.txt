Hello, I have thought of this movie all my life. I saw it when I was in Los Angeles, California, in 1942, at the age of five. They forget that these are mistakes that are related to each other. It was as if they were humans. I love this movie and my adult kids too. Such a nice color in this movie. I have to see this movie again. There's a story about an envelope in the movie that I just can not remember. <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
