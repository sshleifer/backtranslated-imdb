We came across this show on a Sunday morning at 6:30 am and flipped through all the cable channels. This turned out to be the best show! It is absolutely adorable. We need shows like this for kids (and adults, since I'm certainly well beyond my childhood years.) As highlighted in one of the other comments, this show benefits from the simplicity of the characters and storylines. The dolls are fantastically cute, the backgrounds are colorful and although they were created from cardboard, foam, paint and pure imagination, they remind us of our own childhood when we spent the day at our own grandma exploring the world around around us. For those who have never been lucky enough to have a grandma as nice as Nana, this show is for you, you will make up for the lost time! This show is a true inspiration and filled with wisdom and humor and just fun for kids and adults. In other words, do not miss this show just because you are over three years old! Spend half an hour with Mona, Nana, Mr. Wooka and Russell. You will be friends that you are looking forward to!
