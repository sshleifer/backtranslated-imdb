My wife and I saw this when we were 17 years old. The only good thing my dad ever did (get us in). This is "our movie" and the music is "our songs". Michelle's song is "our" song. Yeah, it's a crime to show naked kids on screen these days, but we shit at 16, why not these kids? The film is a rich boy who impregnates the poor girl, then the rich dad steals him in the end, after she has born under impoverished conditions. She stays alone with the child. It's a love story and an "adult" story. The music is fantastic and history is one with which every human being can identify. Maybe someday it will be released on DVD.
