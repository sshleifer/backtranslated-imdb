Challen Cates does a wonderful job of representing a contradictory bride, between the challenges she expects professionally, the memories of the freedom she believed she had in college (inspired by a famous author) and the security of her upcoming marriage to one Man she really does not love. This movie is definitely worth watching - as predictable as it may be, the drama is inspiring and real chemistry exists between Challen Cates and Malcolm Jamaal Warner.
