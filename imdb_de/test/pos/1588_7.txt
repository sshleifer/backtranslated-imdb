Luchino Visconti has become famous around the world for his great production THE LEOPARD. Film fans got to know the style of the director, who introduced himself as one of the postwar realists, an aristocrat who developed his individual free thinking and expressed himself as an artist. This film, MORTE A VENEZIA, based on the novel by Thomas Mann, is a slightly different story. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the entire film is so unique, so psychologically and so much influenced by the different ideas of an artist (both director and main character Gustav von Aschenbach), that it seems "unsurpassable" for many viewers. to be. Therefore, such opinions about the film as "too slow", "unbearable" or "endless boredom" on. Why? The reason seems to lie in a significant view, which is widespread nowadays: "GOOD FILM IS PARALLEL TO FLAWLESS ACTION". Here it would be appropriate to say: "GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLEL TO NO ACTION". In fact, everyone could say one sentence about the content of the entire film, and that would be enough. Everything we find in MORTE A VENEZIA has a sense of vague reality that is both profound and superficial, and that seems significant to every single moment. And when we see the psychedelic scenes in Venice, when we see Gustav at the train station, when we are provided with his emotional memories. The insight into his decaying mind is sometimes so intense that the viewer can only watch the movie if he does his best to feel and experience rather than see and think. Everything has faded to wither, like flowers in the meadow when their time comes. In other words, everything has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogues. Therefore, after a single consideration, it is unlikely that you will get the idea of ​​the movie. It has to be seen more than twice with the spirit that is constantly open. Whether you like it or not ... that's another, very personal story. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​are the factor that can be felt at first glance and stays with us throughout. Beauty as something very meaningful for the main character who seems and seems to be walking; rest as something he is heading for so badly and that comes to him in an unexpected way; the feeling of being in a teenager who appears as a model of all dreams and desires, as the forbidden fruit of homosexual pleasure that disappears. The costume designer Piero Tosi does an excellent job in this film. Through many wonderful wardrobes he gives us a very realistic view of the year 1911, as the action takes place. The cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis offers us a fantastic visual experience that can be described as eye candy. And in the background the music of Gustav Mahler, the composer whose life inspired Thomas Mann to introduce the character. <br /> <br /> The performances are first class, especially by Dirk Bogart as the main character, Gustav von Aschenbach, who wants to rest after a hard artistic job and tries in vain to find her in the crowded Venice. For much of the film, we have a great deal of insight into his thoughts, feelings and acts of anger, exhaustion and despair. Although depressing at times, he keeps us on the right track until the end and does not lose hope for the less tragic end ... Tadzio (Bjorn Andersen) shows the model of a decadent homosexual desire, but also a model of beauty and purity , which seems rather long lasting ... "Adieu Tadzio, it was all too short," says the main character. Mark Burns does a big, if controversial, job as a kind of "super-ego" Alfred, with whom Gustav Polemik talks about ideals like beauty, justice, hope and human dignity. For Alfred beauty belongs to the senses. How joyful, how dangerous the idea may be! Silvana Mangano, an elegant lady from Poland, Tadzio's mother, is present in artistic Italian films of the time. <br /> <br /> Memorable moments make up the movie's strengths; but not all viewers will find it unforgettable. Like the whole movie, they require a lot of effort to get on the right track in the individual ego of the director and in the four walls of his psyche. Under such scenes, I think the beach sequence is quite important, especially the way Gustav Tadzio observes. The physical distance is precisely the lack of courage to get closer ... I also appreciate the attitudes when Gustav sits in the gondola and the city's gaze fades into the background - as it may be memorable - for existential thoughts of reflection wake up. Are not we humans, a kind of "passanger" in the world, on the journey that is life. <br /> <br /> In the end I have to tell you one important thing. I found MORTE A VENEZIA extremely funny until I started to get more involved with what the director was really trying to convey. Then it turned out that every scene is meaningful in their interpretation that you do not need to agree with (I hardly agree with the main character), but you should at least tolerate this as something the author desperately wanted to say. Listen to his voice, let him say a few words on one side of the reality ... <br /> <br /> Therefore, the movie is far from understanding, since 1971 and 1971 not many such films were shot done now. It seems paradoxical that in the long run we all will have the right feelings for this film, just as we all have to experience a strange, inevitable, normally unexpected reality, that death ... 7/10
