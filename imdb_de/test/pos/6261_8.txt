This is a beautiful, funny, lively movie. It's even better than "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" - which is parallel but not replicated. The story closes a whole circle and the theater beamed as the credits rolled. One hundred years after this story took place, we are equally fascinated by flickering images in a dark theater.
