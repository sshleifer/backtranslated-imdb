Is it a perfect movie? It's a weird adaptation of a sci-fi book, offering vampires from space, nude beauties, and the efficiency of the British Army. When I saw this movie for the first time, I was pretty young and all I can remember the feeling of reverence for the movie and Mathilda May. If this gorgeous lady did not have the whole movie naked I'd probably have her not so highly rated, but considering their magnificent splendor, I am now considering thinking about it! Luckily, I was reminded of the movie and have now watched it again. Imagine, Raiders of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist special effects splashed into a pretty decent science fiction story, but with absolute excellence. I still enjoyed the movie very much (as did Mathilda May), but it was a mix of nostalgia that compares to the crap films they do today and actually wants more when the movie comes to an end. They are a science Fiction fan and may not miss this movie. Oh, and did I mention that Mathilda May is young, beautiful and naked?
