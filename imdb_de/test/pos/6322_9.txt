A variation of the same plot was used in a Simon & Simon episode (Thin Air), originally aired in December 1982. <br /> <br /> The sex of the victim has been changed, the surviving spouse is one of Rick's "old flames". It's also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney had a role in this Rockford episode. <br /> <br /> Both episodes were based on a story by Howard Browne - as noted in the 'Writing Credits' list. <br /> <br /> Anthony James plays one of his classic TV villain roles. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the concept between the Rockford Files to Magnum PI up to Simon & Simon is quite interesting.
