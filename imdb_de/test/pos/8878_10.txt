This movie was one of the laughter movies that I've ever seen on the floor. Danny De Vito plays Owen perfectly. Momma is brilliantly portrayed and was one of the highlights of the film. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, it starts differently than what you would expect. Larry tries to write a book and has some problems. Larry is teaching a typing lesson, and Owen has been tagging for Larry, who was trying to read his story. Owen finally asks Larry to kill his mother, and in return Owen would kill Larry's ex-wife. The whole movie was really funny. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts is when Owen writes "Throw Momma from the Train". Larry gets angry because he's just written a book with a similar storyline. It turns out that Owen has written a children's pop-up book. <br /> <br /> I would really recommend this movie. I gave it a 10.
