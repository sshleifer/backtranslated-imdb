I never paid much attention to this film until I learned that Paddy Chayefsky - author of the brilliant "Network" - was the screenwriter. His work there had informed me of his genius, and when 'Hospital' appeared on TMC, I wanted to see it. I was not disappointed. Looking at this film and Network, it seems that its main theme is the absurdity, insanity, and sheer evilness of large human companies (eg, hospitals, networks) against the sanctity of individual experience and the human mind it delivered a razor-sharp Feeling of absolutely black humor. "Hospital" is a black comedy like "Network", and the outstanding cast, led by the incomparable Scott, lives up to his work. This is a guardian. definitely not to be missed.
