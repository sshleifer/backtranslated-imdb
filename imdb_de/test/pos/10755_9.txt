What is often neglected in Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd did not have the background of Vaudeville / Music Hall and he was not a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to act; and he discovered that he had a knack for being funny - first in shorts, then in features. He made a name for himself as "Lonesome Luke", a Chaplin knock-off; With the "character of a spectacle" that made him an All-American boy and not a grotesque, Lloyd found his step and his films were among the best produced during the silent film era. <br /> <br /> He developed a reputation as a "daredevil" in some short films, and kept this in some of his best films ("Safety Last," "For Heaven's sake," "Girl Shy"). He was more popular in the 1920s than Chaplin or Keaton and became very rich before the advent of the sound. <br /> <br /> The first sound films were often disasters. To get the most out of their "sound", too much dialogue was used in many films. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's acting was focused on Silents after two decades. He did not have a bad voice. His high pitch matched his "eyewear" mark. And his sound films were not unqualified catastrophes of the legend. Silent films, however, had been elevated to a high art level (especially Lloyd's, which was out of budget and extremely well made); With the introduction of talkies, films had to learn to walk again and made some missteps. Although he tried to move with time and embrace the sound, Lloyd's best pieces from his early (overly talkative) talkies were still visual - like the scene in "Movie Crazy," in which he seems to be in a shabby car seems to drive, but was actually "taken" by bicycle. <br /> <br /> Trying to regain the daring jokes made him famous, as he did in Feet First, was a misstep. (In "Safety Last", his best film and the movie that condemned Lloyd as a "Daredevil comic" or did not poke into the pits, he played a determined young man and climbed to the top, "Safety Last" had a natural effect The structure rose to the side of the building, and his anxiety increased even more to humor, and in "Feet First" he accidentally found himself in a precarious position where the building was scaled, his desperate cries for help detrimental to humor. His character was wretched and convulsive, the desire to save his neck - possibly a precise statement from the 1930s, but not amusing.Harold Lloyd was not like some other crazy Norma Desmond in the past.He hugged the clay and tried his Moving films in different directions grew and changed with the industry, but when Feet First failed, he left the daredevil business and made a satire in the movie industry, Movie Crazy Just as he had to flit through many films as "Lonesome Luke" before carving his place in film history with the spectacle figure, he had tried different directions in the sound films before he made his soundtrack what he did with "The Catspaw " did. <br /> <br /> In "The Catspaw" he plays the son of a missionary who grew up in China and unintentionally gets elected mayor as a front for corrupt political interests. When he learns the truth, he sets himself the task of tidying up the city. Only in his early forties, Lloyd could play the brazen young man. <br /> <br /> However, "The Catspaw" was another box office outage, and Lloyd shot only three more films, including "The Milky Way." Of his main rivals, Chaplin still had silent movies and Keaton was hopelessly abused. "The Catspaw" and "The Milky Way" suggest that Lloyd would have mastered the sound comedy if he had been a little younger or the audience was taking advantage of the doubt after his early sound fiascoes. <br /> <br /> Although the film was unfairly abused about the way Lloyd's character has cleaned up the city, it suits him. From his days in "shorts" Lloyd wanted to scare his audience, and the climax of "The Catspaw" reached it again in a surprising way; until the trick is revealed, it appears cruel, and then comes laughter. <br /> <br /> As a product of his time, "The Catspaw" is charming and witty. A well-written sound comedy well played by Lloyd. Directed by Sam Taylor, it seems almost like a Frank Capra or Preston Sturges comedy because of its curious mix of drama and smart humor.
