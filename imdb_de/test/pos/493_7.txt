I was not familiar with the characters in the comic book series, but I expected this movie to do just the basics: I want to familiarize myself with the characters and their inherent traits, present an action, and destroy the main enemy and maybe this also indicates the possibility of a continuation. And that's exactly what this movie delivers. <br /> <br /> However, unlike most other comic movies, I felt that this movie has a bit of class. "Blade" risked a limited audience with strong linguistic and graphic combat scenes and presented a very modern, believable and gloomy world whose small nuances could effectively cause a viewer to have as little feeling of fear as possible. Who rarely becomes a story entangled, unless it is an emotional (ie sappy) aspect. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film has created countless potholes and unforeseen unrealistic situations, such as a normal female doctor, which no one has been able to do for thousands of years. But if you have such a cool enemy like this one in this movie and fight scenes with exciting camera cuts and special effects like this, what's the point? It may take a bit of a run, but for what it's about to do, "Blade" is a definite relief among most other films in the genre.
