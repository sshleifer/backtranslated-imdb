ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style story based on the fact that Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured out his likeable, boyish charm and played with admirable admiration what he has made known since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS. Stephen Herek, no stranger to musical films, takes this with the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the hair-metal rock god. Wahlberg's "Izzy" acts as the host of the film as Anyone who makes his wish come true. His likable character quickly conquers the heart of the audience, who wants to bring him to success and gets the chance to give him several times the metal goat horn hand signal. <br /> <br /> The only real complaint The story is that the minor cast, the other members of the band, were not properly designed or even introduced. More interaction with these lifelong rock musicians would have strengthened and cemented Izzy's new environment. <br /> <br /> Of course ROCK STAR is filled with great music. Rabin's score, the original of the Steel Dragon and many metal hits of the 80s make this soundtrack a must! Let us all hope that films like ROCK STAR not only lend credibility to a style of music that has shaped a generation, but also trigger a necessary revival.
