Man with the Screaming Brain is certainly not a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it should never be more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, which means it's a kind of summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, Action and happy ending. Campbell is inconsistent as a writer - there are many things in the story that make no sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts just because a female brain was implanted in it?) And some scenes look like a retread of other, better incarnations (the Scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William fight for control of Williams' body, is directly from Evil Dead II). However, there are many small touches and non-successors that feel quite brilliant, like when William is at the height of his panic and screaming at a statue, "What are you looking at ?!" The movie looks like a sci-fi channel, probably because it was him. The acting is actually pretty good. Tamara Gorski especially liked me as Tatoya; She was ruthless and cunning, yes, but at certain moments she seemed to have tragic features that history never explored. Ted Raimi admirably managed the standard role as a "limping assistant", and Bruce is weird as an arrogant, sardonic, condescending American idiot. (Now that he's writing his own films, you'd think he's giving himself a role he has not even staged) Anyone who can avoid taking a movie experience too seriously.
