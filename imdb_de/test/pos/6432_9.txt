Recently I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Hauer at the Sarasota Film Festival 2005 for the US premiere of this film. Not only was he merciful enough to sign my copy of BLADE RUNNER, he took the time to answer a few questions about the film before showing THE ROOM for a full-fledged theater. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed by the movie that I used it as a benchmark for comparing all the other films I saw at the festival. It was powerful and moving, yet subtle and short. The film tells how one day a young man (an older version of Rutger) is fascinated by a seemingly ordinary room in an unobtrusive building near the road. As he passes, he notices an always-open window, from which a haunting melody can be heard. Every day he walks past the room, sometimes standing outside for hours, looking at it through the silk curtains fluttering in the light breeze, hoping to catch a glimpse of its inhabitants. At the end of the film we learn how important this space really is and what has brought our protagonist to it. <br /> <br /> The movie was beautifully cut. In an uninteresting recording no second of the screen time was wasted. Every single frame of the film could stand alone in an art gallery. Rutger is incredible. He is mysterious and yet accessible. His dialogue involves a series of reflections on a life that has taken its course, for better or for worse. His words evoke familiar feelings and thoughts from the audience. I was particularly moved by a scene in which he looked at old photos, his favorite dog, his favorite horse and his first love. You feel that you are in his presence as he transports you into his world to see precious memories of a life nearing its end seeking something fresh, intelligent, and moving. Should be required for all major film fans.
