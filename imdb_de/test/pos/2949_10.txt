The reputation of this film triggered a rather emotional reaction. That's what the documentaries are about today. It's refreshing to see something so personal, honest and genuine. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and revelations are rarely seen these days and are incredibly visible here. It is a fine line between personal truth and exploitation. This film is very carefully and very successful. <br /> <br /> One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple would fail to meet society's expectations would lead to pessimism, but not. On the contrary: I felt good. I feel like I know more about marriage now ... about women. <br /> <br /> If you definitely check that out, you'll think about what exactly a good documentary should be.
