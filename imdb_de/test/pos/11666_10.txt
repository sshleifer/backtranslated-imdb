In a world where controversial and misunderstood topics can be performed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes on a very special role. In addition, it makes it objective and realistic and with a sensitivity and sensitivity that makes it a really great movie that is measured with every dipstick. And to make the whole thing even more ironic, even the subject of this film was widely misunderstood, as it is assumed wrong that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty. it is not. The heart of Tim Robbins' Dead Man Walking is perhaps the most misunderstood thing in reality, and for good reason, because it may be the hardest thing a human really has - and really does - understand. And that's what this film is all about: forgiveness. Real forgiveness; not to apologize for a heinous crime or the culprit - not to say that what happened is okay - but to find the strength to go on and do so by choosing life. <br /> <br /> Director / Scriptwriter Tim Robbins has worked hard to deliver a faithful adaptation of Sister Helen Prejean's novel, discussing her involvement with the death row inmates she has served her belief in God over the years , As noted in the film, what for them was a lifelong pursuit of justice, but also of human dignity, began with a simple letter from an inmate of the death row in the Louisiana state prison in Angola. Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), who was sentenced to death for rape and murder, turned to anyone who wanted to listen when his letter landed in the hands of Sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon went to an area in she had absolutely no knowledge or experience. And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey, leaving no blunt sentimentality, making her not only real, believable, and believable, but making her a poignant and emotionally charged experience for the audience. Through the medium of cinema, which was once a personal, significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean, she becomes one person to all who see this film. <br /> <br /> For her soul-stirring, passionate portrayal of sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She is sensitive and full of emotional depth, and is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way she conveys sister Prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability, which she persistently tires with the tenacity she needs for Poncelet (and in Reality a total of five since she started). Whatever your opinion of the things studied in this film, Sister Prejean is undoubtedly a person of heroic proportions, whom Sarandon exquisitely embodies; and she does so without resorting to superfluous melodrama, but by keeping it real, subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very credible expression of characterization. It's an extraordinary achievement, arguably Sarandon's best career. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn, who was nominated for Best Actor by Poncelet (down to Nicolas Cage, who won Las Vegas for his performance in `Leaving '), also proved to be his best career. Penn was perfect for the role in every way. Penn has never been better so far. In fact, he portrays Poncelet as a real person rather than a caricatured cartoon of a monster who can commit the crimes shown here. Not that it does not make Poncelet any less despicable. On the contrary. It's really confusing to be confronted with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who lives next door might be capable of such things. And that's the strength of Penn's performance - it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance. You just have to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul. A terrific performance, and as good as Cage was in Vegas, Penn should have won the Oscar. In another outstanding performance, Raymond J. Barry is memorable supporting role in a memorable scene as Earl Delacroix, father of one of Poncelet's victims. With limited screen time, he still develops his character so that you can empathize with him and also in sister Prejean, because through him we get insight into the complexity and seemingly weak position, at least on the surface. Barry presents Delacroix in a way that gives the story the necessary balance and perspective, which is ultimately extremely effective and underlines the message of the film. <br /> <br /> The minor cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell (Lucille Poncelet), Margo Martindale (sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is doubtful that this film will change anyone's opinion about the death penalty, but that was never the intention. The goal was to make a thought-provoking, emotionally involved film, and that's what Robbins achieved with Dead Man Walking. Regardless of your personal perspective, this movie will have an impact and hopefully open some thoughts for the true nature of forgiveness. For if we see through the character of Count Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something that one decides on, but a task that can become a life's work. And it may be one of the hardest things in life to accomplish effectively; And you come away from this film with an appreciation for people like Sister Prejean, who selflessly dedicated their lives to helping those in need, and filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon, who brought them to life for millions of people they'd never known before you would have. I rate this as 10/10. <br /> <br />
