Sister Charlotte Beale (the pretty Rosie Holotik) is in the clinic of Dr. med. Stephens arrived to prepare the lunatics for a new job. What she does not expect is to find another presumptive doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by an ax-wielding manic "judge" Oliver W Cameron (... as he approaches a running gag in a situation that gets him out of control he retires to repeat his name). This doctor is Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick) and does not know if Beale is suitable for her facility. After a long discussion about the position (which is a rather embarrassing scene, than the two debates about Beale sending a letter from Stephens requesting a job at the clinic at Masters, which often reminds her that he no longer Masters agrees to let her work in nursing, but the good doctor may not be who she seems to be. <br /> <br /> The assortment of loons includes Sam (Bill McGee), a simple-minded Kindermann who was the last victim of Stephens Lobotomy, Jennifer (Harryette Warren), a woman who needs an adult to comfort her while rolling herself like a puppy on Masters' heel, Danny (Jessie Kirby), an annoyance that often tries to steal the fake baby from Harriet (Camilla Carr.), Allyson (Betty Chandler), a sexy nymphomaniac, who simply wants to be loved and hops on every man she sees, and "Sergeant" Jaffee (Hugh Feagin), a typical case of soldiers who have not escaped the madness of the war /> <br /> The film shows that Masters' unorthodox methods of running the clinic and allowing patients to roam freely with the doors to all the rooms, without questioning locks ... and not to mention that Oliver is still allowed to walk around, even though he has Dr , Stephens just hacked with an ax. And what exactly is with Dr. Stephens happens? Ah ha .. <br /> <br /> Tacky 70's drive-in garbage is a lot of fun when you're in a distorted brand of cinema. I feel attracted to bizarre flicks about mental rejections because of their unpredictable nature. They just never know what the hell could happen, especially in this case, where they are often allowed to walk around unattended. Some consider the low budget a burden, but in the case of this film, I believe it improves the experience. With the cheap photography and the low output (shot for peanuts in a run-down house in a horrible place) it feels weirder and I feel like a voyeur peeking into the madness through a camera lens from the outside.
