Brilliant movie! I'm sorry to say that it looks a bit like Pulp F to me. But that's the way it is with the post-pulp era. Many pictures are automatically compared to being just a gangster strip. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something of Tarantino, which is a good resemblance! <br /> <br /> The film is about a guy in Australia who gets confused with a hardcore detective gang and ends up in debt and deep in the world. To help him, his late brother (can anyone remember Val Kilmer in True R.?) Pay his debts and escape the gangsters who are on his trail. The gangsters are cold-blooded, but take time to play chess and focus on their children's education! They also receive tea from their granny while planning a bank robbery, and have problems with what they should do with their children during the robbery. So a humorous gangster movie with Heath Ledger in good shape (although I'm not a fan) and Bryan Brown in great action as gang leader.
