A self-confessed Slasher addict means that it is very rare for me to get the opportunity to review many movies with a larger budget and acceptable casts. Apart from James Mangold's successful box office, Identity draws; Since the scream trilogy, Wes has put Craven's name back on the Hollywood map. That's why Mark Malones is The Last Stop? a mystery thriller with blatant slasher undertones fascinated me immediately. With a decent cast of Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow and a mesmerizing soundtrack that even finds room for Lynn Anderson's Rose Garden, I must admit that the first signs of this claustrophobic feature were very positive. As far as I know, there were only three other snow-covered Slashers, unless you think that Demon Possessed fits into this category. The first disc and dice on the ice were the bone-dry Satan's Blade, then came the cheese festival of Lisa Loring, Blizzard of Blood, and the amusing shredder followed about fourteen years later. During an extreme blizzard, State Soldier Jason (Adam Beach) struggles through the snow to reach a remote lodge in the Colorado Mountains. His job is to inform the guests that the road is closed and they have to stay at least one more night until a path can be cleared by the dangerous conditions. This news is not well received by the suspicious group, which includes two brothers (Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming), a truck driver who really does not want to (William S. Taylor), a horny pair of lovers (Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson) and Jason's ex-girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan). The motel owners (Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson) are also unenthusiastic about the news, but offer rooms to the stranded guests and try to calm the tense situation. Things are getting worse as Jason finds a mutilated corpse and a bag of stolen cash in the snow behind the cafe. Just like a chapter from an Agatha Christie mystery, the subtenants die through the hands of a masked assailant who wants to reclaim the money. With so many dodgy characters to choose from and no way to leave the scene, Jason must try to stop the maniac before he kills again. <br /> <br /> A good mystery requires at least a handful of dodgy suspects, each with a credible motive, a secluded place that no one can escape, and an intelligent protagonist who can clear the clues. Fortunately, The Last Stop offers all the essential ingredients of a thriller that has equally brilliant moments and downright stupidity. The film begins excellently as the dubious personalities clash in a claustrophobic environment that keeps the tension high throughout the run. Malone holds the interest high, as each character has his own reasons for taking some of the suspicion, and to be honest, the essential phrase is not easy to guess. In fact, I revisited the film to see if I could find any clues I'd missed the first time. Unfortunately, when the maniac turns out to be an exaggerated psycho going like a cartoon villain, The Last Stop loses incredible credibility. Fortunately, not everything is lost when an unexpected and brilliantly orchestrated plot of the film saves the film's finale. <br /> <br /> Similarities can be drawn with the excellent identity, as the two acts are almost interchangeable. James Mangold's effort must be the best of the two, mainly because of the star calculation of John Cusack and the ever-reliable Ray Liotta. While Adam Beach does a good job at the top, Jurgen Prochnow, Amy Adamson and the brilliant Callum Keith Rennie provide credible support. Rose McGowan is just as confident in this role as he is likely to be in day-to-day reality, and Winston Rekert started fantastically before jumping overboard to the climax of the film. If you're a die-hard Slasher fan watching bloody killing, you'll be disappointed. The Balaklava psychopath appears only once and the rest of the murders are committed off screen. But as I said earlier, Malone's directorial talent means that the tension is never too far from the word and you can forgive the few shortcomings, as the positive aspects only triumph Slasher addicts and movie fans alike. Yes, there are a handful of negatives, but overall this is a solid example of up and coming Hollywood talent. If you liked Identity, then try it anyway?
