Chop Shop, the second feature of Ramin Bahrani, is a rare breed. It is an American film that tells a story that is not usually found in American cinema, the story of a minority living in poverty. It is a work of simple beauty. Chop Shop was shot on location in Queens, New York, in the shadow of the Shea Stadium and is neo-realism at its core. With a number of non-actors it has more to do with the classic Bicycle Thieves by Vittorio De Sica than anything made in the USA. There is no score or soundtrack, all music and sounds are diagetic. It feels like you're seeing a great foreign movie. It takes us to another world because it is so unusual to see it. However, this other world is not after the Second World War in Rome or Istanbul or New Delhi, but New York City. <br/> <br /> Bahrani tells the story of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as ale. He is a 12-year-old Latin American boy who has no parents or family members to look out for. He lives in a tiny room in the dealership where he works. He shares the same bed with his teenage sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales). None of them passed the second grade. Ale is young, but hard and ripe. He is the head of the little family. He brings his sister to the job and he does everything he can to earn money if he does not work in the chop shop. He sells bootleg DVDs on the street and sweets in subways. He looks for auto parts and sells them to the many car dealers lining the street he lives in. Alejandro is devastated when he learns that his sister works as a prostitute at night. He himself is gradually disinterested in order to obey the law. He begins to steal, first car parts and later wallets. Like Antonio, the desperate protagonist in Bicycle Thieves, we can not blame Ale for becoming a thief. It's just survival. Ale and Isamar are hoping to buy a food car for $ 4,500. They see the van as their way out and there is a lot of optimism. However, as is customary in neorealism, we know that this will only lead to disappointment. The fascinating performance of Polanco gives the realism of Chop Shop its legitimacy. Here is a 12 year old character who must be credibly independent and vulnerable naive. Whether it's driving cars into the store, selling movies and Snickers bars or playing with their sister in their barren room, it's authentic. <br /> <br /> Chop Shop is a sobering reminder that not all American children grow up a land of opportunity. Ale's lifestyle is "third world" for many white middle class citizens. They are aware of poverty and deprivation in foreign countries as they sip their coffee on Sunday morning and read the New York Times, but blind themselves on their own streets. If you look at Chop Shop, you think differently about the children who sell sweets on the subway. <br /> <br /> More reviews can be found at www.mediasickness.com
