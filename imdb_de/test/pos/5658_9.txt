During the Second World War in the Philippines, Japanese soldiers are starving, dying, becoming weak and becoming more and more insane. A small group of soldiers who want to stay alive eventually resort to cannibalism. This film perfectly shows the madness that overtakes people under extreme conditions. There are some humorous parts in this movie, but the majority is just a very slow and realistic movie. It follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another and finally to death. A very interesting film that shows the death and horror of perhaps the worst war the world has ever seen.
