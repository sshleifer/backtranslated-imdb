Jim Varney's performances as Harem Girl and A.U. are amazingly funny - at a level that excels Chaplin and Keaton. Linda Kash is great in her unique role as a waffle waitress from the hometown, longing for adventure. Unfortunately, the remaining 90% of the film was inevitably bad due to the cruel conspiracy. The creators of Ernest Goes to Africa did not face the creative challenges of low-budget film production. Worth seeing only on cable.
