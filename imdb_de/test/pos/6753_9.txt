I agree with most of Mr Rivera's comments and just want to make a few reservations. This movie "The Mascot" is criminally neglected in its current form. That also applies to "Vampyr". "The Mascot" is not a "bonus feature" - it is listed as a chapter in "Vampyr". Although it is clear that this is a separate film, it should have been treated as such by the producers. And while I'm "there," "Vampyr" needs some respect and cleaning. I felt that The Mascot should go there, and that's the way it went. <br /> <br /> Dude A "We've just put vampires on DVD, but it takes about 20 minutes to put on something that does not cost a lot of money, so you think film critics want to get paid for it Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B: Dude B "The animations on The Mascot are great and I do not have to repeat what Mr. Rivera did so well. However, this thing needs to be thoroughly cleaned and restored, especially the sound. The plot comes out in dialogue, and in my copy there were so many sibilants, pops, and places where the sound just faded (I had no idea what the dog wanted without having read the box): No volume make the words more understandable, it only brought out the finesse and made the hiss and crackle louder. <br /> <br /> Bottom line is: Starewicz's films must be brought into a respectful collection, cleaned up, written down, liner notes and the whole nine feet to be made, in other words, they must be "criterionized" 9 out of 10 for the movie not the product would only get a 5.
