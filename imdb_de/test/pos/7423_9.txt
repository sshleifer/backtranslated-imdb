"Terry & June" was one of the most unfair programs ever, one of the most popular sitcoms of the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> It started as "Happy Ever After", but when Eric Merriman decided that he did not want to write anymore, it changed, causing 'Aunt Lucy' to fall and the Fletcher to become Medford , <br /> <br /> Yes, it was cozy, domestic and middle-class. There were a number of clich√©s in the attacks, from the chef who came to dinner, the vicar organized a flea market and unwanted relatives came to stay the weekend. It certainly was not a "horrible lazy comedy." Since it is "not smart", it should not be. It was funny and well done, and that was enough! <br /> <br /> I also loved the "alternative" boom of the 80s ("Spitting Image", "Black Adder", "The Young Ones", etc.), but also conventional stuff like this one. Not least, she offered an alternative comedy with an alternative. I found it sad when Ben Elton had to defeat both Benny Hill and Benny Hill. Well, family-oriented comedy has almost disappeared from our screens, but where did it go? Watch the current TV schedules. All soaps and reality slags. The few remaining comedies are directed at adolescents, which means they are jammed with rascals, physical jokes and explicit sexual references. And they are not funny either. <br /> <br /> The alternative comedy boom was good in many ways, but had a dark side. Conventional sitcoms were old-fashioned, selling talented writers and performers like Spike Milligan, and ultimately leading to such unspeakable hoaxes as "Little Britain" and "Tittybangbang" (Heaven help us). If it is not broken, do not fix it!
