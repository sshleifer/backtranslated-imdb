It looks b-grade and you'll probably think that there's no reason to rent this movie! But I'm not expecting anything from this movie, just something to pass the time, but I was addicted from the start! Two interesting premises - A bank robbery went wrong, a million dollars are missing and two girls are on their way to start a new life - how will these two stories collide? Just when you think you know which way the movie is going, it makes you 180 and you are overwhelmed by the big twists in the plot! It has a great, but unexpected end, and you want more - always a good sign - to rent or even buy, you will not be disappointed!
