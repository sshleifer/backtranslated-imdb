A great look through the eyes of four friends through the eyes of four friends from their student days in 1960 until their reunification after 10 years - a Yugoslav immigrant who loves the American dream and struggles with the often violent reality; the son of a prematurely bald-headed buyer; a soldier; and the crazy hippie girl they all love. A good direction and a strong cast will do justice to Steve Tesich's brilliant screenplay; The dialogue is not as snappy as in "Breaking Away," but the issues of growing up and the father-son conflict are treated equally well, and there are still some wonderfully funny moments between the shocks and the drama.
