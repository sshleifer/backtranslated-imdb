I've seen this movie so many times, so good. Maybe because I can relate to the way of life of Tittas, that's why. Not everyone would find it to their liking. Also my Italy improves after each visit. Am I a sad case? Thank you, Mr Sorrentino. I'm looking forward to your next movie. Although I did not see the movie in a movie theater, I have the DVD and would ask anyone to buy it. Only the special features extras are worth the price. The time a director spends making a movie is rarely appreciated. The extras on the DVD give a great insight into creating a movie. As far as the story of the movie is concerned, I'm biased. I rave about it to all my friends, but as I said, I have a lot to do with the main character who is a loner in a situation that is not chosen by him. The mafia in Sicily uses Titta to wash her money in a Swiss bank. He owes them that they cost them millions of dollars in the stock market that went awry. Love kills.
