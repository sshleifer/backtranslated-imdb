This was a pretty good episode. Although there was no "prisoner in the closet" or "cartoon wars," it had a lot to offer. The character of Al Gore and this bizarre as hell "Super Cereal" thing was damn funny. But the scene in which I adore this episode was one that I'm sure everyone will agree with, one of Cartman / Kyle's greatest moments. If Cartman is superstitious about Kyle, he'll steal his gold (which of course is wrong!), And he comes just inches from his face. Suddenly Kyle wakes up and they have this crazy conversation in which Cartman tries to pretend that everything is alright. Cartman, who undermines the treasure in the end, was predictable, but quite funny.
