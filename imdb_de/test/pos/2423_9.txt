*** SPOILERS *** Feeling alone and needing company as well as loving Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, keeps all those emotions in her mind as she goes through life as a beloved young single with many first-rate friends. But for reasons of her own deep insecurity, she keeps her in arm's length. As for Frances, male friends are not of their age, so she has no reason to be romantic about them. <br /> <br /> One early evening, when Frances entertained some of her friends, she spots a young man, Michael Burns, sitting alone in the cold, pouring rain outside her window. The feeling that he is homeless and alone after his friends left, Frances goes outside into the park and offers shelter to the young man until the rain subsides and even sleeps in a guest room that she has. You can see right away that Frances is more interested in keeping the young man safe from the cold and rain than she wants him to be as a friend or even as a toy on her own, and as you go through the movie, you see you were right. <br /> <br /> A truly amazing performance by Sandy Dennis, somewhat akin to Kathy Bates' Academy Award performance in the movie "Misery," shot in 1990 twenty-one years later. Frances thinks the young man was alone and homeless, and when he meets him later, he sees the perfect person he can have for a true friend. He is in no way equal to or better than she is, like the friends she has, lawyers, Indian bosses, and therefore completely dependent on her. Later it turns out that the young man is not the lonely and homeless person Frances thought was him. It's when she slowly finds out that he really does not need her and he manipulates her, instead she makes something in Frances's mind that turns out to be obsessive compulsion. <br /> <br /> A really funny movie by director Robert Altman, who goes deep into the depths of loneliness and depression of the human mind. The actress Sandy Dennis is perfect as the personalities of Dr. Jekyll and miss. Hyde in her role as a lonely yet dangerous Frances Austen. It is a pity that she not only received an Oscar for her role in the film but was not even nominated for it. <br /> <br /> As with most Robert Altman films, the actors in the film seem to be giving a lot of improvisation, and especially between the young man's sister, Nina, Susanne Benton, and her boyfriend Nick Garfield. The only thing that I find confusing is when we see Frances going to a gynecological clinic to undergo a gynecological examination and tell the doctor she expects her to marry soon. Was her husband the young man who stayed in her apartment? Apart from that, the movie stays pretty good in the story and the ending is a real shock to both the audience and the young man. When he finally realizes that Frances is not only a bit off the mark but is also murderously crazy.
