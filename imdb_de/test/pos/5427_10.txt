"The Big Snit" happened to come into my life and has shaped my soul indelibly. A scar of love, destruction and futility that will forever be part of my life. This is a story of beautiful futility. We are helpless without each other. We are helpless against state misdeeds. We are helpless about the choices we all try to make when we are in love. Deaf for the murmuring and drifting of a world outside the window. Blind for an inevitable apocalypse. Silent of the hatred and greedy opinions of an overly indulgent society. This is a story of personal commitment and triumphant love that defeats the ideologies of war. Their petty quarrels are a sublime observation of human nature and the way that love goes hand in hand with pain and darkness. Everyone has an irritating aspect in their personality, and this is watched by the creators in the simplest and most fantastic way. We are only a short distance with the two main characters, but we want to complete our own travels with some of their simple, loving, honest philosophy. I am so glad that I exist in this "our time". Another 20 years on both sides of my birth date, and I would not have seen and felt ... .... The Big Snit. William White. Sheffield
