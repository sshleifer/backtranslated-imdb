I am a big heterosexual male ex-bouncer, former rugby player and former boxer. I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a Mystic River. It's a piece of fluff. But in life, there is room for fluff, and when that fuzziness is shot captivatingly by attractive, likeable people, cleverly planned and full of good dialogue, there's even more room for it. <br /> <br /> I'm not the biggest fan of Tom Selleck. But he is good at it. The same goes for Julianne Nicholson (love for her bald head and freckles), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do!) Sorrow and melancholy and farce and even a small salvation. <br /> <br /> Any (male) reviewer who dissects this film is, as we say, not completely confident in his masculinity. In the meantime, I always catch up with no apology when it appears on the cable.
