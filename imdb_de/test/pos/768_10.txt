beautiful. I love the movie. I want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. His expressions are great and spectacular. The movie was excellent. Julie Walters was perfect, too. I think Rupert is the only red-haired boy I love. Rupert has a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. I think the movie was great and it was great to see Rupert in something other than Harry Potter. and it's a very good actor, so it deserves that and more. He only has a golden ball, but he probably deserves an Oscar Oscar. There are some actors who do not behave very well, but still have an Oscar. It does not matter. but he is perfect, brilliant and beautiful
