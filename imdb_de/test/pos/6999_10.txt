"Pitch Black" was a total shock to me when I saw it in 2000 for the first time. In the past few years I've been disappointed with all the lame sci-fi movies (Ex: STARSHIP TROOPERS) and thought that this movie would not be different. But to put it simply, this movie freaked me out ... on a good way. I did not know that I was still afraid of the dark until I saw this movie; I must have buried my fear in the back of my subconscious mind when I was a kid, and it rightly deserves to stay there. <br /> <br /> The alien creatures sent a shiver down my spine; The person (s) who have designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to find something so impressive and grotesque. <br /> <br /> I loved how the authors of each main character gave a story and showed their weaknesses and strengths without much confusion. <br /> <br /> Riddicks (Vin Diesel) Gift for escaping from any impossible situation and leading a hellish fight was a hiccup. At first you find him a cold-smart villain, but in a few brief moments you can see something human behind his animal side. But once you discover it, he does something spitefully wrong. He certainly lets you guess until the end. I did not know if I should despise or admire him ... he is definitely a kind of love / hate. <br /> <br /> Johns (Cole Hauser) was a perfect example of a character who shows a good front But by the need for greed he shows his true intentions and shows what he wants to survive. John's skill in knowing which buttons to press and the right words makes him as unwise as Riddick. Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, as Johns so cute expresses, looked at your own ass first, before looking at the consequences. But what appeals to her is that she quickly recognizes her mistakes and desperately tries to repent, even if she endangers her life, when others have rejected all human values ​​and opted for the dark hills. Jack (Rhiana Griffith) just wanted to have a hero and was the first of the whole group looking for this hero in Riddick; By the eye of a child, good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil. I found it absolutely priceless when Jack shaved his head towards Riddick; They know what they say: imitation is the best form of flattery. <br /> <br /> Imam (Keith David), like Jack, has the ability to see good in every evil. He uses philosophy to carry him through the rigors he experiences, and when time allows, he mourns rationally for his losses and then for the soldiers. In a way, he served as a survivalist for the survivors, even though most characters acted as if they were not listening. <br /> <br /> The casting for this movie was positively perfect. Each actor shone brightly in his role and his talents mingled wonderfully on the canvas. <br /> <br /> Although this film had a small budget, the director's lead and the actor's performances made the film work, allowing the audience to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageously expensive special effects work their way through. This movie is a definitive sci-fi classic. Watch it and judge (open-minded) for yourself. It will be worth it.
