Isabelle Huppert portrays a talented piano teacher who is calm, unfriendly and distant in public and bitter towards her students. Privately she cooks with violence and frustration, and her sex life is lonely and perverted. She lives with her arrogant mother, who compulsively drives her to become a talented pianist (and to move on). The key to the characters of mother and daughter is "obsession". These characters can not change their impulses any more than a rabbit caught in the spotlight can avoid death. The piano teacher meets a young, attractive, talented pianist who is drawn to her from the beginning. They start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the beginning they make perverse and violent expressions that they have to do to them, which makes them sick enough to end the relationship before it really starts. > The film ties in with the female lead role. Isabelle Huppert thrilled with a brutal, absolutely convincing performance as a piano teacher. She cleverly depicts a woman attracted to beauty and perversion, but her power is nourished by her perverse impulses. As a movie with character, you could say that it would not work half as well if it had done badly. <br /> <br /> This is powerful, intelligent and intelligent and sensitive to the novel. The camera work also fits the movie. There is, what I can only name, framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to shoot around. This is extremely effective against an empty bathroom wall and is further evidence of the director's mastery. <br /> <br /> Expect to be disturbed and ill by this movie. But be brave - have the courage to see it. This is a very private view of a person's life, but does not expect to be entertained in the Hollywood sense ... There are no car chases in this film!
