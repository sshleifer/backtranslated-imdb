I would give this movie a good strength. Although it is definitely not the best movie or even one of the best films of its kind (The Killing Fields is better), it at least tries to tell a necessary story. > <br /> I think the method of introducing Laura to Burma was a bit thoughtful. Burma is not exactly the easiest country to visit, especially in the late 1980s. Second, if you made Burma, your passport would not be lost. A healthy person would be damn sure she always knew where her passport was. I'm sure the script writer knew it was weak but needed something. Patricia Arquette's performance was below average and I just did not buy that she is a doctor. At least she has not overreacted the role, which is common in movies like this one. U Aung Ko was good, but also understated. The end is difficult to trace as most of the dialogue takes place in Burma and translates people to Laura. It would have been difficult for Laura and difficult for the viewer. Another plus is the strong Southeast Asian backdrop in the film, which was impressive.
