Nemesis Game is a stunning movie full of mystery, death, mystery and philosophy. In the simplest sense, the movie is about finding answers and what happens when you find them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak along a path that gets darker the more convincing he becomes. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, but Sarah is so close to understanding everything. What would you do if you had the opportunity to finally understand the chaos of life? <br /> <br /> The film was written and directed by Jesse Warn. This was the first feature film by Warn, the film does not reflect that at all, but shows Polish and artistic approach to tell the story. Carly Pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a complexity that was intriguing to behold. I would definitely like to see more of her work. <br /> <br /> Based on riddles, this is a very cerebral movie. It's your thing, since it's mine, then I definitely recommend seeing Nemesis Game. Rating: 4.5 / 5
