An old man rides his bike along a village street as a car comes out of nowhere, kills him dead and drives on. The rest of the film is about finding out who met him, why he was hit, and what the consequences of the murder will be on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is indeed a very British movie. I'm not saying car car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a "stiff upper lip" attitude to the tragedy. His wife Anne (Emily Watson), who is twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive, and more susceptible to drama. The man who really spice up life in this sleepy village is Playboy millionaire William Bule, played by the deliciously devilish Rupert Everett (most American viewers will forever remember him as Julia Roberts' gay girlfriend, who's every scene in My Best Friend's Wedding has stolen completely). In Separate Lies Everett is cruel, cold and selfish, but he's a real eye-catcher on the big screen. No, it's not as exciting as a movie title (Separate Lies, how did this lame and memorable title come about, did not they have a marketing team, did they care about people watching this movie?), But Beyond the title is a heartbreaking drama about the power of forgiveness.
