While Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan comes no closer than the Johnny Wiesmuller films, they have their own peculiar and entertaining bias in the story. It is a successful Tarzan film. Beautiful landscapes, good photography, workable continuity, and a Tarzan reputation that reflects the one described by Burroughs. The players all perform well. The only bad points I found were, I think, connected. It moves in places slowly. This slow movement? Makes this picture too long. It could have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which in my opinion would have helped with the natural flow of the plotline and character development. The rest of the film, however, works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still satisfy the viewer with the movie. Short version of all this ... It's a very good Tarzan movie.
