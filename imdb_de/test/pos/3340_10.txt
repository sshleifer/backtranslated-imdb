I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before I saw this movie. I had just seen the MOOG document, which was fine. The only problem was that Moog had a very happy life and the document was well ... satisfied. Haack's story is full of all the marketable tragedies people buy nowadays, but she has a lot of heart. Although the film is not so much about the tragic stuff, you can tell that Bruce accepted the price of making music in his own way. There are so many elements that make up his old IE. Invention of the Peopleodian, where Bruce could actually play music by touching people. It had to be a challenge to document Haacks's Streu Brain issue, which fell pretty much into every conceivable music category (even rap music), but the director cut the piece very well and managed to capture the ghost. And the cast ... what kind of character Bruce has surrounded himself with, but what do you expect from a telepathic guru who stumbles with children and battles the music industry. I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in music history. That's mainstream, but so important.
