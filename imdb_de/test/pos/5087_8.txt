However, "The Amazing Spider-Man" was one of the best TV versions of a famous comic book hero. Only "Wonder Woman" (Lynda Carter) (the best of the genre and "The Incredible Hulk" (Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno) were better. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Spider-Man" beats the 1966-68 "Batman" because the high camp elements of this adventure often ruin the adventure. "Spider-Man" surpasses all three television interpretations of "Superman" - "Lois and Clark", "Smallville" and of course the George Reeves. "The Amazing Spider-Man "was an action drama in the late '70s, before the CGI, when stunts had to be stunted, not" Superman ". In a computer database," Spider-Man "had its own very talented stuntman, the His name was Fred Waugh, who put on the spidy suit for the action sequences, and Nicholas Hammond, better known as Julie Andrew's children of the all-time classic "The Sound of Music", were spiders during the dialogue scenes -Man. Hammonds Spider-Man also had s a secret of its own Identity as Peter Parker, similar to Christopher Reeve-Superman / Clark Kent, Adam West-Batman / Bruce Wayne and of course Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman / Diana Prince. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that only the series had thirteen episodes. When the first episode hit the air in November 1977, the whole country watched CBS this Wednesday night. To be fair, CBS should soon be releasing this pilot episode as well as "The Deadly Dust," "Captive Tower," etc. on DVD. "Spider-Man" was short-lived, but had a cult, and in my opinion, it was much better than the movie's interpretation of the famous comic hero with Toby McGuire. <br /> <br /> CBS It may be hesitant to publish these episodes for two reasons. (A) There is no broad market for them, based on the longevity of the series and a generation of children and adolescents who were not born when the series was originally aired in the 1970s. (B) One of the early spider-man episodes involved a terrorist with World Trade Center designs attacked twice in 1993 two years after the outbreak of the show, and of course the devastating attack on land on 9/11 / 01, where the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost. <br /> <br /> However, I do not think it would be a bad taste to publish this "Spider-Man" episode. Even though the show was an adventure, derived from a comic book, and a camp in the Nature. The live action "Amazing Spider-Man" does not have a big fan base, but it has cult. When and as CBS released it on DVD, this cult episode could be explained along with the episode in which Spiderman rescued the towers in 1978. How life in September 2001, however, differed from the movies. I like to follow the news, but I also like science fiction / fantasy. Therefore, I am looking forward to the release of "The Amazing Spider-Man on DVD".
