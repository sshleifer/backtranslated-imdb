Jack Webb is a Marine Corp drill instructor in the D.I. Webb game Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough but fair-minded Marine dedicated to preparing young teens for possible battles. Nobody could have played this role better than Jack Webb. As a former Marine, I can assure you that this is the most accurate film dealing with basic training in the corporation. Extremely entertaining!
