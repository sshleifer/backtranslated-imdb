I got the solo "Summertime" in fifth grade for our spring choir concert. From then on I got a lot of appreciation for Gershwin's music. I love the haunting melodies of this opera by Gershwin. When I was in fifth grade (about 10 years old), I got the LP to practice and I love the soundtrack too. I recommend seeing this movie and if you can get the soundtrack, get it - you can sometimes find it on eBay - an old, used LP. I searched and searched to find the soundtrack on CD. The songs have wonderful musical arrangements and I really wish they were put on CD for purchase and also wish that they restore the movie and burn it to DVD. This is really a great work that I think will benefit and benefit current and future generations. Some may find the movie slow and boring, but I think it's the opposite. Although Poitier and Dandridge have called musical voices, I find that the voices fit well with face and personality. The speaking and singing voice of a person can be very different. Porgy and Bess and the songs of this opera will always have a special meaning for me.
