Remake of the classic 1951 "The thing from another world". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are attacked by something from outer space - it devours and copies everything it wants. It starts as a dog, but gets loose - and has the chance to copy one of the men. Soon nobody else trusts - they are isolated - the radio is destroyed - as well as their helicopter. What are you going to do? <br /> <br /> The movie of 1951 was about being a big, super human monster. This movie was scary. And that's it - but the story is different (and more based on the source material - the novella "Who Goes There?") And is scary in a different way. The movie starts off with Ennio Morricone's scary score, which sets exactly the right tone, and when the thing is attacked, the amount of thrill is amazing. Everywhere blood and parts of the body fly - the arms are bitten off, the heads part and - in the strongest - a man is devoured with the thing first. The Gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I'm not afraid, but I had to sleep with light when I first saw it in 1982. The effects of Rob Bottin are simply unbelievable - how did this picture with an R rating come through is not up to me! <br /> <br /> It also has a very scary feeling - by the way it is very exciting. You're not sure who's what and how Carpenter's direction and score really build the tension. A complaint - nobody has distinctive personality traits. The actors just stay straight and say their lines. That's annoying ... but the movie still works. <br /> <br /> This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982 - he competed with "E.T." and many critics complained about the amount of Gore and there were no female characters in the film. It is now considered one of the best by John Carpenter. A must for strong abdominal muscles. NO date movie! <br /> <br /> An amusing note: When this was published, Universal sent a note with all the printouts of the movie. They suggested to the theater owners to play the film in an auditorium near the toilets. They were afraid that the people would be so ill from the violence that they would have to be near a facility to vomit!
