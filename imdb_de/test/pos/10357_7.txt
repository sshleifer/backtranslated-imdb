Brain of Blood begins as Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), the leader of a country called Kahlid is about to die on account of cancer. However, if he dies, Kahlid will break free without anyone leading them, so Robert Nigserian (Grant Williams) and Amir's follower Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) have devised a plan to bring Amir's body to America, where the madman Scientist Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) will transplant his brain into a fresh body and with some plastic surgery that no one will ever do knows he was even dead. Things are not going according to plan, however, because when it's time to transplant Amir's brain, Trenton's Freak Assistant Gor (John Bloom) brings a body to someone who has fallen from a balcony, Trenton needed a highly adaptive living body He decides to use Gor's body as a temporary gap until another more suitable one is found. Unfortunately, when Amir wakes up in his new body, he is not very happy with what he sees. If you found out that your brain was in a badly burnt freak, that's not the case. <br /> <br /> Also known as Brain Damage. The Brain, The Revenge of Creature & The Undying Brain This cheap exploitation film was produced and directed by the only Al Adamason. Honestly, I'm offended by the pathetic 1.5 rating that Brain of Blood has on the IMDb. I personally think it's great fun so bad, it's a good way. The hilarious screenplay by Kane W. Lynn and Joe Van Rodgers is as loose and stupid as they come from sloppy, blood-soaked brain transplants to wacky crazy scientists, from seven foot scarred freaks playing toy cars to one four-meter-tall medical dwarf assistants, from cellar dungeons to rooftop chases, from car accidents to assassinations, kidnaps to lightly clad women, from Regina Carroll's hairstyle, in the opening speeches to teenage girls, in the basement should be kept captive, because of a laugh their own mention should be -out-loud funny ending that includes a deep, meaningful speech! It's all here & Brain of Blood has quality cheeses all over the world. If you're a fan of bad exploitation and enjoy it, then this movie should be at the top of your list of "must see" movies. Despite the low rating of 1.5, I'm proud to admit that I liked Brain of Blood very much. I thought it was an absolute trick that I had to look at. In the end, it slows down a bit because too many shots were taken by people who do nothing, but most of all, it had been like a rocket by then, with only 85 minutes being relatively short, the barmic plot is difficult Guess, and I think it's a lot of fun, fun. <br /> <br /> This is the director Adamson's masterpiece, as far as I'm concerned, along with Dracula Vs. Frankenstein (1971), which he made a year earlier. Those who have seen an Adamson movie before will know about nonexistent production values, inexpensive special effects, and card sets, and all of this adds to the fun. This film creates the border between incompetence and seriousness to create an unforgettable viewing experience. I love the opening shot of Kahlid, which is obviously just a photo of the Taj Mahal in India, with statuesque people in the foreground! Regina Carroll's hair seems to be an independent entity in its own right, it seems to change the style between shots and is frankly appalling. Do not let me start with her make-up job, which she has to apply with a paint sprayer! There's another weird moment when we see Amir's body being transported to America, wrapped like ordinary tin foil. Why am I wondering why?!? The effects are variable, there is a terrible-looking false spider, Gors burnt makeup jobs are pretty bad, although there is an amazingly bloody brain removal, which is actually quite impressive. <br /> <br /> The budget for Brain of Blood must be There was virtually no existence. I have to admit that I thought Trenton's lab was pretty good with different computers and medical instruments, although the rest of the movie looks cheap and mean. The production values ​​are low, the music comes from another movie "Beast of Blood" (1971) and acting is terrible, but in a camping way. <br /> <br /> Brain of Blood may have the best title An exploitation film for me and for me a very entertaining part of the nonsense, which I had a lot of fun watching and laughing. They just do not want to do it, can not recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie, but bad movie lovers should enjoy it. I liked it, but then I'm just funny.
