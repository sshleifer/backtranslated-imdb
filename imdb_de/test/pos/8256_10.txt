This movie is an almost forgotten gem dating from 1979, which, though essentially a comedy, is based on one of Britain's biggest bank robberies. In fact, one of the titles that this movie knows is "capricious," which is why it itself is an indication of the nature of the film. One of many lovable rouges who are not the violent or psychotic types who do the biggest job of their lives with cheeks and falsities. To be honest, I do not really know much about the real crime and can not comment on whether it accurately represents the events that unfolded or the characters involved. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan treats himself very well when playing PINKY Green and is very credible as a carefree little American rascal who feels very comfortable. I have to add that American actors sometimes struggle with English actors in a British film, the chemistry is not always there, but this is not a problem for Jordon, who fits his role. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that Jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 70s and 80s and never really received the recognition he deserved. He seemed to be stuck in supporting roles and B films, not a fair account of his acting skills. He played a corrupt cop in THE FRIENDS OF EDDY COYLE, a sadistic murderer in THE MEAN SEASON. In THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS he played a kind of weird Gordon-Gehco character, and in the EQUALIZER television program of the 1980s, he played a good man. All of this demonstrates the versatility of his acting skills as he mixes with people like David Niven, Kurt Russell, Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham. In this movie, he effortlessly plays his role as a little contemporary with the eye for the ladies and you immediately take his character and his root for him from the beginning. You can not help but like Green? ?? You see, he really wanted to go straight, but when he was blackmailed, it all seemed to be a great opportunity, and in the end he enjoyed the thought of all the money. David Niven is the boss and the police inspector was brilliantly played by Richard Johnson, who was usually an elegant but meticulous London detective who clearly loves his work. The other supporting actors do not say too much, but if you look at them, they were all well-known British character actors who often played bad guys or Coppers (that's not ironic). Elkie Sommers, Oliver Tobias do what they have to do, and it's nice to see Gloria Graham in a cameo role. <br /> <br /> For some viewers, especially for Americans, it seems ridiculous that someone with a Greens record could get a maintenance job. Just a bank and come and go if he wants. Moreover, the stunt he'd put on Kronplatz after his conviction was not as far-fetched as it seemed when security in the 60s and 70s was not as tight as it is now. <br /> <br /> Like in the movie itself, there are some interesting observations. For small time crooks the train was too much here. There were also other films where this also happens, d. H. THE BRINKS MAT. It's not just eliminating or hiding the loot, but with so many people, someone will be careless, babble, or just break if he leans on. In addition, the authorities make in the large robberies very difficult to the local Rouges. They also say that there is no honor among the thieves, but Ivan insisted that PINKY got his punch. They only had too much view of the jetty in the dock, if looks could kill, a look of total betrayal! How could he have shown them all after taking care of him? You have to ask yourself a question, why crooks can be so stupid? Did Green really think he could speak sweetly a second time out of suspicion? Inspector Watford was not fooled by his innocent-looking face and a well constructed alibi, and the whole caper smelled of internal work. You also have to wonder why they leave so many clues. A notepad with the safe numbers, travel brochures for overseas trips that still had his telescope lying around, as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery, which was not one of the characters normal policing Insp Watford quickly took the measure of Green, picked him up and left him singing like a canary soon. It only shows that, despite thought-out planning, things can clear up very quickly, there is never a clean holiday for every body, some are always attacked. Although it is worth pointing out that much of the money has never been recovered. All in all a fun movie, interesting shots of London and England in the late '70s, good mood with a great ending. I highly recommend it, especially if you like capers. (Note: I recently bought a DVD of it, but the transmission was obviously made by a VHS cassette and is of poor quality, so do not pay too much!)
