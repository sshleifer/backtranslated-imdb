<br /> <br /> After reading the critique of the unemployed critic, I went to a show on "Radio" and did not know what to expect. Luckily, the jobless critic seems to me to be a frustrated director / film critic anyway. His review is callous and absolutely not announced! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes you laugh, makes you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of rest! <br /> <br /> To formulate a line that the actor Ed Harris recounted in the final barbershop scene "... and the whole time we thought we were teaching radio is the truth. He's been teaching us, He's treating us all the time, we'll treat each other at times, as we wish! "<br /> <br /> Yes, the film tugs at heart. Yes, it's emotionally manipulative and yes, Cuba Gooding Jr. is sometimes over the top (see the Christmas dance scene), but you know what? SO WHAT! The American community must be constantly reminded of what tolerance for our great country can bring. We need to be reminded of how great we can be. <br /> <br /> This is a solid cast. I was particularly pleased that S. Epatha Merkerson, who portrayed Radio's mother, did something outside of Law and Order. I've always wondered if Ms. Merkerson is a great actor or is it the quality of writing that is a strong cast of Law and Order. After watching this movie, it is easy to see that she is indeed a very good actress. <br /> <br /> Also Alfre Woodard as principal and Debra Winger in her career are small but important and powerful roles of Coach Jones' wife and Chris Mulkey as protagonist Frank Clay. <br /> <br /> We can not overlook the performance of Ed Harris as coach Harold Jones. After thinking about this movie and growing up in the deep south of myself, it's hard to really appreciate Mr. Harris and his contribution to this film. As Coach Jones, Ed delivers a calm, absolutely solid performance, that of a man on a mission. Coach Harris will not allow the city or the circumstances to distract him from what he knows in his heart, and it's the right thing to do. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie, make sure you are laying around the credits. You'll be pleased with a treat, as the real James Robert 'Radio' Kennedy, who is now in his mid 50s, is shown and still leads the T.L. Hanna Football Team comes to the field every Friday evening. <br /> <br /> One last note. If you were a teenager between the mid and late '70s, this movie is worth the price, just for the soundtrack!
