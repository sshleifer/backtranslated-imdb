With the seizure of power in 1933, Hitler and his "National Socialist German Workers' Party", which we all know as Nazis, reinforced the country more and more as time went by. At the beginning of their rude divorce of the German people, they called all the artists, newspapermen and filmmakers into their Nazi headquarters so that they could be informed what exactly the newly declared "Third Reich" (aka "Empire") was. ) expected from them. <br /> <br /> IF Fritz Lang, the master-director from the time of the "Silent Impressionist" and "Expressionist" of German cinema, was invited to Mr. Goebels; he listened attentively and said nothing. Immediately after leaving the Propaganda Minister's office, Mr. Lang went directly to the station and took a passenger directly to Paris. Fritz Lang did not even return to his residence and did not return to Germany (at least not many years later.) He remained in France and eventually emigrated to the United States of America.) Mr. LANG went to work properly in America, creating many years a variety of entertaining, solid and well-educated films of a high level and in this small title volume is the today's lucky topic WESTERN UNION (20th Century-Fox, 1941) included /> <br /> TYPISCH needed a film about the Old West and Pioneer Days both quality and quantity of cast. WESTERN UNION has been qualified for both requirements. We have a good selection of starters as well as a minor cast that pleases our senses almost every minute and every scene. <br /> <br /> Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore are on the ball, other celebrities like John Carradine (do not play a vampire or any other scary guy, but a doctor), Geor "Slim" Summerville (Veteran figure, Silent film veteran and Keystone Comedies graduate of Mack Sennett), Chill Wills (always reliable supporting actor and former singer in "The Avalon Boys") and evil villain Barton MacLane. To this mixture are added such names as Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kermit Maynard (Ken Maynards brother). <br /> <br /> PROMINENT in these American Indians are: Chief Big Tree, Chief Thundercloud and Mr. Jay Silverheels. An outstanding representative of the Aboriginal peoples of North America is also this magnificent, uniquely impressive and memorable example of the Red Man, the Louisiana Indian Iron Eyes Cody (born Espera DeCorti by Sicilian immigrant parents). <br /> <The shooting of the beautiful outdoor shots was done on location in Arizona and Utah and rendered in the highest Technigolour quality available. (There is no Monument Valley, but this is the province of Mr. John Ford.) In a way, this movie is a far more amazing feat than we might think; it took a sort of pulp magazine story adapted to the tastes and idioms of pre-war America of the late 1930s and early 1940s. All this was done by a German-born director who had been the shortest time in Hollywood and America. In his latest analysis, WESTERN UNION, this may not be the most historic example of the Western genre; we just do not care. It scores in all the necessary categories needed for a great night in the cinema! SO, who cares about small details like "accuracy"? <br /> <br /> We give a rating of **** to Mr. Lang and 20th Century-Fox! <br /> <br /> NOTE: * We've just seen a special on WTTW's PBS station here in Chicago. This was all about the movie actors, directors and other artisans who had brought National Socialism to power in America and seek refuge in Hollywood. (Film Folks and Scientists were apparently the biggest export for Germany at this time, the scientists who built the atomic bomb and the future NASA people came from Europe at the time.) POODLE SCHNITZ !!
