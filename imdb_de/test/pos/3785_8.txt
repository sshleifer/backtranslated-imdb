This film, as it is now, is much shorter than it was in 1918. In fact, it is now available with two other medium-sized, silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE and THE PILGRIM), which Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. At the time, SHOULDER ARMS was a great success, as there was humor in a consistent approach. It's still very funny (Chaplin disguised as a tree spying on the Germans is so ridiculous that it's hysterical), but he suffers from his own age. Charlie looks at the First World War, a terrible conflict that killed 20 million people but not the worst war of the 20th century. Chaplin would also experience this war and fake his main architects in THE GREAT DICTATOR. The latter, however, is more accessible to the modern public, as this film is a talking picture. Hitler's goal in 2008 seems to be more important to the public than Kaiser Wilhelm II and his general staff. SHOULDER ARMS should guide us through the elaboration of the Tramp, its training and its habituation Trench War and its actual fight against the "Huns" on the Western Front. Much of this is gone now - a segment (if Albert Austin is a doctor who examines Chaplin in his Design Center office) still exists and has been fully featured in the documentary UNKNOWN CHAPLIN. This is unfortunate because the movie is now about forty-five minutes long and there seem to be gaps filling those scenes. What stays is first class, but one leaves the desire for more ... and feels a trifle cheated. <br /> <br /> Sydney Chaplin and Henry Bergman are good at supporting parts, especially in Sydney as William. He had previously done it in a short show with Charlie for the sale of bonds and made a militaristic speech, before he was berated by the tramp with a huge hammer with the inscription "War Bonds". Here we see that the tramp manages to win Wilhelm and the general staff to the conclusion. It was crowned only by Stan and Ollie, who had captured the German army with tanks and barbed wire in PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that Chaplin actually had a serious crisis because of its wartime activities. He was not a naturalized American - neither in 1917 nor 1952, when Attorney General McGranery publicly announced that Chaplin could not return to the US because he was a hostile alien (Chaplin and his family were on a trip to Europe) - Charlie was furious He settled down in Switzerland for the rest of his life, except when he made a COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG and when he went to Hollywood in the 70's for his special career "Oscar". Since he was not American, he could not be drafted by the US. He sold (along with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford) US war bonds. But in the UK, tens of thousands had died on the battlefields of World War I, and the public there was upset with Chaplin, whom they considered "slacker" and coward. Chaplin finally overcame this, but remains of resentment followed him until his death. This does not negatively impact on the success of SHOULDER ARMS as a film, but it does suggest that Chaplin did not make another modern war film until 1940 and is a worthwhile target.
