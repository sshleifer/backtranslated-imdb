Last night, I had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie Hitch. I was stunned and amazed. Will Smith did a phenomenal job in a role he does not always associate with. He has proven once and for all that he does not have to hold a gun in order to be a great actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit that I always like him on "The King of the Queens", but this role has really brought him more into the light and I hope that in the near future he will be seen much more on the big screen. The movie was funny and adorable and I recommend it to anyone as the best date movie you can imagine. The mix of comedy, romance and drama made me feel complete. It's nothing like most "chick-flicks" in the sense of tears and sadness, but it's impressive, and I think it can appeal to both men and women alike. I particularly encourage all couples to watch this movie, but even if you are not involved with someone, you can take some great ideas from Hitch with you. <br /> <br /> TWO WAYS LARGE THUMBS !!!
