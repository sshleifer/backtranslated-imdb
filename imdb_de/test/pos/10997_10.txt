This movie is not your typical Hollywood award, although the selection is so bad that I often stay away from movies rather than be disappointed. However, this small, inexpensive gem is absolutely adorable and enjoyable and definitely a keeper. The actors are as different as the characters they portray, the buffalo scenery is charming (what a pretty city), and the story sparkles. The lack of unnecessary violence, sex and the word "f" does not adversely affect! Take the kids, take Grandma and take a break from Hollywood! I give 11 out of 10 points!
