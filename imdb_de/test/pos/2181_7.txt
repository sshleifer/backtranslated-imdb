This cheap remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting. Humphrey Bogart plays the lead role as manager of a sleazoid radio station that desperately wants to give in. The owner decides to write a series of morality games about a famous murder case of 20 years ago. So they hire the fake preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down the murderess, who was acquitted and calmly lives under a false name. The preacher arrives on the daughter's wedding day, but the reckless radio station refuses to reveal the mother and ruin her life. Bogart is always good. Hayden is good the slimy preacher, and Henry O'Neill is as good as the father. Everyone else is just terrible. Helen McKeller wins no sympathy (decisive for the role), Linda Perry is a lousy actress, Beverly Roberts is alright, but always looks old, Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh have no role As the mother of the company Robert mishled Middlemas as a station owner. <br /> <br /> This is less than an hour away but is a pale copy of the original featuring dynamic performances by Edward G. Robinson, Aline MacMahon. Frances Starr and Boris Karloff. But it's always worth seeing Boagrt.
