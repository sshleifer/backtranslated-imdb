This is my fourth review of a Charlie Chan movie in serial chronological order on these consecutive days. This is also my first comment from one I've seen before, even though it's been about 24 years since then. So I could not remember much. In this case, the Honolulu detective investigates a spy ring that was originally hounded by a former Scotland Yard acquaintance who has appeared missing in the Big Apple ... This is the best chan entry I've seen so far with everyone Note (though, of course, if I look at it more closely, there could still be some holes, though I can not imagine it at the moment). And "Son No. 2" Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) is a little help if he first identifies the poison that leads to some murders, although of course it bothers him a little later. The recurrent cast of the latest Chan movie - Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum - includes the blonde Joan Valerie as June Preston and Stanley Blystone, whose brother John G. shot a lost chan named Charlie Chan's chance as a fingerprint expert. Beautiful intrigue, especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber plane. Oh, and watch out for some stooge in a police line ...
