After looking at Ingmar Bergman's skams, I had many feelings, but above all, I felt dissatisfied. I've heard so much hype about this movie, but I came to the conclusion that it seems to be missing. Do not get me wrong, I can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film, but I was not so impressed with depth and emotion. I found the characters uncomfortable and unrealistic, which affected the dramatic effect. Besides, the fact that the war was fake led to the feeling that the emotion was not genuine. Dramatic war films are, in my opinion, much more effective if the events (not necessarily the story itself) really took place. I think that of all the films that try to show the brutality that this film is in the middle of effectiveness.
