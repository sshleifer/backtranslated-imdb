"Sleight of Hand" is my favorite Rockford Files episode of the entire series. This episode shows a page from Jim Rockford that is usually ignored. Jim is really in love with a beautiful woman and is shown to her young daughter as a father figure. The wife has recently divorced and she and Jim have recently returned with the youngster from a weekend getaway. By a curious turn of events, the woman is discovered missing after returning to her home. Rockford's account of his father, Rocky, who recounted the events that led to the disappearance of the woman, is reminiscent of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer series from an earlier era. After much pondering and reflection, and with Rocky's encouragement, Jim encounters the hint that he's looking for disappearance with his usual steadfastness. Unfortunately, Jim's girlfriend Karen unintentionally experienced some mafia activities while staying at the Buena Vista Inn. The detectives reacted by killing Karen and replacing another woman in Jim's car. The cheater, who had apparently fallen asleep in the backseat, made her home immediately upon arrival. A few recidivist murders follow, and Jim resolves his solution while under suspicion of LA's police department, although arrest warrants are issued for his arrest. This episode evokes more emotional responses than any other Rockford Files episode combined. James Garner as Jim Rockford is seen in his most vulnerable moment and yet retains the presence of mind to pursue the case. This is personal for Jim Rockford. In this case, he is not hired to do a job, but he tries to find his lost love again to save her life. Unfortunately, this is not possible, but Jim is trying hard to sort out his feelings, but it's obvious he will not get over his pain soon. Despite the appeal of the main story, many important questions are raised but never answered in this episode. (1) What happens to the young daughter of Jim's girlfriend? (2) What did Karen actually see in the hotel where the mafia killed her? (3) How could Jim drive for hours with a cheater in the back seat without noticing? (4) The daughter explained that "Mommy did not come back with us." So why did not the girl scream or cry when she noticed that her mother was away for the hour-long drive? Regardless of these ambiguities, "Sleight of Hand" is the Rockford Files episode that comes closest to a tearjerker. The excitement is convincing and the story is narrated in a sensitive and vulnerable style that feels Rockford's pain.
