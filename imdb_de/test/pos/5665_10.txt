Giorgino is a long, agonizing journey in the life of the protagonist, after whom the film is named, from bad to bad. Young demobilized, gas-poisoned First World War Lieutenant of very sensitive health, who was previously in an orphanage for mentally challenged children, goes in search of his new location and finds much more than he had ever intended in another nature of the ultimate depressive atmosphere Despair, in which the insane are less terrible than reason, in which madness is a kind of poetry, will keep you mesmerized from the first pictures of this film to the very last moment. And all the beauty: the beauty of winter and mountains, the beauty of snowy landscapes and wild forests. I do not even know how all the grief and sadness of the last days of the war can be so beautiful.
