Emilio is a successful businessman, a perfect father and a good husband. Or is that what everyone thinks. The perfect action he has carefully crafted over all these years suddenly closes around him. Will he be able to keep up with his own lies? <br /> <br /> This is a very well done drama with great acting and constant direction. Although the plot is pushed to the limit to increase tension, the film explores some of our worst fears ... Do we really know the people we're dealing with? Can we be so sure? <br /> <br /> The story develops at an ever faster pace when Emilio is no longer in control of the lies. Many Spanish films have interesting stories, but are far from technical skills. The perfect rhythm and the well shot scenes make the actors so credible that we go in and hate Emilio and suffer for him as his situation becomes more and more desperate. There is no need for Spanish folklore, and this is not an attempt to create a Hollywood style film. This is the real Spain of 2002, and despite the apparent improbability that Emilio's life is in reality, there is a good chance that someone we know will not be the person he claims to be. Not only is it a great commercial product, it makes you wonder where we can lie. Can we keep up? <br /> <br /> Well done.
