The Diary of Anne Frank is the best-selling non-fiction book in the world, and with good reason. Still, I thought as I ran through this documentary about her life, citing some of the details the diary had stopped, "Just another documentary about Anne Frank." I found it competent but not exceptional. That was my smug attitude, because I already knew the story of Anne Frank; Most of what the documentary had to tell me was not news to me. <br /> <br /> But everything changed when I reached the end of the documentary - when I saw the filming of Anne Frank. The emotional impression of seeing this material for only a second or so long made everything that came before it a thousand times more real - but not just everything that was in the documentation; Everything I had previously known about Anne Frank suddenly became more real and personal to me. Her story had always moved me, but when I saw the footage, what I felt was stronger and deeper and deeper than any other movie experience of my life. (I knew before that this documentary contained live footage of Anne Frank, and I had even seen the footage on TV on television, but it was a completely different experience to see it in the context of the documentary) ruin anyone.) <br /> <br /> I now realize that many people do not know the story of Anne Frank yet. It is sometimes daunting to witness this kind of ignorance. I think, "How could anyone NOT know the story of Anne Frank?" ANNE FRANK: REMEMBERED is the best place to start reading her diary. It's a story everyone should know.
