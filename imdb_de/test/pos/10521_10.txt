Another that slipped off the radar of almost all people. This little B-produced gem is so full of new ideas in an old genre and so absolutely refreshing and inventive that a horrible feeling about the lack of Cojones in today's cinema is slowly overtaking the body. The final set is so innovative in attitude and style that there's a preference for everyone from Tarantino to John Woo. Oh, and if you think that "dying lines" are all stereotypes, wait for FF's dying line. A dialogue that could tear you away with laughter will conquer your heart. A real pleasure. Find it and see it. You will not regret it.
