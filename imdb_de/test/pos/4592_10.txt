This movie is "the" stupid comedy of the year and probably the best of Mike Judge since "Office Space". If you're a Mike Judge fan or enjoy shows like Futurama, you're going to make a fatal mistake yourself by skipping this little-known, limited release. Although the DVD has few "bonus features," this movie is certainly funny enough to make up for the "lack of value" movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is about an army grunt called Joe Bowers (played by Luke Wilson) that is part of a top-secret army experiment aimed at preserving army personnel in peacetime it can be thawed in wartime to fight for our country. Things take an interesting turn, however, as the general's chief responsible for the operation collapsed in a prostitution ring and the experiment is almost forgotten. Bowers and his buddy Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) wake up in the year 2505, where the American population has become increasingly stupid in the course of natural selection. Now Joe and Rita need to find a time machine to return to 2005 with the help of Frito (played by Dax Shepard). <br /> <br /> What I really enjoyed about this movie was Mike Judge's comedy satire about the history of US history over the last 50 years and how humanity is evolving over the next 500 years. This is most evident in advertising in the film, which has become an integral part of American culture. With shows like South Park in the mainstream media, it's easy to gauge how conclusions can be drawn that profanity will become a marketing tool in the future. This is humorously portrayed in the film with subtle things like "Fudd-Ruckers" changing their name to "Butt-F ### ers" and a billboard featuring the ad "If you do not smoke tarryltons ..." F ## # you! "I also can not stop laughing at Carls Jr.'s role in this future, with the slogan" F ### you ... I'm eating "and their automated newsstands showing theirs Advertise "Extra Big-A ## Tacos" (With More Molecules)! This film has everything I go to the movies for - excellent, sharp, funny comedy and a gripping plot make this DVD one for all time If you are not a fan of Mike Judge, are not interested in "Beavis and Butthead", or have no sense of humor, this movie is probably not good for you, otherwise I would say that this is probably the funniest movie of 2506 is ... I mean 2006.
