This movie is one of my absolute favorite movies and made me a Nicolas Cage fan. In the mid-80s, I recorded this movie (as a VCR was unable to do so !!) and have watched it over and over again. Nicolas Cage is just brilliant here. And it looks wonderful and does not affect "drama isms" (see "Peggy Sue Got Married" to know what I mean by that !!). I measure all his achievements in this. He was as perfect as the cool punk guy with the nervous friends. The music was great. The Plimsouls! The psychedelic furs! Modern English! Men at Work! Whenever I hear "Melt With You," I'm going back to the finale of this movie. <br /> <br /> What happened to his cute wife, Deborah Foreman? And his hysterical friend Cameron Dye? Certainly a different turn from Nicolas! Interestingly, the sloppy girlfriend (Elizabeth Daily) became the voice of Tommy of the Rugrats (she's billed as E.G. Daily for this horrible show)! Bizarre! <br /> <br /> If you want to make a great trip to the 80s, watch this movie. It's definitely a classic. How totally!
