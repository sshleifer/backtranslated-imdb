"Saratoga Trunk" is a film from 1945 with Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. It is based on a 1941 published book of the great Edna Ferber. In the subconscious she may have been blown away by the wind. Parts of the story reminded me of GWTW. <br /> <br /> In the 1890s, Clio Dulaine was an illegitimate child from New Orleans with a mulatto (Flora Robson) and a dwarf, Cupidon (Jerry Austin). She has won a Countess title and claims to be a widow. Her mother accidentally killed her father and his family avoided her. Clio takes over the old homestead with the idea of ​​embarrassing her half-sister and her father's wife, which she does by attracting a great deal of attention. Her plan is to marry a very wealthy man who can give her the security and integrity she yearns for. Then she discovers Clint Maroon (Cooper), a Texas player, and falls in love with him. The two have an erratic relationship - and he has no money, so she can not marry him - so he goes to Saratoga Springs. After all, the Dulaine family has enough and their lawyer gives her $ 10,000 to leave the city. She does. She goes to Saratoga Springs and goes to the owner of the railway, Bart von Steed. But Clint is always close. Bergman is beautiful in dark hair and wears the costumes of that time, and Cooper is stunning with his incredible 300 watt smile. How she could resist him is not mine. And the love scenes - whoa, what chemistry! The understudy is excellent, Robson and Cupidon create interesting characters and Florence Bates is an outstanding performer as a socially prominent woman who takes Clio under her wing because she knows she is a big fake a bit long and some of the acting may seem old-fashioned today but it's a gripping story full of atmosphere and lively performances. The end will not be a surprise. It is a fun journey though.
