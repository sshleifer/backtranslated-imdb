Sometimes the academy does not recognize the potential of some films or does not nominate them because they are controversial or strong. Sometimes they are nominated but win nothing (I hope this is not the case for "American Beauty" this year). Exactly this happened with "Boogie Nights", the best film of 1997. The Academy preferred to award "Titanic", a purely commercial and hollow film, the best Oscar, and other awards for the overrated "Good Will Hunting" " and the irritating "Full Monty." The other images nominated in the main category were "LA Confidential" and "As Good As It Gets," great movies, but "Boogie Nights" is still better and could have more categories This amazing movie tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, surprisingly great), a 17-year-old barman who caught the eye of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in a redemptive acting), one Eddie has a special "gift" to help him get into the world of pornography, he changes his name to Dirk Diggler and begins to achieve great success, but fame ... lasts not forever. Other characters also have their parallel stories - Amber Waves (Julianne Moore, perfect), Buck (Don Cheadle) and others, including Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actress who agrees to do something, but she has to wear her roller skates , <br /> <br /> What could have been a banal, trivial film becomes a perfect, unforgettable film in the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. What makes "Boogie Nights" such a great movie is its execution, complemented by a clever, well-written script, great soundtrack, etc. Each character is very well developed and each of them has his / her meaning in context. Every feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of modern American cinema. <br /> <br /> "Boogie Nights" is a powerful, influential image that anyone who really enjoys cinema should see. Under a conspiracy that seems banal at first sight, there is a wonderful story of ups and downs that we encounter in our lives. It's an amazing portrait from the late '70s and early' 80s, in an age of ups and downs. That makes this movie so special and a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> 10/10
