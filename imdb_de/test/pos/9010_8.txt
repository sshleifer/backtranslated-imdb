I just love this show. She is so funny and cool. Kuzco is such a funny and interesting character, I love him. He's the thing that makes this show what it is, even though Kronk and Yzma are so funny and charming. Show is great for me because it always manages to make me laugh, no matter if it's just an episode , It's just funny and all the characters are so adorable and cool that it's worth the show, unlike some other crap on Disney Channel. The next time you see the movie, when you've seen the movie, and if you have not seen it yet, you'll find that it's very enjoyable anyway.
