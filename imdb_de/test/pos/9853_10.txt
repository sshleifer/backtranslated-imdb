In Sudan, the Arabs rule and are constantly at war with the Christians and animists living in the southern part of this East African country. This film features a group of Dinka boys, a tribe of cattle herders orphaned after the destruction of their village and their families killed in a brutal attack by the Arab forces. Most of these boys are now teenagers and were called "The Lost Boys". The filmmaker follows a group of "Lost Boys" on his journey as they were picked up as refugees in the US, where they will land in Houston. Those who have been admitted as refugees receive a celebrity status because they believe (from what they have heard) that America is amazing. A trip from Sudan to America is like "a journey to heaven," says a young man. A big party is thrown out for their departure, and they are told that they should do well to Sudan, and once they have been brought up to return to Sudan so they can contribute to the Dinka society. They are also warned not to be like "those with the baggy pants" who are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men, and also, no matter what, not to forget the Dinka culture. <br /> <br /> Watch as the boys come from a third world country in America and try to integrate into American society while they have gone from a place with virtually nothing to this rich world in which everything is massively overproduced and overloaded. You learn how to clean and how to use all the tools we take for granted every day. Sometimes it's humorous, humble in others. <br /> <br /> Listening to the comments they make about black Americans and American society / culture is very interesting. Later in the film, you will see how American culture begins to spoil its formerly modest mindset. One of the boys, Peter, is not content to work and just do enough to survive moves from Houston to Kansas City to pursue an education. When the other boys visit, they talk about how they can not attend schools. The main reason they came to America was education, and the media say that the Sudanese boys were being educated. This is because the boys have reached any age, making them older than they actually are, and preventing them from enrolling in high school. <br /> <br /> The film juxtaposes pictures from Houston to Kansas. We watch Peter enroll in the school, where he makes friends with a group of Christian Conservative children, and how Santiago tries to attend the driving school (although he does not have a driver's license anyway) and works at Walmart. We see that Peter is struggling with high school life as he struggles to form the basketball team of his schools, and as Santiago struggles to keep up with work, to solve the rent, the tensions at home in Sudan to mitigate and, above all, to cope with loneliness. > <br /> It comes to the point where the boys want to return to Sudan and tell them that everything they are taught about America is lying. "You have to do it alone, do it all alone," says one of the boys. A damning message to a liberal-capitalist lifestyle that shows how people are made to become radical individualists (a trend that led to the creation of neoconservative and radical Islamist movements). Their biggest beef with America, however, is that there is no time; Time is money and we do not waste a second! <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the boys never lose the sense of Dinka culture. They are celebrating South Sudan Liberation Day, the day the SPLA began fighting in Sudan. This fight continues today. They also meet with other "Lost Boys" on the anniversary of their arrival in America, where they discuss their experiences in America compared to Sudan. When asked, a boy says that if he could make a living he would rather live in Sudan. It's too lonely in America, he adds. They never lose their sense of community that has been implanted in them as part of their culture! <br /> <br /> This film lets us question the way we live, questioning the artificial happiness that materialism and nature are like. Our societies have created within us , It will also change the way I look at refugees. I will never again take for granted how hard they have to work and what immigrants mean for a country like my own Canada. This is a wonderful movie. I laughed, I cried ... a very emotional journey and a very well done documentary. 10 out of 10.
