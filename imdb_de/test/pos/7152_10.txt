I saw this movie and was really excited about the characters. It's definitely my kind of movie where you do not get bored. I love independent movies, they are so much more rewarding. My husband and I really enjoyed Jay's style. If you're an open-minded person who loves to make movies thought-provoking and love conversation after their end, you'll love this movie. It's definitely a thought. The movie will definitely kick some toes, but who cares that people probably will not see this movie. It's amazing to see how the characters evolve. Jay Floyd has really conquered both sides of the table. Applause applause Jay I hope you are working on another movie.
