Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) is a farm girl from the country who comes to the city in search of love. She met a man who told her about an astrologer who will show her the stars. This is a soul journey ... Eliza is put to the test. Can she recognize her true love when she sees him or not? Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) is a construction worker trying to find himself in his homeland heritage. They show each other different views. Eliza is still looking for love all the time, and Tommy is trying to protect the reserve his grandmother lives on. This is a twisted story of looking over the obvious and finding beauty in simple everyday things. The style is artistic and full of symbolism. The psychedelic camera styling may deter the average moviegoer, but the deeper message and interesting frames make this movie worth seeing. It's a movie that explores the underworld of weird, miserable and devastated individuals. This is off the way, but definitely worth a look!
