Now I like Victor Herbert. And I like Mary Martin and Allan Jones. But it would have been nice to see a real biography of Victor Herbert. Walter Connolly as well as Herbert have a decent resemblance to him in his last years. Jones and Martin are singing beautifully, though. The Herbert music is only there to decorate the plot of these two musicians. Jones John Ramsay is a frail figure, very similar to Gaylord Ravenal in Showboat, who also played Jones. <br /> <br /> As for Mary Martin, it's a mystery why she never had a good Hollywood career. She made films with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell as well as this one. She did a good job, but the movie audience did not take her. The best musical moment in the film is Jones and Martin in a duet by Thine Alone. The recordings I have of this song are individual and it was written as a duet. There is also a pleasant scene in which Jones and Martin exchange Herbert songs on their bicycles. The real Victor Herbert with his wifeising and his Irish patriot background and his musical education in Germany, for which he developed a love Everything German would have been a fascinating study. He was also a cello virtuoso before devoting himself entirely to composing. I have to make a strong exception to the reviewer who said Cuddles Sakall was a good Victor Herbert. Sakall as Irishman, HI. <br /> <br /> Nice movie, but the real Vic would have been so much better.
