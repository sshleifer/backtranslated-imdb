The story of an obsessed lover (Shahrukh Khan) and the long ways to gain his true love (Juhi Chawla), who is already married to her husband (Sunny Deol). The film is considered one of Shahrukh Khan's best performances and was admired by critics and audiences alike. Fear that your love can not be returned, fear that you will lose the love that you love, and fear that your lover may have a change of heart. In short, fear is the villain in every love story. <br /> <br /> But in Darr, fear is the ultimate expression of passion, obsession and sacrifice. Darr is the story of Rahul (Shahrukh Khan), whose love and obsession for Kiran (Juhi Chawla) frees him from all fears of life and death. Darr is the story of Sunil (Sunny Deol), whose continued love and passion for Kiran gives him the courage to face dread. And finally, Darr is the story of Kiran, who holds on between one man's love and another man's obsession. She fears one and the other. One stands for love, the other for life. In this battle between love and life, the ultimate victor is love, for love always wins life and death. Simply "Darr" is one of the best Indian movies ever made.
