"It's funny that your worst nightmare always seems so far away!" The characters of Dark Habour, a couple (Alan Rickman & Polly Hunter) and a tramp (Norman Reedus), slip into a game of hidden sexual energy and betrayal. Occasionally tempting breaks intensify the tensions and leave a lot of room for interpretation. Good drama and a story that, if you do not use the brain, will confuse you. You have to see it at least twice. The strength lies in their unconventionality and of course in Alan Rickman. Those who love him will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's not a typical primetime movie, but well done!
