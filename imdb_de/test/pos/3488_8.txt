A formula for murder is not a well-known giallo, but that does not mean it's not very good! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics like The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late in the Giallo cycle, but holds many of the films that were released around the "golden" period of the early seventies, more than stood. Though lacking logic in some areas, the film works mainly because of its expert manner of mixing the Argent-style death scenes with truly surprising twists of plot and a variety of well-defined characters. Overall, the movie may not be as exciting as many other films in the genre; However, this is more than compensated for by the secure way in which the central situation is passed on to the public and the resulting tension. The plot begins with a fake priest who rapes a young girl named Joanna before he pushes her down a flight of stairs. We then rest for several years and the girl is now a woman who unfortunately sits in a wheelchair. She is coached by Craig for a sporting event. a man who also has romantic motives. However, his proposal is not satisfied by Joanna's personal assistant, who also has romantic designs. <br /> <br /> The film features an action that is filmed halfway and forms the backbone of the movie while it's not exactly logical; It is good to see and hints that you are interested in an interesting movie. Obviously director Alberto de Martino is not afraid to show some unremarkable Gore scenes, and in this movie a priest is beaten to death by a spade - and I personally would not hesitate to call this sequence one of my favorite giallo murder scenes! The action can be a bit uneven at times, but in general the action is very good. The director seems to spend an eternity for the conclusion of the film; But it is absolutely tense and the way it plays out is good in that it takes advantage of all the action points ahead of it. The music from Fulcis's The New York Ripper is also well-suited to this film, and as part of the tradition of Giallo, Martino's film in its only feature film role offers some good acting performances by cult veterans David Warbeck and Christina Nagy. Overall, this film is not one of the easiest to find Giallos. But it is worth tracking down and is recommended to fans of this movie.
