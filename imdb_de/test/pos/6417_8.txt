Footprints are certainly not your average run of the Giallo mill, and that's not a bad thing. Unlike his previous attempt, The Fifth Cord (which was her "classic" Giallo), Luigi Bazzoni's film renounces almost all Giallo brands, not murder; The focus is very much on the psychological mystery. It's obvious from the start that this will be a totally bizarre movie as the movie opens with a scene playing on the moon. After that, things do not get any clearer, as the lunar sequence is the dream of Alice, a troubled woman. Alice is tormented by dreams of a moon-stranded astronaut, apparently from a movie called Footprints on the Moon. After some things went wrong for her, Alice decides to go to a mostly abandoned former tourist place called Garma. On her arrival, she is surprised when the people she meets already know her. Alice also meets a young red-haired girl she already seems to know. The girl tells Alice that she looks exactly like Nicole, except nicer and with shorter hair ... <br /> <br /> The fact that Footprints is not much about sex, murder and other brands of Giallo presses It's a bit on the back foot with the main audience from the start, as most people who get into this movie do not get what they expected (or probably did). On the other hand, Footprints commands respect that it does not simply tie in with the previous one. In 1975, the Giallo lost popularity, and many of the films released at the time (with some notable exceptions) were all retreads of the previous one, so Luigi Bazzoni had a great chance on this film. Florinda Bolkan shows a strong performance in the lead role; and the fact that she's not the prettiest giallo heroine is not really important. The mystery builds up well, and sometimes it gets a bit babbling; Footprints are generally fascinating for the duration. It will probably be no surprise to many, once they get there, that the end does not make much sense and does not really clear up anything; but it contributes well to the bizarre cult value of the film, and all in all; I'll give Footprints a thumbs up!
