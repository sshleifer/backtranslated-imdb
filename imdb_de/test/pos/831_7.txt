This is Van Damme's best direct-to-DVD attempt I've seen so far. Van Damme is a border guard who wants to stop the heroin smugglers trying to enter the US. The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Damme's best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in martial arts. For more information, see "Undisputed 2". In fact, Adkins is so good that before I saw "The Shepherd," Van Damme did not look very credible when he beat him on the screen. Although Van Damme holds his own and although he is not as athletic as Adkins, he can still compete with the best of them. All the fighting scenes in this film are very well done and the shootings are also above average for this type of movie. The only negative I can say about this film is that the story is a bit underdeveloped. I think the motives of Van Damme's character should have been portrayed earlier in the film, especially in terms of why he carries a rabbit. The reason he does it is very cool, but you will not find out until the end. There are a few other things that are never really explained, but this is a Van Damme movie. So you know where the priority is in creating this kind of movie and it's not character development. Overall, this is a solid action movie that I recommend. So run to the Damme border!
