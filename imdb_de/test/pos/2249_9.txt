As an Israeli Jew, naturally sarcastic, and a lover of independent cinemas, I am always pleased to see a film that looks at the Holocaust, which is sensitive and respectful, but also original and unusual. While I did not read the book? or, before this movie, heard of its existence? and therefore, like other reviewers, can not comment on how they pile up in comparison, "Everything Is Illuminated" gave me great pleasure, and I can certainly comment on that. <br /> <br /> To shed light on all this is a Holocaust film It would be a great injustice, even if it is undeniably about the Holocaust. So it would be called a comedy or travel movie, even though it is a journey and is exceptionally funny as moving. Everything is illuminated is about Jonathan Safran Foer? Played in minimalist perfection by Elijah Wood, in the most dramatic performance I've seen so far, with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals everything? a young American Jew and an obsessed collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts who travels to the Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. It's also about Alex, his tour guide through the Ukraine, and Alex's grandfather. The fascinating thing about these characters is that at the beginning of the movie they seem like a comic relief to offset the melancholy nature of Wood's character; But both Alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the movie and prove to be at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, Boris Leskins turns out to be the grumpy, self-professed blind grandfather as the film's best dramatic performance. Apart from the surreal nature of the film and the characters, the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, the sensitive cinematography and the daunting contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history. What made Everything Illuminated a powerful and moving experience for me was the fact that we come from Alex and his grandfather a very different and original point of view on this painful subject; Some excellent films, such as The Gray Zone and Downfall, have already shown us the point of view of the subordinate Nazis, who are portrayed as people who are not necessarily aware of the moral implications of their actions but are caught up in the reality of war. Everything is lit up, a point rarely touched upon before: Alex's point is that of a young man who was born many years after the war and who sees it as little more than a cold historical fact that has to face up to Horror of his own people? and maybe his own family? were able to. The change in Alex's attitude? and his grandfather ?? Towards Jonathan, towards the Holocaust, and towards the Jewish people in general, the film makes for a fascinating and original character development study. Everything is Lit is a terrific directorial debut for actor Liev Schreiber and one of the most original and unique films of 2005. This is a highly recommended experience, especially for anyone interested in the Holocaust and World War II.
