From every category, this is a denied and superior movie, even in today's standards. This movie was filmed entirely in Crap-o-Rama and will blow you away (and something else!). The dialogue is breathtakingly fast and cool. You will either love or hate this movie, but let it go. I have seen it 4 times and I am absolutely thrilled. Divine is looking for the dirtiest living person, but also her rivals in this obscene and disgusting (but funny) and stylish little movie. <br /> <br /> The Divine was phenomenal and "she" will always be missed. Edith Massey makes the unforgettable performance as "Egglady" and does not forget the energetic Mink stole! <br /> <br /> About crazy s ** t! <br /> <br /> Also recommended for you sick little puppies; <br /> <br /> Annoyances <br /> <br /> Desperate Animals <br /> <br /> Polyester
