Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about surviving against even more hostile enemies in a hostile alien world. The task becomes even more difficult when the next enemies can be found in your own surviving group. <br /> <br /> The plot of Pitch Black is quite common and has been seen several times in different variations. But what makes this movie shine over others are the well-written characters. <br /> <br /> The group consists of very different people, few of whom are more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot who has a hard time with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty hunter with drug habit; Imam, a holy man who faces the fact that sometimes God is cruel and Riddick, a convicted and a murderer, who learns to value others, not just himself. Characters begin to live in the film. Not only are they on paper like in many other films of this genre. You're starting to take care of the characters, especially for Riddick, though that feels weird. He should be the bad guy. In this film, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both. <br /> <br /> Another thing that works in this movie is the casting. Seldom do actors go so well with their roles. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings Johns the right amount of cruelty and responsibility. However, the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does a great job as Riddick. In his hands, Riddick is pretty scary, definitely very dangerous and deep as he is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> So how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends closer and the enemies even closer.
