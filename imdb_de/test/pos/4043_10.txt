Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is at some point unhappy or sad. It's all so cute, all the way the white bear secretly loves the queen and gets her in the end, as well as the performance that the two young actors of Gerda and Kai have done. The music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one that is combined with sad piano tones in some places, resulting in a very touching result. If you look at both parts at the same time, he sees that the Snow Queen is not so bad. She just tries to surround herself with love in the wrong way. The night this movie was here (first part), I just looked at it because I was bored, but I loved it afterwards and was very angry when it did not show the next part because of the pope's funeral. Yes, that was terribly sad for me. But when they said it was next week, I was so happy that I took it in and now I'm glad I did it.
