Okay, maybe it was because I happened to be in Yangchun China when I saw this movie. Maybe it was because I finally had something on TV that I could understand, or at least read the subtitles, or maybe it was just funny. Whatever it was, the movie was worth the time. <br /> <br /> I had just arrived to do my foot and head massage when they gave me the remote so I could watch TV. Normally I would turn off the damn thing, but I stumbled upon this crazy movie and became addicted. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you could call it an action, is about a cooking contest and is a love story and the food in this movie is the real star. If you like Iron Chef and many of the other cooking shows that are currently in reality TV mode, you'll love the scenes with food in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's fast and the subtitles are so fast that you're better. Be on speed measurement for this one. However, the action is mostly slapstick, so you do not always have to read the entire subtitle to get the idea. The main actress is a beautiful eye candy and the main actor is not bad to look at. They are both worth seeing. If you have some time to kill and want a good laugh, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> I do not speak a word of Chinese, but I could quite understand the cultural humor of this film. For those who speak Chinese, it may be even better. All in all, I give 8 out of 10 points and currently I am even looking for a copy that I have in China and will keep it when I get home. It will be a nice reminder of my time in Yangchun and its a silly afternoon in the massage parlor looking at a stupid movie.
