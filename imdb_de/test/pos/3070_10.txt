SPOILERS AHEAD ------------------------- Mel did it. From the opening credits to the end, this movie laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes wears the movie most of the time, but the minor cast seems strong when the plot is pulled away by Robin Hood. This film explains from the beginning that it should not be taken seriously. If you take a time machine and give the characters thoughts about modern antics, you would get this movie. What makes this movie so special? Throughout the film you'll see flashing and acuhu become big friends alongside Robin Hood's as Robin Hood's companion. However, flashing is never said to be black until the crowd says "a black sheriff", blinking repeatedly "he's black". This is a timeless scene. Simply one of the most beautiful films of our time.
