This is a thoughtful film that exposes the injustices of the so-called upper classes and those who work for them, rabbits and non-nudes. Robert Shaw does a remarkable job in his role as a firm, correct chauffeur, Steven Ledbetter, who helps Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) at the beginning of her mental depression. Steven, however, has many mixed feelings about this upper-class lady. He inevitably falls in love with her, which of course transcends the social boundaries that separate her. I have not read anything before and judge the movie just as I saw it. I consider it a very honest story about the realities of daily life and the conflict of what we want or expect of life and what we get. It is a beautiful drama that can be seen.
