<----- Minor spoiler! -----> <br /> <br /> A woman becomes pregnant, but not her husband. She develops something in herself, or at least that's what her husband thinks. They go through a lot of hard times while they are on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The husband contacts a UFO professor and uses his help to find out what's wrong with her. <br /> <br /> <----- Minor spoilers! ----> <br /> <br /> The story could have been a little better or at least less predictable, but the movie is catchy and brought me and my sister through the entire movie without any problems. The drama is very good and the shooting is far better than normal compared to your normal b alien movie. The effects are good and something happens every second of the movie. The characters are really sympathetic and apart from a stupid nurse in a scene they are all very convincing in their roles. <br /> <br /> I thought it would be a good movie, and I recommend it if you like alien / monster abduction movies! <br /> <br /> 7/10 - The story could have been a little less predictable.
