I remember this movie when the other person who commented said. I've picked it up, but I wish I had it now, just because it had to be one of the worst movies ever. Funny, in a really bad way. I remember that the marker line on the box was "The Ultimate Frontal Lobotomy." I got it from my mother, who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst / kestest movie she had ever seen, so my mother said, "My son will probably love it." and the woman gave it to her just to get it out of her possession. I then taped it later, which I regret. I also remember that the "Corck Screw" thing was one of those ball catch things ... the yellow conical things with a red "button" at the end, and when you hit the red thing, a ball is shot in the air. Well, they used that with a crank on one end and a corkscrew in the funnel. When the killer was killed, they showed him how to get to the front with the "weapon" and then to see at close range what turned out to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victim's head. I do not know what else to say about this "gem," except if you like bad movies, it will not get any worse.
