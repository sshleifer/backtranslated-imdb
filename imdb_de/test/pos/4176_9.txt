"Head" is a movie that has performed well since its first release date in 1968. The film contradicts the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans have never perceived; Men with real thoughts. Fully controlled by their producers, the Monkees got the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The movie is fun for its image, entertainment industry and entrepreneurial America. The soundtrack contains some of the best music. It is a film that is always worth seeing.
