I just saw "Checking Out" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. What a great combination of a heartwarming story and a great cast. Director Jeff Hare has done an outstanding job of inviting the audience into the disjointed but funny world of Morris Applebaum and his family. Family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy the crazy antics, but feel the real pain and care they have for each other. <br /> <br /> Usually I'm not a Peter Falk fanatic, but he's Morris Applebaum and plays the role with great humor and humanity. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone can see and enjoy this wonderful movie as I did. <br /> <br /> Hats off to the director, cast and crew for a good job!
