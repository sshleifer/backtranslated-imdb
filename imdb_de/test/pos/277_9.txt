So real and surreal, all in one. I remember feeling like Tessa. Heck, I remember that I was Tessa. This was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending. I particularly liked the tangent of the demonstrators. It's nice to see symbolism in a movie without being knocked over your head. If you get the chance to see this, use it. It's worth the 30 minutes.
