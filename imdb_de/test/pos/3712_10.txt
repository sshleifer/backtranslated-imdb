A beautifully photographed and moving short film. The feeling of this family and much of the country before and after Pearl Harbor is impressively captured. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the visual look of the film - naturalistic and at the same time poetic. Great work by David Boyd. <br /> <br /> Although it's a family movie, the story never becomes Mudlin or Saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that drives the boy on his odyssey. I understand the younger brother's love for his older brother and I do not doubt why he does what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother during this time of crisis. The boy is tough and the performance of Jonathan Furr is excellent, as is the performance of Ron Perlman.
