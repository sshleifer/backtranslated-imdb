I'm still waiting for a new DVD release of this wonderful movie. I own a Betamax recording with the language FRENCH. Unfortunately, MGM omits the French title on its last DVD. Only English was spoken with French subtitles ... I do not know how to tell MGM: I wrote emails, but of course no answer. If I insist, it is exceptionally that the synchronization track in French was spectacular, funny, well written, and so on. George C. Scott's acting is always superb and for people born in the '50s, Diana Rigg is something quite different than Madonna (for example). Thanks for the help ... Best regards ...
