This short film sequence, directed by Rutger Hauer and starring, was based on a short story by Dutch writer Harry Murlisch. In the 10 minutes of movie length, you'll see a lifetime as "Harry" unleashes his long-standing fascination for a space he constantly passes through in his youth. When he returns to the city many years later, he realizes that he has rented the same room. <br /> <br /> With black and white films, the textures are emphasized in this delicate narrative. The voice of "Harry" pulls you into his world. <br /> <br /> A subtle, close-up performance by Rutger Hauer and 2 non-talking characters. Wonderful soundtrack by the Dutch musician Dyzack. <br /> <br /> This film is difficult to see at the moment as it is only available on DVD Region 2 "L'infidele" (Liv Ullman) as a bonus track. But it is expected to appear on the re-released DVD of "The Hitcher" - another, but very hard, performance that's different from Hauer! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you can!
