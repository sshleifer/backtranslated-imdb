This DVD is indifferent to millions of classic rock music fans around the world because Rush is just not cool. It is a shame that Rush had to overcome the mocking contempt over the thirty-year history of North American and British music journalists, as it denied many people the chance to get into a real band. Each of the last four decades is well represented here and what a catalog of songs it is! We have the groundbreaking "2112," the magical "The Trees," and the lyrical "Tom Sawyer," infused with the high-energy, genre-demanding pieces of their latest album "Vapor Trails." The musicality is almost immaculate, the stage show is spectacular and the Brazilian fans are just crazy (they sing along to an instrumental piece someday!) Each band member plays at a level that defies conviction, real craftsman Try the Instrumentals "La Villa Strangiato "or" The Rhythm Method "for the size - and yes, the latter is a drum solo (which you must have seen to believe it). <br /> <br /> Sound and image production The values ​​are very high, as befits the Rush experience, and you will also receive documentation and multi-angle set pieces. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing achievement and a tribute to the Canadian rockers and all serious classic rock fans. Have a copy.
