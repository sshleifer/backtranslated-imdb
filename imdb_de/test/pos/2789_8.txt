L'Auberge Espagnole is full of energy and honest, realistic and refreshing. No comedy or drama, but rather a piece of life film about this group of very interesting, but still normal young people who share a flat in Barcelona for a year. Nicely photographed with a nice soundtrack. When you are older, this movie should awaken a flood of good memories. When you are young, you will learn from this example.
