This is the fifth part of 'The Animatrix', a collection of animated short films that tell us something about the world of 'The Matrix'. This time they introduce Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) in a story about a detective charged with finding her. With great black and white animations and an interesting story, this again is a great animated short film from "The Animatrix".
