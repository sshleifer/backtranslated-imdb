We saw this film being previewed before it was released at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was general agreement on two points: a top-notch drama saw both the two main roles and other first-rate performances: and secondly the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster. We saw a dazzling poster with chains and suggestive commentary suggesting a kind of crazy sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, while the film has some depth and thoughtful ideas. What's sad is that folks looking for porn are going to get sucked into the movie and be disappointed because it's too "heavy" for them, while the people who really enjoy it would not be dead in the movie Going to the theater would show it. Too bad. A good movie wasted.
