Musical bios are all cut from the same fabric. Hopeful struggles, success, and finally the girl win, but this - a life with the Irish tenor, Chauncey Olcott / Jack Chancellor - has more to offer than the usual traps. It has great charm and sincerity and is played beautifully by everyone involved. Dennis Morgan is well in the lead, as is Arlene Dahl as a love interest. Andrea King's supporting performance as Lillian Russell is far better than Alice Faye's leading bio-performance in the film dedicated to her career. William Frawley touches the aging tenor champion William Scanlon, and Sara Allgood is adorable as Olcott's mother. George Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale give good support. There are over 25 songs (a true treasure chest): Come Down My Evening Star; My Nellies blue eyes; You tell me your dream. Wait until the sun shines, Nellie; Will you love me in December? Through the light of the silvery moon; Minstrel Days; Polly Wolly Doodle; The Natchez and Robert E. Lee; Miss Lindy Lou; When I Dream Little Rose of Killarney; Shaking hands; A little girl; A little piece of heaven; Maria; Sweet Innescarren; Tiddely Um; When Irish eyes smile; Mother's macho; The Kerey Fair; Space in my heart; My wild Irish Rose. <br /> <br /> Although the film has earned only an Oscar for scoring, it also deserves a well-deserved praise for art direction and costume design. The reasons why this is not shown on video may be due to the large amount of time in the film Minstrel show atmosphere that makes up at least a quarter of the movie. However, it is historically accurate. <br /> <br /> This is a real gem and very worthwhile. It leaves a warm glow.
