What I got was something better. <br /> <br /> Just like many of the films I recently commented, I had been looking forward to this movie for a while. Especially after watching another movie by Toshiaki Toyoda, "Blue Spring," which is easily found in my top 20 favorite movies. I loved the trailer for "9 Souls" and I thought it sounded very good. I heard nothing bad. Now I know why. <br /> <br /> This movie starts out as a kind of comedy and in the last half of the movie it quickly becomes something else. It gets more dramatic as each of the characters faces their own tragedies. Each character has just enough screen time, and you care about what happens to each of them. Although there are 9 characters we need to learn in just two hours, Toshiaki Toyoda looks great. <br /> <br /> After watching "Blue Spring", I hoped the soundtrack would be there, at least a bit as good as in this movie. I got my wish, because the soundtrack to "9 Souls" was incredible. The music used in each scene, especially the more dramatic, is just wonderful. I loved every second of it. <br /> <br /> I was not sure if I wanted to see another Toshiaki Toyoda movie "Pornstar" or not, but after seeing this, I go. Certainly. Also, because I read the plot for it and I think it sounds really good. I look forward to it. On the R1 DVD of "9 Souls" there are two interviews with Toyoda. He says he has finished another movie and wants to write the script for his next one. I can not wait any longer. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. You have to see that. Now.
