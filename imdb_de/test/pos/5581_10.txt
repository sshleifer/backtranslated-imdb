Somehow I have missed many of the early Farscape episodes, so I see them in all possible orders as they are repeated on different channels. I caught it for the first time - quite by chance - while sitting in a hotel room. The first 10 seconds had me completely addicted - that's what SF is all about. <br /> <br /> The characters are strong; and Moya / Pilot the living ship is what Lexx should have been. The plots differ in quality, but in my opinion none are excellent. And I have to mention Rygel - what an ingloriously irreverent character! None of your sugar-coated Star Trek aliens here is the real deal - cynical, selfish, and full of disgusting personal habits. Rygel is creating a genius channel showed "Out of Mind" (the body-changing episode). A true classic, I could not stop laughing ... <br /> <br /> Farscape has long been gracing our screens!
