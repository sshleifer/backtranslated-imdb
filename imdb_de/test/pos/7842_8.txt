Here you see Mr. Eastwood in all its splendor (d. H. At the top of his form as an actor and at the height of his physical attraction), but the depicted "ladies" are then or now hardly typical of the South. The young girls in the boarding school are incredibly na√Øve. Some show signs that they have become truly corrupt women, and Geraldine Page, who has become full in her corruption, hardly represents the mean when it comes to running the then or today's teacher of girls' schools. (That does not mean there's not a bad apple in every barrel.) Mr. Eastwood said this is one of his two favorite movies. <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled" has an original storyline, many attractive characters and many surprises for the viewer. It is absolutely captivating and entertaining, but not really realistic. (I know that I grew up in the South and attended a girls' school and a college, and I met countless girls who did the same thing, not to mention their relaxed teachers, or you could even say, "repressed professors." She was a far cry from the headmistress pictured here.) She's downright weird in her portrayal of a gentle southerner who's not quite what she seems. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit disgusting, when it first came, it seems, and still is, I think, but you will not be sorry that you have spent your time looking at it.
