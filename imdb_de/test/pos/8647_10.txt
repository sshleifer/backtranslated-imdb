On the Lost Highway there's a sign saying: <br /> <br /> * IMPORTANT SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> (but you knew that, right?) <br /> <br /> Since there are a lot of people who apparently have not understood the meaning of this film, I would like to introduce my interpretation of the reason for the plot. As others have mentioned, a single look at this movie is not enough. If you have the DVD from MD, you can "cheat" by watching David Lynch's "Top 10 Notes on Unlocking MD" (but only on second or third viewing, please.);) First of all, it's Mulholland Drive downright brilliant. A masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuses to leave your head. Not often the comments on the DVDs are very accurate, but Vogue's "It comes in the head and stays there" really hits the mark. <br /> <br /> David Lynch deserves praise for making a movie that does not just have a nice movie - a stylish look - cinematic, with great acting (especially Naomi Watts), a haunting Badalamenti soundtrack, and a very dreamlike one Quality - but most of all, he succeeds in involving the viewer in such a way that there were only a few films before. (When is the last time you saw a movie that you just would not forget and that everybody felt compelled to talk and write about it, regardless of whether they liked it or hated it?) <Br / > <br /> Alright, enough about all this. It's time to justify those statements. Most people who have tried to pull the plot together have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion / dream sequence. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a pity for anyone who tries to understand the film with "traditional" methods in which history is timely. Logic and linear way for the viewer. But for those who expect that, I ask you to check the director's name and come back. ;) <br /> <br /> MD is the story of the sad death of Diane Selwyn, a would-be actress who is desperately in love with another actor, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diane's lack of talent, she constantly strives to advance her career and feels she could not meet her own expectations and those of her parents. When she realizes that Camilla will never be hers (C. gets engaged to Adam Kesher, the director), she hires a killer to get rid of her and then has to deal with the guilt that comes with it. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a strange opening for this thriller. This is a 50s Dance / Jitterbug contest where the main character Betty shows a great performance. We also see an elderly couple (which we'll see twice in the movie) with her and applaud her. <br /> <br /> No, wait. This is what most people see at first glance. There is indeed another very important fact that is stated before the credits - the camera moves into an object (though blurry) and the scene fades out quickly. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream. <br /> <br /> The main characters seen in the first half of the film: <br /> <br /> Betty: Diane Selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the film, which is the "dream sequence" represents - a positive representation of a successful, aspiring young actor (the complete opposite of Diane). "Betty" was chosen as the name, as this is the actual name of the waitress at Winkies. Note that in the dream version, the name of the waitress is "Diane". Rita: The fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes, which consists of Diane's dream and with the help of an imaginary car accident turned into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. She is then comfortably accommodated in Betty / Diane's aunt, where Betty is allowed to live. Coco: In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream section, the woman responsible for the apartment complex where Betty lives. She is mainly a strong authority figure, as you can see in both parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> Adam: The director. We know from the second half that he is engaged to Camilla. His sole purpose, being in the first half of the film, is only to serve Betty / Diane as a punching bag as she develops such hatred for him. <br /> <br /> Aunt Ruth: Diana's real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she's actually dead. Diane inherited the money her aunt had left and used it to pay for Camilla's murder. <br /> <br /> Mr. Roach: A typical Lynchian character. Not really; only appears in Diane's dream sequence. He is a mysterious, influential person who controls the chain of events in a dream from a wheelchair. He has much of the same function as the backward-talking dwarf (whom he also plays) in Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> The killer: the person who killed Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, even though he was shown a bit more silly in the dream sequence (more on that below). Now that the different versions of the characters have been defined in the movie, we can start to delve into the storyline. Of course I will not go into every detail (I will not specify it chronologically), but I will try to explain some important scenes related to Lynch's "Leaflet". <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, Camilla was restored to amnesiac in the first 10 minutes of the movie due to her unlikely survival in a car accident, which made her completely vulnerable. What MD found very intriguing is that Lynch keeps giving hints about what's real and what's not. I've already mentioned that the camera moves into the cushion, but on each lane drive two cars approaching the sedan. <br /> <br /> Only one of the cars actually hit the sedan; what about the other? Even if they did not escape the accident themselves, would not they try to help or at least call for help? My theory is that since this is a dream, the other car's presence is simply set aside and forgotten. Because, as Rogert Ebert puts it so eloquently: "Like real dreams he does not explain, does not complete his sequences, lingers on what fascinates him, and rejects unintentional actions." Shortly thereafter, Rita crawls down from the crash site in Mulholland Dr., and walks down the slope and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment. Betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away, staring scaryly, grinning at themselves and the camera. This is the first indication that what we see is a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Although the old couple Betty are unfamiliar, I believe that they are indeed their parents (seeing them in the Jitterbug contest). Maybe she did not know her so well and did not really have as good a relationship with her as she wanted, and so the couple in the dream is presented as very pleasant and helpful. They also express their guilty feelings about the murder and Diane's feeling of being unsurpassable about their unattainable goals in their lives. <br /> <br /> A rather long and funny scene is the scene in which the killer is involved. Diane apparently sees him as the main force behind the campaign, trying to pressure the director to accept Camilla's role in the film (from Adam's party in the second half of the film), and he therefore takes a large part of her dream on. Because of her sense of guilt and the remorse for the murder of Camilla, part of her wants him to miss him, which is why she makes him a stupid criminal. <br /> <br /> This scene is, I believe, Lynch's attempt to totally blow his audience out, as they have a false pretense to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I have to love the "Something bit me me bad" line. :) <br /> <br /> The next interesting scene is with the twins at Twinkies talking about how one of them has this recurring nightmare with a man being seen by a man through a wall outside the diner where they are sitting. After a short conversation, they go outside and continue walking towards a fence corner, accompanied, of course, by excellent music that matches the mood of the scene. <br /> <br /> As he reaches the corner, a character with a disfigured face emerges from behind the corner, terrifying the living manure from the man who has the nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diane's mind; She saw this guy in the diner as he paid the murder. In short, her aspirations are translated into poor man's nightmares. The bum also means Diane's evil side, as you can see later in the movie. The Cowboy (along with the Dwarf) forms one of the curious characters that are ever present in the Lynchian landscape - Diane I only briefly saw him at Adam's party, but just as our own dreams can distinguish insignificant persons that we in our dreams barely knowing, he can get an important part in their dream. During his scenes we are given further hints that what we see is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.). <br /> <br /> The cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director when he meets with him at the odd spot (the lights here clearly indicate that this is part of a dream). Notice also how he says he reappears when he (Adam) does good, or twice when he does evil. Throughout the movie, he appears two more times and shows Diane that she was feeling sick. He is also the one who brings her to reality (this scene is probably an illusion that meets her needs if he appears twice), and shortly thereafter commits suicide. <br /> <br /> The espresso scene with The Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, as Luigi) is probably due to the fact that Diane had an espresso just before Camilla and Adam in the announced the second half at Adam's party. It could also be a statement from Lynch at the same time. During the scene in which they enter Diane's apartment, Camilla is the body lying in bed, but notice how she has taken Diane's sleeping position; Diane sees herself in her own dream, but the face does not belong to hers, although it had the same wounds on her face that Diane had after the shot. This scene is also filled with a certain Lynchian scare. Since Diane did not know where (or when) the Hitman came to Camilla and got her killed, she simply brought her home. <br /> <br /> In real life, Diane's auditioning for the movie part was bad. In her dream, she delivers a perfect audition - the whole crew is thrilled with their performance. Also interesting is the fact that the money that was actually paid for the murder of Camilla now appears in Rita / Camilla's handbag. This is part of Diane's submission to her terrible act by effectively recovering the money, as the murder has not taken place now. <br /> <br /> When her neighbor comes to get her ashtray in the shape of a piano, another clue is given; She takes the ashtray off her desk and leaves, but when Camilla and Betty meet on the couch, we see the ashtray reappear as the camera pans across the table, suggesting that Betty's meeting with the neighbor is a Fantasy was the slogan of the movie in which Adam will audition actresses is "She is the girl"; These are exactly the same words Diane uses when giving the biography of the hit Camilla. <br /> <br /> The blue box and the key represent the crucial turning point of the movie. Here are the true identities of the characters uncovered. Here is a lot of symbolism; The box may represent Diane's future (she is empty) or a kind of Pandora's box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open). In any case, it is related to the murder over the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder). The box can also be seen at the end of the film in the hands of the disfigured butt. <br /> <br /> Club Silencio is a nice little addition to further reminding the viewer that what he is watching is not real. It also means that Diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality is a nightmare that she can not even escape in her dreams). <br /> <br /> At the end of the scene during the chill scene Creepy old couple reappear, Diane is so tormented that she only sees suicide to escape the screams and to avoid them their fears are haunted. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's my $ 0.02. Hope this could help people beat this movie and call it "the worst movie of all time" or anything in that sense without realizing the plot. <br /> <br /> As usual, Lynch is concerned with creating irrational fears. And he certainly creates with this picture. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
