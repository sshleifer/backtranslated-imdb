If I was allowed to see only one program in my entire life, I would definitely have to choose "The Chasers War on Everything". Of all the satirical shows shown on Australian television, I found "Chaser" to be the funniest of them all. It's just amazing, the boys are not afraid to do anything. <br /> <br /> Whether it disguises itself as Hitler to get into a Polish club, or pull a MASSIVE ball of string through Melbourne to try out tourism ads or rock naked in the Cola factory in a bath with $ 2.40 to buy water. The Chaser boys will go there. <br /> <br /> In line with the comments above (and / or below) "The Chaser's War on Everything" is more popular than its previous program "CNNNN". But CNNNN was just as funny. Some unforgettable moments from this show ... clean up Cambodia !!! Classic. <br /> <br /> So to stop me from screaming, I definitely recommend you give Chaser at least one chance, you will most likely find HILARIOUS !!!!
