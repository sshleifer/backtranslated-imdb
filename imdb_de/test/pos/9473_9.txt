I just brought my 11-year-old daughter and my 8-year-old son to this movie and I can not remember a movie I laughed so hard in - literally loud, deep laughter because this movie is hilarious. Granted, the plot is predictable, but the ride is very enjoyable, it does not matter that you know how it will end. The comic timing of the actors was impeccable. The actors were perfect. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last of the young actresses who do not ruin her life. She is so refreshing. My kids said this was their favorite movie of 2006 now. Our money was spent well on this movie.
