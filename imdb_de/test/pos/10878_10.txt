Two years after its first release, Goldeneye still stands in the field of first-person shooters for the Nintendo 64. Even the series Quake and Turok did not have the combination of graphic details, sound quality, opposing intelligence, challenge and overall fun I keep coming back to this game back. Each of these missions has specific goals that force you to think of Bond. Not only must you shoot up every villain that appears on your screen, you'll also need to avoid cameras, disable security systems, rescue hostages, protect the Bond girl, and so on. In this game there are numerous gadgets, including the famous watch. The game is loosely based on the movie storyline, including all the main characters and the best scenes of the film, from the bungee jump of the dam to the flight of the propeller aircraft to the tank hunt through St. Petersburg. Even the layout is kept as much as possible so you can see different situations when you've seen the movie. Other levels are added to challenge the player and put the scenes together a bit more. With each level of difficulty, the mission goals are more difficult, the enemies smarter, and the bullets more deadly. I have not gone through the 00 Agent levels yet. Cheats can not be opened by entering codes or pressing keys, but by reaching certain levels within a certain time frame, and additional characters can be opened for the multiplayer. The multiplayer is still the best of first-person shooters. It's not as crisp as Turok, but it does not slow down nearly as much ... Countless opportunities give your friends a reason to keep blowing, and again for kicks. There are better games for the N64, such as Zelda and everything else that is Star Wars, but Rare has continued his series of outstanding games with a first-person shooter that will not outbid and be surpassed until becoming Perfect Dark in 2000 trumps himself.
