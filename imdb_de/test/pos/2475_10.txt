Death Camp Opera: Right here, right now! <br /> <br /> Ten years ago I read that a very special film about the polarization of our society had been filmed. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. His picture was played by some non-professional actors, citizens like you and me. and other. The violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both actually. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I realized how hard it was to find it. Maybe I would by chance? Anyway, it's still an old story. I saw it recently. Totally impressive. My dearest art peace: Punishment Park is the name. I love this "docu-fiction", this "Truecastmovie", this "reality-show-fictionnal", whatever. After all the shock films I have seen, I am getting the most out of this strong and intense experience of cinematography. I found a masterpiece. There's plenty on the net to learn a lot about the movie. It's even on DVD to buy, with additional material. The only words I would like to add relate to my own experiences with this film. I can only trust, direct, act or watch such honest and committed artistic peace on people and on people. A cinema that is simply a real human experience in an art adventure? or the opposite. <br /> <br /> So I'm not talking about all the "Mucs" we can see on TV, especially the "reality-show", which are interesting the concepts of self-play of people but are used on dumb ones and perverse way. At Punishment Park we can see some real individuals as they are. We only put them in a very specific context, with a few lines that follow, and we let them be what they want to be. It is a kind of therapy, a kind of 'individuation' for the people in the film and also for the active viewers in front of screens. Then the director's touch ends with a short and sweet apocalypse movie, a desperate cry, a "Death Camp Opera" in which some people are on the run for virulent exams. Punishment Park is for those who want to grow. Watch this movie and have the opportunity to choose your own morality. Grow up and harmonize with it! If you can feel it! If you can see it !! In my case, the Punishment Park is in me forever, with all my love, my consciousness and my will.
