I did not find this movie really bad. Sure, the detective somehow sucked on what he had done, and usually he passed Capt. Howdy accidentally, but he did the work. Captain Howdy himself was pretty scary. The make-up artist has done a great job. I really enjoyed seeing Dee dressed quite geeky. I laughed so much when I saw that. I personally do not understand how anyone can sit in the crap like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, call it a great movie, and then see Strangeland Bad. Personally, I think the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a lot of crap. Probably one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I enjoyed Strangeland. It was a very disturbing movie because almost everything actually happened.
