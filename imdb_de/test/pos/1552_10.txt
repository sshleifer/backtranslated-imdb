This film brings the psychological thriller in new dimensions. Well written by Shane Black, the film is performed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of director Jack Swanstrom. Of course, Swanstrom is a director we should look out for in the future. His strength lies in the adaptation of personal experiences both on the canvas and in the classroom. <br /> <br /> This thought-provoking film is a must for anyone who appreciates action, drama, suspense and mystery. As with all good films, the viewer undertakes a journey of their own to find his own interpretation of the film. The mystical aspect of the film is fascinating and adds to the excitement. They find themselves together with Marquette in search of answers. The audience loved the film on the festival circuit - with many prizes they must agree that A.W.O.L. (2006) is very worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I would like to have a copy - how can I get one?
