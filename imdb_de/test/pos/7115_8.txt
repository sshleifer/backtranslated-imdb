This moody, scary horror movie starts at a cliff-top castle overlooking the ocean, a great backdrop as a vampire bat flies in and sneaks onto a sleeping doctor (Onslow Stevens). The bat turns into a man named Baron Latos, in reality Count Dracula (John Carradine). He is looking for Dr. Edelmann's help to cure him of his vampirism. Finally, the good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked nurse assistant (Jane Adams), the Wolfman (Lon Chaney), and the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange). But Dracula's trickery infects the doctor's blood and he becomes a Jekyll / Hyde vampire himself. This is slightly better than last year's House of Frankenstein, as it is less episodic and visually more exciting. There is a haunting scene in which Dracula tries to lure the second nurse (Martha O'Driscoll) into his world, where she first plays "Moonlight Sonata" on the piano, which soon leads to frightening music. Director Erle Kenton uses expressionist shadows and sinister music to frame many sequences, including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio often used in its horror features. Two actors are remarkable: Stevens is initially sympathetic with his wonderful voice, then convincingly menacing. Adams, her beautiful face in an alarming contrast to her twisted body, shows a great pathos and compassion. It all ends in a noisy climax, typical of the 1940s Universal Horror, a bit abrupt, with footage from The Spirit of Frankenstein (1942). I hope that Universal will soon release it on DVD (it was not released in the Double Feature versions).
