true love. true love. Crazy love. nice love. ugly love. dirty love. sad love. happy relationship. stupid love. clever love. beautiful love. stupid love. Love love love. Minnie Moore understands that she really needs a man who trusts her, trusts her and loves her immortal. of course, if this man comes along ... she tries to run away, but seymour, wonderful seymour, he trusts her, he believes in her, so he'll fight her for her. I want to be like seymour moskowitz. I want to be such a man. a man who is ready to love without fear, failure, but willing to fail. This is a kind of hero. This is my kind of hero ... and Minnie Moore is my kind of wife. Long live Cassavetes and his whole bunch!
