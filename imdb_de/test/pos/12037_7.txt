The Turner Classic Movie Channel shot the films of one of my favorite actors, Robert Montgomery, in January. His films are rarely seen these days, except for those who were atypical of most of his career - meaning that the roles that often appear on television are YOU PRICED, WOMAN IN THE LAKE, JUNE BRIDE, NIGHT FALL, SAXON CHARM, RIDE THE PINK HORSE, RAGE IN HEAVEN, THE EARL CHICAGO (in short, the films in which he fought to get the roles because they are not the usual comic fluff that he normally performed in). It is ironic that these days, considering Montgomery's career, the films filmed especially after 1937 are the ones that broke the original image that MGM and Louis B. Mayer promoted. Too bad that Montgomery was a gifted comedian and saved many films from the routine. The PETTICOAT FEVER is one such movie. Made in 1936 with PICADILLY JIM and TROUBLE FOR TWO, it was an outstanding year with good performances by Montgomery, which helped convince MGM's forces to play "Danny" in NIGHT MALL FALL year. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER plays in Labrador and Montgomery is a weather station operator named Dascom Dinsmore. He has lived there for five years and was not in the company of a woman most of the time (except for Inuit women). He has a kind of girlfriend named Clara (Winifred Shotter), whom he has somehow suggested, but he has not been heard by her for two years and believes she has given him up. <br /> <br /> Dinsmores world is shaken when Sir James Felton and Irene Campton (Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy) show up. They flew to Toronto for a business meeting to which Felton was to turn. Felton is engaged to Campton, but Dinsmore finds her enchanting ... and gradually she finds him just as attractive. Surely, the pompous, self-important and hopelessly unresponsive Felton is not a rival (it's a measure of Owen's spectacle that he entertains the character, even though it's hard to believe that such a fool is a Canadian industrial captain) /> <br /> This Film has something surreal - probably because of the original. While the "Labrador" scenery looks rather phony, it serves as the comedy (witness of the Polar Bear sequence). But the highlight of Surrealism is the dinner that Dinsmore serves to its guests, a dinner with "pemmican steaks" that Owen eats with real enthusiasm. Owen (a little nobleman as Baronet) is dressed in normal clothes - a winter suit for the climate. But Montgomery is dressed in his evening suit (as if he were visiting a ball at the embassy). When Loy sees him disguised, he also puts on a dress. They are served by Dinsmore's servant, Inuit Kimo (Otto Yamaoka), who also wears an evening suit. It turns out that it is Owens! Owen, who had previously insisted that Dinsmore dress suitably for his station, is the only person who is not dressed properly for this dinner !! Montgomery was the most elegant actor of MGM in a tuxedo or evening dress (Franchot Tone was his closest rival). If Montgomery or Fred Astaire turned out to be more elegant in such suits, this is a movie cast. Hard to decide. <br /> <br /> The course of love does not go smoothly in comedy or drama. Clara appears (we are informed too early at the beginning of the movie when we see her on an ice ship). Will Dinsmore break with Clara? Will Irene break with Felton? The movie is funny and Loy and Montgomery make a nice couple. They had appeared together in another film, and both were in a second scene before this movie. This would be the last movie together. <br /> <br /> One last interesting point: At the beginning of the movie, when the credits are shown, you will see pictures of men and women in weird situations. They are based on the artwork of John Held Jr., the great cartoonist / illustrator of the 1920s and 1930s who was the flapper and "jazz age". It's an unusual choice - since it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot of the movie or Labrador.
