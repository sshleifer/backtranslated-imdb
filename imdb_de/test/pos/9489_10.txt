Zeppelin is my favorite band. When I heard that this double DVD came out, I was understandably excited. I'm just going to hunt and tell you, if you're Zeppelin fans, you need to get out and buy right away! It is absolutely spectacular! It blows 'The Song Remains The Same' completely out of the water. Why this material has never been published, I am not. The material shown here really shows Zep at the height of her playing, which I never really felt as a "song". Jimmy Page is undoubtedly the best there has ever been and Jimi Hendrix will look like a jerk through these performances! Be on the lookout for the live jam 'White Summer' ... woe! <br /> <br /> Viva Jimmy Page! <br /> <br /> Viva Led Zeppelin! <br /> <br /> from 10
