I saw this movie for the first time at a premiere party in Fredrikstad's hometown of Mr Zwarts. I laughed and laughed between directors, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities ... I just could not stop. If you like a comedy with black humor, sharp lines and excellent acting, this is a movie you must see! It's like mixing "True Romance" with "The Wedding Singer" and adding a hint of "Mad about you" to Hilarios! <br /> <br /> 10 points!
