I like the national anthem. I like the national anthem, if I put for nothing else before the Midnight News, that I play cymbals in the band. Not as easy as you might think! One two three four; One two three four; but what then? So I understand the practicing bass drum player in Roy Andersson's wonderful movie and wait patiently for him to hear a very good 70's cassette player. <br /> <br /> The motif of the 70s seems to be completely classic and soulless furniture. In addition, each scene has an eerie jade wash that highlights the meticulous nuances of the subtlest spectacle. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to Jessika Lundberg's superb purple boots. Boots that would otherwise have inspired a Silk Cult advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> But then the difficult one. Someone asked me what it was about. Well, there's a scene where the starting line is called "I do not have that length green" Brilliant. Straight from a Gary Larson box. <br /> <br /> I can not say what it's about. See for yourself. <br /> <br /> Ron Plasma <br /> <br /> Hmm. Larson! Sounds Swedish <br /> <br /> (seen 15Apr08)
