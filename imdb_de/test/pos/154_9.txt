No pun intended. I will not spoil the story, but you can assume that you already know which character represents the main actor. And of course, being a priest while being "naughty" is exaggerating all that. It's also the hottest movie ever made by Park Chan Wook. <br /> <br /> If you have seen Wook's previous work / films, you know that he is very visual (in a good way) and is shown here again. Although it deviates from the revenge motives of its earlier films on the surface, it still has some heat under it. And when that cooks, some bad things happen. But through all the darkness there were also moments of light (fun). A very stylistic yet provocative film that lives off the mainstream and does a great job ...
