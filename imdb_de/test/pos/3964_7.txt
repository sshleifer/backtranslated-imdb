When the trailer for Accepted first came out, many people were excited to see it ... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's it. People went to Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted is not the kind of movie that is meant to be a good movie. It should be a movie that thrills the audience without too much effort. That being said, for those of you who have been expecting a great movie, you need to think about what could be made of such a comedy. Remember, and you'll really enjoy the movie (because you're getting rid of your idea that the movie is going to be awesome.) BELOW: Watch the movie and have fun.
