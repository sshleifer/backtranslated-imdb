I could not believe that the Adult Swim guys had this character. I laughed for days and just thought about this show. After I finally saw the pilot, I will probably hold on to a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the entire crew of the police shows characters, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a bit frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a wandering ass who has nothing but legs and wears stockings and feet with traditional wingtips. Assy drinks too much and "plays by his own rules," as you may have guessed. The only other funny moments are that Assy shoots many, many people and spends time at home - in the bathroom. It's not funny squidbillies, but worth a look.
