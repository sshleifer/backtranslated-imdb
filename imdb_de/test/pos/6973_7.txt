** SPOILERS ** A simple movie about simple people whose problems are far too complex for them. <br /> <br /> Natalie or Sara Ravenna, Shirley Knight, is overwhelmed with married life and the fact that she is now pregnant is the straw that breaks the camel's back. Natalie has no idea where she is going, but she hopes to find peace and quiet somewhere in the heart of America. On the Pennsylvania Turnpike, Natalie attacks hitchhiker Jimmie "Killer" Kilgannon, James Cann, who seems as lost and confused as she is. When Natalie called herself Sara at the time, she quickly learned that Jimmie had suffered a severe concussion while playing football on his collage team and was reduced to such a simple-minded person who is so passive that he allows everyone, even later Film Natalie, step over him. <br /> <br /> Sympathetic at first, Natalie is very upset about the self-pitying Jimmie, who does not stand up for herself and lets herself be used as a doormat by anyone he comes in contact with. Not knowing what to do with the childish Jimmie Natalie finally gets him a job near Nebraska as a cleaning man at the Reptile Jungle Pet Market, run by Mr. Alfred, Tom Aldrege. Jimmie is the friendly and simple-minded person he is, and gets all the animals out of the cages that cause havoc in the zoo business, and lets him be fired by his boss, Mr. Alfred. In the meantime, Natalie thought she was finally done with Jimmie and ends up back in the reptile jungle when she got a ticket from Robert Copall, Robert Duvall. It seems that Mr. Alfred is also the incumbent district judge and the person to whom Natalie should pay her traffic penalty. While all this happened, Gordon, the cop, had a strong liking for Natalie and wanted to put her in the bag, in his trailer, the first chance he can. Gordon, a widower with an uncontrollable 12-year-old daughter, Rosalie, Marva Zimmet, needs a mature woman with many lovers to make him forget his many social and psychological problems and Natalie is exactly the medicine the doctor ordered! > <br /> *** SPOILERS *** A wild and shocking finale, in which Gordon went completely crazy and tried to rape Natalie, who rejected his drunken thrusts, which finally got Jimmie out of his self-pitying stupor and There is no happy ending, for Natalie was rescued from manipulation and rape by Gordon, but Jimmie, who whirled Gordon around like a ping-pong ball, was dead for all his good and noble efforts. <br /> <br /> Jimmy was by far the most tragic and likable person in the entire movie. All Jimmie wanted was a friend to talk to and spend time with, and all he got was the end of the stick. Of all, even of the one person who treated him first with kindness and understanding: Natalie Ravenna! In the end, though he was treated like dirt by everyone else, despite his willingness not to offend, even those who had stepped on him, Jimmie was the most sympathetic and heroic person in the movie.
