This movie is very stupid and very funny. You can never criticize it because you take yourself seriously. If you've listened to their previous album or watched HBO videos from this album, you can imagine the extremely foul-smelling, rocking time of this movie that tells the fable of how the group Tenacious D came to be /> <br /> Full of cameos Not only is there a fictional account of Tenacious D, but it is also a broadcast of music history. The humor is reminiscent of Something About Mary, as they often "go there that they thought they would not," but they lack the skatological humor of South Park. This movie contains no nudity except mooning.
