Finally, I snatched a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal from Netflix and spent New Yera's Eve watching an amazing drama. It began when Shyama (a winning Nandita Das) was married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over her romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp when she gives birth to a child. A few years later, we see Amudha, a playfully popular child (P.S. Keerthana), who is the favorite (or burden) of teachers, parents and classmates alike in a very problematic order. On her birthday she is told by her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) that she is not her biological child, she was adopted. This tilts her self-assured, love-filled world, and she's always busy wondering why her birth mother left her. Later, the adoptive parents tried her to Sri Lanka to find her birth mother. The country is torn by a furious civil war, and the trio will inevitably get into the mess. However, this also causes them to meet the new Shyama - one who will eventually face Amudha and ask why she has left her daughter. <br /> <br /> The story of a child who has to deal with the fact that she has been abandoned At birth, her compulsive urge to reconnect with her mother made the unconditional love of the adoptive parents, the demons Mani Ratnam filmed a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that touched the soul. The music of AR Rahman perfectly complements the magical and poignant moments of the film. The film has outstanding performances of Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and an absolute madness role as Amudha - the Abandoned - performed by the child artist P. S. Keerthana. For this performance she received a national award. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully designed and shot stunningly. I am fascinated by the connection Mani Ratnam associates with terrorism, love and obsession. I think his exploration of these topics is absolutely outstanding. Mahadevan's character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, but he agreed well with how interested he was in the little girl. His deposits were hilarious. The mother, who was played by Simran, was also very complex - she was idealistic, loved the adopted daughter, but also worried about her biological children. The shock, anxiety and obsession of the child Amudha were excellently portrayed by P. S. Keerthana. Her big, accusing eyes talked the most. In fact, the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das and her husband. Maybe Mani deliberately made her mysterious so as not to tell us why they were like her - the mystery of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes. It also prevented him from being judgmentless - this was another conflict in which he did not take sides but merely show the human tragedy. Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul-stirring drama - I seldom weep the films, but it made me wet and a little heart-sick. This is a beautiful movie - a treasure and a guardian, if you can find a copy; borrow one more today or steal one and watch the movie!
