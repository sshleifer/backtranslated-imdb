I work in a cinema as a projectionist and have the opportunity to basically watch any movie that comes out. When I saw the trailer for "Black Snake Moan" for the first time, I laughed and thought, "Great, another Snakes on a Plane Samuel L Jackson movie." But of course I wanted to see it for the salmon factor. Many people have over-judged this film because of the allusions in the title, the images in advertisements, and the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. I personally loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and a young woman who are both going through hard times and reaching each other. The story is really touching and sends a great message about life and how we live. Of course I do not recommend it for a young audience because of the graphic material. However, if you are looking for a great story and authentic drama by Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci, and even Justin Timberlake, then I recommend you moan 'Black Serpent'.
