Let me first say that I spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before I realized that I was completely uncoordinated. I've always thought it would be cool to watch cats know how to handle them extremely, but I've never been a skateboarder and never really followed the sport. That being said, I considered it a very informative and interesting documentary. Some reviewers said these guys somehow blew their own flag, but what the hell? It seems to me that these guys probably deserve as much recognition as anyone who has given the skateboarding world a kick and they have provided some good shots of their innovations. It's great how viewers can see these guys then and now. The material that they grew up as a teenager in California offers interesting nostalgia that goes beyond the skatesport. I never thought where the extreme skating came from, but this film connects all the parts together and gives us an informative documentary. I am sure that it is at least a little biased, but is not it all documentation? Worth seeing for anyone interested in sports or, as in my case, for those who grew up in the 70s.
