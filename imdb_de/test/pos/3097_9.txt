The famous filmmaker Werner Herzog "Fata Morgana" is breathtakingly unorthodox. Although there are characters in the film from time to time, there is no actual story. The film is also not an educational or historical documentary. It's a movie without an accompanying script. <br /> <br /> The film consists of curious background music and a somewhat illogical narrative VO, the combination of which overlays a long series of images, mostly from the Sahara desert, but not exclusively. Some of the pictures are wonderfully strange and unusual. The camera captures ghostly images or illusions, optical illusions that excite and fascinate. <br /> <br /> This general cinematic trend is underlined by occasional observation of random topics. In a sequence, for example, a man with glasses offers us a mini-tutorial on lizards. In a most intriguing and bizarre sequence for me, in a small room is a man with dark glasses singing in a voice that is completely distorted by the microphone he uses, accompanied by an old woman playing a punchy tune old piano Neither the man nor the old lady seem to enjoy what they do. How baroque. <br /> <br /> "Fata Morgana" has a basic concept that combines the wide range of strange images and eclectic sounds. However, this concept is so subtle and so opaque that you will never understand it without help. From this subtle theme, the film actually makes sense. Without this reference, however, the film may seem boring and endless, a pointless parade of random earthy imagery and esoteric narrative nonsense. <br /> <br /> Unapologetically superfluous, thematically confusing and cinematic heretical "Fata Morgana". They will probably faint or faint you. You can either stick to the Zen-like qualities of the film or smash the DVD into a thousand pieces. One thing that most viewers will agree on is "Fata Morgana" ... different.
