Will a company PLEASE create a (good +) DVD of this movie? "Four Friends" is not just a wonderful movie about relationships and friendships, but also the ONLY movie I've ever seen - and I literally spent * years * of my life watching movies! - That captures the essence of the experience of the 60s (and I was there!): the idealism, the hope, the freedom, the confusion, the betrayal and ultimately its positive, but bittersweet alienation. And all of this is achieved without being a story of the many upheavals of this epoch, though many are touched only ... as part of the tapestry. But the story is mainly about the characters and their friendship over 10-15 years ... and that these were survived and deepened despite the tragedies of this turbulent decade. Absolutely a funny and indispensable movie ... even if you are not an old hippie !!!
