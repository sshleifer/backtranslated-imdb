"One Crazy Summer" is the funniest, craziest (not necessarily the best) movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Just when one crazy scene is done, another is created. It never lets you rest. Only one by one. The soundtrack is great. The songs are the right ones for the scenes. <br /> <br /> It's also a clean movie. It's not a bit dirty. <br /> <br /> Of course, the story of the guys you would not trust with your lunch money would take on a challenge and win over people with more resources. Who wants to see it when they fail? There is a serious side where parents and children do not live up to the dreams of others. One should always be open-minded and weigh all options. This applies to both parents and children. In "One Crazy Summer" the parents are wrong. This is not always the case.
