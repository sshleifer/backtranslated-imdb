Do you know, sometimes you just have to have it? So this movie is with me. I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I like it, it's so stupid in some areas, but I grab it when I'm down and just need a good laugh ... silly guy "kinda guy. <br /> <br /> You can read the summary so I do not have to bore you, just rest assured if you like Kelsey Grammer you'll probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> One more thing, be sure You do not have to read them, just watch them and experience the performance of "In the Navy" by the Village People ... and friends.
