One night, bartender Randy (Matt Dillon) rescues Jewel (Liv Tyler) in front of her jealous friend Utah (Andrew Dice Clay). He brings Jewel home. But Utah comes back and wants Randy to open the safe at Mc Cool's. Suddenly a shot - Utah is dead. Then ... I better stop telling the plot. That explains the story of "Wild Things". What I found so interesting was the fact that the conspiracy (written by Stan Seidel, his first and last work - he died last July ...) was narrated from three perspectives - the three men who succumbed to Jewel. Each of them looks at her with different eyes - like John Goodman as a detective who delicately falls in love with her because he remembers his dead wife ... No wonder the boys are looking for her interested! Liv Tyler - she is a real gem. She has made the big screen shine! She played her role as if she were in a 40s noir thriller. Sweet - but at the same time she was the cool vampire who goes over dead bodies and uses the men for their needs. And of course Michael Douglas. How could I forget him? Mr. Burmeister, the bingo-playing killer - he was pretty cool! <br /> <br /> But in the last 10 minutes there was a bit too much slapstick for my liking - it weakened the atmosphere. This part started when Paul Reiser (as Randy's cousin Carl) put on his leather dress for Jewel. The "YMCA" song did not fit that much here ... ... but overall, "One night at Mc Cool's" is a pretty cool movie noir parody! <br /> <br />
