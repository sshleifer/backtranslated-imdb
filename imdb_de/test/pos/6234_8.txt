Slasher movies can be started 30 to 35 years before this movie, but believe me that this pearl stays longer after turning off the TV. Especially if you are slightly scared, this is the movie for you for which you do not have a stomach to fill it up. Even after so many years, the film has not lost its charm and thrill. <br /> <br /> No blood, but the thrill ensures that the spine is cooled. The movie starts with the bang and stays at the same pace until its very end. BGM is nerve-wracking and I remember that this was the case in many Indian films back then. Kings darling? No wonder why ... that's the only reason I wanted to see that and it did not let me down. "Do not turn off the light" ... because you will not find Enrique, but maybe a smiling doll sitting right behind you! beware. not for the lite hearted ... <br /> <br /> Two punches and I go with 8 out of 10, which is pretty low, but I still keep my ratings for dramas upright ...
