I saw this movie in Wales in July. It is about the courage of Czech pilots who flew numerous missions for the RAF after the occupation of their country by the Nazis. In this film, the action takes place both in the early 1950s, when these pilots were beaten in political prisons in Czeckoslavakia and in World War II in the UK. They were imprisoned after their return to their homeland because the communist regime saw these warriors as a threat to their occupation of Czeckoslavakia. The pilots retain their dignity in prison and in numerous air battles against Nazi pilots. This film contains a love negotiation that makes sense because it helps us understand that both civilians and soldiers have made great sacrifices to preserve democracy. The end of this film shows that the heroism of these Czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990s after the restoration of democracy in what was then known as Czeckoslavakia. This powerful and moving film was shot with the financial support of the Czech government. I highly recommend this movie.
