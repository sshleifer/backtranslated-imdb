One thing I noticed while watching this movie is that it was funny / exciting for the cast and crew; I could feel that they arrived with enthusiasm and commitment against the Budget, because they seemed to like the people involved. <br /> <br /> I like B movies that are original and have a heart, and I think that's one such work. The actors seem to give me more than usual hearts, perhaps because of a good direction from the lead actress / director, and they were obviously clear enough in their parts of the story to create a coherent, observable work of art. <br /> <br /> The criticism of this film, which is more or less: "Why not just rent a hardcore porn film", makes it clear why they did not like the movie. If you are hoping for this movie with lots of T & A without patience for the material of the plot, it is so unhappy for them. You could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porno, though I assume the star made its share of soft porn. I think she graduated. <br /> <br /> In terms of writing, dialogue is not a big part of the movie, as in a Tarentino movie, but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun. In particular, the end is not a disappointment, but a pleasure. The villager and the "leader" learn from their complex web of feelings. <br /> <br /> I understand that the producer made a 3-movie deal out of it. If you want to prove a few tens of thousands of dollars, it can go quite far if you have artistic sensitivity and pride. <br /> <br /> Gabriella and the other girls with nude scenes were likable and hot, not just Airhead bimbos, but also an erotic science-fantasy piece of nude art, even with the limitations of the B-movie Land, not disappointing.
