I'm not from the USA. I'm from Central Europe and think the show is amazing. It can easily be compared to married children. My title says that it is not shown to the conservative public. I mean, I'm not that liberal, but there can be a little difference between European conservatism and us. In any case, the show is very popular in our area and it is very bad that it contains only two seasons. The last episode opens up many uninterrupted and funny moments. In any case, I and many people would be glad if this continued to play. The last thing that excites me is a moral education that is very nicely packed in humorous scenes. I mean, I've seen many comedies that were very sad for two or more minutes in tragic scenes that absolutely do not fit the comedy. War does not contain that and makes you laugh. It is like the Simpsons and married, who also have no sad or even unpleasant moments. I apologize for my awful English skills, but I still hope you understand what I meant.
