I have seen this movie three times in different ages and have always enjoyed it very much. This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre, like Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly Musical, but in a French way. And a Jean Renoir, a nice tribute to his time, his friends, lovers, music and dances. It is also a show-business chronicle of this era, full of affection and French humor. It is also a clear tribute to Impressionism (people who like Impressionist painters will like this picture). This is in particular a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and of course to Jean Renoir's father Pierre-Auguste. You will find a trustworthy and gorgeous color reproduction of some Renoir masterpieces. Excellent casting, scenery, sound effects and music. Even it tells us about the founding of the Parisian Moulin Rouge, obviously it's a fiction story (and not very original, by the way, as she remembers the well-known morality that the show has to go on). But the production of Jean Renoir is great. <br /> <br />
