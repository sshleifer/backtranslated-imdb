"Who are you dreaming of? Hoot Gibson ... Howdy Doody? I'm talking about the * theater *!" [Harry Crystal] <br /> <br /> Nothing is better than a great stage show ... nothing! And Harry Crystal lives that belief. As a stage actor still waiting for his break, Harry brings the magic of the live theater to a small town and to Artie Shoemaker (TOM HULCE) ... a young man who has big dreams (but only knew it when he met Harry). <br /> <br /> With scenes and songs from many of America's classic musicals ... These lips, these eyes convey both the heights and the depths of the people who lead us into a fantasy land for two hours, but who can do it? to keep that magic alive in their hearts all day! <br /> <br /> Like Artie ... if you've seen those lips, those eyes ... "You're addicted, kid!" [Harry Crystal]
