Those who want to see movie noir remakes should not see this as a remake. You will always be disappointed. Instead, enjoy a gripping performance by Dennis Quaid and visual imagery that you should recommend. The color flows out of the film (literally, not metaphorically!)), When the plot gains pace, and the dialogue is crisp and bleak. The opening dialogue is smart and the viewer is carried away by a sharp script and a genuine, original film noir feeling.
