There are two ways to make a movie from a TV series. <br /> <br /> The first, most common and least successful film is essentially to make a feature-length TV episode - to watch the disasters of Steptoe & Son's movie. The second is to do something different - something completely different, Ã  la Monty Python. Fortunately, the creators of the cult TV series have chosen the second option, and they've come up with something unique, clever and witty - it could not feel any less like a TV episode. <br /> <br /> Try to turn your head - the authors who play themselves are confronted with their Royston Vasey alter ego, of course, and told to continue the series, otherwise Apocalypse will Meet village. <br /> <br /> High concept, invented and easy to screw up? Yes, but somehow they did it. Maybe not for all tastes, and the end dragging on, but the fans will be thrilled and it can even convince the uninitiated.
