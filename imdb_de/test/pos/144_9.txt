The priest did not show in deep love and suffering the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has the exalted beauty of man (or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/ <br /> <br /> And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious, but she takes the responsible death as a vampire. She did not fall deeply into the lost paradise, but decided to leave the man alone. Fragile but beautiful femme fatale! In this film, I had to think about the suffering between man and vampire, beyond the priest, and about salvation. I also thought about love. Adam was not so much responsible for Eve, but for this Adam (priest), who sacrificed and was responsible for bringing Eve out of the vampire world of Paradise Lost. Another symphonic poem by Adam & Eve, Paradise Lost.
