Horses on Mars is a wonderful journey made by very small creatures. It does not have to work hard to keep your attention, and the characters are really memorable. Most of the recognition must go to Eric Anderson for his choice of visual style and for writing an interesting story, but Anuj Majumdar deserves credit for the narrative and the wonderful musical score as well. These decisions were obviously no coincidence. If you can, you'll see it in the 35mm range for the most impact. It's a pretty nice movie!
