Tight, up-to-date political thriller targeting the controversial US policy of rendition and another frightening word from Orwell (collateral damage, anyone?). The inhumane interrogation is overseen by the Egyptian Chief of Police, who himself is the target of a fundamentalist suicide bombing and who interleaves the film's two main lines. Both work very well, the bombing set-piece graphics are daunting and realistic. Their dissolution shows in a stylish Tarantino-like flashback and the torture scenes of an innocent man, who are also inimitably depicted in their bloody detail. The film scores with the use of torture as a credible source of information. He rallies in the war on terrorists and against the unpolished faceless bureaucracy (here personified by a suitably cold-stoned Meryl Streep), such as the CIA chief, who casually gives the order for the rendition) who can ruin innocent lives. No matter Kafka's fiction. Think more of the recent killings of the innocent Brazilian in London in 2005, where the Metropolitan police chief is still in the job and nobody tried for the murder of the poor. The acting is consistently excellent - the two key roles of the innocent man and the terrorist bomber are played realistically and revealing by the unknown actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas. Similarly, Yigal Naor acts as an intimidating police chief and Zineb Ouhach as an idealistic love daughter with her performances, whose lack of familiarity (at least for me) enhances her characters' credibility. From the larger Hollywood names present, Gyllenhaal's stature grows with the following films. Here they play the first freestanding, but later certain conscience and desperate government man who does the right thing in the end. Witherspoon plays her disturbed wife mainly in one key, but is still believable, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin show convincing selfish senators and their lackeys who will only help you until your career opportunities are compromised. There are some fundamental weaknesses; There is hardly a dramatic need to "ease" El-Ibrahimi's escape, and Streep's character may be too obvious a Bogey man / woman. Worst of all is the pointless inclusion of Gyllenhaal's on-the-spot girlfriend, which is merely for decoration and a short, gratuitous love scene. On the whole, however, a haunting, thought-provoking cinematic experience.
