I do not really know what Dirty Dancing is about ... there is some kind of absolute magic in this movie. I can not possibly tell the hundreds (yes, hundreds) of times I've looked at, from start to finish .. But every time I come across it on TV, I'm intrigued and confused, sit down and spend two hours long to love the movie as if I were seeing it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray absolutely hated each other during the making of this movie, they have a beautiful chemistry on set. It's much more fun for the viewer to see that passion and commitment. I can not help it In the end, when Patrick comes to the Houseman family and says to their dad, "Nobody brings baby into a corner". (classic moment) For all those people who think this movie is cheesy and juicy, maybe in a way, but it was the penikel of the 80s movies and put Patrick Swayze on the map. his performance was impeccable. <br /> <br /> Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing! <br /> <br /> P- The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece
