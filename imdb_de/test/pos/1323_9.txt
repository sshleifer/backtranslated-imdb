Mishima is one of the greatest movies ever made. Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest script writer of all time, but I do not like the movies he shot, not what I saw (with the exception of this and Affliction) 3-dimensional character study. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima, Japan's most famous writer, and combines the last day of his life with flashbacks and stories. I do not know how, but Paul Schrader manages to combine all this in a very artistic way. The acting is great, as well as the photography and a perfect score by Philip Glass. Although this confuses the first consideration, this is one of the few films that becomes richer with each viewing. Really an underrated gem of a movie.
