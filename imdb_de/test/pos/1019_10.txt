Okay, I love this movie !!!!! I have seen it again and again. It's so hard to tell who the attacker is. They always think that it is one person, then another, then back to the first person, then to another person. It's so exciting that you want to fast-forward your TV to see who it is. <br /> <br /> ABSTRACT: Gail Osborne is raped and left at home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell how she was raped. It's about her meeting with her boyfriend, her teacher, who likes her, her ex-boyfriend, all the different stories, all the suspects. But who did it? <br /> <br /> I love acting, they have a lot of talent here. The tension is wonderful and the settings are excellent. If it's on TV, check it out. *** 1/2 stars 10/10
