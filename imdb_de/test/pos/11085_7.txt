My dad used to work on top secret information in the DIA and he mentioned that movie to me. When I was a kid, I always asked him what would happen if he revealed secrets and recommended the movie. In a jumble, they never really knew what the result would be. The snowman, Daulton, has really brought me to my knees because the movie just portrayed him as a drug man who did not know what he was arguing about. The hawk, Chris, is just one guy who wanted to express his feelings to the US government in a very radical view. For movie lovers this is a must !!!
