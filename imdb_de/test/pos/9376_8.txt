Definitely a "must" for all fans of Film Noir. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a fine script and a sharp, crisp sense, a top cast comes together and works like a well-oiled watch to produce a pounding psychological thriller. <br /> <br /> Wonderful characterizations articulate the powerful message of the film about racial and religious tolerance. It's difficult and almost unfair to highlight a particular achievement as there's no weak link across the company, but Robert Ryan as a hateful and violent white supremacist is really worried. <br /> <br /> Make this film In the 1940s, it would have taken a lot of courage. All these years later, at a time when contemporary films are dominated by a ridiculous abundance of nasty language, bare breasts, grumpy drama, and deafening soundtracks, it's refreshing to enjoy movies like "Crossfire." <br /> <br /> Another gem from the Hollywood archives.
