This film offers you a fascinating journey through one of the most exciting cities in the world - Istanbul - and its musicians. Do not expect a composition of Turkish folklore or the like. Alexander Hacke, a German musician and member of the cult band Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, travels to Istanbul to get to know the music scene. His sparse voices from what he experiences are a guideline through the film. But mainly the German-Turkish director Faith Akin lets different artists speak from Istanbul - and of course their music. They meet a variety of personalities, big stars and street musicians, young and old, people who play many different styles of music. But this film does not just introduce you to the sound of Istanbul. It also draws a compelling picture of Istanbul today and the development of Turkey over the last decade. The film characterizes its protagonists with subtle humor, but never without respect. They all share a passion for music and belief in their power. <br /> <br /> Akin once again demonstrates his talent for carefree diversity when introducing you to very different musical scenes. After his award-winning feature film "Against the Wall", Faith Akin proves with "Crossing the Bridge" that he can touch, entertain and lead his audience in a documentary alike. If you have never been to Istanbul, you want to go there after the movie.
