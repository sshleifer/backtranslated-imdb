I've watched this movie about 4 times and each time I'm impressed with Second Camera Assistant's work. Seems trivial, but there is something very professional, knowledge and talent. The film as a whole suffers from other problems, as stated in other comments. The importance of the topics covered is just as relevant today as it was 40 years ago. The acting is a bit tense, but the work of the second camera assistant is excellent! This person needs to get back into business - maybe directing? What is this person waiting for? I'll watch and wait and cheer from the sidelines! - Bob
