Gen-Y Cops ... since I heard about the release of the movie, I wanted to see it because I loved Gen-X Cops. I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse did not return and B) too much slapstick. Still, I liked the installment because maybe it's not good as a first movie, but it's good in its own way. Stephen Fung returns as an ultra-cool ladies man match having a solid girl Oli (note: where is Haze?) And Sam Lee returns as the crazy alien (this time talking to a Mohawk and a lot of English !!!!). The real star of the film is the newcomer Edison Chen. He's a great substitute for Nicholas Tse as ... Edison. I also enjoyed Paul Rudd's appearance by Agent Curtis ... he seems to be a tough guy, a smart FBI agent you'd like to hate ... but soon you want his character. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes are much better in this scene ... even though there are only a few, but they are great, courtesy of Jackie Chan-stuntman Nicky Li a cage fighter who is having a tiny little fight with Match has. Smoorenburg is also the stunt double for Rudd. <br /> <br /> If you like GEN-X COPS, you will love GEN-Y COPS !!!
