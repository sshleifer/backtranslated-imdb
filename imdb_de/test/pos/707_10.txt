I read on the internet that this movie is being rebuilt into a play. Finally!!!!! It's time for Hollywood to pull itself together. The big studios frowned and looked up annoyingly at Oscar. Go to the figure !! <br /> <br /> JERICHO MILE was ahead of his time. It is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Michael Mann, a true visionary, has found a way to engage an audience without excessive enjoyment. The Emmy Award by Peter Strauss is probably the best character role I've seen in my movie view time. Any actor who touches this role will never be the same (unless an Academy Award is already on his coat). <br /> <br /> The sturdy multi-ethnic ensemble, a backdrop for THE JERICHO MILE, lets the delicate social environment understand the dynamics of our world. This is salvation without public acknowledgment and the power of the human mind that overcomes all barriers. Imagine a convict who has been imprisoned since he was a teenager and had no chance of parole. He does not know that he is possibly the fastest runner in the world. ... what would you do? <br /> <br /> This movie makes you feel like you have not been cheated on any level. Totally exciting, captivating, emotional and a "Rolling Stones" soundtrack that makes your ass suck !!! <br /> <br /> I always thought that was for the big screen ... I can not wait ...! !! In the meantime, I have to revisit my weathered VHS copy that I had for many years.
