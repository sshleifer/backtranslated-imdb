My husband and I loved this movie. My husband was skeptical at first, asking how many points he would have for getting his way. But after a few key scenes, he was totally sucked and in the end he was convinced that it was one of the best films. Kathleen Bates has never been so wonderfully loveable and the rest of the cast is just fantastic. Thanks for this nice movie.
