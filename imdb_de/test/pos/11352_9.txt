When I saw the movie for the first time, I said to myself, "This is how a movie can be done like this." Wong Kar Wai's beautiful poetic love story captured me during and after the movie. I have to admit that this is one of the best love movies, maybe the best of all I've ever seen. The content and the shape overlap perfectly. When we observe the secret love, we see the characters in limited frames that limit their movements as well as their emotions. Beautiful camera angles and the lighting let the emotions and the blues even touch. I would like to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee for their fantastic cinematography that creates the love of love. The music also defines the sadness of love that plays along the beautiful slow motion pictures, and shows the characters in desperate moods. And of course the performances of the actors who make love so real. After all, all the elements of the film under the direction of WKW are perfectly combined and give the audience the feeling of love.
