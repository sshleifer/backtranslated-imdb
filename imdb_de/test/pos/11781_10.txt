The hysterical hardware wars are finally available on DVD. HW has established a niche among the parody classics and is not only an exciting short film of 20 minutes in length, but also an absolute must in low-budget film production classes, where the cult status of the film is very much alive. Not only does the DVD have the chance to revisit Ernie F.'s original parody (4Q2, Cinnamon-Bun Head, Ballistic Toast and others) in 1978, but there's plenty of extra footage showing the Fosselius joke. Antique Sideshow is a total parody that is very funny, but at the same time makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed. The director's commentary is just as hysterical as the creature feature that picks up parodies that include a movie in the talk show circuit, and actually IS, which is based on putting HW on the talk show circuit, albeit in public access , I would like to see Ernie, Michael Wiese, and their crew encounter other, contemporary, over-budgeted and over-budgeted goals to parody - as with almost every film Hollywood produces today at $ 100 million per pop cunning films such as Spider Man or Men In Black (actually parodying themselves!), but any number of overflown, rushed, overstressed and overpriced features. <br /> <br />
