This was an excellent movie with good acting and it keeps your attention until the end. Maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable about the subject, which is why they make so much rubbish. It could also be too deep for many viewers to give higher ratings to films like the American Pie series. Jake Gyllenhaal is a CIA analyst, not an agent who wants to see an interrogation of an Egyptian by Moroccans, not Egyptians. He should not be a hardened agent and therefore seems naive of the interviewing techniques used. This is more believable than if he looked like an "old hat". <br /> <br /> The story jumps a bit and can be confusing, but you can also focus on what's going on right up to the end, when everything fits together as the puzzle fits together. The supporting actors did a good job of carrying the film. I found the movie powerful and thought-provoking.
