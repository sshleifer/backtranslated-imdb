From the first to the last scene of the film, director Visconti distinguishes himself through his art, as long as the film remains as a cultural treasure for only God knows how long. It's perfection - as a movie though, but the story has a few minor flaws. <br /> <br /> Thomas Mann's novel is also a perfect work of art, which is why it is of course impossible to bring in another medium. Visconti follows the story fairly closely, and only when he admits to some deviations does the transition falter. And no matter how wonderful the landscape is, the tension in the air between the figures, the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories, the almost unbearably enhanced performance of Mahler's music - yet the tiny anomalies in the plot disturb me. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just a victim of a man's desire to commit the flawless. However, I will give an example that I consider crucial. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In Mann's story, Aschenbach eats the strawberries that are likely to contain the disease that will kill him after giving up his frustrated persecution of the young Tadzio in Venice. He can not be delighted and is committed to another - which poisoned him. It's very subtle in the book, but it's there. The forbidden fruit, in a sense, but rather a sign that he is giving up life himself. <br /> <br /> In Visconti's film he also eats strawberries, albeit in a rather insignificant scene on the beach. The persecution in Venice ends much more melodramatically. It works, too, but it does lack some subtlety and also the multi-faceted symbolism that makes us think. <br /> <br /> But all that is forgiven, if the film allows us to enjoy beautiful landscapes, faces and constellations and certainly so many other symbols that we can possibly digest - the last gesture of Tadzio being in the water is the equally sublime and mysterious finale.
