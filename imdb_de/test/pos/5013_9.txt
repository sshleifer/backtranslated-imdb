In many reports Stu Ungar was not a very nice guy. He spat at dealers, stiffened people he owed money, and verbally verbally abused him. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers may choose to coat the man, making him a sports hero who would win despite adversity. But High Roller does not do that. And that's a difficult business. <br /> <br /> Instead, we have to look very closely to see that a man who has never matured passes the frightened little boy from the streets of New York, despite all the successes. And the only real confirmation he ever receives is death. Very brave (because people do not understand it) and very touching (if you do). <br /> <br /> What's courageous is the use of a Scorsese feeling. "Aha! How derived," people say. "Really?" But there is virtually no violence. And Stuey LOVED gangster movies. Maybe the feeling reflects the man Stu and not the director Marty? And if it's really a low budget movie and looks so good, Bravo! <br /> <br /> Finally the linear Flashback structure. Wow, this is going to be hammered. But it not only works, it works extremely well, even for those who do not see the connection to the "Seventh Seal". (PROOF: In SS, Knight plays chess with death: In HR, Stuey says, "We can spend cards, you know.") ... Death says, "Never much good on cards ..." Damn great last line.) < br /> <br /> No tricky effects or camera movement. No shaky camera. Nothing trendy at all. Only solid, tight storytelling. <br /> <br /> Maybe that makes the movie too simple and somehow flawed. But then again it was the guy. And that makes it just right. <br /> <br /> 9/10
