Bergman's regular guests Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann played as village couple Jan and Eva Rosenberg. The story started with an ordinary couple who fights and paints. Jan was a sensitive person, but an escapee who isolated himself from the world. Eva is a practical woman who is tired of the ambition of her husband. Because Jan hesitates to repair his radio, they are unaware of the impending war. Of course, the war came and the film was a fascinating study of their transformation and invasion, as they were mistreated by the enemy and their own government, music to the film, but the soundtrack was the war noise. In one scene, the pulsating background shot, the explosion and the sound of flying through planes was unbelievable. From time to time, Bergman zoomed in on the expression as various events took place. When something violent happened, he zoomed out to let the audience perceive the violence instead of getting closer. Very well made movie.
