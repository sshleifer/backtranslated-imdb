I rented this movie with very low expectations but was pleasantly surprised. This movie is extremely good. And you would never guess that this is a low budget. <br /> <br /> EIGHTEEN, directed by Richard Bell, centers around an 18-year-old Pip played by the great Paul Anthony leaving home for circumstances like his older brother died. He is overwhelmed with guilt by this incident and falls into a hard life of a runaway teenage drug and alcohol. On his 18th birthday, his father Pip Pip pursues and gives him a cassette that his grandfather left him to listen to on his 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> How the whole movie is told with two simultaneous stories unfolding at the same time. The current life of Pip and the past life of his World War II grandfather, of whom Pip listens to tape. The three outstanding performances in this film are those of 'Paul Anthony' as Pip and 'Brenden Fletcher' plays Jason, the young soldier from the 11th World War, his grandfather. The role of the wounded paramedic 'Macauley' from World War II was played by 'Mark Hildreth'. All have performed well. <br /> <br /> A few worries and scenes that did not suit me well ... the priest, Father Chris, played by 'Alan Cumming', who is gay and is in broad daylight Get the local one Street vendors, the whole neighborhood knows about. And then there's the local seller, Jeff, a sweetheart played by the attractive "David Beaszely," who just wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason, attracts the very unattractive and sloppy street hawker Clerk who sleeps with almost everyone and everything Likely it is a poisonous time bomb. Besides, he is not a very nice person. This part just did not sound right. <br /> <br /> The parts that I liked best were the flashbacks of the war. They were so well played and very touching. In the end, there is a scene where one soldier is dying and the other "Jason" is there for him to comfort him and show him love while he is badly injured and dies. This is a wonderful and touching scene that caused me to cry. Nicely traded. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It is love, salvation, and the power of the human spirit to survive.
