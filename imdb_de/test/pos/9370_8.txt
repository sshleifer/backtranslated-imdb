"Crossfire" feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece - it's well played and beautifully filmed, but sparsely spelled and far too short. It's just a decent police case, with references to Film Noir (in the zenith of 1947) and social commentary (which is also trendy at the time), which was thrown out for good reason. It is remembered today as one of the first two Hollywood films dealing with anti-Semitism and much better than the "Gentleman's Agreement" of the same name (not a bad achievement). The real issue, however, is the difficulty that World War II soldiers had as trained killers as they made the transition to civilian life. (To learn more about this topic, try "The Best Years of Our Life.") A man is beaten to death in the first pictures of the movie. We do not see his attacker. The film is about investigating this murder, which is actually quite straightforward, but it takes some unnecessary detours, for example, when the prime suspect, a depressed soldier, lands in the apartment of Gloria Grahame, a dance-room hooker with Paul's real strange pimp Kelly played. In the middle of the film, there's also a talk on bourgeois issues that slows down the process to crawl, and the end is neat enough for a cop show. But otherwise it's a pretty decent puzzle. What a great Noir it could have been. Director Edward Dmytryk gives a few pointers to the theme of the original novel - homosexuality, not anti-Semitism - as if the sadistic sneaker Monty sees the image of his friend Mitch talking to a strange man in a bar. And the cast is excellent. Robert Ryan makes a very credible testimony and even in his last scenes even a little sympathetic, much like Peter Lorre as a child murderer in "M." He earned an Oscar but lost to Edmund Gwenn this year (you can not beat Santa Claus). Robert Mitchum is a friendly soldier of the accused murderer. Was Mitchum a great actor or a great star? Someone else can figure this out, but his sleepy eyes and confused half smile work very well here, implying that his character knows something that everyone else does not know. (And he does.) And Robert Young, as the detective assigned to the murder, is surprisingly stubborn and rejects his usual unsuspecting affection, even if he has to hold the civil rights sermon halfway through the picture. There's no question that Bogart or Tracy were brilliant in that role, but none of them was in the RKO in 1947, so you just have to get in touch with Dr. Welby deal. Still, Young is good enough to wish you'd put someone in a detective drama instead of "Father Knows Best", which he hated, and drove him to alcoholism and suicide attempts. The man deserves better than Smarm and Sanka.
