It's been several years since I saw this movie, so forget about most of the details. However, I loved it at that time and found the plot very poignant, the climax of the heart stopped. I remember that in 1979 I literally sat on the edge of my seat in the theater. Jane Fonda plays Los Angeles-based reporter Kimberley, who stumbles over an accident at a local nuclear power plant. She wants to bring the story to the public, with the help of her hippie cameraman (Michael Douglas), who photographed the event, but an eerie conspiracy tries to cover everything up. Jack Lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the conflict-ridden middle manager of the nuclear power plant, who is torn between the loyalty to his company and the "right action" by reporting the dangerous situation. His facial expressions speak volumes here. <br /> <br /> Aside from the thrilling storyline and thrilling suspense, this film is all about Jack Lemmon, his character and his outstanding acting performance. As for Jane Fonda (I was a big fan of her at the time), I suspect she's just moved from her anti-war protests to the nuclear industry. <br /> <br /> nuclear anxiety tactics. Despite the influence of Chernobyl and Three Mile Island (different types of reactors), our Canadian CANDU reactor is safe and recognized worldwide. I would not hesitate to live near the nuclear power plant, about an hour's drive away, where my friend works as a very competent engineer. Obviously, they eliminated any teen problem, regardless of the financial losses. I sincerely doubt that there will be conspiracies. It is hard to imagine that one of the managers or very well trained operators is willing to risk any kind of meltdown or whatever. Of course it is the moral to save neither cost nor effort in the construction of the plant or the ongoing security. <br /> <br /> If we want our western lifestyle, we have to get our energy somewhere. For those who claim that nuclear power can never be made completely safe (of course), they should volunteer as miners or return on pre-adolescent days. <br /> <br /> Be sure to enjoy this entertaining and exciting movie that seems to be based on a true story (loosely "beautified"). It's a real cooler, a thriller and maybe (?) Even a killer, but please, do not get your opinion on the operation and safety of nuclear power plants.
