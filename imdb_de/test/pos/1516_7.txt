I'm not sure what exactly it is, but the movie sits happily on my shelf, never thinking to ever leave me. Fulci has developed one of the most ridiculous, bizarre, spoiled and unique films I have ever seen. I've never seen what else to say, but I LOVE THIS FILM !!! The steak's tatar scene is absolutely thrilling, and the whole Nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely funny. I'm not sure what Fulci wanted, but someone has heard that Fulci accused him of "Scream" because of this movie Wes Craven of the Riss? "Cat in the Brain" is a must for bad movie lovers everywhere ... Yes, I'll definitely say it's not a "good" movie, but I guarantee that certain scenes will stay in your head forever! This is an exercise in craziness, people ... I think if I was a "serious" critic, I would give him a 3, but out of pure enjoyment (again, I can not really explain my affection), I would give it one 7 .... Really flogged ...
