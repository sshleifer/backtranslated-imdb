My wife is a psychotherapeutic therapist and we watched her from start to finish. I'm the typical man and I can not stand shoes, but this movie is amazing. If you want to see what it's like for someone who is going through this kind of fight, this is the movie for you. When I saw it, I felt sorry for him and others like him. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** Plus the fact that all the people in the movie, including the people in the asylum, were the real people in real life made it even more real. <br /> <br /> A must for someone in mental health!
