Josie is a reporter from a newspaper, who sets herself the task of going back to high school, since she will be 17 again. , <br /> <br /> When she's there, she remembers some really horrible things that happened to her the first time in high school, as we see in Flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> In the flashback scene, Josie (a small spoiler) was kind of a nerd in high school and was chosen a lot. One day the cool guy says he'll bring her to the prom, just on prom night as she leaves her house through the asshole and his bitch. What a terrible thing (some will find it hard to see them because it is so evil and you will feel warmer for Josie). <br /> <br /> I did not find this movie so funny, but there were really some fun stuff in the office scenes much funnier than anything that happened at school. <br /> <br /> This movie had the perfect happy ending as it brought tears to my mother and sister. The acting in this film was not excellent, it was good for most of the film, in some parts of the film there is bad acting. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 7 out of 10.
