I play this game right after watching the trailer in an old magazine with a CD. <br /> <br /> This is very interesting and darkly atmospheric (missing in today's games / movies). The game takes place somewhere in the mid-90s in the spooky, mysterious mansion. You play as Adam Randell and your goal is to free the soul of your father caught up in death. <br /> <br /> The look of the game looks like a sinking, but a very different kind of game. A lot of action, different puzzles, quests, mazes and many other interesting places and characters are presented in this old classic. <br /> <br /> The game only runs on Windows 98 and there is no patch for Windows XP.
