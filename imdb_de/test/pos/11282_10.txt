This is not a story. It's a bunch of psychic needles reaching for your subconscious mind. If you wait for a story, you will be bored. But when you surrender yourself, you are in the dream world within 10 minutes. The vague but disturbing images of pain and torture in a desolate landscape leave room for your own fantasies. The strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation, the visual echoes of the crucifixion of Christ, the pulsing light and the deep, dark shadows, all reach your subconscious to fill that thought space. I shivered and could not escape from my TV. It was like dreaming with open eyes. A strange nightmare, a bad journey, a religious experience ... it touched me deeply and shaped my life. It freed my mind and gave me one of those rare experiences of losing the personality and merging with the world of archetypes. A little freedom for the soul. A violent freedom, however ... Not a nice movie, but a very powerful and memorable movie. Literally my text has no spoilers. For me, the big surprise of this film was the incredible intensity of the film, and its description can be understood as a spoiler. The less you know about this movie, the better.
