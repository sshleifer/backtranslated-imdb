Producer / Golden Globe nominated director James L. Brooks is a really good satirical comedy shown behind the scenes of the life of a news anchor / anchor / journalist or producer be like. Basically, Jane Craig (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Holly Hunter) falls for new reporter Tom Grunick (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated William Hurt), but correspondent Aaron Altman (Oscar nominated Albert Brooks) also has strong feelings for her. The network is preparing for big changes and sparks fly with all members of the studio.

The comedy is subtle but strong, the romance has its moments and it is certainly a credible situation film.
