<br /> <br /> It is well known and said before: no one can ever play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer (no longer Kilmer, who divorced ex-husband Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett, and although this is a sequel and not a repeat (godly !!!), she still can not face this opportunity ( her voice sounds evil several times, she has brown eyes (Scarlett had green eyes in both novels and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green) and her voice was also inappropriate Scarlett is a Southern Belle, so she has an incredible talent for Flirting (as she did in SCARLETT's novel and, of course, GWTW) and to be a great flirtation like Scarlett, you would most likely need a higher voice like Vivien Leigh. <br /> <br / I think I compare Kilmer with Leigh a little too much, but if someone has such a masterly role as Leigh at Scarlett, you can just criticize a new budding Scarlett, Timothy Dalton should not have had an accent. due to the fact that both Margaret Mitchell Rhett and Gable in the fi i had none. His acting has never been truly remarkable (except perhaps his portrayal of evil by insulting King Phillip of France in THE LION IN WINTER), and he gives his rhett little (if any) freshness or vitality. <br /> <br /> Outstanding performers are above all Tina Kellagher (a born actress with much authenticity in her liberation) as the tragic victim Mary Boyle. And then of course there's Sean Bean as the cold, calculating and not to mention demonic evil Lord Fenton, Mary's nemesis and Scarlett's ultimate offender. I could not forgive the writer that Scarlett is being raped in this film (a fact that has never happened in the novel, Lord Fenton is cold and unworthy of the Irish in this book, but he is nowhere near so heartless.) Another failure read to the novel, but for the film, is the figure of Belle Watling, which was played by Ann-Margret in a cameo role, which we all could live without, the most terrible, since the book was such a fleeting bestseller without help by Mrs Watling. <br /> <br /> For a film alone, SCARLETT is a very good, but not so sublime place in relation to the GONE WITH THE WINDs sequel: Another actress was for both Scarlett and Rhett of great importance. <br /> <br />
