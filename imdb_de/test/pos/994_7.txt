This movie made a miserable freak in the UK and did not deserve it. The trailer for this film is easily misleading, and I think it has led critics and audiences to believe it's "Atonement: Part 2". Although the film was marketed this way to capitalize on the earlier success of the BAFTA award-winning Joe Wright movie, the tone is very different. The focus is on a vision of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who spent the Second World War as a writer of propaganda films for the war effort and on his return to Wales. Director John Maybury quickly introduces the childhood of Vera Phillips, played by Keira Knightley. She was Dylan's first love in her homeland, but the moment has passed, and singer Vera just wants it as a beautiful memory. Or does she? Vera unexpectedly has a close connection to the other woman in Dylan's life: "Queen of Ireland, love of my life, mother of my child" Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). The three form a kind of triple in war-torn London, but Vera then falls in love with a dashing soldier, William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They marry quickly and Killick goes to war. A frightened Vera persuades Thomas to return to Wales, but the three are confronted with the reality of the birth of Vera's child, William's jealousy and shell shock after returning home. Caitlin realizes that she can not share Dylan with her best friend. <br /> <br /> Filmed on a low budget, this is more of a mood than anything else. It works best as a recognition that some memories and feelings are appreciated, but not renewed. The performance of Sienna Miller is particularly excellent (the paparazzi nonsense unfortunately results in her being a true talent), and Knightley and Murphy are once again very good. The disappointment is Rhys as Dylan, who, while the Welsh poet himself was not a rosary, lacks charisma and lets us ask what these women see in Dylan. The writing is very choppy, some nice moments are interspersed with sloppiness. It is definitely worth seeing.
