A young couple - father Ben (solid Charles Bateman), wife Nicky (pretty Ahna Capri) and daughter KT (cute Geri Reischl from "I Dismember Mama") find themselves in a small California desert town surrounded by hysterical madmen. Worse, there is a pernicious satanic cult that has kidnapped small children for their own evil purposes. Director Bernard McEveety, after an unusual and inspired screenplay by William Welch and L.Q. Jones ("Devil Times Five" director Sean MacGregor invented the bizarre story) tells the compelling comical storyline at a slow but steady pace, cleverly creating a spooky, edgy, mysterious Ooga Booga atmosphere. Strother Martin performs a wonderful, evil, and robust job as Doc Duncan, the cheerless leader of the evil sect. The stellar cast of excellent character actors is considered substantial capital: Jones as a rude, sober sheriff Hillsboro, Alvy Moore as a friendly local Toby, and Charles Robinson as an ingenious, devout priest Jack. John Arthur Morrill's bright, polished widescreen cinematography, Jamie Mendoza-Nava's spooky score, and the wild, rousing black ritual of black mass are also up to date. The idea of ​​bringing toys to murderous life is simply awesome (the opening scene with a toy tank that becomes real and crushes a family in its car is really a jolt). Nice, weird, ambiguous ending. A gratifying idiosyncratic and subconscious winner.
