This show is absolutely fantastic. It has all the great drama and romance of teen shows like The OC and Dawson's, but it's a lot funnier. It's a show with morals and values, without everything being sugar coated and sterilized (ala 7th Heaven). There are no sisterhoods or brotherhoods in Australia, and our university system is completely different, so I do not know how exactly Greek life is represented. But I do not care! Because this show is my new favorite! Any writer who can make me beat a racist, homophobic confederate who wields a banner with the Bible must be awesome. <br /> <br /> And Cappie is my new Pacey. I'm sorry, Josh Jackson, you've been dethroned!
