I did not know what to expect from this hugely popular (and witty) Swedish comedy and satire team when they released their first feature film. Wider satire? Well, we get four contemporary, exceptionally memorable stories about family pain, generational gaps and especially fatherhood. But it is a drama, luckily, and what a drama! Epic in scope as each episode comes from carefully selected, geographically diverse parts of Sweden. But every story could carry a whole movie if it's expanded separately. <br /> <br /> It's dark, twisted, shattering, yet entertaining and breathtaking. Screenplay, drama and cinematography are absolutely world class, because three hours seem to be in no time! It is four stages of the championship and, without a doubt, one of the best films in the history of cinema in the United Nations. It's Sweden's answer to "short cuts" or "Magnolia" if you want, and immediately on par with those! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
