When the bicentennial came, I was in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and part of the Middletown Skate Team. We did nothing but skate and tried to find out what we read on the skateboarder magazine pages. A few local hills provided all the speed variations you could handle. At the time, Mike Weed was the hot stuff, along with Russ Whats-his-name, with the Z-Boys on his tail. I had a GT board (GrenTech) with Power Paw polyurethane wheels (loose bearings). My parents told me that we would move to California later this year and that they were going on a hunt trip. I was an extremely good son this summer and asked if I would not be rewarded with a REAL skateboard from California. You have delivered. It was a fiberglass deck with the Surfer Magazine logo on it. Wide trucks and big red wheels (precision bearings, you do not know). They had it in Oak Street, a surf shop in Laguna Beach. <br /> <br /> When I came to California (all 13), Anaheim had the Concrete Wave and Carlsbad also had a great park. Soon came skateboard Odyssey in Mission Viejo. An indoor park with every imaginable scenario. I read about Stacy, Shogu, Tony and Jay all the time. This movie was right for the money and a wonderful experience to watch.
