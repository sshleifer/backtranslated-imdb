Helge's best movie by far. Very funny, very surrealistic. If Bunuel made a movie with Buster Keaton as Krusty the Clown, he would look like that. <br /> <br /> Brilliant performances of the cast, which we already know from other Schneider films, in particular Helmut KÃ¶rschgen as a sidekick from 00Schneider. (Andreas Kunze, who once again plays the woman in this game, is a bit annoying though). And of course, Helge himself as Nihil Baxter is absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S: If this movie had a good merchandising, I would really like to buy a replica of this "wood is" painting.
