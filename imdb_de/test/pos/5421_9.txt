This is a very strange little short film that did not impress me at first. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the animation here is certainly not pretty - although after a while you realize that the simple and stupid drawings have a certain strange charm. This is probably because the script, which is as confusing as this, makes the animation work. The film shows an elderly couple sitting at the table playing Scrabble. At the same time they are fixated on this game or other bizarre persecutions (eg the man's compulsion to see things - even the chair and the table)! And all that happens when the TV warns of impending nuclear destruction - Armageddon is definitely here! Of course, the neighbors are screaming and running amok - during which time the couple silently continues this idiotic game. Heck, even her cat knows that the end is coming as the couple begins to argue about who may or may not have cheated - leading to a very surreal ending !! The film deserves a lot of praise for being both unique and very funny. Although the Oscar was not won, he was nominated for the Best Animated Short, which he had earned abundantly.
