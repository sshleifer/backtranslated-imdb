Stan as a bullfighter, and a good one, is a surprise. These silent shorts, which are usually overshadowed by Oliver Hardy, allow him the lead and the limelight. <br /> <br /> One can only conclude that his character "Rhubarb Vaselino" was a spoof on the many Rudolph Valentino films of this era. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to make fun of some dialogues and keep an eye out for the special effects. <br /> <br /> I have this on DVD in a Vol. 1 & 2 collection.
