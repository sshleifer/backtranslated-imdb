I liked this movie, not because Tom Selleck was there, but because it was a good story about baseball and also had a semi-dramatic view of some of the problems a BASEBALL player had at the end of his time in Major League sports. I also really enjoyed the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the little facts about how the games are played differently. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie to watch on cable TV or rent in a cold winter. At night you can check out the "Dog Day" of the summer and know that spring training is only months away is. A good movie for a baseball fan as well as a good "DATE" movie? Trust me in this case! *To wink*
