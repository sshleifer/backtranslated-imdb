The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon. two rival Bond films. "Octopussy" with Roger Moore was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond series. "Never Say Never Again", produced by a rival producer, is the only Bond movie not to be part of this series apart from the awful "Casino Royale". His great charm was that he brought the original Bond, Sean Connery; His title is allegedly derived from Connery's comment on "Diamonds Are Forever" that he would never play the role again. Some have complained that Connery was too old for the role at 53, but in fact he was three years younger than his successor Moore, who in the same year not only made "Octopussy", but also made another Bond film. "A View to a Kill", two years later. <br /> <br /> The film owes its existence to the settlement of a film rights lawsuit by Ian Fleming. It may be unfortunate that the terms of the settlement contained a clause that the new film had to be a remake of "Thunderball," as this might not be the largest of the Connery Bonds. (A remake of "Dr. No" or "Goldfinger" could have worked better). The plot is the same as that of the previous movie; The terrorist organization SPECTER, which co-operates with a megalomaniac tycoon named Largo, has stolen two American nuclear warheads and tried to force the governments of the world to ransom by threatening to detonate unless they receive a huge sum of money. Of course, it's up to Bond to save the world by tracking down the missing missiles. <br /> <br /> The film is fortunate that it has not one, but two of the most beautiful Bond girls of all, Barbara Carrera as a seductive, but deadly Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo's girlfriend Domino, at Bond's page is broken after learning of her lover's evil plans. Some Bond films have an action that depends on the hero's ability to win the villain's mistress or the bad guy's accomplice. Similar developments can be found, for example, in "Goldfinger", "Live and Let Die" and "The Living Daylights". , In the official series, Bond's ally is usually considered a female lead, but here Carrera, who plays the villainy, is charged with Basinger, who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. Of course, Basinger has become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, while Carrera is one of a number of Bond girls who are out of focus. Of the rogues, Max von Sydow effectively does Blofeld, the head of SPECTER, but Klaus Maria Brandauer seemed too bland as Largo and little threatening, except perhaps during the "Domination" game, a more sophisticated variant of those violent computer games like "Space Invaders" that were so popular on the Internet in the early eighties. Brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native German, in films like "Mephisto" and "Colonel Redl", but he does not speak English so expressively. <br /> <br /> One of the features of the film is that both follow the normal bond formula and sometimes deviate from it. There's the standard World in Peril storyline, chases, a series of exotic locations, glamorous women, sinister villains, and a specially written theme song based on the movie's title. However, there is no advanced pre-credits sequence, and we see some familiar characters in a new light. For example, Bond's Chef M becomes a feeble, cocky aristocrat, his American colleague Felix Leiter is black for the first time, and scientist Q becomes a decidedly workerly accent by Alec McCowen (despite his distinctive Christian upper-class name) as disappointed with Algernon , There is also an amusing cameo by Rowan Atkinson as a grumpy British diplomat. Although Connery may not have been as good as he was in some of his previous films, making the change to the familiar theme one of the most memorable ones. 7/10 <br /> <br /> A stupid. Rowan Atkinson's character indicates that he is from the British embassy in Nassau. However, since the Bahamas are a Commonwealth country, Britain would have a High Commission, no embassy, ​​in its capital.
