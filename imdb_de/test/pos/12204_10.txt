This is the first sci-fi series I have been seriously addicted to since Star Trek (and I have not seen Trek in years). The invasive motif takes a slightly different direction, but has done so in a very exciting way. It also lends itself to the soap opera format, where it continues the arc throughout the year of the series. The CGI definitely can not overcome the plot or the characters, except Nim, the young creature that is a pet with a certain attitude. (Anything that would show what he really thought about the neighbor's yippy dog ​​is in my book A-1.) He was a stroke of genius. <br /> <br /> I stayed behind at the end of the final, asking questions (smart questions, I hope) and keeping my fingers crossed that NBC or someone else (Sci Fi, maybe) will keep the series running. Answer This question. <br /> <br /> A really great show.
