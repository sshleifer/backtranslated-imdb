Bergman's sketches are one of the most realistic depictions of the war ever made. This is by no means an action movie, though the tempo is faster and most of the action is seen in most of the other Bergman films. Unlike most war films, this is not a romanticization of war or patriotism. In fact, the robust realism and the deliberate ambiguity of the figure's loyalty is very timely. Skammen is a darkly lit film that should be observed at night to make it magical. Many of the effects are conveyed indirectly, but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity with a contemporary, insanely large budget movie like Saving Private Ryan. Of course, the action in Skammen is much smaller, but still impressive. <br /> <br /> While the style of the film feels contemporary, the film feels timeless and serene. The war-torn landscape and even the still intact provincial village could be anywhere, anytime. And this film is not so much about specific historical events, with specific names and dates, but about universal human responses to adversity and chaos. <br /> <br /> The drama in Skammen, though typical of Ullman and Sydow, is not of prime importance in contrast to most of the other Bergman films in this film. Through much of the film they are onlookers as we are. Bergman has imposed the war, and through it the public, and their reaction may be what could be one of our reactions. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10/10
