"In The Line Of Fire" tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a former government killer who became a psycho. The intelligence agent / bodyguard (Eastwood) is in the defense and the killer (Malkovich) is on the offensive. The stakes? The president is live. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie ... I've seen it on TV many times and recently bought it on DVD. It is not an excellent movie though. The plot is far too thin and the attempts to thicken it are downright ridiculous. The whole love story is not very plausible, and the way they add an extra character to the story just to kill it is a kind of insult to the more or less intelligent viewer. Although I believe that these mistakes can not be forgiven, I can easily see Mr. Malkovich's exquisite performance. I've always considered him a great actor, but in this movie he's really on fire. There is a reason why he received an Oscar nomination. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were okay, but I do not think their performance is memorable. They are never the best of their abilities. <br /> <br /> If you do not expect too much, you'll love this movie. It's not a masterpiece, but John Malkovich is really extraordinary and I do not think anyone can enjoy his performance. Really worth the clock ...
