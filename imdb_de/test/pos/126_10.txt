INCLUDE "SPOILER" INFORMATION. At some point watch the other film by this director "Earth". It's a better movie, but it's not bad, just different. <br /> <br /> A rare feminist view of an Indian filmmaker. Tradition, rituals, duty, secrets and the representation of strict gender roles make this an engaging and culturally dynamic film experience. All married characters lack the "fire" of the marriage bed with their respective spouses. A husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual "adultery" by giving all his love, honor, time and respect to his religious swami (guru). His wife is lonely and longs for intimacy and tenderness, which she finally finds with her closed lesbian sister-in-law, who lives with her unfaithful husband in her house. This unfaithful husband is openly in love with his Chinese lover, but was forced to marry a lesbian (unknown to him). They only have sex once when their lesbian wife loses her virginity. <br /> <br /> A servant lives in the house and finally reveals the secret that the two women are lovers. Another significant character is the elderly matriarch, who is unable to speak or care for herself due to a stroke. However, she uses a bell to communicate her needs and the displeasure of family members. She lets her know by her bell or by fist-beating that she knows exactly what's going on in the house and how much she rejects her. In the end, the truth comes out about each and the two women lovers run away together. But not before there is an emotional scene between the swami-addicted husband and his formerly slick wife. Her sari burns and we first believe that she will die. However, we see the two women united in the last scene of the film. The author / director of this film challenges the traditions of their culture, but it shows us individuals who are trapped by their culture and gender. We really care about the characters and do not look at them as stereotypes. Everyone surprises us with their humanity, vulgarity, tenderness, anger and their spirit.
