Cuba Gooding Jr. is back at the top! Jesus, he did a great job in this movie! I loved this movie. It's one of those films that feels good and makes you want to do a mission or something. Anyway, I would recommend watching this movie in no time! Worth the entrance fee. As for Cuba Gooding Jr., give him his next Oscar !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
