I love this movie so much. It always makes me cry. If you value Drew Barrymore half as much as I do, you'll love this movie. It has all the essentials that I'm looking for in a movie. It has good actors, good characters, good mood ... and many heartwarming moments. The flashbacks when we see Josie in high school make me cry. Every time. I'm sure you'll like this movie, do not judge by the fact that it looks like a teenage movie, even though it's kind of a teenage movie. If you're a guy and only see hardcore special effects that can only be seen in the 250 best movies of all time, then this is not for you. But if you like romantic comedies, you will not forget them, pick them up in a video library and enjoy: Drew Barrymore is great at this!
