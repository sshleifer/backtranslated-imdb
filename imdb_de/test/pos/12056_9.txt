I generally love SRK as a villain (how can you not?) And I think SRK and Juhi fit together perfectly on the canvas as they are both more than pretty. <br /> <br /> This movie is great See, though it has some big drawbacks: <br /> <br /> 1) The Good (Sunny) - not only is he much less attractive than Shahrukh (which is mine) His role is lacking in character - it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities, instead we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier. <br /> <br /> 2) Kiran and Sunil's reactions to Rahul's behavior are incredibly stupid and naive even for a Bollywood production. <br /> <br /> But all that is not so important compared to the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere , great songs (really really great) and (let's say) Shahrukh as a villain, I just love him when he's so pagal <br /> <br /> A Must (along with Anjaam, Baazigar and Duplicate)
