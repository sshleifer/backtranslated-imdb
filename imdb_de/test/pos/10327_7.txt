This movie was roasted by the guys at MST3K, but it's actually a neat and uncomfortable piece of low-budget movie Noir. The plot is tight, the characters are believable (within the genre of good-boy-gets-with-bad-girl-obsessed), the tempo is solid, the climax is well controlled and the cast is supported by several good character actors. Most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a rock, but he's pretty scary playing the mastermind. The scenes between him and his father are very powerful in a minimalistic way. Sure, it's depressing, but that's the point. Good movie.
