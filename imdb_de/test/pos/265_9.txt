A vg brit rom-com, one you should look out for when you get a copy in your hands. Quirky and often surprising, this is not Brady's best movie (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), though he has a unique charm. The story is well written, there are some dead ends, but mostly with a new plot. They know from the beginning how it will end, but when it comes, it is honest and very open, a realistic and believable ending. The end seemed to be a start, pleasing and made me want more.
