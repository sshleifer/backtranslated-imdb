The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime that impressed me a lot. Partially for the characters, many of whom fall into anime fantasy / science fiction stereotypes, but placing those stereotypes in the more secular environment of high school is a twist I appreciated. Then there's the slightly crazy title character, which is something else: a headstrong, almost immoral girl with ridiculous talents and a secret she does not know. <br /> <br /> The set-up for the series is a bit of a thought journey. Essentially, Suzumiya, who is unaware of herself, is a kind of overpowering being capable of divine creation and destruction, as she can destroy reality and rebuild it at will. Our narrator and protagonist is Kyon, a high school girl whose sympathy / curiosity for Haruhi apparently forces her to move him against his will to a club she is bringing to her life because she is bored with normal life. In search of adventures, she claims to have three other uncommon members with secrets, all drawn into their crazy plans. <br /> <br /> There are already some crazy but enjoyable philosophical reflections as we debate whether the world is just a creation of Haruhi, as she's bored of the old one and if our characters exist to her to serve or to serve, to continue to exist, or to exist without them. It's a bit of a puzzle, but still a nice one. While sci-fi / fantasy scenarios occasionally occur in the series, I think the joy of the series lies in how normal things are, while it is still exciting to know that Haruhi could hopefully destroy the world When things are boring to make things more interesting. <br /> <br /> The art is clean and corresponds to what I expected from an anime usually imported to the US. I like the character designs and although there is not much action in the series, I think it looks better. The series is told from the mind of Kyon and he does not play an omniscient narrator, just commenting on what he knows and what he feels. He has a lot in mind, but he does not speak much, so it's good that we hear that. <br /> <br /> The voice acting in English dub is acceptable, but I prefer the Japanese to do it. There are some foreign aspects of the series, some of which are both parodies and fanboyism, which I found amusing. For the first season, I have to admit that there is a lack of closure, because the series does not really have a bigger story arc, but things seem to take it one by one. So it's a simple series that you can pick up and drop off, though I think it's still pretty hard to beat down because of its more entertaining qualities. It is also based on a series of light novels and the author was directly involved in writing the series. <br /> <br /> Although based on the novels, I still wish the Over series had stronger story arcs. but I love how naturally we can observe the evolution of these characters and how well the series can play both quiet and crazy moments. Seeing Haruhi grow by himself was quite a treat, watching the relationships between the SOS brigade (Haruhis Club) develop. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone because of its dazzling premise and "extraordinary beings" in a worldly world. "Fanboys interested in action / science fiction / fantasy are likely to be unsatisfied and for the rather relational drama lovers a bit too outlandish, but for those who want to try something different, or something like that weirdly curious series like this one, I think the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a rather refreshingly unique and enjoyable series. "More Please, 9/10.
