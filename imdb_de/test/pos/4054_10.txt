I saw this movie on PBS for the first time. Then I bought the video and saw it countless times. Every time I see it, I can get something different. It is a real proof that we want to stick to a good life, but now the world is changing. But you do not have to be older to stick to the past, even the young characters like Charlotte do not want things to change. The overall sound and mood are excellent. The cast is stellar with stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy. And it's fun to see the rising stars before they see more recognizable feature films like Kevin J. O'Connor (The Mummy) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black and Law & Order: Criminal Intent - one of my favorite shows). , It's just one of those movies that stays with you.
