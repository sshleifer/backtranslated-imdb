This was a thought-provoking and well-shot and staged television movie that captured a large theme with precision and intelligence, giving it a movie treatment that would look good on a larger screen - the range is somewhat subdued for television. If you are looking for a war movie or "Bosnia lite", this is not for you - it's about an ordinary woman who has taken on an extraordinary challenge to humanity. If you want to know more about the conflict and how a woman's work has massively influenced the world, watch this movie. I do not see that many other television films have dealt with the subject of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. The story avoids an obvious demonization of the "bad guys" and instead shows the denial and the daily hatred that has led to the deaths of thousands. I was moved in several places and not in any manipulative Hollywood way with driving music and eye-popping stagings, but was allowed to discover the horror and implications of the characters. This is a movie that is brave enough to let the content speak for itself, and keeps the imagery too low to gracefully support it. The actors do a hell of a job to bring the intense dramatic scenes to life. The scenes in which the victims testify before the court-martial are powerful, and Wendy Crewson, Stipe Erceg and Heino Ferch are excellent. The British accent of William Hurt is terrible - no one gave him the chance to play a Briton, and when he finally has it, he beats it! - and although John Corbett's body was born to play a soldier / commando, he is a little too stingy, though he does a good job.
