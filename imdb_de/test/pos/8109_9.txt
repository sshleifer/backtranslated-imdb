This film was shot when Hitler (and also Mussolini, who is also in the film) was at the top and many politicians and even the Roman church closed their eyes to the brutality and evil of National Socialism. Especially in the US, there were many people who did not understand what was really going on in Germany and Europe (Charles Lindenbergh, for example). It would be like a great actor parodying Berlusconi or Chirac. Chaplin may have made many mistakes in his life, but this is truly a masterpiece of humanity and I think he was a brave man. The film is funny and deep, the closing speech has a terrible strength and is still being updated. I think this movie is one of the best ever made.
