In the middle of the hole, I emailed a friend to summarize it. I was not sure if the movie would fall into a series of submissive gestures. I felt it was a little uncomfortable, but I saw the end. It's perfect. I've been living in Korea for 6 months, and this movie might as well summarize the weird boredom and frustration of an Asian metropolis as Taiwin here. It uses the myth of Hong Kong musicals in the same way that Godard or Hartley use western musicals, but it goes to extremes, it's a gloomy world and occasionally the Kafka Esquire logic gets even better. I really feel like The Holes closest comparison is Hal Hartley's Surviving Desire, but I have a somewhat bleak advantage for the ultimately hopefully weird metaphorical movies. Anyway, I wrote this to Esther. I hope you like The Hole too. <br /> <br /> Hey, <br /> <br /> watched a move called the hole. I think Taiwanese seems to be a bit weird for China, unless it's Hong Kong. it is worth seeing until now. It's about a man and a girl in an apartment complex. The guy's blanket breaks and the girl starts to get angry, and it's kind of a weird metaphor for the simultaneous pleasure, demixing and pain of a pretty fierce raving. There's also some kind of zombie virus subplot and lots of weird little scenes where the girl makes her wishes in innocent and somehow funny 50s doo-wop sequences. Worth a look.
