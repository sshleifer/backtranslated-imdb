This timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be outdated. I can not even count how many times I saw Dirty Dancing. This is a movie that I probably watch every few weeks and still love. <br /> <br /> This movie has something timeless. I loved other "blockbuster love movies" like Pretty Woman, and when Harry met Sally. I think they are up there, but there is something about Dirty Dancing that makes it absolutely perfect. The characters, the chemistry between Swaze and Gray, the direction of the movie, the AMAZING dancing, the warm summer atmosphere, everything about Dirty Dance is absolutely perfect. It's an instant classic and I've never seen a movie like this before. <br /> <br /> I do not think there's a specific element that makes this movie so popular, but many other things. Many are mentioned by many reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, boring, summery vibe, realistic characters, a relatively honest message associated with incredible music and dance, and one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us. <br /> <br /> This movie is always on TV and I will keep watching it as long as it is shown. But I will mention that I have no interest in seeing "Havana Nights" that they should have left alone.
