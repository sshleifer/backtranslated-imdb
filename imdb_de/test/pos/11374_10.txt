Boogie Nights follows a theme that is very familiar to gangster films (though it does not fit into this genre) - the rise and fall. We see the rise of several individuals, some of which are completely unrecognizable, reach great heights ... and then fall from grace due to their excesses. I think this is the writer's first post / director Paul Thomas Anderson, and it's a great start! I have seen elements of influences from other directors like Robert Altman, but the film asserts itself in the originality and development of actions. Character development is the best thing about the movie. I really identified with all the characters and felt their pain and their success with them. All performances were brilliant. (It was especially nice to see a small part of the real porn veteran Nina Hartley). <br /> <br /> Basically, this film combines comedy and tragedy resulting in one of the best movies of 1997 being stupid at the Oscars (probably because of the "racy" - as they would say -) theme and general conservatism of the Academy.
