I understand that "Checking Out" will probably be released on cinemas in the US in June 2006 and on DVD in November 2006. My recommendation is, "Checking Out" not to be missed !! This comedy movie will entertain anyone who relates to the characters, family relationships, and diverse social issues. "Checking Out" will make you laugh with a quick fire. Weak humor is built into almost every line, and you can also cry in a touchingly positive way. <br /> <br /> The topic of suicide is treated in a funny way so that people who think about it can understand the implications of this action on those who have touched their lives and those who love them. Let's hope that "Checking Out" can have a positive impact and prevent suicidal people from being considered, especially in the 16- to 25-year-olds, who have the highest suicide rate in the US. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully written, perfectly cast and chronologically loaded with synchronicity and meaningful flashbacks, the meaning of which is becoming clearer throughout the film and especially at the end. I believe the script earns an Oscar nomination for "Best Screenplay, Play to a Movie" (the Phoenix Film Festival honors "Checking Out" with a "Best Screenplay Award"). <br /> <br /> The cast is packed with great, self-driving actors with a long track record of great performances, drama nominations and victories. I feel that Peter Falk's performance in "Checking Out" deserves an Oscar nomination and is the most challenging and comprehensive of his career. Laura San Giacomo's performance and chemistry with Peter Falk as her father is masterful and has been honored with a "Best Actress Award" at the Palm Beach International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Even the youthful characters in the film shine and are hailed by young actors Dan Byrd (Films: A Cinderalla Story with Hilary Duff, 3 Young Artist Award nominations, Won 1) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (TV : Monster Island, Wolf Lake, Passions, touched by an angel, 2 young star) nominations). <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare and producer Mark Lane wonderfully develop the characters, their interactions, and the storyline of this fun, entertaining yet intricate script. <br /> <br /> Filmmaking keeps the movie moving quickly and slows down in the moving scenes so that the audience never loses interest from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie that you can take with you to see the whole family and everyone will enjoy it.
