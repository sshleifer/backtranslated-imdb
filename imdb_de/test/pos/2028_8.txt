WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I've ever seen. The original idea of ​​the script focuses on a young singer of the 80s, who directs a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the time. He not only plays her music to the touch, but also lives the life of his idols. When his friends in the tribute band identify him in search of some originality, fate takes a good turn and is set to replace the lead singer of the idols band. A dream came true? Almost. As he began living the life of the famous man, including the drug and sexual excesses of the 1980s rock scene, he will also have to face the problems of relationship with his supportive girlfriend and eventually have to answer questions about creativity and questions With a saying in the music of the band. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, one of the reasons was that it's one of the first times that the life and music of hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic way. Fans of the music genre will love the soundtrack. The overall idea is original and the questions of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are presented in a meaningful and balanced way. Acting is pretty good, with Mark Wahlberg better than most of the other actionflics I've seen lately, and Jennifer Aniston in line with the role of the cute girl who knows a lot about life. More problematic is the end, which is quite conventional and may disappoint. It seems that the main character has found her own creative path after leaving the big and famous band. In an ironic twist, the music he plays in the club at the end is the worst in the entire movie! <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale. Worth seeing - but expect a high metal dose. If you do not like this kind of music, you can avoid this movie.
