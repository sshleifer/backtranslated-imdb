What do we do now? that's the overriding question of this movie. And do not make a mistake, "mainly ETC," 2003's use by director John Jansen, poses far more questions than it answers, but not as poignant or as powerful as these. <br /> <br /> Film is like a fluent conversation between you and your college drinkers, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters will be recognized in your own evenings of drunken debauchery. One of the many beauties of this film, however, is that we rarely receive an answer. Questions are asked? everything from the profane to the profound ?? But jansen skillfully forces its audience to examine and answer these questions themselves, with little or no help from the characters. Page 1 opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully orchestrated arrangement of nonlinear segments to introduce us to the main characters. We meet her on the morning of April 8, 1994? The day Kurt Cobain committed suicide. And it's the death of Cobain and the trip to Seattle, two days later, as the backdrop for the movie. In exploring Cobain's life, music and death, the characters attempt to understand and process their own lives, with varying degrees of success. There are some aspects of the movie you might like You might expect from a low-budget indie movie: The performances range from decidedly mediocre to excellent, with the strongest performances coming from Jessica Scott (Holly) and Noel Wood (Daniel). While some of the dialogues are somewhat stiff, they never completely go to the unreal; and there are some minor sound problems, especially when we're on the go, which makes it difficult to track the action on screen sometimes. <br /> <br /> But despite its shortcomings "mainly ETC". is a solid, deeply affecting piece of cinema. jansen interweaves all current threads and captivates her own struggles, illuminating her own struggles while making them accessible and captivating. and because we can see reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters, we can identify with the issues and problems they are struggling with, and we can look back and remember where we were that day in 1994 Many people in the world have changed. <br /> <br /> while jansen writes, edits and recognizes the direction of the film, kudos must also be given to his photography. With an eerie eye and the amazing ability to get caught up in and dragged into the character's worlds, jansen managed to produce one shot at a time, sticking with me long after the credits. <br /> <br /> And no review This movie would be complete without a nod to the amazing soundtrack. The music in this movie is used to amazing effects. sometimes they subtly emphasize the action, sometimes they are the center of attention, but never disturb in kitschy music videos. The soundtrack sounds like the ultimate biggest hits, though I suspect that the label probably would not work well with the director. <br /> <br /> The new Double DVD Archivedition features some deleted scenes, trailers, music videos and a Cobain documentary. The deleted scenes give an insight into the making of the film through alternative opening and closing sequences, and it's certainly a pleasure to have the rare and beautiful Raining Kind video. the cobain documentary is fine, albeit a bit worse off, and certainly there are more documentary films available for hardcore fans. Remarkably absent is a commentary from the director, and I wonder if Jansen plans to re-release this at some point with the yummy treat. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say next time 'If you are looking for a strong work by a talented filmmaker, I recommend you come aboard.
