OK, the other reviewers have dealt with the main points of this great little gem quite extensively, d. H. The story began as a life for Buster Keaton's mute classic "7 Chances." To act comedy or so much in a genre is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has previously written and performed, unless this is a completely original creation. Here's The Stooges, which basically writes material written and performed by someone else, and for a small budget and a short amount of time in a movie, they can handle things well. Regardless of what the credits in their films say, real "Stooge-Philes" know that they had a lot of influence on lines and direction. They took their work just as seriously as a surgeon did a vital operation. Words from Emil Sitka during a documentary about the boys. What appears as their usual anarchy about something as simple as marrying is actually organized chaos. Each line is perfectly matched with a corresponding physical action. How many comedians are there today who can claim such a championship? Most obviously the Seinfeld crew, but no one else I've seen in the last 35 years of television. The critics will be The Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others always "pooh pooh", but then again ... who remembers the names of the critics or what they said? Just watch, laugh and enjoy!
