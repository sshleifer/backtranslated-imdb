What are the films? I mean ... what are films made for? Shootings? Killings? NO. They are made for life stories and that's what this movie does. It shows how life has changed between two ages. The father and a son, the father needs work and asks the son for help. <br /> <br /> Although there is another generation, there are some characteristics that involve the caress of the family. <br /> The main theme in my opinion is the love of the son for the father and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The film is ONLY a dialogue, but this dialogue is more than I could ever want. This movie is a pure art! After "Marfa si Banii" Cristi Puiu again delivers us a beautiful film. Well done !
