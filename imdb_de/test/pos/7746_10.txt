I absolutely fell in love with "Living in a Big Way" when I saw it for the first time! Reason # 1 is because I LOVE, LOVE and am a GIANT fan of GENE KELLY. He was such a wonderful dancer, actor and choreographer. Not to mention his extremely beautiful appearance and sensual personality. I love his role in this movie. He was such a gentleman. This film showed his wonderful talent for acting. I also enjoyed Marie MacDonald. It was the first time I saw or knew anything about her, and this excellent movie also made me a fan of her. Actually, the whole cast in this movie was enjoyable and great. The humor between the butler "Everette Hanover Smythe" and the father, Mr. Morgan; Mrs. Morgan's courtroom and especially Granny Morgan's immediate attachment and concern for "LEO GOGARTY". And GENES number "FIDO AND ME" is adorable. The opening dance number with GENE and MARIE is also very nice. I would recommend anyone to watch this movie. It will really love your heart forever. Or at least it has to be mine. And you will fall in love with GENE again. I rate it as my 2nd GENE KELLY MOVIE, and I've seen and own many of his films. They are part of my everyday life! So trust me when I tell you, you will love this movie! Look at it and enjoy it !!
