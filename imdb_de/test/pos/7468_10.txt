This movie is outstanding! On this date, April 8, 2007, it was on call from the showtime. It has been a while since I saw it, but Thomas Jane is seen in the first role I saw him in. First, you see a normal man, who seems to be crazy, with a woman who almost goes her own way. The directorial cut I've just seen has an opening scene that's cool. Paulina Porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader and looks very fresh and hot. Attempting to buy coffee late at night without bills turns violent in a hurry. Paulina shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal. He first met his old buddy Nick, played by Aaron Eckhart, and even loaned his wife's car to take care of something. Then he discovers silver briefcases and the day changes for the weird and violent one. There are a number of real characters going through the next scenes. But Paulinas Dallas steals the show, I think. It's outrageous that she tells the doctor a Casey story that gets a personal interview in an adoption request. In general, I never thought that tall women are so sexy, but as with any rule, there are exceptions. Paulina is like you have never seen in movies. Sexy and deadly as in the one movie with Tom Selleck, but with a malevolence never seen before. If you're looking for a movie to add to your collection, it's worth the price. Paulina is naked, the price alone, but this story has everything you can hope for. Love, friendship, sex and violence in a grandiose mix. When I saw it for the first time years ago, it blew me away, and I know you will feel the same way.
