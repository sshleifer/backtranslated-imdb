Knute Rockne had an extraordinary life and his story is told pretty well in Knute Rockne All American. We follow Rockne's incredible journey from a Norwegian boy to the legendary American football legend. The film was produced in 1940 and sometimes looks a bit dated and sometimes downright hokey. And the filmmakers sometimes put it a bit thick, while Rockne is shown glowing and loving. Maybe you think Rockne should have been nominated, even though he was just a football coach. However, there is no denying that he had a great influence on the football game and has also greatly influenced the lives of so many young men he trained. This film shows the great influence he has had and gives you an insight into why he is so revered to this day. <br /> <br /> Pat O'Brien plays Rockne and delivers an impressive performance. It is without question O'Brien's film to wear and he makes the film and the character to his own. The real Rockne was known as a great inspirational character, and O'Brien's performance will make you understand why. The only point of criticism comes early in the film when O'Brien, in his early forties, plays college student Rockne in his early twenties. The whole make-up of the world would not make that believable and the effect is pretty staggering. But as the Rockne character gets old and begins his legendary coaching career, O'Brien fits in perfectly. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, a name jumps out and that, of course, is Ronald Reagan, charismatic, but ultimately doomed to fail, football star George Gipp. It's not really a big deal in the big scheme of the movie, and Reagan does not appear for more than 10-15 minutes. The performance, however, became legendary thanks to Reagan's famous deathbed speech "Win One for the Gipper". It's a brilliant scene full of emotions. Reagan has not been on the screen for very long in this film, but he certainly has a tremendously positive impact on the winning performance. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film balances football and life in general Rockne had great lessons for his young men in both areas. For football fans (and history buffs) there is a rare pleasure, as the actual archive footage of Notre Dame games of the Rockne era is interspersed throughout the movie. It's a rare opportunity to see how much the game has evolved over the last six decades, and an opportunity to put Rockne's legendary strategic innovations into practice. If you're a fan of Notre Dame, you'll probably enjoy the fact that the Notre Dame Victory March offers a seemingly constant soundtrack for the movie. If you're a Notre Dame hater ... well, then you probably will not watch this movie anyway. Knute Rockne All American is an inspiring, uplifting, emotional movie. Maybe a bit too sentimental, but that's not so bad. It is a very enjoyable movie that is worth taking the time to do.
