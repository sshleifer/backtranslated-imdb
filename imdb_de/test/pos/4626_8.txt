2:37 manages to show admirably what Australian teenagers feel and do not say. These are the stories of real children and I think we would be naive if we think differently. The only new thing that brings 2:37 is from the Australian point of view. We often watch troubled American children, but we can not associate the same issues with our own teenagers. Performed with clever and artful cinematography, I found (after recognizing the disappointing final song) the musical direction unclear. I welcome the great casting of this movie. These are regular-looking Aussie kids, who for that reason invite a lot of sympathy. Great performances and you can not beat Gary Sweet. This movie made me remind myself why sometimes high school crap and if you're not prissy or if you want to go with warm and fuzzies, go to 2:37.
