It's a movie with a theatrical message fused with some smart moments. Movies like these are the reasons for great actors. They like to throw the ball into open pieces like these. The angel, who was not seen in old books and churches, is a nice change. It can be heard in Kevin Smith's piece Dogma almost in the same slapstick vein. <br /> <br /> - = 0) Watch this movie for a good day after sucking in everything. Could it be that there are so many films trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of such films? Perhaps one of the funniest pieces I've seen in a long time, I found VHS in a trash can because somebody's basement was flooded this summer, and I got a handful of cassettes. <br /> <br /> Whether in a trash can or on the screen, mild comedies are fun, you just do not have to tell everyone in a trendy nightclub that you like it or a fancy political party. Just keep it to yourself, and I'll bet many people will borrow it from time to time.
