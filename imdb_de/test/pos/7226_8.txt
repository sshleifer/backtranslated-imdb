Who else but Troma can take the classic tragedy and change it to today's standards? Nobody .... in my opinion the Leonardo DiCaprio sucked one. Tromeon & Juliet is a definitive section of the original Shakespearean tragedy, but it behaves well. It's sick, dement, twisted, but still funny and fulfilling. Mostly it follows the true story of Romeo and Juliet, but many Troma elements are added. Will Keenan gives a great performance as Tromeo. The drama is solid and the story is great. Many people are watching these films, not just the Kaufman Troma movies, but all those who drive them. Safe Troma movies are an acquired taste, but you have to see some of them. It's Renegade filmmaking at its best.
