This must have been one of Chaplin's most ambitious projects; He throws in virtually everything, from visual gags and comedy sketches to social relevance, romance and even violence. The mix is ​​challenging and intriguing, and the movie has many entertaining and clever sequences (like the one in which Chaplin and four other guys try to find a coin that commits their self-sacrifice), but the ingredients do not always work together and blend (and the sound) seem somehow disharmonic. As for the famous closing speech, it is, although undeniably honest, a bit naïve even today, with allusions to "a better world in which man will overcome his hatred and brutality and fly his soul." Great performances by Jack Oakie and the beautiful Paulette Goddard. (***)
