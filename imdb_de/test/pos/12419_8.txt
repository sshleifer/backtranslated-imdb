I got that in the context of a competition price. I looked at it and did not really expect much from obviously low budget production. I laughed sick! There are obvious references to other movies from the horror genre - Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Friday, 13th, and so on. All the standard clich√©s were there - long drive through partially dry and somehow threatening landscapes, red inhaler breeders, mysterious vehicles. Track - drop some really good, humorous scenes (gasoline from the motorhome) and dialogue ("F ***** g virgin? That must be an oxymoron ..") and you have one of the best parody horror movies in years, especially good I liked How our reluctant hero took advantage of his stress-related nosebleed.
