When I started seeing 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel, I have to say that I saw on all shows that ADV was released. This is one of the best shows ever. I had to see it again, and then I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th birthday. I could enjoy it and see more of the episodes I've missed on Action Channel, and the same three episodes I've seen. My favorite characters in this show are: Sylvia, Leon and Nigel. The animation in this series was the best and the hard suits were cool too. But the show also has a great voice like: Chris Patton, Jason Douglas, Christine Auten and Hillary Haag and more. If you like this show on Action Channel, you need to own it on DVD. It's the best, and you'll see what I mean.
