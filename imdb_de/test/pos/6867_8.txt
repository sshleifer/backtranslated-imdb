I was very curious about anatomy (aka anatomy) and if I saw it, I had to buy it, because in my environment no video store wore the film. Since this is not a cheap DVD, I took a chance and thought I would take a look at other comments on IMDb. Many of the comments did not leave me hoping enough to spend a lot of money on a movie I've never seen before, or to have any clues. Basically, I came up with the idea that this is a sexy, youthful jerk that is compared to many youthful thrillers. Well, something in the back of my head told me to ignore and buy such comments! I was and was pleasantly surprised! <br /> <br /> If I compare it to other movies, I would say it's a variation of Coma and Extreme Measures. I could not compare to movies like Scream, Urban Legends and others. Yes, the cast is young (that's because they're medical doctors, at least it's not the increasingly boring high school characters), and yes, some are relish (basically, the character Anna Loos plays and it gets done ) but Anatomy is well constructed, the mood is tight, the sets are amazing, the make-up effects are a wow and Franka Potente is very believable in her role. Despite some gaping holes in the plot, I enjoyed everything! The story of a student who discovers some kind of secret society doing autopsies on living patients is a scary scenario, and what happens to those patients afterwards is pretty clever. Sure, you might ask why she did not just come out of this city. Okay, but then the movie would be over within half an hour. <br /> <br /> This was the first effort of the German part of Columbia Pictures, and it's actually a pretty impressive one. There was a bit of care in production, and actually offering some real thrills is a feat. It is a bit mature in mind as it does not involve constant opportunities for sexual encounters (a breastfest) or juvenile drug jokes. Although Anna Loos's character often made sexual remarks and sought some fun, it was a nice touch - with a character who was a woman who was smarter than all the other men in the classroom. She found that sex was really just a distraction for her and not enough for men. <br /> <br /> THE IMPORTANT STUFF: If you watch this movie in English with English or French subtitles, you can enjoy it best. I saw the movie trailers in English dubbed and disgusted about the change in the sound of the movie. I have never seen a properly dubbed film in my life - they never find voices that match the actors or characters of the movie. Of course, I tried to see some of the English Anatomy movies whose intelligence level has dropped a lot, making them seem more like a comedy. A good example is when a guy was freaked out because he was cut open and screamed to be sewn back together. When he heard that in German, he sounded desperate, but dubbed in English, he sounded like a comedian. Honestly, I'm tired of hearing that people say they can not read subtitles or see a "letterbox" movie. The anatomy looks stupid, with voices spoken that are too high for anyone you see in the movie, and the sexual comments of Anna Loos sound like terrible expressions straight out of the Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I wonder if the negative comments on Anatomy came from people who saw it synchronized, it just does not seem to be the same movie! This is not a cheap horror movie and deserves to be seen as it was created. Interestingly, some of the English subtitles are different in scenes in the feature and in the "making of" episode. <br /> <br /> As it turns out, I played and won with Anatomy. It is a competent thriller with sympathetic characters and does not try to look for cheap thrills.
