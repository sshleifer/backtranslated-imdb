Enchanted by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that traces the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island, New York at the turn of the century. It's a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately profoundly rewarding experience. The latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro), interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with rough realism, is like an impressionistic painting - a film artist depicting the effects of the immigration process on our parents and grandparents. Crialese's "magical, mysterious itinerary" emerged as a result of his visit to the museum on Ellis Island, the faces of the immigrants shown in the photographs, and his research on the rigorous policies and procedures that were used in the admission of Panda immigrants. Guided by letters reading that immigrants were sent to relatives who stayed at home, Crialese identifies with the impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things outside their agony. For Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his older son Angelo (Francesco Casisa), America is a distant dream about which they know nothing. After climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the Saints for a sign, they are rewarded when they are shown by Salvatores younger son, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo), a deaf and dumb dumbbell who portrays the New World as a land in which you can swim In rivers with milk you sit under a money tree or harvest huge onions and carrots. Salvatore, his two sons, and his older mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) set out on the adventure with more hope than fear, after moving their animals in exchange for shoes and suits, but the equation soon shifts the other way , When they board the ship and settle in their overcrowded third-class tax compartments, the most talked-about scene takes place in the movie. With an overhead camera that shows crowds of people as the ship drives away, the frame in which aboard the ship and in those who bid farewell to the dock, and the way they are separated, implies that they are be demolished by all confidants. <br /> On board the ship is a mysterious Englishwoman named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Crialese does not reveal her past or the reason she travels to America, but she does seem to stand for the beginning of the modern world they are entering. Carefully, Lucy eyes Salvatore and asks him to marry her so she can enter the country. The journey is treacherous with a violent storm that bombards the ship. Shot dead in almost complete darkness, the passengers are thrown against the side wall in the steering, and afterwards the bodies lie on the ground like in a macabre dance of death. The passage through immigration processing in Ellis Island does not get any easier, and Crialese is attacking the way illiterates, in the name of preserving the "civilized" society, are forced to compile puzzles, perform mathematical tasks and undergo humiliating medical examinations, that they are "fit". <br /> <br /> A marriage agency looks like an auction block and the young women look discouraged when they are brought together with overweight middle-aged men. Only then can they enter the "Golden Door", since single women, if they have no partners, are rejected in order to prevent prostitution. Through the fog, immigrants can barely see the land of milk and honey, and there is no Statue of Liberty asking for tired and poor, the humiliated masses long for air. In their imagination, however, the river is still flowing, waiting for them to go inside. Although the end is not clear and a door to an empty wall opens, another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we all must take the old world to the new.
