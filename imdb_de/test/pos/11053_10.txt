Garbo's first spoken word in this 1930 film electrified the audience and became part of the Hollywood legend. Garbo had become a star in 1926 in her first American movie The Torrent. The audience waited for this movie to see if Garbo could make the transition to talkies. She did. And while Pola Negri, Vilma Banky and Renee Adoree fell by the wayside for their accents, Garbo sailed for another decade. Despite the staginess of this film, Garbo is truly outstanding, especially in the opening scene with the equally great Marie Dressler as Marthy. The two big stars exchange dirty looks and sharp words as they add some drinks and set the tone for the rest of the movie. Garbo was 25; Dressler was 60. Charles Bickford is fine as Matt and George F. Marion is good as Old Chris. Marion developed this role on Broadway in 1922 and also played it in the silent version of 1923 with Blanche Sweet. This game by Eugene O'Neill is a true classic, but strangely never filmed again. Anna Christie is one of Garbo's best performances. And despite the staginess of the movie and the cruelty of the story, it's really a miracle. See this for Garbo and Dressler!
