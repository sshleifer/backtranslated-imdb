I love this movie. The actors were all great at portraying their different characters. Judith Ivey has so well-portrayed a weak, anxious, dependent person who was passively aggressive in her plaintive and self-engaging character, that it was a relief to see the figure's metamorphosis. Blythe Danner was equally appealing in her role as a somewhat prejudiced Jewish mother, devoted wife and loving sister. Jonathon Silmerman, Bob Dishy, ​​Stacey Glick and Lisa Walz have done their roles equally well. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies that go through difficult times without losing your sense of humor and hope, you will love this movie.
