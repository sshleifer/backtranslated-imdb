I do not understand why people have not commented on that, except that maybe not many have seen it. It's an amazing group of characters, one after the other, all about the man who wrote the piece. If you do not like filmed pieces, you may not like it (after all, the games on TV do not usually look good), but it's a one-man show where you keep an eye out. Highly recommended.
