Entertaining movie that features romance, psychodrama for women, sexual harassment at work, adultery and fashion. It is all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual longtime employee who feels the need to be like that because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the ambitious entry-level employee who is determined to reach the top with her mind and not her body. Her personal life is the subplot. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe for the movie is great, but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairdresser that "a little fool will do it!" The amount of Brylcream in Stephen Boyd's hair sometimes distracts. His character's relationship with Long Character was never fully developed, which disappointed me. Overall, the film is pleasing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
