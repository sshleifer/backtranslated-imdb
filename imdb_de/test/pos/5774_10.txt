Hello, I was wondering if anyone has a copy of the movie Broken Promise? I loved this movie and watched it every time it ran. It's been years since I saw it and I'd like to get a copy of it. I checked the entire internet and could not find it. If someone has a copy to trade or sell, please email me at NoelGypsy@yahoo.com. Christine --------- The "broken promise" was made to eleven-year-old Melissa Michaelsen, whose parents left her and her siblings. Michaelsen was received by the county and had to watch helplessly as her brothers and sisters were divided into different families. One of the children is even institutionalized. Adolescent court official Chris Sarandon joins Michaelsen to unite her family under one roof. Broken Promise was originally offered as a "General Foods Golden Showcase" presentation. It was the first broadcast on 5 May 1981.
