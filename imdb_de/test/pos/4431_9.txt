Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly, what he was, is moving and emotional. <br /> <br /> This film shows the spirit of what architecture is all about, what good design is and what the emotional price it has to pay. Equally insistent is the soundtrack. If you watch the movie and then hear the soundtrack, you can easily recall the movie by listening. As an over 30-year-old architect, I had a heart and was excited about the film and its very straightforward, if emotional, honesty and sincerity. <br /> <br /> I had the honor of making this movie in Chicago at the National Convention of the American Institute of Architects. The movie was introduced by Daniel and he was kind enough to do a question and answer session afterwards. There was no sound during the entire presentation of the movie, no coughing, no distraction. The entire audience sat hypnotized, and the real treat was that Daniel's mother was present during the screening of the film. I will always remember the movie and constantly reenact it in my mind every time I listen to the soundtrack ...
