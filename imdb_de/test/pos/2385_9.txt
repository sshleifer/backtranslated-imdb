I am a talent manager. I have been here for 15 years now. I discovered a wonderful talent. They were in movies, Commericals, Braodway and television. In my opinion, Eddie Monroe was wonderfully busy. I love to see the ability of real people. Not just a name. The actors in this movie were very natural and believable. I was very excited about this movie. I love a movie with a few twists. I'm also happy when the puzzle is solved at the end of the film. I would still like to know what happened to the big sum of money. I want to see this movie on the big screen. The material was really well received. The landscape of New York was the New York that I know. I wish you a happy 2006 and may this film make it to the awards.
