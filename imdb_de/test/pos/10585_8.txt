While some things in Haggard are stupid and unnecessary, the overall package is good. <br /> <br /> Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) in an attempt to reclaim Glauren (Jenn Rivell), Ryan's ex. <br /> <br /> The story is surprisingly well tracked and developed, she wonders, and becomes an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, though she has a side story that does not harm the main story. <br /> <br /> And for all Bam fan boys (And Girls) there are several sequences of Bam skateboarding, perhaps the weakest aspect of the movie. Phil makes two surprisingly small appearances, even Don Vito got a bigger (but meaningless) role. <br /> <br /> If you're hoping to see a comedy and escape Bam's craziness, stay away from this movie or enjoy the time you spend finding it. There are some really funny scenes in this movie.
