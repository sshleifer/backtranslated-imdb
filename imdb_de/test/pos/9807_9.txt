You have it right! Bobby was Mike's imaginary friend throughout the movie, even at the beginning when he was traveling to California. His mother knew about Bobby and did not discourage Mike from leaning on Bobby, because imaginary friends are common in young children. That's why the boys were so close. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mike let Bobby go. The "king" was arrested. Mike could go on without Bobby. It was also why Mike's mother did not seem disturbed when Mike received the postcard from Bobby the Ol 'West and the other postcards from around the world. They noticed that Mike's mother had turned the first card and looked at the postmark. What a great mother who did the best she could in the late sixties. <br /> <br /> A 9 out of 10 points for me. Brought memories ...
