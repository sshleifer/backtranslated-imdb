Presumably, some high-profile film directors sat in the '80s at Cannes or another film festival in the' 80s and drank their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice. One said, "Hey guys, let's make a movie where each one of us creates a segment of a world-class aria." Well ... it somehow worked. Obviously, someone was smart enough to pick some of the best shots of the chosen arias, for example Nessun Dorma from Bjoreling. So if you were blind and lying on the floor and just watched the DVD, you have more than your money worth. Not every director has made it, but more than that, and the streak seems to improve with each viewing over the years. My favorite is the incredibly beautiful love duet of Die Todt Statd; okay, a young, naked Elizabeth Hurley is a feast for the eyes, but her husband sings you, the spirit of his wife, and is incredibly beautiful with the love music after Otello and Desdemona's "Gia nella Notte Densa" throughout the operatic repertoire. Could the strip be better, sure, which could not have been, but it's worth it especially if you're in a hyper-romantic mood.
