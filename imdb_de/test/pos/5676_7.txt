When I read the synopsis - three people lost in the wild when they were fighting a giant crocodile - I was not exactly drawn. It sounded like the typical horror formula of a yawning movie of a group of people being chased by a monster - except in this case there are only three of them, so we would not even get the macabre 'joy' when watching them singly be removed. <br /> <br /> I saw it (could not sleep, nothing else.)) and it turned out to be a lot better than expected. The acting is great, the atmosphere is tense and you really get the rare impression of a low budget winner. <br /> <br /> Horror, how it should be done. First-class film production. It's not perfect, but worth a visit. I give a 7.
