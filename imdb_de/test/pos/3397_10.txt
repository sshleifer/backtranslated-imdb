North and South (Books I & II) are for me the ultimate TV series of the 80s. To discover all these cameo performances was very entertaining. Gene Kelly, James Stewart, Elizabeth Taylor, Olivia De Havilland, Robert Mitchum and even Johny Cash. No series has come close to this success. Dick Smith's prosthetics made Hal Holbrock's powerful performance even stronger. The handcrafted costumes, the places where the lower jaw falls, everything. It's clear that there are excellent and bright TV shows these days (Desperate Housewives, Lost, 24), but North & South was and is one of its kind. Do not miss it. Only David Carradine's depiction of the ultimate villain (you can only call him a violent husband) is worth watching. Maybe some characters and situations are too stereotypical, I admit it, but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them. I am so glad that it is finally available on DVD in Spain.
