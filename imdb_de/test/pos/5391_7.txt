Dallas stars Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton and Raymond Massey. It is directed by Stuart Heisler, the photograph was taken by Ernest Haller and the duties of the pen fell on John Twist. Dallas is produced by Warner Brothers and shot alive in Technicolor from the ranches of Iverson & Warner, California. It's a movie whose tongue is stuck in the cheek. The film is a return to the Westerns of yesteryear that exist without pretensions or deep penetrating meanings. Hollister falsifies his own death to kill his reputation and free himself in Dallas for persecuting the brothers who have massacred his family. Essentially a routine plot, Twist's story is aroused by many fun and exciting distractions. There are role reversals, dandymodes, horseback, shootings, a love triangle, powerful dialogues, and skilful twists to keep the piece from painting numbers. <br /> which further enhances the feel-good factor. It's true, he's not really asked to do more than be a laconic guy on a mission. When called to action, he delivers the goods his fans expect in his successful career. In particular, the villains entertain Steve Cochran's vile and stupid Bryant Marlow, because everyone has their own little Peccadillos to protect them from the known impudence. The two ladies of the play look great and work well under the machismo, while the high production value allows Haller to treat the eyes with lush technicolor and use the camera near the places. <br /> <br /> has the ideals of being a list that Oater Dallas does, something that can not quite reach it. But it's not for lack of trying and the end result is one of the pure entertainment that should really be enjoyed on a cold winter's day when the spectator has to pick me up. 10.7
