This movie blew me away - I only saw two episodes of the series, never saw the first movie, but I got involved in a preview in which Johnny Knoxville himself screened the movie. He told us that we should turn off our moral judgment for a movie an hour and a half. ' He was right. For a movie, this would probably be a 2 because it has zero plot, no structure besides randomness and a very low production value. That is not the point. Everyone in our theater laughed and snapped all the way through - not just that some of the stunts were creative (look at the trailer, if you must know, but they hid some of the best (or worst, depending on how You want to look at them).), But some of what they did completely surprised us. These people are doing something that does not make it into their newspaper reports (and probably can not even be published here), with many things below the beltline. However, nearly three-quarters of the stunts are fantastically hysterical (though they should be morally condemned, but remember Knoxville's testimony), and if you're in the right setting, this movie is hysterical. Only about 20 minutes of this film could actually have been shown on television. So consider yourself a warning of what you're getting into - some things are disgusting, but instead of being rejected, you end up laughing at mere stupidity. As a person who thought Jackass was overheated on the TV show with just a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain, the fun I had in this movie made me realize that it was the best for them Environment is boundless to put boys to work. It's a lot of fun and should be a great comedy solution until the Borat movie comes out. With this movie, you may think you know what you're getting, but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - I guarantee you'll be surprised by the third sketch. So, enjoy it and do not worry: they hardly want to play at home.
