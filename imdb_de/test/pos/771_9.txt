I have the feeling that Rupert Grint promises a lot from this role in which everyone knows him. Although I had never heard of this movie before when it appeared on my cable television programs, I switched to that channel immediately. I am so happy that I did that! <br /> <br /> I read from other reviewers that they generally do not like age stories. I'm quite right. I am one of those who are getting older and older; I've been in my twelfth year, now 52 years old, and I'll probably continue until I'm 92 years old. Growing up is nothing more than suddenly recognizing the opportunities that another day brings. The suddenness of knowledge, the magnitude of it, sometimes causes us disorder. When we try to protect our sensitive self from it, I can see how adulthood can end. But if we just dust ourselves off and move in the new direction that we've discovered, then suddenly we're on a new path and as alive as yesterday, just stronger, brighter and I dare to be more interesting. <br /> <br /> That's what this movie was about. This was a story of the coming of age. Young Ben, his father, Father Robert and certainly Lady Evie ... all went through a wonderful transformation. Mr. Fincham too, right? I suspect everyone else has, except the mother, despite their tremendous opportunity, which was offered by the events at the end of the film. One has the feeling that she will continue on the same path she went on, only with a different cast. <br /> <br /> So an excellent movie that could be made impossible in America. It is extremely depressing to think about it, but thankfully we have constantly films made elsewhere that we occasionally see. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie as long as you do not mind moving through the parts that we all know too well and smirking at the rest.
