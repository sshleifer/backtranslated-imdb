Mikio Naruse's exploration of the lives of three idle, constantly complaining ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful character piece. They used to be friends, but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful money lender and the other two owe her. Although the lender is the only one who has succeeded in this upbuilding economy, she is the only one of the three who has no children. The two others each have a child they depend on because they are not working. Complications arise when the children decide to marry (albeit not with each other) and leave the house. As a result, the bitter, grumbling old women become even more bitter and grumpy, getting drunk and appeasing their lazy children and their ruthless friend to the money lender. In the meantime, the money lender is unhappy despite her fortune. She has no one but her young deaf to keep her company, and random encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days do not lead anywhere - they really only want to borrow money from her. The three characters are all uncaring in the deep, boring life and are too tired to fight a lot, instead opting to put up with the pointlessness of the whole or even tossing complaints back and forth. <br /> <br /> "Late Chrysanthemums" is very slow and actually does not happen much, but Naruse, like all great directors, has the ability to do very little with very little. I have not seen much of his work, but I suspect that this is not his best, although it is very good. I think the problem is that it does not mean much. But the movie is full of good points. Although it is cynical, it is not over the top. Naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and he paints vivid portraits that make the characters even seem noble in the misery of their self-made misery. While not a must-have, the film is a fragment of the work of a major, lesser-known director (outside of his home country), much of which is seen on video here in the US.
