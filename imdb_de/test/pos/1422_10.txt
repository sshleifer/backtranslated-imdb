Robert Jordan is a TV star. Robert Jordan likes to do things properly, punctually, and properly. In his world children are to be seen, not to be heard. Why would Mr. Jordan become the master of a Rambunctic band of Boy Scouts? Reviews. His associates believe that if they learn to interact with youth, they will rather see their show. Of course, watching Jordan is the biggest part of the fun. <br /> <br /> As Mr. Belvedere and Mr. Belvedere go to college, this will certainly be appreciated. <br /> <br /> ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN A COPY THIS FILM PLEASE WRITE ME: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
