It was easy to dismiss this film as an exaggeration at the time of its release. Fonda, Douglas, and Lemmon were known as "lefties," but the crash on Three Mle Island provided a shocking context to this fictional drama. <br /> <br /> This film works on many levels and makes shots in both public utility and television news. 1979 was the culmination of the infamous "Happy Talk" format of television news (see also "Ron Burgundy") and is shown here in all its glory. The sonorous anchor grimly reads a story about a "head-on collision" before cheerfully introducing Kimberley Wells (Fonda) and writing a story about a veterinarian who makes home visits (or is the "aquarium"). The producer of the show and the station manager argue behind the scenes about contents or their lack. <br /> <br /> There are some technical mistakes. The PR flack (James Hampton) shows Fonda and Douglas the required model of a pressurized water reactor plant built by Westinghouse. Later, when Lemmon and Wilford Brimley (the friend and colleague of Lemmon, caught between duty and fidelity) fight a sudden crisis in the factory's control room, they obviously operate a boiling water plant (built by GE.) A small point, but curious if considering how many details the scriptwriters have understood correctly. <br /> <br /> As with any good drama, the movie asks more questions than it answers. The real accident at TMI proves the basic premise of the film. The working title for the movie was originally "Power," and you'll see why. As nuclear power is preparing for a comeback of $ 3 petrol these days, "The China Syndrome" is just as relevant today as it was over 25 years ago.
