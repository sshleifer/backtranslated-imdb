This is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time. An eerie abandoned house, interesting characters, blood and a twisted property. Who could ask for more in a horror movie? It's pretty predictable for the most part, but most of the horrors you can find out within the first 10 minutes, so I do not reject that. The music, camera angles etc. are excellent. The sets are well made and very convincing. However, there was virtually no negotiation, as it is a horror movie, as too many alternative acts are only removed from what was missing from a horror anyway ... to be scared ... This movie keeps it pretty simple and does that. If I compared it to another movie, I'd say it reminds me of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. In any case, a horror movie lover must see.
