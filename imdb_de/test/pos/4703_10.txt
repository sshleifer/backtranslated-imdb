I was in a screening of "SISTER HELEN" at the Sundance Film Festival and did not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> I was shackled by the people in this documentary. Sister Helen is an incredible character !!! The filmmakers captured the essence of Sister Helen's amazing soul and took me to an unknown world. I was very satisfied with the trip and was completely surprised by the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> This film appeals to those who want a second chance in life.
