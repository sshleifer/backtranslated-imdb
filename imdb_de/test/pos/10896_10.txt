Since I was allowed to play Goldeneye again, I could not distract myself. I am surprised that I could have walked without it. It is without doubt one of the biggest games of all time. I have never played any other shooting games, but I know that this one rules above all else. Most people make too much violence, but I think that's ridiculous. There may be some graphic antics, but it's much worse. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, it's fun. With an unbelievable arsenal of weapons like the RC-P90 and the classic Golden Gun, you'll go through various challenging levels of the movie, accomplish important goals and fend off swarms of guards. There are tons of great cheats and even two secret levels that you can only earn if you have the true ability. Goldeneye is also one of the best multiplayer games ever. You can select several characters from the movie, classic villains from old 007 movies (Baron Samedi, Oddjob, May Day and Jaws) and guards in the game. Chances are you and your partners will laugh so hard you blow each other away that you look like Bart and Lisa Simpson watching an episode of the Itchy and Scratchy show. <br /> <br /> So if you do not have the game, you can not rent it: just buy it. It's too good to be true. For more information about Goldeneye, visit the Goldeneye website of Detstar.com. Any James Bond lover will dig this game great.
