The film Night Crossing captures the feelings that the vast majority of East Germans experienced during the period 1961-1989. I lived in West Berlin almost 1967 and traveled weekly through the Wall to East Berlin. Why? Excitement to cross a border into a soviet-dominated country, to experience the smells and feel of the GDR, which is why Night Crossing is excellent. It captures exactly that feeling and is exciting. I was arrested by the Vopos at Checkpoint Charlie and approached by a guy in his leather coat and dark glasses that I think was Stasi. When I see the movie, I can smell cheap diesel and cooking oil, I can see the outdated vehicles, the dreary clothes that the public wore, and the dull products in the shop windows. It brings back memories of how lucky I was to live in a free country. In 1988 I toured East through West Germany, North to South. East Germany had changed little since 1967. The Trabants, which were constantly collapsing, were still the most important form of private motorized transport, the shops offered nothing that tempted me, uniforms were still commonplace, but the people, the ordinary people, were openly beautiful, if you trust them won. Watch Night Crossing, it's as close to the truth as any movie you'll see in divided Germany, even closer than two other favorites. The spy who came out of the cold and the funeral in Berlin.
