MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to take a look at it, as it was pleasantly surprised and also surprised those involved in the production. If I recall correctly, we had to watch it on a UHF station. This meant that UHF did not belong to regular television these days to listen to the local broadcaster to see the cartoon a big deal these days, making the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects with which Gerald has spoken. A great memory from over 50 years. I have to see what other memories could hide on the web. Incidentally, I try to make computer animations in which the johnl3d comes into the picture
