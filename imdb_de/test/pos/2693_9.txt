This is one of the funniest shows on TV today. It reaches the mark 99% of the time. Normally, after watching a sitcom after a few years, the actors become cartoonish as if they wanted to become the beloved characters they play. These actors have stayed true to their roles in my opinion. The chemistry is still there, the writing has not gone down and I'm still looking forward to watching it. The family dynamics still seem real and the situations after all this time are not so far-fetched that the writers grab into an empty pocket and try to keep the show up for another season the remote control in hand for quick switching.
