This movie should be released on DVD. I just got a copy of what I thought was a studio movie and I was totally satisfied !!! It was on my list of films that were easy to own because of the cast. Three of my people, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both were in Romeo & Juliet and also John Gielghud. Sorry for the bad spelling in there, I thought on my own that it would be good for the small amount I spent. Boy, I was right. I will not give it away, maybe you already know the story anyway, but I'm just saying if you can get a copy in any format. JPC
