I've had to watch this movie about four or five times, and with every look it gets better. Suffice to say, this is the best movie I have ever seen. And I think I saw a lot. <br /> <br /> But I've always wondered why this movie was so shunned in some reviews or reviews. Take, for example, the IMDb Top 250. Why is it only ranked # 216 (as of today)? Surely the answer is not in the movie itself (because that's nothing but flawless), but in the reception. The film provoked controversy in his portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and his anti-death penalty stance. Of course, the more conservative-thinking user probably did not like the movie (as you can see from some other comments). So DEAD MAN WALKING gets a ranking that is absolutely ridiculous in terms of quality. These people did not understand what the movie was trying to say, and maybe they did not want to understand that they demanded the death penalty. Now I understand it: It's all political. You are per capita - you do not like (and therefore do not want to hear) what the movie has to say. <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry that there are still so many people who just turn off when a new perspective challenges their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Mr. Robbins, the issue of your movie split people's opinions. Some checked their position, some just did not listen, but you raised a very important point. Her film will probably never appear on a "TOP 100 MOVIES OF ALL TIME" list, but it will be remembered long after movies like Braveheart or Babe or Apollo 13 (all were falsely favored before the Oscars) ) be forgotten. Congratulations, Mr. Robbins, and many thanks for this important piece of filmmaking.
