Perhaps the best movie Director Kevin Tenney has ever made (well, his Witchboard is not on my horror list ever), this is a curious, intriguing mix between Pin and Child's Play, both better than this, but not so much better Sure, the conspiracy is fictional and perhaps too predictable, but the actors are good, Rosalind Allen is very pleasing to the eye (and Candance McKenzie - God bless her for the shower scene!), The child actress can interpret very well The Disturbed Daughter and The Pinocchio puppets are so scary that you get some thrills on your back. Not bad for a B-movie.
