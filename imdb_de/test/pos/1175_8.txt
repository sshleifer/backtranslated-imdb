8/2008. When I originally wrote my comments, I saw a critical stance shortly after seeing this movie for the first time. He felt that Lemmon and Matthau had basically "called" their performances. But seeing them again seemed different, especially considering that none of the two big megastars lived much longer after being released. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Spiner, all eight principals are performers with considerable experience and also inevitably much longer than many other films and on television work. But not almost everyone? <br /> <br /> To see it again is not considered "classic" in any of their careers, it's a funny movie with an interesting backdrop. <br /> <br /> In my view, it reminds me that many Movies, plays etc. can often be viewed either from a very critical point of view, or instead look to the brighter side, without having to expect one movie to another "Citizen Kane", "Casablance" or (in relation to the two Traces) to be another original "Odd Couple". It will also provide a lasting nostalgia for Lemmon and Matthau as well as for the others in the cast.
