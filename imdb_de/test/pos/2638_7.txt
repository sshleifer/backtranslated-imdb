_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_, and _The Wild Life_ is running out. <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> Some other stan wrote the above comment. Of course, The Wild Life is not a ridgemont. Ridgemont is the epitome of the 80s Flica. However, the wild life is enjoyable if you do not remember that mindless movies are mindless films (especially if you know that this is primarily a mindless movie). The little Latino from Scarface is in this movie and he is downright disrespectful ("I have Visa ... Masterrrrr Charrrrge !!"). RIP The Colonel 1931-1997. <br /> <br /> This movie is no worse than a 6 compared to other genres, by the way. It's not worse than a 7 in relation to other 80-year-old comedies. It has the feel of a Cameron Crowe movie. Only Staniels gave him a 5.
