... the world can never know. (The film that shot this year's Academy Award for "Best Animated Short Film," "Anna and Bella," is very good, but it's not a "big snit." Both are on Expanded Entertainments' World's Greatest Animation I would like to compare.) <br /> <br /> "Snit" and its director Richard Condie have attracted so much attention that I have little to add. However, I would like to say that the film contains one of my favorite single shots in an animated short film sequence in which the man opens the door to let the cat out. I do not want to reveal the actual events here, but when I saw the shot for the first time, I was dragged from one mood to the other, then seconds later into another. This shot has always influenced me since then. For this recording, and the way Condie builds those moments, "The Big Snit" deserves the title "Masterpiece."
