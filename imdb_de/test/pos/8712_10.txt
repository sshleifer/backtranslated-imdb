A sparkling movie. BB is a miracle. She is sultry. She is a feminist. She is still very much in love. <br /> <br /> The film shows Paris in the 50s. It's wonderful to see the sights, the cars (DS!) And Orly. <br /> <br /> A simple but very pleasant romantic comedy. The music is terrible. It almost crumbles. On the other hand, it's funny. But it's probably the only thing that's not true, if you look at it at least through the eyes of the 21st century. The film comments on the French way of treating infidelity. That's modern. A movie like an elephant that distinguished itself as Trompe Enormenent in the 80s. However, the basic requirement remains the same. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the creators who gave BB this opportunity.
