Despite all negative criticism, I really liked this movie. I do not say that lightly. I love movies and I'm pretty choosy (my DVD collection includes over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are fine, some do not like me at all). And for those who have criticism: This is a comedy. I just love this movie. It is easy, funny and very relaxing. I know all (or most) shortcomings, but I love it. The comedic talents of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro are exhausted (for this kind of movie). Do not compare it to other movies with these star actors, just enjoy it. The cast is great and I believe that the purpose of this film was fully realized. If you want a really "carefree" and very restful night, watch this movie. DeNiro and Murphy just had fun shooting this movie, so we should (look at it). And please do not be so negative. Do not expect any sponsorship or Meet The Parents from DeNiro, do not expect Murphy's comedy blockbuster performance ... It's a completely different genre, and I relaxed after a hard day at work. Your pages should not be ridiculous, but it's still very funny.
