Secondary school. Years and decades later, some prefer to look back, others to embarrassment. But only a few find it easy to forget. It is one of the most critical phases of our lives when changes become quick and angry, whether we are ready or not. No more children, no adults, irresistible forces buff us and drive us in all directions. <br /> <br /> "Fame" sought to capture this turbulent, chaotic time for his cast of young characters. For the most part succeeded. It snaked but felt like a piece of life. This film occupies a special place in the hearts of the 80s class. We had just said goodbye to a decade and soon after three, four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years. We went into the cold, cruel world and left home for a college. As we approached our turning point, this newly released movie was like a two-year yearbook for us. We could not escape the title song on the radio. That's what we were on top of the screen. These were our friends, rivals and classmates as we faced our own dreams, frustrations, successes and failures. <br /> <br /> It is particularly interesting for those who have attended one of the other elite high schools in New York City, in particular Stuyvesant, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like the children here, we were considered the best of the best. We did not have auditions, but rigorous entrance exams. Perhaps even more than the children of the performing arts have been expected to change the world, if not necessarily become famous. How they did not do it all of us. However, the environment of the pressure cooker promoted an extraordinary camaraderie and esprit de corps, similar to the "hot lunch jam" in the cafeteria. On our graduation day, our spirits rose almost like the jubilant crescendo in the rousing finale. The film leaves us with a single, triumphant note at the end of "I Sing the Body Electric," which refers to the dazzlingly bright, boundless future and all the promises it holds. <br /> <br /> "Fame" could not. It was not set anywhere else. This story would never have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has a stronger identification with film and television, but NYC is a Mecca for all the arts. New York is not only what was then called PA, but also the world famous Juilliard. NYC is a cultural center that can not be found in any other city in the world. It's also a time capsule of the rest of the city of time, which shows the germination, the sand and the dirt that were endemic in New York and still came back from the financial crisis that had nearly bankrupted it. Above all, it showed vitality as it was muted by Giuliani, Disney and tourism. What I would not give to be young again. But with "Fame" I can at least remember what it was like.
