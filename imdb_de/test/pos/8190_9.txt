Based on the actual event, this epic is written in the year 221 BCE. Performed and tells the true story of the unification of China. Action full of intrigue, passion, betrayal and unforgettable combat sequences. Despite its 160 minutes, it took my attention. <br /> <br /> King Ying Zeng, played by Li Xuejian, is obsessed with unifying the seven kingdoms of China and becoming his first emperor. His lover, Lady Zhao, played by the beautiful actress Gong Li, designs a conspiracy to travel to the neighboring kingdom of Yan to launch a fake assassination that gives the king an excuse to invade Yan , However, she falls in love with the assassin as the king becomes more ruthless. <br /> <br /> There are subplots and tragedies and a constant high drama. There are scenes of great beauty and cruel cruelty. There is great cinematography and brilliant use of physical space. <br /> <br /> The deep characterization made me think of Shakespeare. And tragic events reminiscent of the Greek drama. And yet it is absolutely Chinese, since these are age-old questions, whether the purposes justify the means. And raises the questions that deal with life and death and good and evil and all the blurry edges in between. <br /> <br /> It is the story of individuals against the background of history, a story that has shaped China for the past two thousand years. I got carried away in the story as well as the moral issues raised. There are no easy answers and this was one of the movie's strong points. <br /> <br /> Recommended. But be prepared for violence and anger. <br /> <br />
