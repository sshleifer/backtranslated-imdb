Although the video box for many copies of this film claims to be people turned inside out, this is a total lie. Apart from the opening segment, the film is not a horror movie. With its sunken treasures, legions of fish people and crazy scientists, it resembles an adventure movie by Doug McClure. Obviously this movie is not a work of art, but it's fun to see it ... Just be warned that the beginning is pretty bloody.
