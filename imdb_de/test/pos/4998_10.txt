I must have seen a different version than the first person in the comments. <br /> <br /> It's really good ... Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are great. Val Kilmer's character is very similar to the novel, although the focus is on Gus and Call and the Comanches. We can see what happened to Call and Newt's mother as well. I will not spoil it, but it gives a great insight into the character of Call. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a really convincing job. Steve Zahn had the biggest challenge, I thought, following Robert Duvall! There is a lot of action, humor, tragedy. There is something for everybody. I can not wait until it airs. My family is all jealous. I saw it early!
