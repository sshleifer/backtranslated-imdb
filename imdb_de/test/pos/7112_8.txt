At the end of the cycle of Universal Monsters' horror films and before the golden age of science-fiction movies, House of Dracula is more sci-fi than horror and contains some of the more kitschy elements that would come out of the sci-fi movies of the coming era describe. Lon Chaney Jr. plays the Wolfman and John Carradine, Dracula and Glenn Strange, the Frankenstein monster. A mad scientist sets out to "heal" the two monsters from their "illnesses" with modern means {las: mad} science. If it turns out that the wonderful nurse of the scientist is a hunchback at the beginning of the film, the viewer is made aware that this film will not be a typical universality. This film shows what kind of shabby exploitation we would take for granted in the '50s science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind that the older movies are slower and Black & White does not throw you out, this movie is recommended. Afaik, this is currently not available on DVD, but AMC sends it occasionally. So check it out or keep it on your TiVo!
