"Who will love my children?" Most sad movie I have ever seen. Definitely 10/10. Published on television in 1983. The film was released on the VHS. DVD release is a must, sooner rather than later. A mother who dies of cancer must find a home for all of her children before she dies, because she believes that her husband and father of the children will not be able to take care of her once she dies. She manages to find a home for the children, except for one, a boy whom one does not want because he suffers from epilepsy. Very sad if you do not want to. Take this movie for a good tear wiper. I'm a man, though I cried when I saw this movie. Not to miss.
