Distributor: GOODTIMES home video <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A pretty high school student is marked for relentless terror in this TV movie-filled suspense. Gail Osborne is new to the city. She makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to go her own way. Until she receives a sinister and frightening call while she is a babysitter. After more and more phone calls, she is raped. Throughout most of the film, she tries to find evidence that the person has raped her. <br /> <br /> Audio / Video: This 1987 VHS edition of Goodtimes stinks. There are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen. <br /> <br /> Extras: No extras from the Goodtimes home video. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: This tension was made for the TV movie Do not expect many deaths (there are none). If you find this movie with the Worldvision Home Video logo on the front, buy it. But the Goodtimes version is pretty shitty. This can be a bit boring, but if you are patient, the end is pretty good.
