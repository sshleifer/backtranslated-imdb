I saw this movie for the first time on an Alaska Airlines flight and have seen it twice since then. It is - and simply is - one of the best movies in years. I enjoyed it after my first visit, but a little sad about what had happened. After seeing it again a few weeks later, things began to settle down. It was not confusing, just deep. In fact, the depth of the movie may not be recognized for a long time. For example, it only occurred to me after my third visit that Sammy Davis Jr. (grandfather's dog) is more than just a pet - maybe she's the replacement for his dead wife. Experience how hard he protects you. There is an abundance of symbolism, and none of it is juicy or indulgent, only real. The adventure of their journey keeps the story moving, and even when they arrive you're not sure it was their destination. As the movie continues, the adventure makes it and I feel like the destination was just a waypoint. The soundtrack is fun, the scenery captivating - and both decidedly from the Eastern bloc. I could go on and on talking about the deeper meanings in the movie, but I'm not sure I've discovered all the nuances. It's also more fun to try it out for yourself. As much as any movie can be, "Everything Is Illuminated" has turned out to be a fine wine that gets sweeter with time. I highly recommend seeing it twice.
