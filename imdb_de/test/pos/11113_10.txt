"Fame" has been one of my favorite movies for years! It's not just a musical movie from the '80s from "this" high school in NYC, it's LEGENDARY - people are no longer referring to the High School of Performing Arts, but "the Fame School" is real, they're not " Hollywood "and her stories are real. The film follows them through the four years of school, starting with a powerful monologue from a student at auditions to a spectacular final show that you should definitely watch this movie and then have your own opinion. For those who like to watch movies and like the "classics", this is certainly one of them. It's an example of one of those films that was really great, with actors we loved for those 2 hours, and then never saw them again ... they're classic "Fame Students." <br /> <br /> make FAME live forever.
