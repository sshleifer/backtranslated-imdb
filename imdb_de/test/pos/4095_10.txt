I was about 14 years old when I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the movie as much as the songs I visited several times in the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learned the songs by heart, just like I did with "The Sound of Music" (which people in Austria barely know). I think the problem with some self-styled critics whose comments are being shared is that they do not have a romantic soul and can not see the movie through the eyes of a young teenager. Maybe he is an Ingrid Bergman fan, but I was satisfied with Liv Ullman. Could Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What was so great about her? Perhaps the critic did not appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses, as he sees a close resemblance between Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. It was the idea and the story behind the movie, the philosophy that was the most important and interesting factor, and a musical in color just made it more entertaining and enjoyable without affecting the intellectually pleasing aspects. It is a shame that many other films with so-called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are totally boring in comparison.
