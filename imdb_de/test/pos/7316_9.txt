In this incredibly harsh and often hysterically funny turmoil, the favorite trios of all bumbling fools are running amok in a hospital. These guys are without a doubt the most incompetent group of doctors who ever move across the screen. Comic highlights include the Stooges, who are constantly breaking a pane of glass in a door, their encounter with a confused patient who claims that rats came out of the buttonhole of his shirt, the Stooges, who drove a huge bike through the corridors, a huge one Horse, and miniature racing cars, and our great stupid threesome accidentally dropped instruments into the belly of an unfortunate patient after he finished operating the poor guy. Director Ray McCarey tells the hectic comedy of comedy at a reasonable pace and stages the broad slapstick gags with considerable zeal. Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly Howard are all in bad shape and are hailed by Dell Henderson as longtime hospital director. Graves well supported, the squeamish Jeanie Roberts as a swallowing nurse (the scene in which the Stooges seem absurd Impromptu group singalong with this girl is absolutely exhausting!), Ruth Hiatt as a whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert as a raging, crazy Patient and "Little Billy" Rhodes as a mad little patient. The spirited madness never lasts for a minute and makes this wonderfully insane baby to one of the best excursions of the Stooges.
