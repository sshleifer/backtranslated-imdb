The portrayal of the Marines in this movie is just right. The action scenes are among the best ever produced in terms of content accuracy. The uniforms and weapons of the American and German troops were perfect. The Berber costumes and weapons were also absolutely accurate. This film could easily be used to teach militaria of that time, and was used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes in which Roosevelt was shot and the rifles he used were beautiful. Obtaining so many historical weapons in such good condition is a testament to the attention to detail. Millius is a genius.
