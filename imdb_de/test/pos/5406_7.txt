Imaginary Heroes is another piece of darkness and denial that hides beneath the surface of American suburbs. The life of the Travis family is recovered after the suicide of their eldest son. <br /> <br /> The couple at the center of the film are mother and son Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) and Tim (Emile Hirsch), both of whom act differently due to death. As Tim experiments with prescription drugs and his own sexuality, Sandy commits her former self, smokes marijuana, and abandons herself to an old act of unfaithfulness. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sandy and Tim is particularly well-researched Referring to both expelled from her own family: Sandy due to her affair and Tim initially because he was always in the shadow of his more successful older brother , Sandy's husband Ben (Jeff Daniels) has much less time. He has ordered Sandy in a devastating display of refusal to prepare an extra plate for his dead son and to place him in his old place at the dining table. Michelle Williams' older sister Penny is under contract and could easily be taken out of the movie. Despite its long running time, Imaginary Heroes does not explore its many dealings as much as the individual stories deserve, while there are some of the film's black comedy not being translated as well as author / director Dan Harris liked it. And the representation of a disturbed family dynamics is not as well represented as the many other films with similar ideas. Despite some problems, the central performances of Weaver and Hirsch are overwhelming and easily contribute to the film's successfully muted result. <br /> <br /> Rating: B-
