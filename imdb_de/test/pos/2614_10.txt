That's it! I would never have expected the end, if I did not already know the background. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hated was why Shannon was pushed away and not Alyssa. I hate her, I would prefer that her character dies of Shannon. Funny thing is that in the scene where Piper dies on the hospital bed and Prue is crying at her side, I started too quietly. By the time this was aired, I was about 10 years old and my favorite character was Piper from the start. I told myself that when she dies, I will not see the show anymore! lol. <br /> <br /> then the whole thing was back in time, which was a shock and really good. I also blame Pheobe for Prue's death, because she did not just have to be with her sisters, she should be a naughty bitch and good for her, no demon mate, and forever one of my favorites and a CHRMED classic. <br /> <br /> FOREVER CHARMED! Blessed be!
