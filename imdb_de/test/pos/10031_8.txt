The second historical drama of Warner Brothers with Civil War and Battle of Little Big Horn, General George Armstrong Custer, which existed with their boats (Warner Brothers, 1941), was the far more accurate of the two; Especially compared to SANTA FE TRAIL (Warner Brothers, 1940), who did not raise the bar very high. ALTHOUGH Both images were equipped with vehicles for Errol Flynn, which led to a casting change the part of General Custer. While it was "Dutchman", Ronald Reagan portrayed the flamboyant, egomaniacal cavalryman in the previous picture, Mr. Flynn Virginian and later Confederate Hero General, J.E.B. (or Jeb) Stuart; Errol took over the custer part for THEY DIED WITH HER BOOTS. Once again, the willingness of the Warner brothers to employ a large number of reliable character actors from the Warner's Repertory Company has been used in giving. The film is a kind of authenticity, and everything really happens right in front of our own eyes. Starring some of the more notable actors and actresses, such as: Elizabeth Bacon / Mrs. Custer (co-star Olivia de Havilland), Ned Sharpe (Arthur Kennedy), Samuel Bacon (Gene Lockhart), chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn), "Californy "(Charlie Grapwin), Major Taipe (Stanley Ridges), General Phillip Sheridan (John Litel), Callie (Bacons' Girl, Hattie McDaniel). <br /> <br /> The rest of the line-up is filled with unrooted players, though seasoned players like Joe Sawyer, Eleanor Parker, Minor Watson, Tod Andrews, Irving Bacon, Roy Barcroft, Lane Chandler, Spencer Charters, Frank Ferguson, Francis Ford, William Forrest, George Eldridge, Russell Hicks, William Hopper, Eddie Keane, Fred Kelsey, Sam McDaniel, Patrick McVey, Frank Orth, Eddie Parker, Eddie Keane, Eddie Parker, Addison Richards, Ray Thorne (All) Americans, himself), Minerva Urecal, Dick Wessel, Gig Young and many, many more. The movie moves very fast, especially in the early years. then the plight of necessity slows down as the story focuses on the years after the Civil War, the appointment of Custer as Colonel in the 7th Cavalry and the ultimate destiny at the Little Big Horn in Montana. Directed by director, Griffith Veteran, Raoul Walsh, the film encounters very different types of emotions. from the very serious, exciting fight scenes and convincing historical scenes; Looked like they were Matthew Brady Civil War Photos. Like most of Mr. Walsh's films, it highlights and speeds the end of some scenes with a sense of humor. But do not go overboard and risk the chance to turn the movie into a comedy (actually a farce). As already mentioned, this is much more factual than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (the last time we did that) I'll mention it, Honest Schultz, Scout's Honor!). This does not mean, however, that it was not without a few small pieces of "Artistic and Literary License", as indeed every biopic will give. It would be impossible to make a similar type of film if all the facts and The incident should be attempted to be included in the script. Perhaps the most erroneous inclusion, as well as the most obvious allusion to the Literary License, is the fact that Custer was accidentally promoted to the rank of Brigadier General, but the "gag" helped the film to evolve, while supporting the whole light, carefree feeling that sustained that Pervaded the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> DIRECTOR Walsh and Mr. Flynn have brought us together This seems to be a characterization of this legendary civil war hero who was very close to real humans, and they did so in addition to restoring an incident: the massacre of Lakota Sioux , Cheyenne and Fukowi Custer and his 7th Cavalry at the Little Big Horn At the time of his appearance, on June 25, 1876, "Custer's Last Stand" was as much an incident and shock to the American psyche as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) or the atrocities perpetrated by the police Islamic Fascists in New York's Twin Trade Towers and the headquarters of the US Forces at the Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia, on September 11, 2002. JUST ruled so many films from that time World War II (and the years immediately preceding it) saw so many incidents in that, if not deliberately done, demonstrations of virtues would be n that would be required at the time of another Global Conflict, as we had at the time of THE DIED WITH YOUR BOOTS ON ended its original theatrical release. <br /> <br /> POODLE CARVING !!
