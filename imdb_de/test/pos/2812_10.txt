Gerald McRaney (Dave Morgan), "War Crimes," 01 TV Series, was like a father of Tiffani Thiessen (Jennifer Gallagher), "A Kiss Before Lying," 03, who has a very bad situation in her life and led it Jennifer pulled back with people and young men. Dave Morgan desperately tries to get her out of the house and manages to introduce Jennifer Chris (Gallagher), who falls in love with her at her very first meeting. Nearly one or two appointments later, Chris asks Jennifer if she will marry him and she agrees. It's not very long after the wedding that things are going to happen, Chris is in the Navy and does not like to work in submarines, and something will happen to young men in the neighborhood. This is a very excellent TV movie, and sometimes you wonder if the guy or girl I want to have as a soul mate is the perfect person!
