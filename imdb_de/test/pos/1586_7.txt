A crazy, but funny variety. You have to see it from the beginning to see what happens, but every report to Earth has its own little joke. Pretty good special effects for a very cheap sci-fi TV. Show. It's fun to watch. Something like the Red Dwarf, but even cheaper. For someone just passing one of the episodes, you must realize that these guys are all incompetent because they moved up the ladder of command because the other officers died. Besides, the captains are from the laundry corps, which is why they have laundry in everything. If you like Red Dwarf, you will probably like it. Something else t.v. Concept in which everything you see is the Commander Report every day. <br /> <br /> It would be better if this would be explained more, not only at the beginning of the first episode, but then it was quite difficult Find out what happened in Red Dwarf even if you had not learned.
