This 1955 film follows Tony Le Stephanois, who was recently released from prison for stealing while robbing his life. He works with his old pirates and they bring in an experienced safe-cracker, Cesar from Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directs.) He only directed because he was blacklisted in the US as a communist and did not work could in Hollywood.) The brilliance of this film is 1/2 hour during the robbery. Throughout this time there is no dialogue and no music, only the muffled sounds when digging through the ground or drilling the safe. This increases the tension and attracts you. They receive jewels worth hundreds of millions of francs, but a jewel offered by Cesar to a dancer draws their attention to a trio of brutal brothers. They set about procuring the supplies for themselves and causing misfortune. Great Heist / Gangster movie, but I prefer J.-P. Melville's films in this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a lemonade I had last night. I had gone to a Caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugar cane juice instead of sugar. It also had a lot of ice and was heavy on the lemons, which made it quite annoying (which I like). The sugar cane juice gave it a subtle, slightly milder taste than the sugar, and the ice made sure it was cold and refreshing as I sucked it. 7.5 / 10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
