This is a classic film that dramatizes the plight of a man who can not adapt to changes in society and feels increasingly estranged, leading to violence. Joe is a worker, and he is dissatisfied and angry, and all he needs is a pretext to strike out. That's what the story is about. Alone Joe is silent; he becomes deadly with someone else. And what makes the character of Joe even more daunting is that he completely rationalizes his violence so that not only is it not bad for him, but it is necessary. For Joe, he projects his own violent tendencies on those whom he considers "the enemy" and is therefore in a war. In this film, the "generational gap" is portrayed as a war. But it's just a war in Joe because "the enemy" is in his imagination in this case. Nobody wants to fight Joe, but Joe feels he has to defend himself. Although the film was released in 1970, its message is as relevant today as it was then, as society continues to undergo major changes, resulting in an intense alienation that dramatically dramatizes the film.
