I saw this movie over Christmas and what a great movie! It tells the story of Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during and after his graduation from Westpoint. Although I have heard that the film is historically not very accurate (Hollywood is never), I enjoyed it anyway, since I did not know much about the real events anyway, since then has become my favorite actor! His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the end was fantastic! It almost made me cry when he and Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) rode to death on a small, big horn. I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor because he was my father's favorite actor and I grew up with his films as a child. But it was not until I saw this movie that I realized how great it really was. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 out of 10 !!
