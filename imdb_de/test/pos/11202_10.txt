Like all good works of art, this film can have different meanings for different people. For me, this means that if you do not open your heart to the others, it might rob you of happiness and leave you with an empty life. The comfort of egoism is like junk food: it feels good, but it could eventually make you sick. Almost everything I see in the US is a commercial mass production of action garbage, flat dramas, and stupid comedies, and this sensitive, deep and poetic film really touched me. Thanks, Nuri Bilge Ceylan (and everyone else in the cast)! <br /> <br /> Ivan Yanachkov
