What an embarrassing episode last night! It was either a failed script for "ABC Afterschool Special" or the product of a serious rookie author who pays homage to the 1974 classic anti-gun homily "The Gun" shortly after college. In fact, my husband and his disappointment were disappointed that The Gun was not melted down as in the movie! <br /> <br /> No, I'm not an NRA shill. It's just that if the producer of a smart and nuanced series had set their minds on me to undergo a didactic dramatization of his personal cause, I would appreciate it if the talk did not have at least 2-by-4 Quality! <br /> <br /> OK, the sociology class is over. The message has been submitted. The important episode was sent. Let us now turn to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence.
