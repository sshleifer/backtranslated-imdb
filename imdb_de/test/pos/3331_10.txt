Come on. Anyone who does not understand the size of this cartoon character should be excluded from any review panel. They must not be heard because they obviously have no sense of humor. <br /> <br /> If you do not love this animated animated cartoon by Tex Avery, you should be chained to a chair and forced to watch "Huckleberry Hound" episodes for 20 years! <br /> <br /> The Wolf's settings and double shots in this animated cartoon are the best examples of this important past of the comedy ever recorded in the film. <br /> <br /> Tex Avery was to receive a posthumous Oscar for this cartoon. It is the best.
