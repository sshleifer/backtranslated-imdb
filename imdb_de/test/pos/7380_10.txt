Dude, I thought this movie rocked. Perfect to just sit around alone and watch with you and a bottle like 3 o'clock. All the time, when you see it, do you think of WTF? What will happen next? Buddy, come on with the chick. Okay ... they are pickin mushrooms ... that's weird ... but somehow scary cool. Damn, this whole movie has an erotic, kinky, evil, evil, evil undertone. He is a subtle dance. But damn ... WTF!? They get that and more. For the morally angry stomach, it's great to run to the bathroom to block material. Any movie that can provoke this kind of reaction deserves a prize.
