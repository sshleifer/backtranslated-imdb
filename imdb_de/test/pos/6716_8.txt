"Lifeforce" is a truly bizarre adaptation of Colin Wilson's novel "The Space Vampires" written by Dan O'Bannon & Don Jakoby. A joint US-British space exploration team makes a startling discovery: An alien spaceship resting in Halley's comet, containing three entities that look like humans, including a female beauty (the oh-so-tempting Mathilda May). <br /> They take these discoveries aboard their own spacecraft. Big mistake. <br /> <br /> It turns out that these creatures drain people's lives, and like the American Colonel Carlsen (an intense, nervous and dedicated Steve Railsback) and the British S.A.S. Colonel Caine (a solid Peter Firth) observes in horror, vampirism invades London, with the fate of the earth in balance. <br /> <br /> This image is certainly not lacking in imagination. It sometimes moves a bit slowly, but it offers so many strange and imaginative ideas and stunning images that it's hard not to enjoy yourself. The first of Director Tobe Hooper's three-picture deal with Cannon Films (he followed with "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" and the remake "Invaders from Mars"), making it something truly unique. The elements of science fiction, vampire movies, zombie movies, and doomsday sagas are like nothing I've seen before. <br /> <br /> Railsback and Firth are supported by such strong British actors as Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Aubrey Morris and John Hallam. Mathilda May is very memorable as the enigmatic, enigmatic villainy; it sure does not hurt that she plays many nude scenes. Also noteworthy is a rousing music score by none other than the composer "Pink Panther" Henry Mancini. <br /> <br /> It may seem ridiculous, but it was fun as well. It's a flamboyant and spirited entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
