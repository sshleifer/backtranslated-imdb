I would say this movie was absolutely great. I can see how many people think it's just a shock movie. That's not entirely wrong, but it's just as much shock fiction as Chuck Palahniuk's books are. One of my favorite films of all time, Bijo no Harawata, is a certain kind of rude movie that you can pretty much have any reaction to. It's scary, funny, stupid, rude, full of unconventional material and exciting for some people. The first time I saw that, it was with my friend, and his mother had brought it home so he could see it. He said it was just a small Japanese movie, but I saw a lot more of it. It's done badly, yes, but it has a certain kind of beauty to be beautiful too. As the director himself says, this is a shock film for a reason. It's like an atrophy. If you let the audience go soft, all humanity will be soft. I think that's a good philosophy, and I totally agree. Bijo no Harawata is a kind of movie raped by the gang of fitness, yogurt, and all the New Wave stuff.
