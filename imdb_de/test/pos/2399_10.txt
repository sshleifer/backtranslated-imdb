Fred Carpenter has shown Eddie Monroe at Boston College, and he has much to look forward to because of the enthusiastic response. A learned, well-made Indy, impressive for his great budget. This movie has it all: a tight script that grabs you and does not let you go to its surprising end. This viewer did not see it coming! All around excellence. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were particularly good in the lead role and performed well. And kudos to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado, who created two detectives as intriguing and interesting as any other movie. I really enjoyed this movie. It has confirmed my conviction that some of the best work in the film will come from the independents, and Fred Carpenter seems to be one of the best.
