It is a shame that the Gershwin family and Goldwyn Estate have pulled this great movie out of television, preventing the public from seeing some of the most wonderful actors and performances ever to be bundled in a movie. <br /> <br /> It's also true that the voices for Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge have been dubbed for this film, and this is one of the reasons why the Gershwin's do not want to re-release this movie. <br /> Despite the flaws in the film and the creative differences between the Gershwin and the Goldwyns, this film has some of the most notable performances ever seen on screen. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Pearl Bailey are especially commendable. <br /> <br /> This movie was the great independent producer Samuel Golwyn's swan song. It was also ironic, the biggest shame of the Gershwin. <br /> <br /> After all, it's a loss for the wonderful black actors who appeared in it. Because we can no longer see her in top form.
