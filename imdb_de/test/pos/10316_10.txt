There are one or two other Shemp era shorts that I like more (eg SCRAMBLED BRAINS), but I think you can say without a lot of argument that Shemp shows his greatest comedic performance as a henchman in this episode after joining the Team has team for 1946. <br /> <br /> Scene by scene, this episode hardly slackens: From Professor Shemp Howard's singing lessons with the glass-destroying Dee Green to his futile attempts to win a lady's hand in marriage your little snookums ... do you want to marry me * click *) until the stormy end, it always fails to keep me in jail. <br /> <br /> I would like the immortal scene with Miss Hopkins (who is always very nice Christine McIntyre). By the way, is not she underneath dressed and overly in love when she greets the man she believes is her cousin Basil? Who knows, maybe the real Basil was a "very" distant cousin, making it legal in some states (as far as I know). >: -]
