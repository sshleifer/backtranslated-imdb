The people of Aardman have made a cool, cute, and wild adaptation of their short films by Wallace and Gromit to show length when the man and his dog, inventors, seem to have more intelligence (or usefulness) for the latter. In this case, they have invented a machine that can capture all rabbits eating the harvest in a quiet English village. Especially for Mrs. Tottington (or 'Totty' for those who are 'intimate'), much to the chagrin of Victor Quartermaine, who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trusted rifle. Wallace and Gromit seem to have success with their machine, but Wallace has a mistaken sensation: A machine he processes for more food suddenly intersects with a rabbit - the curse runs! <br /> <br /> Much of this is about as much carefree fun as a children's movie might require, but there is also the oldest tradition of classic slapstick: Looney Tunes, which in turn is the case, owes much silent comedy and variety. Granted, the Aardman guys (Nick Park and Steve Box) have a lot more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material. It's always amazing to see them use the stop motion, even if a joke or a gag may be on the funny "ho-ho" non-funny "ha-ha" side (a tired critique, but I ' ) I say it). Curse of the Were-Rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience, in its distorted history and its sudden collapses in the exhibition (the Golden Bullet story is a fool), park and box and company never lose the joy of the material. <br /> It's blurry and warm and totally unconventional for the kids (even the youngest will love the adventures and weird gadgets, like the truck, the Wallace and Gromit pass by) adults, there are little barbs with funky, absurdist tones in the midst of a classic English farce. Only (and I'm probably a minority opinion here) is a bit of a work compared to Chicken Run - there's less of a conspiracy than a series of running gags and, of course, many puns involving bunnies, monsters and carnivals and cheese ( and terrible men with egos in the guns like the Quartermaine voiced by Fiennes). But if it sounds the best, it's one of the most entertaining films of 2005. It makes me laugh silly when it's on TV.
