I heard about this series in 2001, which a friend recorded on television every week. I never bothered to watch, though I got to know the series through the magazine I occasionally viewed in bookstores. I recently bought the first series on DVD and am fascinated by this intriguing and original series. The characters may seem unlikely at first, but it's amazing how fast they develop into a unit. When they start to take care of each other, it becomes easy to take care of what happens to them (keeping in mind that this is just a television series and they are fictitious). <br /> <br /> However, it is not the PC world of Star Trek and so, while each character shows a good quality, they all have their own bugs and demons to deal with. Individual storylines, mixed with a comprehensive story arc, make this one of the most complex and rewarding TV experiences I've ever seen. I really enjoy watching how each character interacts with each other. <br /> <br /> This strange new world we are introduced to is brilliantly portrayed by astronaut John Crichton as he learns and adapts to the other side of the galaxy, strange alien creatures, different cultures, Being hunted by a character who wants to see him dead and treated by his comrades as inferior, we can easily associate with what he must feel. As he gets used to his surroundings, it is a pleasure to see the audience and his compassionate, strong-willed and brave character. <br /> <br /> I've only seen seven episodes of Farscape's first season and I'm looking forward to continuing with seasons two through four and the mini-series. Maybe one day we can all enjoy a fifth season. Highly recommended visit, and it is worth to put the time aside. Buy and enjoy! 10/10.
