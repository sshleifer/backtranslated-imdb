"D.O.A" is a engaging and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his best; and Quaid is unfortunately one of the least used talents in Hollywood. His then Beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as usual, he does not make a big impact. <br /> <br /> The film is stylishly directed all over the world, bringing with it a range of influences that it can capture, it feels "seamless". Would you agree that it is actually headed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is excellent from the innovative camera work to the uncomplicated use of black and white photography. All these elements help to keep the processes up to date. <br /> <br /> Really the biggest thrill here is dialogue, it's nimble yet complicated, does not waste a word and still manages to be entertaining. The script is like a work of art. <br /> <br /> This went unnoticed for a long time, until I caught it late at night. If this is the first time you've heard about it, do not leave it like me! Start it soon, it's really top notch ...! <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for a solid genre film that surprises at every turn, this is the right choice. <Br /> <br />
