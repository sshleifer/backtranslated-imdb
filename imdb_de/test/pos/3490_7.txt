If you like his show, you may be a little disappointed. This movie has some very funny moments and the laughs are pretty consistent, but none is very memorable or as funny as the things on the show. The initial sequence is really very stupid and funny and a great start. Yes! Borat makes a cameo. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan, have a look! If you do not know him or do not like him, do not bother. 6.5 / 10
