Well, I have to say that I had the chance to see this show here in Philadelphia, PA, sometime in June 06. And I really loved her. My favorite Madonna look was the 1990's from Blond Ambition. This is for me "MADONNA". "Now that she is a mother of 3, she has to change a few things to suit motherhood and I totally agree." This is a classic Madonna concert. "I wish" live to tell "we did not work on it, we saw the body of buildings falling on 911 we can see a woman on the cross ... I'm definitely looking forward to the release of this tour on DVD and I hope that the whole show is unedited and with a lot of bonus footage all the time ... the best out there ... and still on top and strong .. long live MADONNA!
