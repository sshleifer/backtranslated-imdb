I just finished watching and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan to review it with the director's commentary and then in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because I'm fascinated by Christopher Nolan's newer movie Memento. The following has some similarities; This movie was probably the design for Memento. Even the music is very similar in some parts. <br /> <br /> When you record the film in black and white, it seems mysterious. The story and the dialogue are really good. The performance of the actors is credible. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget. I'm looking forward to his next release Insomnia, a big budget movie starring my favorite actor Al Pacino.
