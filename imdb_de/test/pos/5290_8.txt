I've read a lot of different opinions and reviews about this movie and I understand why many people get mixed feelings about Ponyo, whether it's the story, the animation, the dialogue, etc. I think the easiest way I can answer is that it's a movie for a much, much younger age group. An age group much younger than Tonarino Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro). <br /> <br /> As a Miyazaki fanatic like the majority of surfers on this site, I expected the wonderful animation, the musical composition and the complex storytelling, the great steady evolution of the characters, how the story connects with today's society etc. of a typical Miyazaki movie that we grew up with. And to be honest, I did not quite understand what this story was about or what the hell was going on, until an hour and twenty minutes (with twenty minutes in the movie) that this movie is NOT for the deep thinker and hard core Ghibli-ists, but for the small and young and happy Japanese. I also believe that this film is based on simplicity and creative animation. The Ghibli Studios style is straightforward. <br /> <br /> The fact that a villain is not present really surprised me, except for the father and maybe the crazy typhoon. But otherwise this movie is just fun; to stimulate the spirit of a young person and to create a good feeling for the good time. That's all. <br /> <br /> The animation goes back to the Miyazaki movies of the early 80's in the early 90's, where very specific details were not very big in contrast to Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) and the latter. I admire the simplicity that gave rise to a sort of little nostalgia when I first saw Ghibli movies like Tonarino Totoro as a kid. The reactions and movements of the children are very similar to those of the children, and a lot of body language from Studio Ghibli is very noticeable. Studio Ghibli added some creative moments and landscapes that you can only do with their wonderful entertainers, but probably the ritual Ghibli-is not in awe. <br /> <br /> The Japanese dialogue sounded very child-friendly and many scenes and dialogues are very much related to what Japanese children and mothers would say and act. The music, though very hopeful and "fluffy", could be said (like Totoro) from beginning to end. Even the darker scenes did not seem assertive. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is unique. Almost every aspect of this movie is for kids. And I waited 80 minutes to realize that. To be honest, I have never seen a movie that tells or showed like Miyazaki. It's refreshing to see that Studio Ghibli can still tell a story for a wider audience and a different scale of the audience, while retaining the typical Ghibli feel.
