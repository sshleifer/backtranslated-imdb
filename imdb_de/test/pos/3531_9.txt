It could have been unavoidable that with the onslaught of the "Slasher" movies in the early eighties, some good ones could slip through the cracks. This is a great "rare" movie by Jeff Lieberman, who assured his cult status with his memorable 70s movies "Squirm" and "Blue Sunshine". Five young people go to the Oregon mountains (this film was actually filmed on location) to camp and test the act of a country one of them has acquired. Soon they will be terrorized by a bulky murderer with an incredibly scary, gasping laugh. <br /> <br /> "Just before" is much more ambitious, "arty" and smarter than some Slasher movies. Lieberman concretizes the characters - at least two of them - as much as a 90-minute film allows. The film has real moments of tension and excitement and in fact does without graphic gore, except for a murder right at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is an above-average cast here, including Oscar winner George Kennedy, as a ranger, who has understandably become somewhat fleeting because he has been alone in the wilderness for too long. Jack Lemmon's son Chris, future Brian De Palma star Gregg Henry, blonde lead actress Deborah Benson (it's too bad she did not become a well-known performer in terms of her work here), Ralph Seymour ("Ghoulies"), Mike Kellin ("Sleepaway Camp") and Jamie Rose ("Chopper Chicks in Zombietown") complete the cast. <br /> <br /> Some of the recordings are interesting and the early music score by Brad Feidel (now known for his "Terminator" theme is haunting and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> This is for the important plot twist interesting for about an hour, even though a moment in about 75 minutes involves the heroine and a tree and the killer is almost funny, it can actually remind a viewer of a cartoon! One of the smartest accents is the final posting of the murderer that I've never met in a horror movie and probably would not see again. <br /> <br /> I did not let 10 spend 10 because I can not honestly say that I was so scared, yet it's an interesting slasher that one <br /> <br /> "This does not mean anything, son, these mountains can not read." <br /> <br /> 9/10
