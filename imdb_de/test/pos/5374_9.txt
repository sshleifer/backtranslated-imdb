The 70s were a great time for horror movies. The brotherhood of Satan is another overlooked gem. It is brimming with great surreal, disturbing scenes. It's also great, Stother Martin and L.Q. to see. Jones (who also has produced) in decent roles. <br /> <br /> Some of them are a bit old-fashioned and cheesy, but The Brotherhood of Satan beats Race over the Devil and many other Satanism movies of the 70s.
