I went to the preliminary exam of "Rory O'Shea was Here". I like this movie better than I expected because of the great cast and the powerful performance. It is a film about the friendship of two disabled young men. Rory is a young man with a free mind who wants to be independent regardless of his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers, but he can speak eloquently and help his new buddy Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I think that's enough to start a weeping drama. Well, it is. But with inspirational messages and deeply moving performances. I had to look for things in my life that I take for granted. What would I do if I could only move my two fingers? I should be grateful for what I have and what I can do. This is a good movie, though it could have been better.
