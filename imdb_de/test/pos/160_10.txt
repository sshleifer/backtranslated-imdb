Not for the squeamish, but the number of twists, the inventive use of situations in which the vampire mythology is used, beautiful visual extremes as well as interesting and bizarre characters make this movie one of the most impressive horror movies I have ever seen. It falls into maddening madness with the characters, but never seems to be exploitative or repulsive. There is plenty of bloodshed accompanied by nasty sucking and squeezing noises, as well as subtle moments of loud laughter. Meanwhile, Chan-wook Park tends to get you out of the middle of the picture, with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to force on yourself to force your involvement in the story and the characters. <br /> <br /> And there are many jumps. They adhere to the vampire myth (pun intended), have superhuman strength and can almost jump buildings in one sentence (to coin a sentence). The first time our heroine is carried by the restless vampire priest from the buildings, she has all the magical romance between Lois Lane and Superman - but this romance is increasingly disturbing - but driven by a strange and conflict-filled "love affair." not by mere horror. <br /> <br /> The acting is outstanding, especially OK-vin Kim, the gorgeous actress in the female lead role, who at 22 has a remarkable range. The character borders on a kind of black widow. It ensures that the innocent tend to incline to the demon with complete conviction. This is a really gentle and nervous performance. <br /> <br /> If you love real art in horror or are a fan of Oldboy - do not wait for the video, see it immediately.
