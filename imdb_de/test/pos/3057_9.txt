Unfortunately, I have never seen the full version of this movie. I saw the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more fluidly directed than usual at Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully extraordinary piece, packed with brilliant tracking shots through, over and in Andrejews wonderfully atmospheric sets. The well-lit blackjack photographer Andr√© Thomas is nothing but a connoisseur of connoisseurs. This imaginative visual style is enhanced by a script that allows a list of our favorite actors such as Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliant, bizarre thoroughbred characterizations. George Sanders does a brilliant job, while an eccentric millionaire (proving to be a rival racket) is played admirably by Agnes Moorehead. Patricia Roc, who learns the most about her role. The film was shot in 1949 at locations in Spain.
