An interesting look at the immigrant experience, which is told as a fable with very strange pictures. <br /> <br /> This film attracted me because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who have traveled to America. I imagine just like my grandfather did back then. I can not imagine that it was very comfortable traveling to provide ballast for the ships as shown in this movie. <br /> <br /> There were laws restricting immigrants. I would suggest that these laws were more stringent for those coming from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free of infectious diseases or hereditary diseases. In the film we see physical and mental exams, the latter because of the view that low intelligence is inheritable. Single women could not enter the country on the assumption that they would become prostitutes, so that most married single men, as previously agreed, had already been agreed before entering Ellis Island. This is the story of a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who marries a poor Sicilian (Vincenzo Amato). He tries to end his family with a dumb son and a mother (Aurora Quattrocchi), who is considered feeble-minded. By the way, she was fantastic in the role. <br /> <br /> You will also see character actor Vincent Schiavelli in his penultimate appearance. I do not know if his last movie was released. He plays a matchmaker and is also very good. <br /> <br /> It was a strange but entertaining movie. It is not for everyone, as I can imagine that those who have no interest in immigrant experience would find this rather slow.
