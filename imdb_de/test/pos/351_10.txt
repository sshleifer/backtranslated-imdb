(Warning: may include spoilers) Let Rosalina help Mario to show her way and smile, because this game will beautify your day. <br /> <br /> 120 stars require luck and skill, but 60 will bring you just as much thrill! <br /> <br /> The star shows Mario and Luigi and what travelers are now! <br /> <br /> Upside down has never been so fun, especially a final battle with Koopa near the sun! <br /> <br /> This is really a great game and it absolutely deserves a place in Nintendo's Hall of Fame!
