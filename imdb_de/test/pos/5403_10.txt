Just watched this movie in Australia via satellite. Since I avoided the US A news of armed men more than usual in the past week, to be honest, this film is a real gem. A big bravo for everyone involved. I had only a little idea of ​​what the movie was about, as it is usually the case for a good effect. The setting of the scene is literally effective, with all the hairy confronted subjects of today's world in relation to their own wavering family, albeit in a suburb. For the first forty minutes it was such a professional theater that I was not ready for the loud laughter when they came. Although the cathartic moment, which was built up by comedy and character as a family and neighbors, came together in an extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> All in all, a foresight of who and what we are. A very meaningful film and a must. <br /> <br /> Please see the date of this review.
