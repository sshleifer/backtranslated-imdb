"Tourist Trap" is a weird thriller that hit the market in the 70s. There are five friends, Molly (Jocelyn Jones), Jerry (Jon Van Hess), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), Becky (Tanya Roberts) and Woody (Kevin McDermott). SLAUSEN'S LOST OASIS, a curious and uncanny street museum, stumbles upon a closed museum. This goldmine of disintegrating but oddly life-like mannequins is run by slippers (Chuck Conners), an eccentric but seemingly harmless. Slausen has a warning for the teenagers: Stay away from Davey, Slausen's withdrawn and disturbed brother. <br /> <br /> The youngsters' curiosity brings the best of them and they go exploring. The trap has jumped! Amidst flying objects, popping doors, and self-made cloths, strengthened by a hidden power, the trap slowly joins the group. The "creature" Davey and his army of murderous mannequins make the friends fast and brutal until only one remains. <br/> <br/> Although not included in a Slasher movie, "Tourist Trap" still contains elements of Slasher films such as The Chase Scenes and Stalking and the fact that the killer wears a mask. <br /> <br /> The killer's seemingly telekinetic abilities to lock bolts and animate the wax dummies are being used with great success. The scariest thing about this film is perhaps the mannequins, which admittedly are weird enough to start with, but here they are spooky. The film succeeds despite or because of an obviously scant budget. These wax figures are distinctly plastic dummy designs - but this only gets weirder when their eyes move with an incredible man. Acting is pretty good, Chuck Conners gives a rounded and scary performance, as does Mr. Slausen, Jocelyn Jones is great as the female lead.
