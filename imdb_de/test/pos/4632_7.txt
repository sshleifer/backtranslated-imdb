This is a charming little film that, like many of its kind, derives its charm from the circumstances and not from the actual dialogue. Glenn Ford (as always) gleams in a great comedic performance Air Force officer, who after just one day was married to the gold-digger showgirl Debbie Reynolds. After the first wedding night of passion and a life-changing move to Spain, the two quickly realize that the two have nothing in common except the strong sexual attraction they feel for each other. <br /> <br /> However, if she decides to try her marriage, she thinks she only has one month trial and sex is definitely not on the cards. <br /> <br /> Ford also falls against its new $ 40,000 Lincoln Futura Concept Car (the future Batmobile), which it wins in the same draw as it meets its new wife. <The car gets unwanted attention from the Luftwaffe, which sees it as vulgar diets. American wealth and the suspicion of corruption and embezzlement, etc., put it in the tax code of 80-90%. As broke as he is, he now faces a tax bill of over $ 17,000. Not the kind of money you owe if your wife is the kind of person who spends more than $ 1,000 on a purchase. <br /> <br /> Even if he tries to sell her, it brings bad luck because he sells so much B. A cigarette or a pair of stockings for the natives before the court-martial is punishable, so you can imagine that in a transaction worth $ 17,500, the shooting committee needs to polish their rifles. His potential buyer also causes him problems. As he is a disgustingly handsome Spanish nobleman who is interested in the car, his interest in the car has led to a greater interest in Ford's wife, as evidenced by the fact that a rich jet-set lifestyle is offered, is made worse long. <br /> <br /> With Ford's sexual disappointment and jealousy in his rival love, paired with Reynolds' materialistic stance and coquettish behavior around the in love Spaniard, who drives the wedge deeper between the two, it seems as if they were whirlwind relationship is destined for the end. <br /> <br /> But whatever the love and attraction that throws these two love birds together, shines through and holds them together? <br /> <br /> Not the best example of this genre of film, but due to the observable performances according to its principles and pleasing action, it is certainly a fine one.
