The inherent problem in every production of "The Merchant of Venice" was never the pseudo-controversial anti-Semitism, but the fact that there are two narrative lines that differ greatly in sound and content. a frothy romantic comedy and a scorching tragedy. While the mixing of genres in the sixteenth century (and mocked by Shakespeare in Hamlet) was underway, the modern public rarely fails. Therefore, most directors are forced to emphasize one action at the expense of others, and it is no surprise that the decision falls into the favor of Shylock. <br /> <br /> Like so many of Shakespeare Shylock is a great, tragic hero who still fascinates after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character. Poor, proud, angry, vengeful, weak, arrogant; His behavior simply defies analysis and continues to be argued. He is flawed, not because he is a Jew, but because he is a human being. Rarely do modern scriptwriters penetrate their creations with such richly structured contradictions, and it is to the benefit of all that Shakespeare can be used as an inspiration. Shakespeare's language is wild and wandering, in several meanings saturated game and metaphor. To be understood, it must be wrestled and tamed by an actor with the strength and the knowledge to do so. When an actor fails, the words flow in a stream of incomprehensible words, but when he succeeds, the English language awakens to life with an immediacy and liveliness that takes your breath away. Al Pacino is one of those actors and here shows an incredible level of clarity and control that, if there was justice, would sweep any award on offer. He takes on the challenge of presenting Shylock directly, delivering an exceptionally subtle and nuanced performance. It would be a crime if we never had the opportunity to see what he is doing with King Lear. <br /> <br /> The supportive cast is remarkable. Jeremy Irons presents the well-known Antonio in an original way and presents an older, calmer figure, representing the unsavory contradictions between medieval chivalry and the ugly prejudices of the time. Joseph Fiennes is a revelation because it transcends a superficial feast for the eye to actually inhabit a character. Lynn Collins is the only disappointment. Many of Shakespeare's women have been contracted and require an actor to work really hard to bring them to life, and Collins' Gwyneth Paltrow incarnation seems a bit flat and inappropriate for the dark tone that Radford is aiming for must be recognized in order to create a unique and absolutely credible vision of the late Renaissance Venice. The city has not looked so threatening since "Do not Look Now". The film takes full advantage of the existing locations and the natural light and looks authentic, which is significantly enhanced by the dark and timelessly decorated costume design. All of them deserve an award. <br /> <br /> The funders of films like this one must be appreciated. With a budget of $ 30 million, they must be confident that they will never make a profit and still invest. We can all be grateful for that because the result is a remarkable adaptation that will surely be a benchmark for many years to come.
