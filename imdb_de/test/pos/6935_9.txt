Just finished with Zombie Bloodbath Part 1 on the amazing Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy DVD by CAMP Motion Pictures. Zombie Bloodbath 2: The Rage of the Undead is the next. Now I've been a bit confused here and there with some of the plot holes and confusing twists, but it's a better movie on many levels. Director Todd Sheets really shows a big leap in style and talent between the two films. Again, this is not for people who want glamor and Hollywood horror movies, but for people who like their zombies bloody, raw and grainy. As far as I could tell, these were essentially two robbers who tried to steal an elderly couple in 1945, only to find out that the couple were members of a cult. One guy is simply killed and the other, the person in charge, is basically turned into a scarecrow and crucified. They stand in the near field and still live, but die. Today's day is tight and a truckload of college kids collapses near a farmhouse. At the same time, a group of prisoners flees from a nearby prison. Both groups end in the same house. The house was the house where the elderly lived, and when one of the convicts tore down the scarecrow and took off his jacket, the scarecrow is awakened and he brings the cult members back from the dead. Impressive. And that's all in the first half hour. There is another site in the city where a few serial killers have taken some workers hostage in a deli. However, this actually works because the people trapped in the house eventually escape and end up in the same deli. Most twists work pretty well, but it's obvious that in some places the movie was just too complex to improve on. Everything ends in a big showdown. The remaining heroes find a van or something full of carnivorous bacterial vials. Of course, they throw it at the undead and cause some melting and a few heads to explode. Then we get a strange, thought-provoking end. Let me first say that while it was not always easy to follow, I still had a good time with this film. It was fun and the acting was damn good for a low budget. It was obvious that Todd Sheets really tried to bring more than a typical zombie movie to the table, and he did. It had better special effects than the first movie, great tempo and some cool music and visuals. In addition, there is a real show stopper from inside shots of a mouth while a knife pushes through it. Here care was taken and that shows. The weakness lies in the script and in some lazy performances. Again, I recommend listening to the commentary. It was even better than the first and I learned a lot. Like finding out that some of the scenes were filmed on Super 8 movie and the film was ruined from the lab and could not use them. And they had already edited the movie when they got it back. Some of the confusion comes from some scenes that are not in the movie. I also learned that Todd Sheets really has a passion and passion for making horror movies. It shows. The film is a good example of no budget cinema that would have rewritten even more, but still with more style than most DV films I see. Not quite as funny as the first movie, although technically a better movie. I truly admire Sheets as one of the true innovators and pioneers of DV cinema ... and this is a great addition to the cheap zombie genre!
