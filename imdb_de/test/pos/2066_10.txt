Definitely a movie for people who only ask for entertainment and do not think too much about their films. <br /> <br /> Lots of action, lots of great dialogues (eg fun citing), a little intrigue and everything that explodes in the air. Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent but not bloody. The fact that the female part was the competent leader is a pleasant turn of events. <br /> <br /> Have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy enough to bring it into my favorite movies 3 or 4 months. I originally rented the movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the movie but was involved in the events surrounding Samantha's search for her memory and never looked back. <br /> <br /> All the Cerebral people out there - Once again, disbelieve, take less seriously - you can even have fun!
