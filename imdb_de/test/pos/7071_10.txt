Excuse me if I am wrong, but "Cronica para un desayuno" could for many reasons be one of the biggest films in Mexican film history. We can get many ingredients for a perfect Mexican family breakfast: a cup of Buñuel's surrealistic designs with a few drops of Ripstenian sceneries; a pound of phallic symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity, more than Todd Solondz's Happiness and the Dogma Movement Movies. There is a lot of filth, black humor, suppressed dreams (Teodoros dream of the fly), incestuous uncontrolledness (the relationship between Marcos and Luzma), meaningless parallel stories, discrete violence, anachronisms and a small sign of hope (highlighted in Luzma, the homecoming of the husband and "Un poco Mas" as leitmotif). Marcos (Bruno Bichir) is a charming character (I think in the Bukoskian way), the king without crown, who expects nothing, but broken noses. Luzma (Maria Rojo), the lovable woman, stretched out many faces, but she was only worried that her sons would have breakfast. She is in many ways a loser and sensual, but you will fall in love with her. The resistance of the soundtrack (too many woods) feeds on the lack of technical advantages, of course intentionally: blurred shots, overexposed close-ups (in introspective scenes), dizzying pans and sudden edits. "Crónica" is a bit hard to digest, it gets stuck in the throat and everything helps. It tastes bitter like a tainted orange juice and sour like run-down milk, but you want to enjoy it. I therefore recommend getting some Melox before the show as you will not get hungry.
