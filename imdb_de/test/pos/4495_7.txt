Two young friends grow up together in Afghanistan. Their life events are driving them apart and one of them has been living in the USA for many years. When he receives a call, it is clear that he must return, because there is trouble in the air. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about lifelong friendships, mistakes and goodbyes. But also a movie about darkness, pain and endurance. From the enjoyable young days of growing up and playing, to falling apart, to playing games. This is a slow movie, but not too slow. <br /> <br /> It's about emotions and that's just right for a drama, but for my taste it's a bit too much. This makes it too much of a tearjerker who loses some of the quality it carries. It's still good, but not fantastic. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 dragons ran aground
