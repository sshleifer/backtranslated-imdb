Well done. That's how I would describe this animated Scooby Doo adventure. This is the best animated Scooby movie I've ever seen. I liked the story. I thought she had some depth. The movie is also good paced.it will not get bored for a minute. It also has an interesting group of characters (apart from Scooby and Shaggy and the gang of course) and the movie was a real treat. I have a lot of fun watching. I also liked the great Scottish music. It was very catchy and contagious. Of course we know that Scooby and the Gamg will solve the puzzle, but it's still fun to reach that point. The animation is also pretty good for this movie I love it when they've done a 3D animation Scooby adventure, but we'll just have to wait. For me, Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness Monster is a 7/10
