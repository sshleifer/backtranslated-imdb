I would buy this and "Thirty Seconds Over Toyko" today if available. I also saw this movie after seeing 12 years old big billboards by Jack Webb in his dress blues on the highway. Always admires Jack Weeb as John Wayne-type and American. Almost a marine only because of this film, but served for 32 years in the Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Army. Have not seen this movie on TV and would like to own it on DVD. At least if it was on TV, I would copy it to VHS and use it until it is available on DVD. I also have a large collection of World War II films and the Korean War, and I'm always looking for new releases on DVD.
