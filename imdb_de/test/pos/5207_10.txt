If we compare the film industry to an ocean, we tend to only observe the surface. Driven by the strong Hollywood marketing force, we saw all war movies like Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. But under the sparkling waves grow silently, now and then less well-known pearls. If you choose one and look carefully, you wonder why this pearl is almost unknown and why it is not already on the crown. <br/> <br/> "Stalingrad" is such a gem. Why does it have a number of actors with several million dollars? No, there are a thousand extras? No, it has stunning, spectacular, shiny computer-aided visual effects. Not at all. What is so special? Well, in one word, it is the pure past that was transformed into celluloid and transmitted fifty years later. The tragedy of the bloodiest battle of history is here. Dirty, wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who had lost everything during the invasion, burned villages, collapsed buildings, destroyed suburbs, firearms, explosions, tanks in flames, soldiers shot dead, burned alive, crushed or shredded by tanks in their shafts - all. But the real horror is elsewhere. People are reduced to simple farmers without the power to change anything. The soldiers we follow in the movie try to leave the combat zone and they fail. The civilians are in the middle of nowhere in prostration and cry only that their children are killed. Mercyless, the huge grinding machine of war, is melting people, equipment, villages, cities - and repeatedly demanding sacrifice and destruction. In this collective madness, a group of German soldiers are struggling to survive and at least a minimum of normalcy. They are doing their duty and fighting bravely. But as everyone knows, a struggle is almost lost when people start to lose their faith and faith. We see how all these people are left, how they want to leave, how they want to reach the last plane to Berlin (full of wounded), how seriously injured soldiers were treated as simulants and shot as they were forced to do so a small group of Russian civilians, including a small boy, who later discovered a place that is literally filled to the limit of food and drink - of course only to a few "superior" officers. One by one they fall dead. The end of the film is one of the bitterest, most depressing and most touching I've ever seen, all on the great score of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The war has destroyed everything that is in its way. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must for everyone. A real movie lover should have it in his collection. The strong anti-war message must be a warning to us all. Unfortunately, humanity never learns the politicians. Self-destruction is in our DNA and human pain seems to stop forever. Can we be reasonable enough to stop the war?
