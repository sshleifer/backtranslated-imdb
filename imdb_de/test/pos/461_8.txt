Very learned, intelligent drama about a group of international travelers who had been captured by the Russian Communist regime in 1956 in Hungary. Kerr and Robards play lovers, she is a British Baroness, a Hungarian freedom fighter trying to make his contribution to his country. Other New York City Theater Stars Anne Jackson & E G Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two young sons, including Ronny Howard in his screen debut. Jackson's character is enormously pregnant and unwilling to give birth in a soon-to-be communist country; In the third act of this film, which introduces the naturalistic acting styles that we have come to know today from Redgrave, Fonda & Streep, she gives a passionate plea. Yul Brynner leads the pack of Soviet wolves, he's great as a commander and at his sexiest since he played Kerr in "The King and I". He is mean and evil and terribly conflicted by his attraction to the lovely, patrician & heroic Kerr. This is one of the great transitional films of the second half of the Golden Age of American cinema. Do not miss.
