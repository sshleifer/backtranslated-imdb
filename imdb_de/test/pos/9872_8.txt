This sequel is brilliant and is the last film Donald Pleasance (Dr.Loomis) has worked on before his death. I loved the new direction the movie took with the story, rather than just Michael Myers, who wanted to kill his family. I love this whole series, and apart from the first and second films, this is by far the best.
