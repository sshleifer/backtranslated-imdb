Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody of Mel Brooks. His job is to fake the legacy of Robin Hood and a few films that deal with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes plays as Robin Hood. He is looking for some good men who join him to overthrow the nasty sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the beautiful hand of Maid Marian. Robin is also involved with Prince John (Richard Lewis). Tracey Ullman plays the lead role as Prince John's personal witch latrine, who has the sheriff in mind. Will Robin find his happy men? How far will the prince go if his father is not there? Why does the sheriff hate Robin so much? To find out, you have to see ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS !! Watch the funny cameo of Dom De Luise playing the Duke of Jersey. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
