I saw this movie because Joaquim de Almeida was there. Joaquim had a pretty small role, so it was good that I liked the movie alone. In fact, I really liked it! <br /> <br /> The film revolves around two characters, Albert and Louie. Albert is a shy, withdrawn guy, and Louie ... well, Louie is not. The story revolves around Louie's request to Albert to let him stay with Albert for a short time. Louie has just been released from prison. <br /> <br /> Albert and Louie have known each other since childhood, and when they do something together there is trouble and it's Albert who always has to take the overthrow. <br /> The action of the movie is based on the adventures that result from Louie's visit. On The Run is a chronicle of crazy situations. However, Bruno de Almeida and screenwriter Joseph Minion (After Hours) do not always take you where you expect. There are twists and turns that give depth to this film. Of course, there are a lot of comic comedies, but there is also a subtle sense of humor here. <br /> <br /> There are also really good services here. Albert is wonderfully played by Michael Imperioli. He knows these days from the HBO series The Sopranos. Louie is played by John Ventimiglia, who gives his character a lovable, childlike quality. (No matter what he does, you just have to love Louie!). Both actors are outstanding in their individual characters. With Imperioli you want to hug him and bring him home to Mama. Ventimiglia, well, you do not know if you should hit him or bring him home (and NOT to mom!). <P> <br /> <br /> There are other outstanding achievements as well. The character of Rita is played by Drena DeNiro (yes, Robert's daughter). The audience worshiped her. Talking to the others who saw the movie, it was funny to discuss whether it was Albert or Louie who had their favorite of these two. But everyone loved Rita! <br /> <br /> Is this movie perfect? No, I can not say that. Many times I wish the director had a bigger budget. There were scenes that called for more budgetary freedom. (Give this man a decent budget to work with, and I think you'll see a movie that will get you up and stand out.) <br /> <br /> The end sequence was a bit of a budget Victim. But budget or no budget, the end of the screenshot in my opinion brought the talent of actor and director to a memorable, emotionally effective scene. <br /> <br />
