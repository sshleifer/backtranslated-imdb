Cute Movie Feels good. I had never heard of this movie, but found it in search of a rental property. I had high hopes that this film is based solely on Flex. I never saw him in something that was not worth it. It is true that this film was delivered to me. I enjoyed the story. The movie is full of great actors and actresses. The funny Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and of course Tangi Miller. I really liked this movie. I did not rate it as five stars because it did not discuss certain issues that I thought the movie should be detailed. The problem seems to have been resolved, but I would have appreciated a discussion about the solution to the problem. I liked the movie so much that I buy it now after having already rented and seen it.
