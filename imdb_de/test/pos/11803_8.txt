"The Cure" is a very touching and moving drama. The film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends. One of the boys has AIDS. The boys are first good friends, despite Erik's concern. The film shows the boys' journey to discover the "healing" that takes place in Ohio, according to The National Examiner, and how it affects their relationship. Acting is wonderful (I've never done Annabella Sciorra better), and the movie is just touching. I could not stop crying with the shoe scene. That's a good tearjerker. Keep the Kleenex nearby. 8.10
