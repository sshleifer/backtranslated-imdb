This was really a tense and dark episode. "Ice" is one of my favorite episodes. Along with 'Pusher', 'Grotesque', 'Wetwired' and 'Home' (which in my case are quite good in a dark atmosphere.) It seems quite realistic to me that their paranoia, their suspicions and their ever-growing anger from the greats actors were perfectly executed. However, "Ice" had a problem that I had overcome after a few clocks: IT WAS TOO SHORT! I wanted more! <br /> <br /> All in all, 'ice' had 98% of all X-Files episodes: excellent acting, intense story writing, tight directing. All works. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
