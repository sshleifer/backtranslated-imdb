This film has the courage to point out that it is best to just accept your life as it is and still smile. As someone more excited about taking control of his life and moving forward, I felt slapped in the face, but that's okay: I do not have to agree with a movie to love him and to respect. Great show by Streep and Hurt and all the others really and some wonderfully bizarre scenes. A serious movie. And take a handkerchief.
