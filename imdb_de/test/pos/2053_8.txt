A wonderful Christmas story on the moving theme "Susie Homemaker finds her inner Amazon". No I'm serious! Geena Davis's amnesia begins to improve when she is hit on the head. From this known beginning, we are moving in an unexpected direction. Good pace, good action, funny story, lots of explosions and chaos.
