Excellent story, wonderful drama, amazing production values ​​and a cool, action packed shorts with a perfect twist at the end. What a great short film! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and loved it. Then I saw it again at another festival (where it won again) and I was even more impressed, because subtle touches are noticeable the second time around - for a short film this packs a lot of clever shifts in a short time. <Br /> <br /> AWOL is not for the faint-hearted, but it's very well done and absolutely stunning for a short movie - actually for any movie. It's an interesting story that's very well told, and each scene moves the story, showing that good instincts of filmmaking came about when creating this movie. The movie looks great and David Morse is also stunning, with a dynamic performance in every scene. Seeing his character try to defeat the life of curveballs is a great viewing experience. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that when war torture is in the headlines every day, the lines between reality are good and evil can become very gray as the rhetoric gets loud and tries to do things black and white. AWOL allows the audience to decide for themselves what the message is, what is real and what is not, what complements the mystery. <br /> <br /> Both times, when I saw it, the audience WAY was more into this movie than the others who play with it, which says a lot. There are a lot of short films at the moment, but only a few provide all of the great and complex topics that AWOL offers. <br /> <br /> It sounds to me as if the previous reviewer has left his rocker, or has a personal agenda, because this is really a great example of short, independent films. I see a lot of short films, and I have to say that if only ALL the short films that make up the festival rounds were that good THEN the short film business would have some serious legs.
