I've read the comments on Las Vegas and agree with some of them, it's not brain surgery TV, but on the other hand, I got the impression that TV was mainly for escapism, especially what's going on in the world today. Let's face it, a show about Vegas (which is not a reality-based program) is not a reality because Vegas is pure fantasy for me! It's the kind of place we can go and do pretty much what we want, if we want (of course with money!) Reflecting that everything seems to be on the money in my eyes. If you do not like it, do not look that we have a million channels for it! <br /> <br /> We are coming to the third episode here in the UK and I know that I will do it make a beeline to see it again. I just hope it's not canceled, which is reasonably decent at most shows that arrive in the UK! (Firefly and Jake 2.0 anyone? !!). <br /> <br /> It's harmless, it looks great and every time I look at it I want to go back to reality :)
