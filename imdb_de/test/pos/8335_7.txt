After the business coup of 1941, Max and Dave, the Brothers Fleischer were removed from Paramount Pictures Corporation from their own studio. Former employees such as Seymour Kneitel and Izzy Sparber were hired to design the new facility, which has now been renamed Paramount to Famous Studios. The finished product of Famous was early on indistinguishable from the recent production of butchers. The existing series (Popeye, Superman) continued as if nothing had happened at all. <br /> <br /> Today's theme, JAPOTEURS, is one of Famous Studio's former SUPERMAN shorts. <br /> <br /> The custom, the SUPERMAN cartoons were a great combination of fine, well-designed music in the score. This applies to both the theme (overture) and the background music (background music). It was when every cartoon had its own background music, since everything was kept fresh, seemingly being re-recorded with each image. <br /> <br /> With JAPOTEURS we must remember that this was filmed during the first year The involvement of the United States and the characterization of the enemy were very stereotyped, short-lived and downright evil. The dialogue and personality of the malignant Japanese saboteurs came strictly from the root letters of the old Pulp magazine stories, each word said in a sarcastic, totally disingenuous courtesy, as the characters displayed their cold-bloodedness while making the most demonic of them Threats and outrageous actions against the occidental world. <br /> <br /> JAPOTEURS is visually bright and uplifting, breathtaking and uses some multi-plane or table animations to give the flying sequences a real depth. <br /> <br /> makes the connections between the cartoons well, the SUPERMAN Radio Show was then heard through the Mutual Broadcasting Network; The cartoon closely resembles the comics page and uses the same talents of voice actors Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander from the radio show. <br /> <br /> WE rate him with a *** star. <br /> <br /> POODLE CARVING !!
