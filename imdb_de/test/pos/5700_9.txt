What a wonderful documentary - I thought this would be a remake of the bitchy stories told in Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, but it's indeed a clear, glorious celebration of a strange and twisted era that has truly made some great Movies. What struck me was the lack of bitterness that showed in the directors' interviews, as the movie business is now pretty annoying. Instead, folk like Friedkin and Coppola seem to shine their eyes positively on their glory days. The footage of an audience that came out of a daytime performance of the exorcist was priceless. "It was - traumatic," says one man. A great epitaph for the late Ted Demme, an exciting movie, I just wish it was longer - I could have made a three-hour cut of it.
