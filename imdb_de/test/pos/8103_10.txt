"The Great Dictator" is probably one of Charlie Chaplin's most famous films. It is notorious for its stark satire of Adolf Hitler and National Socialism. Until I saw it, all I knew was that it was famous. Now I know how much the movie deserves. <br /> <br /> The film essentially shows the achievements of the somewhat awkward, ambitious, short-tempered and impressive dictator of Tomania, Adenoid Hynkel; and with him, his close and dear staff: Field Marshal Herring and Mr. Garbitsch. It also includes the exploits of an amnesic, emotional and often awkward Jewish barber, a veteran of the First World War. When I stop the plot, I want to say that this movie has different qualities, making it both unique and wonderful. While the comedy is decidedly verbal as well as slapstick and casual, the entirety of the film shows how serious it takes Nazism or aggressive nationalism as a subject with various interludes. Chaplin's flawless acting skills go far and wide in the film, he keeps spinning it up and down until it just explodes. Paulette Goddard's position as an ambitious Jewish revolver and Henry Daniell's delivery of a nasal, calm-as-dead-heavy-as-a-heart assault line provide a wonderful view. <br /> <br /> One aspect of the movie is what makes it so special: it does not hit you. It is not "hidden", it has no shop that is hidden. It is an "open", obvious, obvious renunciation of Hitler and National Socialism. <br /> <br /> To summarize, have a look. Just look at it, you'll see.
