You can take the rascal out of the joint, but it seems much harder to take the joint out of the crook. We've seen this kind of character in this situation before (and since): in movies like BOB LE FLAMBEUR, LIFE ON THE GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, THE ANDERSON TAPES, etc. Too many times to be mentioned. What helps make this one of the most notable is, of course, the robbery itself, which is wordless in real-time, and the behavior of the leadership. Bogart would think twice before crossing this guy. The ironic ending fits in perfectly with this story (it almost demands it). All around one of the better films Noir.
