I played this movie all the time this month and I just love it. I was in the 60s (ooh), so in a sense it's nostalgic. However, it is the funny premise, the lively dialogues and the great performances that keep me watching. <br /> <br /> Dr. Winston's reactions to Stephanie at the end of the film are priceless. (I would be more specific, but I do not want to ruin it for anyone.) Who else but Matthau can play a man who is not quite on the level and still loves him? As far as Bergman's costumes go, I think she looks as stupid as she should. I think, "she was robbed" when she once appears in an evening gown. It does not suit her at all, which is too bad. I never liked it when I saw her for the first time and I still do not know. <br /> <br /> Goldie won an Oscar for her role. People thought it was a groundbreaking idea at the time, and yet it's the one achievement that I do not love as much as the others. She has the right amount of sweetness and sympathy, which is important for this role. <br /> <br /> And I agree - I thought Rick Lenz was great and it's too bad his film career was not like that. After that, it can not go away anymore. <br /> <br /> I hope more people see this movie ... they will love it!
