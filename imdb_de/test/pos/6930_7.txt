To suspect that this movie two actors (Caine and Moran) is trying to cheat a gangster. The plot is weak at best, as there are multiple plots everywhere. However, this should not normally matter because the comedy should wear such a movie. There are some really funny pieces (mostly provided by Dylan Moran). At other times, however, there are long melodramatic scenes that add nothing to the movie. Caines character seemed to me exaggerated. Especially at the beginning he constantly quotes Shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor. You could say that he played the role right, but the character seemed flat and unviable. Overall, I would say only if a fan of the actors involved. Otherwise, wait for video or TV.
