Before I saw this picture, I was pretty skeptical. I do not like movies with agenda or appreciate it when I'm scared to think like the author. I also feared that this would be like the 2-part miniseries "10.4", which had a far-fetched concept, little relation to the real world and very bad execution. In the beginning it says: "This film is fiction, but the events presented and the information on British contingency planning are based on extensive research"; and the general feeling is that you are not sold on an idea, but that you receive a lesson in civilian awareness. The conveyed message is obvious from the beginning: it comes and we are not prepared. The use of real-world locations and a scenario that can not just happen - there are plans to do so when it does - all of this adds to the disturbing impact that the movie itself will have on the most cynical spectators. The perspective of the film is that of society, and it stays away from heartbreaking personal moments that do not convey the message, so we're not used to the Romeo-Juliet drama.
