I saw for the first time the opening of Otto Preminger's "Porgy and Bess" on television, probably in the early 80's, and my younger self, despite the timeless music, found it a bit slow. I turned it off. <br /> <br /> Last night was a very rare, glued together print that was shown at the US Cinematheque, and it was a little revelation. The performances are strong and memorable. Dorothy Dandridge brings a lot of vulnerability, strength and subtle eroticism (at least by today's standards) into her role. Sidney Poitier is said to be uncomfortable with the film, but his performance is great, as is Pearl Bailey. Even better is Sammy Davis than the amoral, cat-like Sportin 'Life and Brock Peters as the malicious tyrant. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I'm not a fan of Preminger's earlier, Bleierndem - and much easier see - "Carmen Jones". Porgy and Bess "is far superior to the less controversial film - though this may be due to the fact that the source material is also far superior. <br /> <br /> As seen yesterday, this is a solid but far from perfect Making work: not all moments come alive, and the way the film mixes the obviously stylized Catfish Row sets (beautifully created by Oliver Smith) with the actual locations is a bit awkward, even on my inexperienced ear, some short sections of the score seem to be overly popular. <br /> <br /> Also, this does not affect the filmmaker's performance - Premingers' decision to film almost exclusively in large settings without close-ups and occasional medium-length shots certainly made it on television "cluttered," "panned, and scanned," and could even fail to make widescreen DVDs if it gets the restoration it deserves. On smaller screens, we can not see the many details are crucial to the staging of Preminger. <br /> <br /> Also the mi x heard last night was weird. Many of the vocals, especially at the opening of "Summertime," were inappropriately soft and overwhelmed with instrumental music. Maybe this can be remedied in a restoration. <br /> <br /> There is the racial politics of the film. Personally, I do not see anything wrong with that, at least in a contemporary context. By the time so few films showed strong African-American characters, this seemed an unfortunate choice for a big-budget Hollywood movie. And while there may not be much "empowerment" here, these are identifiable people who are not racial stereotypes. These are opera characters that make bad decisions because they do tragic figures. That alone made it a huge step forward. <br /> <br /> In a modern context where strong and heroic African American characters are less rare (though they are not common enough yet), these characters are no more and no less than human. They could be really poor and educated people with any ethnic background. <br /> <br /> Apart from the thorny politics, the original work is undoubtedly one of the truly great achievements of American music and (secondary) theater. Poitier, Davis, Dandridge, Peters and, yes, Pearl Bailey, were all amazing performers we'll never see again. This less than perfect, yet solid movie deserves to be clearly seen and appreciated.
