Historical drama is one of the areas where the British are simply unbeatable. Although I'm not a big fan of the genre, I can usually be persuaded to see something if it's British and with decent actors. Of course I should do something. So I did not really know what to expect. I had heard that there would be a lesbian love story, but not much else. Looking at it, I found it much more interesting than I expected. Without too much to say, the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected and well done. Although there were almost too many turns, it took a minute for everything to clear. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is decent, although I found it a bit slow in the last half hour. This may just be me, I usually have a problem with dragging movies after the plot is more or less finished. All in all, these are pretty pleasant three hours. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in historical dramas.
