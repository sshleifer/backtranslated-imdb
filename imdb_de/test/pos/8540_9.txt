The box in my video library is the reason why I rented it. It looked cool when the boys' faces were cut in half, so of course I had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually saw that it was an "Evil Dead" fan. The Swedish manufacturers must have been fans, and they have included many references in this masterpiece. A criminal attempts to invade the house. Evil Ed has cut the movies that ultimately drive him insane and says "groovy" as he looks at his gun just like Bruce Campbell did when he finished his chainsaw in Evil Dead 2. Many of the posters in this movie were throughout the house and scattered in the office. They're not just pretending to be Evil Dead, because there's a Gremlin-style doll monster that Ed is pushing in his fridge. My personal favorite is when he chases his wife through the house and says "I'm coming to get you Barbra". If you do not know, Barbraas Brothers is the main line in "Night of the Living Dead". This movie has pretty much all the action, cool characters, funny stuff (Gremlin doll), scary stuff (demon doctor), great effects (exploding head) and a lot of female nudity. I only gave him a 9 because his style is slow before Ed goes insane, but it's well worth the wait. So if you liked "Evil Dead 2" or any of the other movies I mentioned above, you need to do it with a friend and watch it, and when you're done, try "Brain Dead" because I hear that it resembles this masterpiece. <br /> <br />
