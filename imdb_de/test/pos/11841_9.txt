This movie is more entertaining for me and my wife than all the Bloc Buster's violent thriller / mystery / murder movies. It's about real people who make the most of their lives. They happen to be Indian and the main characters are law enforcement agencies. The realistic drama and grand scenery more than make up for the somewhat implausible plot. The soundtrack comes from BC Smith, who also did the soundtrack for Coyote Waits, and is great. Adam Beach plays a police officer who is a bit prone to accidents, and Wes Studi is the stoic, fully professional detective. Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, etc. There are many other good roles that are either support or cameo roles. We also saw Coyote Waits, another adaptation of a Hillerman novel, and we enjoyed it a lot.
