Overall, a successful movie. There were the parts that made me wince, and there were the parts where I threw up my hands, but I got a little more away when I went in there. <br /> <br /> I think the movie suffers from some serious exaggerated ambition. Without spoiling it, I would like to say that the obvious evidence of the Ramayana ordeal goes far beyond what this film stands for. The Ramayana is an epic. No 200-page book in which women in India are crushed. The film is about two girls who are married to a very distinct Indian family. While the basic principles of the "unwritten laws of family tradition" seem to be those of conservative India, I would like to assure my reader that, after living in Delhi for 12 years, I have found whole parts that do not ring these bells. I mean some things and some actions are very true, but a few other things are just wrong. Especially today. <br /> <br /> Delhi is complicated. India is complicated. The director tries to simplify both. And it fails quite miserably. <br /> <br /> Why in English? Can you imagine a movie about Indians in English? Or French in English. Seriously shocking. Even the servant spoke fluent accented English (but with a touch of colloquialisms in the language of "credibility"). But the chemistry between the leaders is tangible. If you like it hot, this is a movie for you. I think that's the biggest salvation - the development of a true love story. <br /> <br /> If this movie was about Radha and Sita, he would have gotten full marks from me. And when it came to her, she could have made a subtle statement. But this movie goes out to say that this is India, and so is Indian society. And in this regard, it is as successful as it fails. Just take everything you see with a pinch of salt. The dark secrets of India are not revealed. Only two girls fall in love. As it happens everywhere else.
