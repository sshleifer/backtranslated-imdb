This is one of my cheap vampire B movies of all time. Calvin Klein underwear model ... oh, I mean, Stefan the Good Vampire, returns to Transylvania to ascend the throne of the Vampiric Royale, but the manicure-impaired and ever-drooling half-brother Radu has other plans. After killing her father, the vampire king, Radu now turns to Stefan, Stefan's new mortal friend Michelle and her two pretty friends and the almighty Bloodstone. <br /> <br /> Okay, the scenery is beautiful and it should be like it was filmed on-site in Transyl-fricken-vania for heaven's sake. The actresses are not a big shock and Stefan the heroic vampire is about as charming as a chimney chimney, but who cares? There is only one reason to watch this movie and its name is RADU! He is a physical tribute to Nosferatu and has the best lines in the film, all spoken in the scratchy voice of a man who smokes ten packets of cigarettes a day. The graveyard scene of the cemetery is one of the best scenes in the movie as Radu slowly approaches the camera and makes his grinning, drooling face visible to the world. I cheered him as he gathered the victims and mocked his perfect brother. But maybe I'm just a sicko. Aside from the dubious taste of the men, I recommend this movie to vampire lovers. It's original, it's fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I've seen in a long time ... much more fun than the stiff, tragic and howling undead brats that nowadays adorn the horror movies endlessly. Radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. He is what a vampire should be.
