With a title seemingly better suited to a Looney Tunes feature than a grisly Giallo, "Do not Torture a Duckling" (1972) is still a Level A thriller by horror maestro Lucio Fulci. In this case, someone strangled the adolescent boys in a rural, southern Italian village, and there are many suspects typical of these Gialli. There's Barbara Bouchet (Patrizia). She looks more terrible than you've ever seen her, a rich girl hiding after a drug scandal. Florinda Bolkan (Martiara), the local epileptic voodoo woman; her witchcraft practicing Beau; Giuseppe, the local idiot; the sweet-faced priest; his grumpy mother; and on and on. The film contains some unusually violent set pieces, including a chain whip of one of the main characters in a cemetery (one of the most realistic bloody sequences I've ever seen) and a skilful dukeout when the killer is finally revealed. The violent outbursts of the film compensate for the fact that there is no real fear or tension to talk about. Nevertheless, this Giallo fascinates with its unusual rural scenery, disturbing child murders, peculiar characters and a fancy score by Riz Ortolani. The film was beautifully photographed on the Monte Sant'Angelo near the Adriatic Sea in southern Italy (at least the city's police are thanked in the final credits). And though subtitles would have made this good-looking DVD even better (American slang can not convince in this rural Italian setting), Anchor Bay is another good work to thank. Oh ... this title makes perfect sense!
