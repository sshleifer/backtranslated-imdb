Crossfire is still one of the best Hollywood commercials because, in contrast to the admirably intended Gentleman's Agreement, which struck her for a few months in front of the cinemas, she decides to send her message in the form of an excellent noir thriller instead To say an outraged star: It's because I'm Jewish, right? "It's a lot easier to convey the message that hatred looks like a loaded weapon when the corpses are real and not metaphorical." Somewhat shamefully, the short feature on Warner's DVD does not mention that the writer Richard Brooks filmed the movie because of the Shifting from a homophobic murder to an anti-Semitic murder has denied, but it is interesting to note that the victim is mainly killed is Jewish, there is little doubt about Sam Levene's performance, that the figure is actually gay too - no pesky cartoon, but In his scenes with George Cooper's confused soldier, there is definitely an aspect with two lost souls.The killer is no mystery: even though the killing is done in classic noir shadows, the body language of the killer is instantly recognizable, but then the characters drift ahead half the point to the same conclusion: The tension arises when you use it rejects and saves the guy. <br /> <br /> There is an element of Ealing Films for the soldiers who band together to get their buddy out of a fix (you might almost see this aspect as a blueprint for Hue and Cry), but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir. In a long, sultry night, the movie has a great look with deep, dark blacks and shadows created both from the business and the style (it shortens the lighting time and allows the director Edward Dmytryk more time with the actors Outstanding performers make the most of the fine script: a relaxed but quietly charismatic Robert Mitchum, the Maigret-style detective by Robert Young, Gloria Grahame's trample, and the ever-scary Paul Kelly as her compulsive liar-lover, a man who seeks stories the way other people try ties. But the lasting impression is of Robert Ryan's outstanding achievement as a guy who can deal with a good goodbye alone as he does his best to help the falsely accused man into death row. A big surprise hit in 1946, as a reward, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott from the HUAC were investigated, which itself had a notable tendency to attack Jews. So much for the crusade?
