When I saw this for the first time on tape, about ten years after its release, I thought it was one of the better James Bond movies. However, after seeing it again at the turn of the century, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think it's just a bit overrated just because the critics were so happy that Sean Connery had ended his 12-year break with Bond that they did not dare to criticize the movie. I think what disappointed me was the end. After spending two hours in the movie, expect a less hokey, more satisfying ending. And it may be a bit fussy, but I was disappointed that I did not see the regular actors in the supporting roles like Miss Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter, and so on. <br /> <br /> On the positive side there were many Especially early, unique action scenes and the two bad guys were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was the more interesting of the two, because he was so unobtrusive and the "nice guy next door" saw. He was not a normal Bond villain. <br /> <br /> This had a lot of skin for a PG movie, especially with Kim Basinger, who was never an actress known to hide her figure. The language was very tame, but most bond films are pretty good in this department. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a "fair" bond and nothing else. Just because Connery is there does not mean it's automatically good. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan have proven they can play the role well too.
