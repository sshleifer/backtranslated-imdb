Over the past few months, I've seen a lot of reviews for The Italian Job, many of them negative. Almost all of these pessimistic criticisms are that, despite its modernist bravura and high-budget technology, the film does not have much substance where it counts. Guys, it's just a funny movie. This is the type of picture where you want to sit back, relax and just enjoy the movie's ever-moving tempo. As with Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can focus on the characters and the plot at the same time, without much thought (luck for some of us). Granted, "Ocean" is a better movie, but who cares? The plot may have some holes (there is a huge hole in about 3/4 of the way), the action may not be as satisfyingly unsatisfactory as the trailers did, and some dialogues may seem pointless and cheesy, but again, who cares really? Cool Characters, Mini Coopers, Big Explosions, Charlize Theron. What more do you want? I think it's time to drop the fake Roger Ebert and play Gene Shalit. Oh, and anything else you do, do not compare it to the original, because to repeat what F. Gary Gray has said to the press more than a million times, THIS IS NO REMAKE !! My advice: If you are interested in getting annoyed by a good-humored, funny movie, you should not even see The Italian Job. But if you do not have a serious inferiority complex and / or want to be driven mad by a bunch of Ukranians, go ahead. The conclusion, my fellow travelers, is: brighten and have fun, dammit.
