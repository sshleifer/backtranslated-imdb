As a seasoned fan of Italian thriller and directors Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado, I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hack. I had seen The Beyond, which I think is overrated. I thought the New York Ripper was just horrible and I did not like The House By the Cemetery very much. These three films made me come to the conclusion that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers. However, my stubbornness was prevalent and I had to see more of his films. The City of the Living Dead was a movie that I found very interesting, but Do not Torture a Duckling is almost a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Murdered in a small town on the Italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young men live The authorities do not know who is behind these crimes, especially after their prime suspect has been cleared. An eager young reporter and a pretty nasty girl (seducing young men) investigate the matter and finally get to the bottom of it. <br /> <br /> Brilliant atmosphere, combined with a good story and a good cast (not always the case) with Italian thrillers of the 70s) make Do not Torture a Duckling a crackling good thriller. The plot is well built, not easy to figure out and the finish is very satisfactory. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant community and creates very strong visual effects, especially in a scene where a woman is beaten to death by some locals. Fulci's social commentary on religion and innocence is pretty nervous and every aspect is treated well. When you think of his zombie flicks and his extremely violent New York Ripper ripper, it's amazing how well he balances his criticism with explicit violence and makes it even stronger. So far I have not seen such a professionally produced Fulci movie like this. <br /> <br /> Although not a traditional Giallo movie, Duckling has many of the genre's hallmarks. Fulci shows complete control of the format, only once with an unconvincing Gore moment overboard, but overall he seems even better at puzzle-making than full-blown Gore epics. The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really grab a punch. <br /> <br /> So far, folk duckling is not Fulci's best movie, in my opinion, by far. Edgy's social comment combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling, good secret.
