"Big Fat Liar" is welcome - flat but welcome - fresh air after too many movies with baths, body fluids, pets on acid, gaseous jokes and gag. After all, "See Spot Run", "Max Keeble's Big Move" and "Snow Dogs" signaled The Degenerative Spiral of Kiddie Movie Making. Even worse is the realization that the younger audience will later be fed up with the less well thought-out offerings of "Not Another Teen Movie" and "Slackers". The film was written by Nickelodeon producers Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who happened to be in the 80s sitcom "Head of the Class"). Frankie Muniz is the star of the Jason movie, always ready to get out of the mess. (Where is the English newspaper? Dad choked on a Swedish meatball.) His teacher (Sandra Oh) makes an ultimatum: turn the paper off until the end of the day or attend the summer school. Jason picks up a story called "Big Fat Liar" and is hit on the way to school by a limousine carrying the insensitive Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Wolf takes him away, but Jason leaves his paper behind. No one will hear the truth this time, and Dad tells him he has lost his trust. Months later, Jason and his best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) watch a movie preview for "Big Fat Liar" and head to Los Angeles to mess up Wolf's life - all to confess he stole Jason's paper to shoot the movie. They even get the sympathy of some of Wolf's abused employees, including his assistant (Amanda Detmer), the former chauffeur (Donald Faison), the movie star (Jaleel "Urkel" White, who plays himself) and the stunt coordinator (a much older Lee Majors). <br /> <br /> Because "Big Fat Liar" has no advantage for its Malcolm in the Middle sitcom, Muniz is easy to anchor, but has not got much to do. Likewise for Bynes, who shows her own Tracey Ullman-like sketch on Nickelodeon. All the haeming goes to Giamatti, whose eyes curve and his cheeks wiggle with every mocking insult. The film only gets a snapshot by trying the High Road and should be enjoyed by its target audience (especially for most of the high jinks at Universal Studios). But here's a head scratch: The message is that it's worth telling the truth. But did not we just see how Jason got white lies throughout the movie to repay him through the lies? At least there is no shit.
