This sad romance is unmistakable because the director decides to break his narrative and offer the views of each character. So there are many flashbacks to resume the same scene. But it would be an extraordinary moment of the cinema to put all the fragments to see the result! <br /> <br /> And that would be worth it because for me it's just one of the best French films ever made! <br /> <br /> It has everything: <br /> <br /> Performers: First steps by Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such voices, even for the hard of hearing! It is symbolic for her to have fallen in love with this movie! <br /> <br /> Director: His camera is bright, lively, plays with the set or may be mysterious with the long close-up "Ã  la David Lynch". <br /> <br /> Cinematography: The light is beautiful, between gold and rust, as her love! <br /> <br /> An unprecedented Paris: It is a Parisian pastime of more accurate, a composition of many districts! Huge search here! It looks like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! <br /> <br /> Music: Not the big orchestra, but perfectly matched to the frame. And the song of Charles Aznavour made me discover this great singer! <br /> <br /> Ah, ?? the history! As I said, it's a love story, but quite tragic: to say that love can be in vain, that it does not make all people happy or is not guaranteed a sweet ending is great because this message is not told often! Love is passion that derives from the Latin "pain". You can suffer a lot if you are in love! Because of the Why??, The endless waiting, the lack of courage, the indecision. <br /> <br /> And if you can relax, fate, destiny, God (?), devil (?) can stab you in the back simply because you arrive too early or too late, and above all because love means 2 in a world of billions! Many things can happen and so many stories can be written! So, what is love? <br /> <br /> Personally, I have experienced a few moments like this: in a car with your loved one. Her cellphone rings and you know it's her "special friend" kissing her goodbye (and not you, even though we're always together). So you want to get out of this car to let them together, so as not to hear the sweet but cruel words, but you can not, because an amazing, heavy rain has just begun! <br /> <br /> I've found that this movie portrays these moments of tragedy like no one else!
