If you're a fan of Turkish and Middle Eastern music, you're in luck. This film is a documentation of current music in Istanbul, ranging from traditional to modern. It is very good. You could not do better if you went to Istanbul yourself. We get interviews with Orhan Gencebay, concert clips with modern musical icons, a road show with Roma (Gypsy), Turkish Hip Hop (surprisingly very good) and much more. Some of the best singers I've ever heard. A Kurdish woman who sings in a hammam (steam bath) and will rip your heart out. A lot of social and political background. If this is your thing, you have a great time. I could hardly sit in the theater anymore. <br /> <br /> CD soundtrack now available on Amazon. Expensive.
