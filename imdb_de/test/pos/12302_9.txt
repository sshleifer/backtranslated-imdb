John Huston, actor and director known for his robust fare like "The Misfits" and "African Queen", directs his daughter Angelica Huston in his latest movie. In fact, the film was released after Huston's death. Based on the eponymous novel by James Joyce, "The Dead" tells the quiet story of a New Year's celebration in 1904 in Dublin. Huston, his cast and scriptwriters, including his son Tony, have created a movie gem. The novella is one of Joyce's finest works (and is the only one that can be filmed). The film pays homage to Huston's genius. He recorded a nice little story and made a nice little movie. Donal McCann and Angelica Huston shine (though "gleaming" is too flashy, too flashy a word to describe their quiet, restrained performance). "The Dead" reflects the love of the Huston family for Ireland, and is a fitting closing film for a legend in its own quiet way.
