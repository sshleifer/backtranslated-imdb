Drive was a pleasing episode with a dark ending. Basically, a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a high sound wave emitted by military equipment. Some of my favorite pieces from this episode are Mulder's dialogue in the car and the scene in which Scully works with the Hazmat team, finding the little old dove lady completely untouched by what they thought was a virus. The end, of course, is realistic because the viewer believes that he will indeed be able to break this complicated plan to rescue the victim, but when Mulder arrives, the man is already dead. 8/10
