This movie has no claim to be great art, which is good. But it's a well-written script with well-developed characters and solid acting. I think if I write it, I could do without the drama about the woman, but it was not distracting enough to distract from the main story about Minnie Driver's character. I think that all too often, Hollywood gives up trying to write a quality letter to inject more visual drama, when in an adult movie like this, only the emotional nature of the drama is really everything - and probably more believable. All in all it is a very well made offer and worth seeing.
