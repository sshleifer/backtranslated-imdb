Excellent storytelling and cinematography. Snappy, biting social commentary. <br /> <br /> Excellent effects. Well filmed and acted. <br /> <br /> However, the parallel action between the current and the travel adventures (though done very well) sometimes takes a bit too much (about 3 hours) and excessive interrupts after the flow of history. <br /> <br /> I read the book for the first time as a child and enjoyed the parts about the giants and the little people - but the book has lost me when it came to the floating island and island land of "Yahoo's "! Although the adventure story sounds like a children's story, it is indeed a very adult story, full of symbols of moral decline in England at the time of Jonathan Swift, the author of the novel on which the film is based.
