This is a very amazing movie! The characters seemed so realistic to me that I could hardly believe that they were not real people. Being from the South, Judith Ivey's character seemed particularly real to me, and as everyone else has mentioned, she does a great job of acting. The characters are not pretty and do not look like average Hollywood stars - their imperfect bodies and personalities are so much more natural and real. <br /> <br /> One reviewer mentioned that the main character Alice had no good reason to run away from home, which is true - she had no moral or righteous reason to run away, such as abusing a child, etc. Me Thought she was fed up with working dead ends in a working life, she wanted to flee to Florida, where her friend lived the attractive and privileged life of a student in Miami. The actress shows Alice's confusion, insecurity and questioning in determination and willingness to take control of her life with impressive naturalness. The film also shows how Alice is trapped in situations where there seem to be no options. She panics, takes action and reaches for help. <br /> <br /> At first, the grainy style of film made me frightening and made me think that it was a very small budget or home-made movie, but in fact it is very well done. The quality of the home movie gives you the feeling of being with the characters as part of their camper voyage through the country. This is definitely a movie to watch, though I do not understand all the descriptions as a heartwarming story of the time. It is quite vulgar and sometimes disconcerting, even if it is not quite sad at the end.
