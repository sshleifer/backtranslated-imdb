Inspired by Disney's The Little Mermaid, Ponyo on the Cliff is the Japanese animation master, Hayao Miyazaki's next major work after the 2001 well-received Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle in 2004. In Ponyo, it's become his unmistakable style shown again animating fantasy realms and children figures. <br /> <br /> Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), the leading boy in the film, discovers a "goldfish" trapped in a glass while playing at the seaside below the cliff. He stays up with his mother Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi). Sosuke shakes the glass vigorously to extract the "goldfish," but the little "goldfish" hangs. He tries to pull it out, but it can not be solved. Sosuke then places the glass on the ground, smashes a small stone and splinters it immediately, with a small cut on the finger. He then checks curiously if the "goldfish" is still alive. The "goldfish" reacts by suddenly licking the blood off his finger. Excited, Sosuke storms back to the house quickly and puts the "goldfish" in a small bucket of water in the hope that he will survive. It did and he called it "Ponyo" (Yuria Nara). The scene above would mean what will happen to the rest of the movie. These are the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. And it's one that Hayao Miyazaki did meticulously in the performance. He must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of children's behavior before he presents this chemistry of communication between the two main characters. The behavior of the children would also affect the rest of the film in their subsequent encounters. <br /> <br /> The affection between Sosuke and Ponyo grew with the progression of the film from the moment Sosuke Ponyo brought her to school in Lisa's car. The best moment came when the two were reunited after a brief breakup, when Ponyo's father Fujimoto (George Tokoro), a magical sea creature, reclaimed the lost ponyo before encasing her with a magical bubble in a magical bubble. <br /> <br /> Fujimoto, once a human being, has instructed people to disgust humans for polluting the sea and stealing their lives. But all Ponyo wants is to be human and to be with Sosuke, and so she escapes a second time by accidentally dumping the precious supply of his father's magical elixir into the sea, creating a storm of tidal waves, and the devouring small town /> <br /> What follows are the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in the flooded city. <br /> <br /> Is there a happy one in this one? Would true love rule? They find out. <br /> <br /> If you look at the art in Ponyo on the cliff by the sea, there seems to be a departure from Miyazaki's earlier work on rendering. It seems to be unfamiliar, since the environment, apart from the characters playing in each scene, is not colored in the usual way as in Spirited Away (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004). The aesthetic appeal is subtracted from seemingly colorful drawn drawings. The objects and characters are not as detailed as before. <br /> <br /> This is special, considering the value as inappropriate, but the way the story is written and told is the possible explanation that Miyazaki allows the audience to look the film with a children's coloring and allow the adults to remember a Japan when they were younger. This move could have prevented potential moviegoers from being new to Miyazaki's work. The trailer did not do anything to promote Ponyo. However, bringing the case to Japan would be a different story, as Miyazaki's testimony goes far beyond any marketing method. <br /> <br /> In summary, one can say that the whole does not correspond to its parts. Apart from Miyazaki's ability to cast lively and animated characters, the film lacks elements of thrill and wonder when measured against previous works, resulting in a lack of large-screen presence. <br /> <br /> The sparks of Ponyo and Sosuke failed to illuminate the movie in a big way, but moments of warmth, kindness and love can still be found if you recognize the movie as a movie that is not for the movie Children is made, but for the children, who is everyone or was once.
