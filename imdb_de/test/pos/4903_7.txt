Although it is a "woman's story", I still found it quite interesting. It's unusual for three real sisters in the movie to play sisters! I refer to Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. <br /> <br /> Why national critics loved this movie was the presence of the evil boy-rebel John Garfield. In their twisted liberal-dominated minds, All-American characters are sick, but they are mad at life. With poor attitudes like Garfield, people play here with whom they can identify. Still, this movie still has a general sense of kindness, which is why I liked it. Some of the characters may have done stupid things, but they are good hearts. Whose heart was bigger than "Ann's" (Priscilla Lane)? I agree with the critic of the IMDb user who says that this is Priscilla's movie, as well as the beloved (not mine) Garfields. <br /> <br /> With a director in the format of Michael Curtiz, the movie is better than he could have been under someone else's. Curtiz made sure that no scene, whether soapy or otherwise, took too long. <br /> <br /> In addition to the Lane sisters and Garfield, we have Claude Rains (who adds much needed humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (girls' main interest), Gale Page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh and Mae Robson , <br /> <br /> Apparently this movie must have been a hit as there were several spin-offs of them approaching this in content and in box office successes.
