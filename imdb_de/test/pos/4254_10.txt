I saw this movie in its short run at the "Arthouse" cinema in '69. I found it so funny that I literally spent part of the film on the floor after laughing so hard that I fell off my seat. Looking back, I thought years later, Melvin Van Peebles had done it. When I told a friend, he said that a friend of his, Downey Sr., had virtually every non-theatrical role in the movie: director, producer of lyrics, etc. He was right, of course, and my memory was wrong. just that this was one of the funniest films ever made. The part of "the Arab" was especially priceless.
