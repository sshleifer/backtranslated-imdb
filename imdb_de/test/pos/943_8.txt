I can not see how a film of this quality receives only 5.7 on average by IMDb voters. It is a classic Australian production that resembles recent efforts such as LOVE AND OTHER DISASTERS, SUGAR FACTORY, OPPORTUNITY LANGUAGE, RUSSIAN DOLL, SAMPLE PEOPLE, THE SECRET OF US, LA SPAGNOLA, STRANGE PLANET, FRESH AIR, DUST OFF THE WINGS, TIME FOR PATSY CLINE etc ... as a 19-year-old college student (Newton in his perhaps best role, at least on the level of CHANGI) with a bored, overreligious mother gets the shock of it's life when she joins decides to enroll in the same course as him - and before you think of another shower movie, it is not the case, there is a real substance. Sure, it's a simplistic view of life in general and art students in particular (but then they're pretty simple among all the philosophical mumbo jumbo, is not it?), And maybe the study of the character of Sinead Cusack is sometimes a bit confused Guess, but the movie is bright, funny and has some important messages. The principle is great: Cusack and Newton are wonderful, and Rose Byrne (see also in THE GODDESS OF 1967) is so undervalued that it's not funny. She is a beautiful, fresh, self-confident actress who deserves every award she receives. I gave MY MOTHER FRANK 8/10.
