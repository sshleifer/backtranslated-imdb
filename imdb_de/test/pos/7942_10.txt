Alexander Nevsky (1938) is a brilliant piece of film propaganda. The Russian people are threatened by two great enemies, the Mongols and the Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. In order to unite the fighting, rival princes in the Russian Empire, Nevsky takes power and fights against the lesser evil (The Teutonics). This influential film has been copied many times and continues today. The soundtrack of the composers Prokiev and Eisentstein's direction is a sight and a sound that should be seen. Many years later, John Milius used many of the film scenes, set pieces, and costumes of this film and built them into one of Conan's favorite lines from Conan was taken from that movie. "It is not the strength of the iron in a weapon, but the strength of the person who wields it, is what matters." The comparisons are unmistakable. The armor worn by James Earl Jones and the leader of the Teutonic Knights is virtually identical. A real tribute from one director to another. <br /> <br /> I give Alexander Nevsky one of my highest recommendations. The film is like the last act of Richard III. The presence of Prince Alexander on the screen is really amazing.
