I did not mean to watch wasting time watching the MTV preview, but since I had nothing better to do on a Sunday night, I looked at it. A very good movie, considering that it was made by MTV. One thing that made me see it was Summer Pheonix, the sister of the late and beautiful Pheonix River. I suppose talent lives in the Pheonix family because she was good and Jaquien too, even though it is not River. Nick Steel also offers excellent performance as a Junky Jock. There is not much else to say about waste. It was a dark, oppressive and insightful glimpse into the lives of three little city junkies. I recommend it to those who like the theme. 8.10
