And I do. Peter Falk has created a role that will last forever in TV land! And I'm grateful for that. However, this is not one of his most beautiful hours. Columbo goes to college and basically teaches how to solve a crime, and yet there are bad guys who think they are smarter than him. What all fans know is that Columbo needs a worthy opponent. How can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat without a big enemy? Still, it's better than NO Columbo, and I'll wait and see the next one.
