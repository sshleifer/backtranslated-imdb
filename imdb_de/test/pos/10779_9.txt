Eric Bogosian offers such a stellar performance as you'll ever see in an Oliver Stone movie. His Barry character is a man-made assault rifle, and he blows anyone who offends him into the air or out of the air. "Talk Radio" is based on Bogosian's play and is a vicious and terrifying ride that will not dismiss you until it's too late. Until then, you'll be familiar with the brink of racists, rapists, paranoids, would-be assassins and sheer string listeners who listen, speak and lurk in the dark nights of Dallas. <br /> <br /> Stone behaves, if at all possible, in allowing Bogosian to dominate every scene, from Barry's humble beginnings to the breakpoint at which his radio show can achieve national syndication. The rest of the cast is uniquely honored as the lovers and / or collaborators, all of whom are shared and discarded by Barry, are common. <br /> <br /> The only thing I would change is the recurring theme music "Bad To The Bone". I should have used Bachman-Turner Overdrive's "Not Fragile". A better song that I have not heard in a movie yet, and a driving, ruthless melody whose ominous riff is like the true soundtrack to Barry's life.
