I first saw this movie on hbo around 1983 and was thrilled! I searched all the auction sites to buy the VHS copy. This is a very good suspense movie with a few twists that make it more interesting. I do not want to say too much else, because if you ever have the opportunity to see it, you'll be glad I did not say too much!
