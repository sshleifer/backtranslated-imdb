I totally disagree with the person who first commented on the movie. For me, this story is about a man with growth hormone disorder who tries his best to look for the love he longs for. He tried his best to fit into the society that apparently did not accept him. Then he met someone who treated him with the love of his best friend and showed him the way to receive the love he always wanted. The man who created all this happiness got something important from the giant, namely the love of the family and the spouse. <br /> <br /> and the comedy, it's just part of the feeling that the audience feels some laugh bugs in a certain part of the game's shows. <br /> <br /> and I have to admit, it got me a little bit torn.
