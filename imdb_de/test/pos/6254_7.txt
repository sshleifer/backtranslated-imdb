The Slasher subgenre is pretty exhausted - even in 1979, just a year after the supposed "first Slasher", Halloween (released seven years after Bay of Blood) was released; The sub-genre was far from exhausted; The tourist trap is one of the most original things. The film follows the same basic formula as most slashers - the madman kills a lot of children, but his originality is based on the fact that the madman is shown from the beginning (as opposed to an invisible attacker or a masked man) and us actually get insight into his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities, including the ability to control the wax puppets that fill his house, adds to the originality. We begin with a great opening sequence in which a young man rushes to a gas station for a flat flat tire for fear of shock. The scene is incredibly scary as the wax figures mock him and things fly off the shelves - and they give the audience a great insight into what's coming; namely a very scary horror movie! <br /> <br /> The acting credibility is as non-existent as you would expect from a slasher of the seventies, but to be honest; It is not so bad. The girls look hot, the boys do not matter; and Chuck Connors is more or less scary in the role of the psycho. He's not exactly Anthony Perkins; but still good enough. However, it is not the acting, but the star of the show, and as you might expect, the scary atmosphere costs that price. Wax models, such as House of Wax (Vincent Price Version ...), are very scary; and the movie uses that fact best. There are few things in the cinema that can be frightening when they're just there - but wax statues are definitely one of them. The killer's special abilities could easily stand in the way of the atmosphere, but the film takes advantage of this fact by flying various things off the shelves, which fits in well with the rest of the movie. On the whole, this is a very good movie. While tourist traps may not necessarily be seen; It is well worth a visit and I would recommend it.
