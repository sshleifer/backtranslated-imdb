The film begins almost painfully slow, a "romance" (yawning) that seems to be running out of course (all part of the plan ...). Then, about an hour into this celebratory movie, The Feast. It is worth to pay attention to this first hour. The party is still solemn but humorous. All of a sudden, the withdrawn and slightly insignificant characters come to life, and everyone (you AND the characters) will feel enriched by the experience. <br /> <br /> Women will love this. Christians of all kinds will enjoy the deep faith of the characters. Not my favorite movie of all time - no dinosaurs or laser beams - but definitely a movie I liked to see. Do not miss. <br /> <br /> Jim
