This is one of the best episodes of Doctor Who EVER. We have the cybermen, the cyber-conversion units (may scare little kids) and roughly the doctor doing one of his best deeds. Bravo David Tennant. Good scenes, as if it were a movie, with exciting scenes in some streets, an invasion based on the Cyberman and the world that is different from ours, basically a 45-minute film. Part 2 of Rise being cybermen would never disappoint. With the big build up to the final. The Doctor plus a Bad Enemy (Daleks, Cybermen, Master, Sontarans, Davros, Autons, or even Macra) is a fight to death, just be careful with young children watching this.
