The Chinese movie title of "In the Mood for Love" is "fa yeung nien wah". It can be interpreted as "those flourishing years (that were once)". <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a well composed piece. A complex love story told in a simple visual way. Author and director Wong Kar-Wai has choreographed a dance of the hearts - it is them, it is he, it is love. I can hear the theme of Galasso: Dum-Dum-Dum, Dum-Dum-Dum and the strings - almost like heartbeats. A piece with foreplay, punching and epilogue. The director has optimized the use of music (Michael Galasso's score, Nat King Cole sings in Spanish and Chinese songs / tunes). The rhythm and the lyrics prompt the viewer to what they feel and think rather than verbal dialogues. I can hear Nat King Cole giving us the clues: "Aquello ojos verde" (the thing that flies, eyes green) plays when the two meet, and "Quizas, Quizas, Quizas" (maybe ??) if she has not decided. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia runs through the whole movie. Design details plentiful: handbags and ties; Japanese rice cooker novelty; the ribbed patterns of green glass cups, saucers, and plates (I remember Daddy appreciated those at home); Mahjong session; Kitchen; Bedroom furniture; the thermos for the donut noodles she is swinging while walking. Maggie Cheung, slim and shapely, looks exquisite in the fashionable patterns and colors of traditional Chinese women's clothing - 'cheung sam'. Every change of clothes means another day, another time in history. Wong Kar-Wai is resourceful in this way. <br /> <br /> The scenes may be in the same place, but they have a different mood that leads to the next verse. Up the stairs and down to the winning noodle stall. Stand on the wall around the corner to the apartments while the rain is pouring. Along the corridor back and forth to his writing corner. <br /> <br /> Trivia: So she helps him when writing his martial arts novel. Maggie could help, since she was in kung fu / martial arts films. "Eastern Three Heroes" 1992 is an entertaining action movie starring Maggie Cheung (Thief Catcher Chat), Michelle Yeoh and Anita Mui as three superheroes fighting evil. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate the performance of Tony Leung, then not Miss "Chungking Express" 1994 (in the second section - Romance rhythm with a difference) and "Happy Together" 1997 (an intense, colorful Paintings of Friendships, Faith, and Destiny), both written and directed by Wong Kar-Wai <br /> <br /> When I understood the Cantonese and Shanghai dialects and visited the official site, I realized that the epilogue was not has been completely translated. Here is my version of the Chinese captions: <br /> <br /> It was a kind of unbearable encounter. All the time she has lowered her head. He gives him a chance to get closer. He did not have the courage to be closer to her turned around, walked away. <br /> <br /> This time and place were over. Everything that belongs to it no longer exists. _______ <br /> <br /> These vanished years, seemingly separated from a glass dust, can be seen but not grasped. <br /> <br /> All the time he longed for the past, if he can break through this dust-collected glass he will go back to times long past. Wong Kar-Wai's "In the Mood for Love" recalls the simple poetry and wisdom of Rumi, the Sufi philosopher - the "inner and outer," the "spirit and body" of life, love and life. <br /> <br /> [Resend.
