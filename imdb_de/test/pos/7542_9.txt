A really funny British comedy from the mid-fifties about a girls' school. The girls are all involved in mischief and chaos, doing bathing gin, smoking and gambling. Alastair Sim plays Principal Millicent in a glorious drag role and Millicent's brother. A policewoman goes to school to see what's going on. This movie is funny, with great sight wounds and Alastair Sim is great. Just a classic Britsh comedy, fun and not too bad. Joan Sims and Sid James, stars of many Carry On films, play little roles, but this movie is about the girls. It brought 3 sequels and a recent redevelopment. See and enjoy where it all started.
