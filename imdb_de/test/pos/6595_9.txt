This movie was not only exciting, it brought me back to the past with its lifelike soundtrack. Those were the things we said and did ... those were the songs we heard ... all at the same time, in the same era, far down south of Alabama. I may not have been a skateboard set, but I was definitely one of the watchers. I sat at the curb with the old transistor radio and listened to Neil Young Turn on their surfboards on wheels, use the tricks of Alva and Adams and hope they would, perhaps for a moment, adopt the Zephyr style , It just shows how we all were on those wonderful days. ~ KLJ
