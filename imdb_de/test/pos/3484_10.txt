This movie felt so real. In fact, at all times, I have felt the emotions that have been portrayed in my life - by both Rory and Michael. I have Duchenes muscular dystrophy like Rory. What you see here is exactly what I actually felt. Some will not believe that there are disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know that they exist because I am one of them. <br /> <br /> The story is great. For a dramatic, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I never got bored, maybe because I saw things that mattered to me. But I think most people are glued to the screen with intelligence and take care of the characters. The spectacle is phenomenal! James McAvoy is perfect as Rory O'Shea, who has Duchene Muscular Dystrophy. He earns Steven Robertson an award for his portrayal of Michael Connolly, who has cerebral palsy. Michael's love is not reciprocated by a girl, and Rory helps him deal with it. I have felt this many times and the question is, "Does not she love me because I am not the one or because my disability has eliminated her?" No matter what the girl says, we will always be skeptical of the truth. It's only natural and it hurts anyway. <br /> <br /> A few parts made me cry a bit because it is sad and I have to face the problems myself. People without deadly disabilities just can not think about how they can feel. This is a must-have movie for everyone. Disabled people are everywhere and are badly misunderstood. In this film, some facts of life are illuminated, which are so taken for granted by the handicapped. We want to be like you - to live, go out, get drunk, be loved, on our own terms. We can not do much from the outside, but inside we dance!
