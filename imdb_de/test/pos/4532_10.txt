This movie may not have been a favorite with some people, but it had everything I wanted in a comedy. Drop funny moments accompanied by a moment or two of serious moving scenes, great actors and just about everything a good movie should be. Although David Spade played his usual snobby character, he made that role an uncommon performance that I believe did not surpass until it came to the screen with Joe Dirt. Regardless of whether some people were not Chris Farley fans or not, I saw this movie when it came out, and my friends and I still talk about it ... 11 years later. This movie finally told me that Chris Farley was the real deal. He is the best comedian I have seen in my life. In the words of some, he might be awkward, clever, witty, serious, crazy, sober and at the same time moving or depressing. not the same words, but the message is all that matters. one of the true great actors of our time and one of the true great comedies of all time. In addition to good acting, good story, funny moments and serious scenes that sometimes brought me to tears. This movie stands on the hordes as a movie that marked the beginning of a short reign at the forefront of the comedy world by the late great Chris Farley. No actor before or since has conquered my interests in a movie ever since. because no actor has put so much into his films before or since then. This movie is worth the time if you did not take the time to see it at the next loan of a movie.
