Last night I saw a PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Strangely, it took 137 minutes - slightly longer than the time specified on IMDb. <br /> <br /> At first I lost interest in this movie because the rather confusing style of shooting really got lost. The context for the event was missing and I'm glad that I stayed with it. At the beginning, a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding, Sri Lanka war breaks out in their homeland, and the lovers are separated. Months later, the woman is very pregnant and aboard a refugee ship to India. In a refugee home you can see the woman who is about to give birth - whereupon the titles of the movie are finally revealed. <br /> <br /> The entire focus of the film changes completely - to a young girl, which is about to celebrate her 9th birthday in Madras, India. They see her in her house and she talks to the camera about her life and her family. None of that seems so interesting or important, and you wonder what's missing - what about the woman who was about to give birth? My wife and I debated it, and finally we guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the movie. Somehow she had been adopted and talked to Mom and Dad # 2 about her life - though she did NOT know these people were not her birth parents. Soon after, the parents themselves revealed they were total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the movie) when they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about their ancestry, and to tell it in a way that the girl did emotionally unsettled and confused. Despite a silly decision she told in the worst possible way, the parents made up their minds by agreeing to help her find her birth mother. Seeing the impact on girls and parents (especially the adoptive mother) has been impressive and has certainly sparked my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sri Lanka is very, very long and brutally involved in civil war with Tamil fighters for three decades. The family's decision to look for mother in Sri Lanka was indeed noble, but sometimes a little stupid - risking so much and being killed almost every now and then, jumping blindly into the middle of a war! It was all exciting and captivating, but I was also surprised at the reason of the adoptive parents. First you tell her that she is NOT your own child, and now you take her in the middle of a WAR ZONE !!! Sure, the boy really wanted to meet her birth mother, but that was really stupid looking back. If it were me, I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the role and deceive the child - and avoid being in the middle of a war! <br /> <br /> Despite my complaints, the movie was nice to look at and was very rewarding. Far from being perfect, it certainly hits an emotional homerun. Although I expected this because I've seen several Indian films, many Westerners will be a little surprised by the lively songs that seemingly come from nowhere - this is standard in most films from India - also in Bollywood (Bombay ) and Tamilwood / Kollywood (Madras).
