CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) sees his first secret location survey when Anwar (Metwally) is accused of having had contact with a well-known terrorist bomb maker. Anwar's wife (Witherspoon) is desperate for the whereabouts of her husband. <br /> <br /> Do not you just hate it when the title of a movie sends you into a dictionary? I have to have an old edition, because this is not a piece of music. No, it is the government's path to legally bring a resident or citizen to a place to interrogate him and possibly use some torture to obtain the information they want. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I was reminded of a similar plot in the Crossing Jordan TV series (not on TV anymore), and I expect to see more of these actions. It is inevitable. The events of 911 are the catalysts. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult business because we do not like to be tortured and our government does not tell the truth about things. We like the idea that no matter what happens or happens, we can go somewhere to find answers, but when this door is closed for us, we are truly lost and hopeless, as was Anwar's wife. <br /> <br /> The performances of all were first class and it is possible that we see more of Igai Naor (I have no idea how to pronounce it) because he looks and acts like Telly Savalas. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes
