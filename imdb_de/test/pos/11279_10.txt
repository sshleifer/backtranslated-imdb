What this movie is not: Cool, entertaining <br /> <br /> What this movie is about: Visually interesting, hard to get through, Intentionally <br /> <br /> I feel that this movie is the viewer (if he or she is willing) through a clip of the time in which they experience a world without language. Similar to how animals have to experience the world. You do not really see this movie as often as you experience a horrible series of events that "feels" like in real time. <br /> <br /> Consistently it runs much longer than comfortable. This movie could be reduced to 20 minutes and would be a completely different movie. It would be cool and entertaining, but the experience would be lost. I've seen a lot of cool movies, but I've never experienced anything like that. If you can put the head in the right place for this head, you should be able to truly appreciate (but probably not "enjoy") what you have achieved here. 10 out of 10.
