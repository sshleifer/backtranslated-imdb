Two unfortunate but clever ladies choose HAVANA WIDOWS as they sail to Cuba to meet and extort wealthy lords. <br /> <br /> This was the kind of sketchy comic flair that the studios produced effortlessly during the movie's 1930s. Well done and most enjoyable, the depression audience does not seem to get enough of these popular, fun photo dramas. Joan Blondell & Glenda Farrell are perfect as the desperate, fast-talking women who are going to be great lengths to make a little dishonest dough. Although Joan gets both the top billing and the romantic scenes, both girls are just as talented and worth watching as they are stunning. <br /> <br /> Handsome Lyle Talbot plays Joan's stubborn worshiper, but he has relatively little to do. Chubby, Cherubic Guy Kibbee appears as the intended target of the girls. Whether he wakes up to find himself in the wrong bed, or is chased in his long underpants over the roof of a Cuban hacienda, he's just as weird. Behind him are a number of character actors - Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Hobart Cavanaugh, Maude Eburne and Dewey Robinson - all equally capable of pleasing the toughest public James Murray as a suspect bank clerk with the fake check. This very talented actor was pulled out of complete darkness to play in King Vidor's THE CROWD (1928), one of the most prestigious films of the silent film era. The hope for a great career was great, but his fame quickly faded with soundscapes. After a long series of tiny rolls and fractures that were broken and penniless, his life ended in 1936 in the waters of a New York River. He was only 35 years old. <br /> <br /> Although he was never the first Joan Blondell (1906-1979) and Glenda Farrell (1904-1971) in the 1930s revived numerous films in Warner Bros., notably the eight films in which they collaborated occurred. Whether they are gold diggers or workers, reporters or secretaries, these blond and mischievous ladies were almost always comparable to the leading man who was fortunate enough to share the same bill with them. With a little joke or a look, their characters showed that they were ready to conquer the world - and every man in it. Never as disgusting as Paramount's Mae West, you always had the feeling that Blondell & Farrell, tough as they were, used their hardness to defend vulnerable hearts ready to break the right guy. While many ideas from seven decades ago may look like they are now without a fight, these two charming ladies are still spirited and cheeky.
