Maybe not the best work of Miyazaki, but I could not help but love to death. A five-year-old boy finds a goldfish that is in a bottle. He saves his life and keeps it as a pet in a bucket, but it's really a magical creature, the daughter of a human sorcerer and a sea goddess. Ponyo, as the boy calls her, is brought back to the sea by her father, who tries to prevent her from returning to land and becoming human, but she gets into his magical elixirs and does what she wants. The story is simple and cute. Where the movie really comes alive lies in its enormous work. The drawings are more childlike than in any of Miyazaki's other works, but their simplicity is beautiful. As with all of his films, Miyazaki creates this world of imagination that impressed me so much. When I saw it in the theater, it reminded me of how it was when the first notes of Jo Hisaishi's score for Princess Mononoke flooded me just a decade ago and gave me goose bumps (the score here is just as wonderful). I wanted to live in this world and never leave it.
