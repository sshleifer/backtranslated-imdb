When I first watched the trailer, I have to decide if this series is perfect for my collection. But after hearing about it, I decided to buy it. When I bought the entire collection in a box, I absolutely wanted to see. It was very funny and the characters were pretty cool. Favorite characters in the show are: Marion, Carrot, Haze Knights, Big Momma and Dotta. I also liked the beginning and end theme songs. The show also has some great vocal talents from Tiffany Grant, Jason Douglas and others. But this show is one of the biggest. So if you want to see something cool. Then this show is the one.
