Although this film does not stand out from the rest of the film, it is still a very nice movie that you can set up with your feet up. There may be one or two mistakes you find, and the movie is a bit dull, the movie itself is very pleasant and has a wonderful atmosphere. The music adds a lot to the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is still impressive (especially the dog he!), whereby John Travolta takes over the leadership of the fun-loving Michael. Other characters feel real and very good in the movie. <br /> <br /> After a long day's work, glue "Michael" in the evening with ice cream and enjoy a very good movie of your own right :)
