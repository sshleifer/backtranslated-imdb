Dolemite is for me an object of my deepest affection. It has everything: a gang of prostitutes fighting karate. Dolemite beats Willie Green (director Martin) belly, high heels and hats with 100 gallon dalmation pressure. Moore's unique comedy rapeseed, actually toasts, are close to the roots of hip-hop. No wonder Dr. Dre mentioned "Dolemite" three times on his classic album "The Chronic". Add the best list of characters to grace a movie, such as the horny preacher, the hamburger pimp, and of course "the one nobody knows until it's time". The style of director D'Urville Martin should be credited, a guy who probably will not get as much attention in film fan circles as he should (I've been looking for a copy of his and Fred Williamson's films from the start and can do them not found). <br /> <br /> Many people are really into this movie and say that it is really bad, and it is true that you can see boom-Mikes everywhere DP Nicholas Josef Von Sternberg, for whom I think that this a very early effort), there are many things in this film. First, there is no other movie that is like this. Secondly, see how Rudy Ray Moore (a guy who has not yet seen Moore's outrageous live act use his fantasies) uses a cinematic version of his toast and also revives the life of his comic character Superpimp , The action scenes are pretty bad, but the dialogue of the characters when they talk about garbage more than makes up for it. It's full of weird little details (like the fact that the Hamburger Pimp wears a Dolemite T-shirt inside out - was this intentional, or did the guy just pick up the shirt that was on the set and put it on? ) They come back to see it again and again. <br /> <br /> At least I have. <br /> <br />
