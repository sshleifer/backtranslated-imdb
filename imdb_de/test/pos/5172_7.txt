Even if I had never seen or heard of Georgetown, CO, this would be a sweet little movie. But my father was born and raised there, and these are my uncle's horses from which you see the sled pulled! So this movie is very special for me. Many of the interiors are shot in buildings and houses that I know, and are very realistic. The story is a bit hokey, but Georgetown is a magical place where such things can happen. John Denver was a better actor than many people appreciate him. Mary Wickes plays the kind of "normal woman with a lot of sass," which she played so well in many other films, especially "White Christmas." Normally I do not get out in the winter, so I like watching this movie for Christmas to "tide" myself until the next trip!
