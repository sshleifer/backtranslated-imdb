I read "Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl" when I was in high school and immersed myself completely in her story and also in the Broadway play of her life in the back house. <br /> <br /> I'm a little bit taken aback at how people perceived their diary and viewed it as a person, as a little saint or as a message of hope for the world. I do not think that was the original purpose of her journal. She wrote it mainly for herself, though she made some rigorous transcriptions of the betrayal of the inmates of the back house and intended to be published one day. <br /> <br /> But I never saw her as a saint or as an ambassador of hope ... but as a very talented writer who could express her thoughts very well and very entertainingly in a journal. No doubt she was a very dedicated writer, and she had an extraordinary talent for expressing herself completely in words. You really got to know her well through her diary. But the importance of her journal lies in the fact that it is a testimony and an important historical document for the proof that the Holocaust has taken place. It also brought the tragedy of the Holocaust closer to home to losing someone to whom we could give a familiar face and personality at such a young age ... literally her young life had been torn from her and the other inmates murdered in the Holocaust. It is a brutal charge of systematically murdering the Nazis to over six million Jews, and that should not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> But it's sad for me that her journal is so misunderstood. When I search for hope, I have the Bible ... the world's first most read non-fiction book. God's words in the Bible are eternal ... but Anne's diary is a diary of a young girl in extraordinary circumstances, and that's it. She is not someone to be worshiped or worshiped because she was an ordinary girl with many faults, an incredible talent as a writer, and died of typhoid fever at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp at the age of fifteen. She was a victim of the Holocaust, and since this otherwise excellent documentary so vividly testified, she was Hitler's most famous victim. Besides the story of Anne Frank ... the stories of her family members and friends and survivors of the Holocaust were captivating, vivacious and powerful. I especially enjoyed the testimony of Miep Gies and am wondering that she is still strong and alive today. Very interesting was also the testimony of Hannah Goslar. And I also like to hear from Otto Frank. But I also agree that the moving image of the young girl with the dark hair and the familiar big eyes at the end was particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the Holocaust that I somehow disagree with the documentary ... is that I do not believe that it was just discrimination, but something deeper and deeper and that was only an act of pure evil. The Pure evil. Nothing but pure evil. <br /> <br /> Excellent documentary by Anne Frank and the Holocaust to look at.
