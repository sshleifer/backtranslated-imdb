This is the classic case of a stellar movie being reviewed by the American public, simply because Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger were not there as lead actors - Adrian Quinn delivers a better double-performance in this film than any of them have ever done in their careers ! Well, now to the meeting ... <br /> <br /> The order is loosely based on the story of Carlos the Jackal, a radical of the 1970s who terrorized Europe for years before being arrested by French agents. In this adaptation, a US Navy officer (Adrian Quinn) is on leave in Israel when he is arrested by Mossad (Isreal's Crack Intelligence / Anti-Terrorism Agency) and sentenced to interrogation for being exactly like the Jackal This is an extremely cheesy part of the movie, but believe me that does not affect the great value of this movie. When it turns out that Mr. Ramirez is not the jackal, he is recruited by a hardened CIA agent named Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, who performs his usual enigmatic, mysterious governmental authority, but amazingly) throughout his life the Jackal, and the aftermath of the following events will captivate everyone watching this movie - it's full of great drama, without the usual action movie clich√©s and one-liners, and a great action that will surprise everyone. The three leading men - Quinn, Sutherland, and Kingsley - carry this film much further than their modest budget would have if all were to fill their shoes. Kudos to the director and his staff, camera angles and cinematography are first-rate, especially in the action scenes. The job is better than anyone who could hire it, it's a pity that the movie at the box office went pretty bad otherwise we might see a sequel to this amazing spy thriller. <br /> <br /> 9/10 stars, This review recommends it to all potential viewers!
