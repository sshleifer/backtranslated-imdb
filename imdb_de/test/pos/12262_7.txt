Broadcast News is led by James L. Brooks (terms of tenderness, as good as it gets) and has a great cast, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks and Holly Hunter. Everyone performs well, but they are unlikely to really care. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the movie are really brilliant, like the prologue and the short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason that it does not work out is a movie based on the fact that the characters are more amusing than amusing things that happen to them to be too stupid to be successful there. Still, it makes the script worth watching. Certainly not for everyone. <br /> <br /> 7.0 out of 10
