This game is very good for the N64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska and other skaters. The game has neither Mike V nor Bam Margera. Dang! Well, the gameplay is fantastic. The Level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other different things in 2 minutes. There is a skater who is pretty cool. I designed a skater called Butt Mulligan, a black guy with afro, and a girlboard. There's a park editor, some cool pre-built parks, free skate and there's a single session where you can skate and score for 2 minutes. You can watch iterations, which is always cool. Each skater has 2 styles: A and B. The graphics are not that good. Well, they are good for a N64 game. I wish I had a controller pack to store my data. Overall, this game is great. I give 864 for n64. But with the GBA version it's just as much fun as the N64 version, but somehow hard to control. I give a 7/10 for GBA. So go to a place that still sells N64 games and get a copy. There are also versions for PS1.
