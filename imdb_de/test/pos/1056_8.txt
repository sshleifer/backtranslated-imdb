Although it's a Christmas movie, "Christmas in Connecticut" could have been made any season, as it's the story of a soldier spending an idyllic time with a Martha-Stewart type. He thinks that. In fact, the lady in question, portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck, has a popular newspaper section about living on a farm with her husband and baby. She has no farm, no husband, no baby and not many recipes she publishes. They belong to the nearby restaurant owner. When her no-nonsense editor, Sydney Greenstreet, insists she entertain the soldier Dennis Morgan, she asks her friend to use his farm and she brings herself and the restaurateur there. There is even a baby ... well, actually there are more than one. Chaos ensues, and the Charade becomes increasingly difficult to play, especially when Stanwyck falls in love with Morgan. <br /> <br /> This is such a wonderful movie, and even if you are depressed, "Christmas in Connecticut" can make you stand out. Barbara Stanwyck is wonderful when the career woman became a housewife. Although she was not as conspicuous as Crawford or Davis, she could still do whatever required each role - she could be cheap, elegant, warm, angry, cold and / or sexy, and she makes it easy. In addition, she is always attractive and seductive. Dennis Morgan is a handsome and charming soldier; As an added bonus, he can use his Irish tenor. The fianc√©e Reginald Gardner is all business, and one can say that he is not quite right for Stanwyck. S.Z. Sakall as a fake uncle / real cook is hilarious, especially when he prays that Stanwyck can throw a pancake in front of an audience. I can imagine what influence this wonderful film had at the end of the Second World War. It must have been a real beacon for the better times.
