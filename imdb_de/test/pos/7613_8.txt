Never been kissed as a reporter with Drew Barymore as a reporter Josie Gellar is a sweet, extremely juicy and sometimes very painful story about a shy woman named Josie Gellar, who is brilliant but calm and shy and was never kissed by a man , She receives her first major news program for the newspaper she works for. She's a high school student with the beloved cool kids, and she's got a picture of what's really going on in the high school world. The only problem is that Josie was never popular. The gymnasium was indeed a traumatic experience for her, because she received quite a few teasing and cruel jokes. Josie takes on this task to finally "fit in" to get a bullet - what she finds is the most important premise in the story. <br /> <br /> Never before has one of these films, which are so juicy at times schmaltzy, especially in a few scenes at the end, that the limits of credibility are being hard tested and many cynics may not be watching this movie to like. It is, however, very sweet. Drew Barymore is perfect because of the hobbling but lovely Josie - she breathes fresh air into the character and makes her appear completely realistic. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobiesky as an intellectual student who befriends Josie on her first day of school. <br /> <br /> There were some really funny moments kissed while Josie unfolds in her desperate effort to be cool. Example - the reggae bar scene. I also loved the performance of Josie's brother Rob, who also goes back and enrolls as a high school student. The way he helps Josie find her "dream" of finally fitting in is just funny. At the same time, when Josie's sad story of her first years in high school is shown in retrospect, it is extremely painful. You do not have to have had similar experiences in high school as Josie did to be influenced by her story. Drew is wonderful when she personally connects her character with the audience and we love Josie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of "mean girls" in 2004, but in this movie the girls are a lot more sour. Never kissed was a romantic picture, as Josie developed feelings for a certain man and the question of whether they come together. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. In some areas it was really nice. The movie is crazy in some places, yes, the last scene - realistically - in no way - does this film manipulate your feelings in the most obvious way of Hollywood? Oh yeah yeah yeah baby! But it manipulates wonderfully, here are some lessons to learn. The film never preaches, but gives an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few. I actually met people who had similar experiences to Josie. I have met people who are very similar to these characters. I think a lot of people just do not know what cruelty can exist in the world from high school, and how hurtful it can be, but it's there. Not unrealistic at all. What struck me was Drew's speech at the prom, as she demonstrated the "sheep mentality" that can so prevail - like Hollywood and as many as many believe is well done and very true. <br /> <br /> I will never sound kissed, much heavier than it is, in fact this is a perfect movie to choose from, if you want to have a sweet feeling. It is captivating, sweet and only Rufus. I would take a look. 8 out of 10.
