There was a time when not all animations were Disney or Pixar. It's so nice to see this wonderful movie again, and I actually got a good, decent copy on DVD. Be careful, as it is not publicly available and there are some really bad copies. I got a very good copy from a company called Flashbacks, which is pretty good. I used to watch it on black and white on TV, and it's a magic to see it in color. Much better than many would think. The songs are adorable and the color is great. Interestingly, the characters are really well developed, which is unusual in animated films. I loved Hoppity and the bad guy Mr. Beatle is a real Kad. It is incredibly resourceful. The way lifeless objects such as cotton spools, old cans become part of the environment and have new functions is great. The anthropomorphic use of insects is amazing, considering that most people who often find people sad are abhorrent. I hope we can never step on an insect again! The insect enemy is the human. In fact, of course, it is the insects that will survive. No matter how hard we try to free ourselves from ants in Australia, they keep coming back. The battle is lost and we have to live with them. There are several scenes that stand out, such as Hoppity and Mr. Bumble hanging in a watering can, the great tide and the drive to the top of the building are all wonderful. It's also pretty anthropomorphic, but in a way that's charming. The human figures are similar to those in Gulliver and are incredibly effective. The wedding scene looks beautiful. It is a crime that this film was not celebrated as a classic. The only glaring hint for me are the occasions in the movie when the characters get into verse. Speaking verses spoils the story and it was not necessary. The verse is terrible and spoils another wise good writing. It's great and kids will love it. It is a pleasure to see. There is also a very clever ending.
