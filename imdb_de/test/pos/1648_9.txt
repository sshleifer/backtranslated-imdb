Shtrafbat is the story that only Russians could tell about World War II. Ironically, the largest front of the entire conflict was the least-featured topic on the canvas after the war. While the war effort of the Western Allies was portrayed in almost every possible way, the East was left out or the job was only left to some old propaganda films that were nothing but historical footage. There is no chance that Shtrafbat in every detail with Band of Brothers could compete, but you also do not want to look at the screen to investigate small visual effects. That the soldiers are Russians is a good reason to forgive the less spectacular fighting scenes, and you can focus on the story that is most interesting. The war on the Eastern Front and the nature of the Russian army were so different that perhaps one should show people more dramatizations from the other fronts and armies. Shtrafbat is not a perfect way, but it has some rare specialties that increase the overall rating. It tends to destroy the myths that people have about World War II, the true heroes were Russian people and not their leaders who sent them to missions they could only kill. Another big myth bust is that the enemy, who does not use his weapon, is portrayed as an equal human being - an advance that was difficult to try in many acclaimed films. Shtrafbat shows how the war on the Eastern Front was a survival war and how the collision of the -isms crushes people to dust.
