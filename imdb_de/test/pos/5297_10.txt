Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli shows in every little action of the characters in Ponyo his wonderful touch that invigorates life. If Sosuke places his small boat so carefully that it grabs the red fish, you know that you have a very good time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are interesting and you really care about them. They visually remember other stories, Riisa seems to be an adult Nausicaa with a son, an old woman in a wheelchair remembers the witch in Howl's Moving Castle. <br /> <br /> The presence of the elements, wind, rain and sea With its big, powerful waves, it is so strong that I think it has not been so evoked in any other movie. It's a simple story, loosely inspired by "The Little Mermaid," and reaches into the hearts of the audience, as is Totoro, the real masterpiece of the other Miyazaki. <br /> <br /> An instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the credits. Do not miss it.
