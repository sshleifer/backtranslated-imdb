I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has something to blame, everyone is real. No heroes of cardboard or cold, almighty omniscient characters. <br /> <br /> I've read many other viewers here who complain about Anne Morale and about James willing to maintain his love for her even though she cheats on him, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> I found Anne (Emily Watson) absolutely wonderful and I felt love for her. <br /> <br /> She was a heavily oppressed woman, her actions were not planned: when she started to break free, she was confused and made many mistakes. But that's the way it is in real life, if you gain freedom you will probably make mistakes (especially at the starting point). Was she a bit too ungrateful? Could be. But we have to remember that she is walking with her feet for the first time. She knows that James is a good man after all, maybe a bit too stiff, serious and work-centered; But she also feels the urge to live life like herself. <br /> <br /> Is she more to blame for than him? I think no. <br /> <br /> But the change in her life is causing some changes. <br /> <br /> James, instead of letting his wife out of his life (as other viewers recommend it as the right choice) bites the ball and waits, hoping for the better. He begins to understand that what he was outwardly okay (his marriage) was actually a control game he played on his wife. <br /> <br /> This is not a story with characters who have over-emotional and precarious nature (that's the usual stereotype of Latin American or Italian jealous guys), this is a story of men and women, both heart and heart Use brain. <br /> <br /> It can be very painful, but if you really love a person (women) or man) and if you are not terribly unstable in nature, you will probably forgive his / her deceit and let him go. Unless you are a jealous, prehistoric, passionate and mentally unstable person. <br /> <br /> A really good movie. The last scene in which James goes to the station with Anne, despite all the previous things, is really moving: she is free and he has understood what freedom means to a human being. <br /> <br /> Guido
