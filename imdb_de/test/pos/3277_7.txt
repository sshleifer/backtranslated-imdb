A good old-fashioned escape and revenge west, with a certain verve and a hint of gravitas, injecting a little black social history into their plot. Led by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the group of outsiders flees from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army gig trick. Their adventures are plausible, but funny and exciting at the same time. There are some nice flashback flashback scenes that set up the character and background story of the hero, a good end of shooting, while our heroes defend the city from greedy white landgraves, and even Stephen Baldwin is not bad in this pleasant, quite powerful western ,
