Every guy Liv Tyler meets loses his head, not without a little encouragement from Liv, of course. Liv is at her best, with Matt Dillon tops among the paramotors. An interesting prerequisite to telling the story from any perspective degenerates into a sitcom-style finale (not unlike Blame It On Rio, which has more than a few similarities). It's worth it to see it anyway.
