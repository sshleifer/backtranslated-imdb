"Thursday" is a good movie, but we realize too much of other films in its genre, so it lacks originality. If you've seen "Goodfellas," "Reservoir Dogs," "Pulp Fiction," and a host of other films inspired by this last one, you've seen almost every part of "Thursday." There is a scene that includes torture, which even has the same dialogue as in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. <br /> <br /> Still, it's a good movie. Since not every part comes from the same movie, the whole thing contains some new ideas and some nice details. The opening sequence is pretty impressive at first. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart), Dallas (Paulina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They fight a gas station employee over a cup of coffee and it ends with the death of that employee and the arrival of a police officer. We have already discovered a suitcase with a lot of money in it. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He is married to Christine (Paula Marshall) but used to work with Nick. She does not know anything. Then Nick calls him and says he is coming. We learn that he messed up his friends and the problems start right away. <br /> <br /> What exactly happens, I can not tell, but we meet some other characters who were all interested in the money or the drug Nick also with him. Casey flushed her down the drain. <br /> <br /> Very funny moments, lots of blood, a very funny subplot with actor Michael Jeter and some surprises (though you really think about how to get there) This is a good movie with some very good performances by Skip Woods are nicely staged.
