Normally I'm not a drama / feel good movie, but once I saw the trailer for "Radio", I could not resist. Not only is this a great movie, it also has a great effect. Cuba Gooding Jr. has done an excellent job and James Robert Kennedy, a.k.a. "RAdio", presented. Ed Harris has also done a fantastic job as Coach Jones. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw a comedy as well. For a great story, great acting and a little comedy I give "Radio" a 10 out of 10!
