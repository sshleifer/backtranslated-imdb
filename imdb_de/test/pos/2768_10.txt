This movie is very good and the whole family would enjoy watching it. When Susie Q is at her prom from her big night, she dies in a fatal car crash en route to the prom of drunken and highly drunk children. Susie's house is sold and a family moves to the house she loves. As the boy who now lives in the house, Susie sees and is the only one who can do that. The two together with his little sister and trying to rescue Susie's parents I'm broke.Staring Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q.This movie will hit your heart with comedy, grief and laughter. I hope you see this movie because it is very good is no longer on TV.
