I have seen how this film was counted now and still can not get enough. It's like a damned drug. I know that many people do not like it, but it's something that just attracts me. Every single performance is spectacular, but Aaliyah steals the show. Not only did she play the role of Akasha, she became her too. Her body movement and beauty was captured exceptionally well. It is also nice to see that a black girl has been selected for the role of an Egyptian queen (No, I am not prejudiced against whites, I am one). Although it is not known what color the ancient Egyptians really had, but that was a nice change. Stuart Townsend made me forget how Tom Cruise portrayed Lestat, and Marguerite struck again. All in all, it was a good time in the cinema. For those who have not seen it yet, be careful to look at it openly and not take it too seriously. I mean, it's a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star. Take it like that.
