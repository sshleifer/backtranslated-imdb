This was one of the few Norwegian films that I was really looking forward to. It started as a few commercials with a colorful bundle at football matches. Then they made a movie out of it. The leads are not professionals (and you can see that), but they are still doing a very good job and the movie as a whole blew me away. <br /> <br /> Norway is known for making shitty films (no offense), but I had a good feeling about it. Even if I'm not interested in football, I wanted to see it. The story is much better than expected and the laughter continues to pile up. There are many cameos of Norwegian celebrities and players. The characters are well represented and you can feel them. IF YOU SEE ANY GONNA, SEE A NORWEGIAN FILM. LET THIS BE THIS !!!!
