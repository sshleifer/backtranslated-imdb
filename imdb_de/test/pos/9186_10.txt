I expected a good movie. What I got was an even better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is just incredible. I'm glad to see him in a big movie once! <br /> <br /> The movie works because the actors play their roles perfectly. Will Smith is awesome with his never-ending charm. Kevin James is hilarious and Eva Mendes ... well, let's just say she plays this bitch / cute / annoying role to the best of her ability. <br /> <br /> What I loved about the movie was the fact Will Smith did not even have to try to be adorable. He was just !! The "appointment doctor" had all the right steps, said everything in the most perfect way and never went over the edge. <br /> <br /> The funny parts are weird ... and the cute, romantic parts are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this movie. And no, it's not a chick movie.
