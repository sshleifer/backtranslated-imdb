Long follower Whoever said, must joke. This has to be one of the deepest behind the scenes or creating documentaries ever made. How can it be a trailer, when the audience is told for several minutes, how the film was conceived and then brought to the studios? This documentary also spends a lot of time describing in detail how stunts were made and what new technologies were created. then it shows us how the team of woo ping brought the fight scenes along with block cassettes to the market, which shamed the actual scenes with the actors pretty much. It is reported about Matrix Reloaded, but there is hardly anything. If you're a true fan of the Matrix, you need to watch this documentary. The original documentation on the DVD is good but incomplete compared to this one. For example, it has never explained why Keanu wore a neck brace in the original documentation, but that's explained in Revisited. The Revisited DVD also shows how Carrie Ann Moss sprains her ankle during the lobby scene and is really disturbed because she feels she has abandoned the crew. and that's just the tip of the iceberg. So ignore the "just a long trailer" check and see for yourself. you will not regret it Occasional Matrix fans do not have to apply ...
