The wind and the lion is a wonderful, sweeping movie. It's a memorial to what filmmaking was once, but it's not. <br /> <br /> Connery plays the Raisulu very well despite the thick Scottish brogues. It inspires the viewer in ways that many leading actors can not. Candice Bergen is wonderful in one of her early roles because the kidnapped celebrity shows courage to Mrs. Pedacari, in the face of adversity (and a lot of) humor as well). A wonderful movie, rent or buy and you will not be disappointed.
