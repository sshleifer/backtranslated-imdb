Not too much tip is the classic "Top Gun" or "Independence Day" when it comes to fighter jet excitement. Yes, the top-down movie is based on a really fictional example of how someone can take rescue action, but he's cool because he violates all traditional rules. The child does what he wants to do in a jet the way he wants it. I can not really put my finger on what I love about this movie, but others I know have seen it feel just like me. I think it's actually a lot of fun, but maybe a bit too unrealistic for some to see involved in making your own decisions about it. To put it this way, I thought Top Gun was one of the best fighter pilot films of all time and I like this movie as well, if not as a top gun. Do not miss, see it, a really inspiring movie.
