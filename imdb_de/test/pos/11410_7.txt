Simon West's pg-13 thriller on a babysitter who gets annoying pranks when sitting in a mansion is neither original nor exciting enough to be called a good movie. Although there are some elements of excitement, good eye candy and decent characters, the movie is just another, I know what you did last summer, as it's not taken seriously. The performances were fine, but nothing special with this movie, I say skip, unless you're looking for a mediocre movie. Sometimes you can find better films than this. This may not be life, but at least the US or anything, haha. ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
