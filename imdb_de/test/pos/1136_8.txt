When I first heard of "Greek", I thought I would look at it because it sounded ridiculous. Another from ABC Family, which is so bad that they are almost good shows. As we coordinate with a friend from college, we both expected the pilot to be much more than expected. <br /> <br /> As a member of a Greek society, I can say that many stereotypes are the case Here are those who appear almost every time someone on a campus talks about the Sisterhoods and Brotherhoods. And it's also fun to play with him, not to mention a TV screen. The opening scene turned into a slightly dramatized version of the preparation for a formal onslaught in some professions and continued. <br /> <br /> This is not a show for hypersensitive Greeks. If you are even offended by jokes about things that are not so great in Greek life, you spend the entire first episode and probably many others who contract and scream. But everyone else should have a lot of fun watching. It's nothing new, but when it comes to college, it's never something.
