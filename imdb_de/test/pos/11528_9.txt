In one way or another, you can not leave the basic message. The strong survive. Those who are mentally or emotionally sensitive go. They leave a hole in the lives of those who love them. A hole that in its finality is considered selfish. At the end, Phoebe realizes that. Just before he helped Wolf heal from his self-incrimination. She can accept the closure of her ... missing sister. Beautiful european landscape. A lot of truth about idealism and addiction to the next big moment. For a moment, I thought of the Baader-Meinhoff gang, which was in the early 70s. I liked this movie because it reflected a time when I was coming of age.
