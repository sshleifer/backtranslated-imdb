In 1984, Edgar Reitz surprised film lovers around the world with his Opus Heimat: A Chronicle of Germany. Eight years later he came to the market with the sequel to The Second Home: Chronicle of a Youth, which is even more amazing than its predecessor. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is not really a sequel. It is more of a "midquel" as it is about events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episodes of the first home cycle. The second home begins in 1960, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold) was separated from his first love, Klarchen, by courtesy of his intolerant mother and older brother (the controversy had something to do with him being underage while she was about 25 Was years old). The young man is still angry about these events and vows never to fall in love again (a terrific, albeit scary scene), and decides to move to Munich (like the director at about the same time), hoping to become a professional composer after a few years at the conservatory. He stays in Munich for ten years, and the thirteen-hour episodes of Heimat 2 cover this timeframe. Each of them focuses on another person among Hermann's classmates, people looking for a "second home" like him, be it music, film or anything else in which they can finally live peacefully. <br /> < Like the first home, this second cycle is a perfect combination of film and television: the episodic structure and the various romantic subplaces make it look like a soap opera; in fact, The Second Home must be seen in its entirety to be accepted successfully while some chapters of Home 1 might be considered separate stories (especially the story of Hermann's teenage years)), the style and content are pure Auteur cinema, with the familiar black and white color transitions (actually somewhat predictable) and ambiguous characters. The latter element is underlined by the relationship between Hermann and the cello player Clarissa Lichtblau (Salome K ammer): They love each other clearly, but they always deal with other people and delay the inevitable until it is too late. This time, Reitz seems to be more pessimistic about his characters (at a certain point in time, Hermann is disillusioned: "The Beatles are way better than us!") And builds entire episodes around dark, controversial topics like abortion and suicide. The decade he explores is not for everyone, as some of the defining events of the 1960s (notably the 1968 revolution) are dramatically shaken. Reitz also seems to be doing it in a series especially for movie lovers, given the numerous film references (including a brilliant Casablanca quote) and smart jokes (an episode takes place in Venice whose film festival has made an important contribution to the success of the home saga). And since 1992, film lovers have repeatedly thanked him for delivering 26 of the most compelling hours ever for celluloid.
