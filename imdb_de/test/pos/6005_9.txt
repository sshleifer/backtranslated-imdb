This production was pretty well done for a TV original, which offers a very reasonable inclination to Swift's work. For the frame story to work well, the movie begins when Gulliver comes home. Anyone who has read the book knows that it will happen anyway. The frame story of the book has Gulliver's confused confusion in sections. He is horrified, for example, that he will crush little people in England because he has just returned from a land of giants. But the movie has all the book sections within a long journey. When Gulliver talks about his travels, the cuts from England to the voyages are very effective. I confess that at first I found them intrusive and irritating, then they became natural. In the end, they have become a welcome addition to the story. As he relates his adventures to a larger and larger audience, more and more people are listening to his intriguing fantasy, though they doubt his truth. For example, his hatred of dirty Yahoo and admiration for the pure logic of the fourth section comes into its own when he defends his own sanity. The intermediate cuts between events in England and similar events or scenes in the story are very effective. For example, if you tear the cloth off the table to suggest the movement of the tow of a group of ships, filming is inspired. The addition of Gulliver's family, which is threatened by the lecherous physician, works well. Swift just points out that the long-lived woman is protesting against further travel. It will be a natural part of this story. The casting and acting were consistently competent. Some roles were exemplary. Omar Sharif's crazy magician is great. O'Toole's Little Emperor is lovingly evasive of senility. Many specific complaints made by other authors here are a simple personal preference for me, and that's what we are here for. I have read the shortened version several times a year from the fourth grade. Although I missed the full version up to a college class, I have read it a few times since then. And I had to start it again when I started to read about this movie. While the Danson version is superior to all previous films, it does not replace the book. However, I think that it will bring many readers to this book. If you have not read the book, enjoy this movie and then go to the source. If you appreciate the satire in it, you will find Swift's "A Modest Proposal" and his "Draper's Letter." Both are satires who attack the miserable treatment of Ireland and the Irish during Swift's time. The draper protests against cheap, bloated copper coins dropped on Ireland. These were Wood's light coins that were not suitable for the face value of paying taxes and government debt. The outcry from Swift's satire led to the coins being sent to another mistreated British territory, the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and this movie are just fun. You can not change human nature. Give Danson's agonizing experience a chance. I think you will get them thinking and entertaining.
