This movie had everything I need in a movie: - Women, Skateboarding, Violence, Music by H.I.M and Tony Hawk !!! The artwork and the camera effects in this movie are amazing. The music in this movie is the best I've ever heard in another movie. Every track fits so well with his scene. I really liked the acting, considering that there was not a crew of Bams in scripts yet. Although the entire concept of the film is the story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend (Glauren) sleeping behind Hellboy's back with Hellboy, it's a predictable and ancient story. How they behave is very unpredictable, for example: Falcone and the gas tank, Raab himself, Dunn break the bottles behind the Wawa and all the Don Vito scenes. This movie is a must!
