Todd Sheets, an indie horror writer, returns with another entertaining, vile nickel-and-time video clunker that is basically just a faint pardon, getting as much watery as possible and shiny guts around as often as possible to fling. An evil demon scarecrow wakes the dead as voracious zombies with faces to enjoy the living. A bunch of hardened college kids, a trio of dangerous escaped convicts led by the vicious Slade (Byron Nichodemus pounded it to an unprecedented degree), two equally cruel sleazeball gays and a trio of hottie sisters must do their best to That was it for the unnecessarily confused and confused conspiracy, but fortunately, this vile cry of narrative lacks much, which it more than compensates for with a pleasing abundance of gorgeous coarse blood. Disgusting highlights include a woman who has chopped off her fingers, a lethal shot into the groin of a young girl, attempted necrophilic rape, gutting, and of course more repulsive food than shaking a pile of damp intestines. We also have a rough, grainy cinematography that constantly switches between washed-out colors and dirty black-and-white faux-staged battle scenes, lousy acting out of a uniformly pathetic no-name cast (especially Jerry Angell cops's shabbiest top collection) dishonored for his ridiculously ugly ones Histrionics as a slimy no-count psycho criminal (Joe Bob), a blazing Thrash Metal soundtrack, and a generic Shivery'n'ominous synthesizer score. Let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which some of our survivors stumble over a few vials of carnivorous bacteria to use on the shabby undead hordes. Sure, this movie is not a shit, but it does have a kind of horribly disgusting quality that makes it a terrible grade Z fun for hardcore fans of bad horror.
