Gary Cooper (Michael Brandon) played the role of a US millionaire who had seven bad marriages but always divorced his wife with a lot of money to live on. Michael is in Paris on business and goes to a French department store to buy a pair of pajama tops, and salespeople refuse to sell him only the tops. Nicole DeLoiselle (Claudette Colbert) listens to this conversation and offers to buy the bottom of these pajamas. Michael is very interested in Nicole and they have the opportunity to meet and make appointments. It does not take long for Michael Nicole to propose the marriage and she is very withdrawn because she really does not know him very well. As soon as she finds out that she will become Michael's eighth wife, she begins to change her mind and this story becomes very entertaining and humorous. Do not miss this movie, it's a great entertainment from seasoned actors. Enjoy.
