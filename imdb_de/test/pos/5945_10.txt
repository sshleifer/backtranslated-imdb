It's a profoundly silly humor ... but I loved it. Jean Dujardin is a great actor in this movie. Bérénice Béjo is sweet. It makes fun of the secret agents like James Bond: refreshing !!! It's probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. I've seen it three times and still want to see it. Buy the DVD as soon as possible. You will not regret it. It's a kind of movie where you do not need a great scenario because it's a parody. The only flaw is that OSS 117 is too short. It is a gem. It's not very common for a French movie to be successful in the US, but I think this movie has everything to be successful. Trust me !!!
