Boogie Nights is full of surprises, nothing prepares you for his soul. Yes, he has a soul, while he deals with the ironiest smile and respect with the stickiest topic. Brilliantly charged and wonderful character development, the performances somehow combine the best of the stage acting with improvisation in a cinema style. <br /> <br /> The plot proved to be richer than I expected, and the underlying issues are each deeply teased. "B-grade" man is brought into perspective by the crisis. <br /> <br /> The dream of a case study of a sociologist, the film reflects the raw truth of what we all know about self esteem, parental love and lack of it. It is the attention / love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood that desperate need to belong. Something for everyone ... almost camouflaged by untouchables and their own milieu, but of course they are universal. <br /> <br /> The movie works on different levels. The ironic loop is that the environment depicted is just because of the voyeurism watching the movie ... <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights does not judge the subject and the characters, but a rarity. It deserves every award and more.
