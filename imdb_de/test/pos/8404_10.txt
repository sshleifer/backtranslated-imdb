With Wind and Scarlett gone are two different films that should never be compared. Obviously, gwtw's original actors all died and earned their own praise and praise. Up to half of gwtw's praise, but to my shock, Scarlett was as well written as gwtw scarlett. It deserves just as much honors for scarlett, a-number 1 was perfect as a result. Bravo! Director producer and all actors Bravo! AS sequels rarely live up to their name, and it's the same as its predecessor. For those who do not like it, you miss the point and a great end to the phenomenal beginning
