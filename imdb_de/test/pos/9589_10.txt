OK ... time for a bit of fun, I think. It's been two years since I submitted my original comments praising this top-notch footy comedy ... and the damn thing has not made it to video or DVD (or even repeats it on TV!). !) !!!!! <br /> <br /> Does anyone know out there, why not? Was there a BBC-like error where the original copy was deleted / misplaced / deleted? <br /> <br /> Listen to the ITV officers - beat them on DVD now !!! Do you even know how funny this program was? "Mike Bassett" looks as bad as the current Hosen Spurs team. <br /> <br /> Rumble over. For the moment.
