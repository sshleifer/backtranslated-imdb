I've never seen the original "House Of Wax", so I really did not know what to expect when I got a taste of the new movie. After a bit wobbly start of our young characters "House Of Wax" changes gears and becomes a very effective horror trip. <br /> <br /> The plot really does not matter - I think most people know It looks like these stranded kids are meeting a bad killer and finding some terrible things in the Titular House of Wax , This is all about the special effects and they are first class. Spectators who like their horror movies with a lot of blood will be satisfied here, but there are also other scary effects. The production design and sets are superb, and the cast makes the most of their signed roles. Of course, many people probably wonder what Paris Hilton's performance is like. To be honest, Hilton is doing well, and she is not "herself", as so many people predict. Her character is sexy and sweet, and I think her good work will hopefully change the minds of many people about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good and pulls out of her previous movie, the gruesome "The Girl Next Door". Her character goes through a lot, and Cuthbert proves to be a fiery heroine. Chad Michael Murray is pretty to look at like Hilton and Cuthbert, but unfortunately he's not very convincing as the group's bad boy. <br /> <br /> I predict good things for "House Of Wax". As the audience roared and shouted and slapped through many parts of the movie at the screening I was attending. Congratulations to the performers and the crew for a good job. <br /> <br /> And congratulations to Paris Hilton that many people are wrong. As she always says - "that's hot."
