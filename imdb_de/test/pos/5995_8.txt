<br /> <br /> This movie has some really impressive action scenes. Humor and plot mix well, though the intensity of the film does not last until the end. The final scene is a slight anti-climax in terms of action quality and the amazing explosiveness of the previous scenes. The humor does not seem to be as ridiculously awkward as in many other Hong Kong movies, and this film is a completely different class from most American action comedies of recent years. Lau Ching-Wan acts as a typical, intuitive police hero, mocking inadmissible orders from incompetent police officers. The dialectic of the film is based on the superhuman coolness and ruthlessness of the drug gang, which humiliates the police while providing a heavy dose of lead poisoning with a variety of machine guns. Leaves many bodies. Yu Rong-Guang is particularly impressive as an extremely cool, merciless gangster in this Woo-like action where tough guys are really hard-core.
