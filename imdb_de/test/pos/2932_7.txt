I mean, let's be honest, all you have to do in modeling is posing for photos. The assessment is so exaggerated with their criticism. However, the show is entertaining, especially with Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, J. Alexander and the supermodel even Twiggy. I saw season 5, 6, 7 and in the middle of Season 8. It looks like American Idol has become sexy, but I'm a guy and I just watch it because of the hot girls posing in their bikinis! The show can be quite boring when it comes to straightening, Tyra tends to go on and on, and it's really disgusting. Would I still recommend it? Yes, would I recommend it to women who want to get into the modeling business? No.
