I finally saw the real reason why Peter Boyle became famous. It was not the monster in "Young Frankenstein" or Frank Barone on "Everybody Loves Raymond." For younger people who only know him from TV, try this movie, Frank looks like a saint. <br /> <br /> "Joe" is Boyle in his best acting role and as someone said, he most likely gave the inspiration for "Archie Bunker" on "All In The Family". I think Boyle even went back a bit to "Joe" to play Frank. (I say that because I noticed the basement of "Joe" and Frank Barone looks similar.) <br /> <br /> I did not know about this movie when I checked it out of the library, I just knew Boyle and Susan Sarandon was introduced. Yes, Susan looks great here and a very good early role for a young actress. A young hippie wants to be who escapes and lives with his parents, the ultimate in a drug-induced haze hippie who also sells as much as he buys. After an almost deadly overdose On too many pills, she is in the hospital while her parents go pick up their things. Her mother does not go to the stinking, rundown flat, but her dad does it. As dad brings her things together, her friend comes home and the two words, and then the dad does what we'll hear later, as Joe says he would like to do with a hippie. Joe shoots his mouth as he hates different cultures / races, hippies and a laundry list of others. When he says, "I really would like to kill one of them," says the father (trying to look like a joke), "I just did it." Joe almost buys it, but makes fun of it. <br /> <br /> Later, when the police are at the scene and the story is in the newspaper, Joe realizes that he was not joking. Instead of nagging the rich for money by extortion, he somehow blackmailed him. I just wanted him and his wife to "get to know" him and his wife. Long story short, their association is uncomfortable, but after Sarandon has heard of what her father did, he risks falling out. <br /> <br /> How all this ends up, you have to observe for yourself. Although over 35 years ago, the end is something you will not expect. Unless, of course, you've already seen the movie before. I especially recommend it for those who have not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> 10 Stars for Boyle not only play someone who faces his nature, but show what he will show others that he was more than just a television comedy actor. (THE END)
