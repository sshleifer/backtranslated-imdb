I just can not see this piece very often, it's full of true enthusiasm and wisdom that Mickey Mouse had in his first 30 years. Nowadays, Mickey is a wise ass, if you compare that. Steamboat Willie always makes me smile, at least the end of Mickey's laugh after meeting a parrot with a potato. The animation is very nice and although the steamboat Willie has no dialogue, the music is classic enough, but also because it is so fun and always fun to see.
