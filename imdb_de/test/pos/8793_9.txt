Well, I should say, "the only movie that relates to club / DJ / electronic music and raves ... the respect of the ravers". Seriously. It is a wonderfully funny, fast and pretty accurate representation of the night of a raven. It's in a club, in Wales and a bit dated. The film omits some of the more sketchy elements of the club's life, but does not completely dissociate from them. It's an idyllic yet serious portrayal of the highs and lows of the characters' lives. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the film and the best element of Justin Kerrigan's script are the characters, eccentric, unique and yet completely understandable and accessible. This simple movie would not work and would be infinitely less entertaining if it were not for Jip, Koop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Viewers can deny the political and social implications of the subtext of Human Traffic as a drug film, Trainspotting wannabe, an important link in British youth culture (circa 90s), BUT .... they can not deny that these are seductive characters , > <br /> It's wild, it's brutally honest, it's sobering, it's overkill, but it's a great comedy. <br /> <br /> Raves are a complex matter, as are the drugs that are taken at these events, as well as the people you will encounter. But somebody who's gone to parties is dull and keeps going ... Human traffic is the best snapshot that could be taken by the subculture. Whatever you do, avoid "groove" as this is the opposite of anything good for human traffic.
