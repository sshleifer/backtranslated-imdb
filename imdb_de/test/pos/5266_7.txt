Florence Vidor plays the daughter of a strict Bible-father who throws her out of the house when the gossip falsifies her name. In the city she finds the dying wife of her own brother (the two had secretly married) and raises her child alone. Years later, she returns home to face her family. <br /> <br /> This old melodrama is full of fascinating feminist themes (circa 1921, but remarkably modern). Part of it is applied with a trowel (Theodore Roberts raises his eyebrows like a father), but he is dramatically and lovingly put together and put together by cinematographer Henry Sharp.
