This was my second experience in the Monkey Island series, seven years after I showed the first game. What was my answer? "Oh, great, we're playing a cartoon." I am glad that my brother silenced me and continued playing because the jokes caught my attention again, as well as Armato's wonderful voice by Guybrush - not to mention all the others who were well done (I still think, that CMIs Elaine sounds better than EMI). The cut scenes show well what happens, and the art of both the game and the cut scenes is superb. When we found the original CD, Secret and LeChuck's Revenge, we were both thrilled and spent hours working through Revenge - one such moment was the moment we sat down and blew half a day on it. However, CMI is the Monkey Island game I played the most, especially for the return of swordplay and the fight on the high seas. At that moment, when you meet Kenny and he tells you that he's gone straight and then, "I'm running rifles!" Both my brother and I had tears of laughter. And that's not the best part of the game, not nearly.
