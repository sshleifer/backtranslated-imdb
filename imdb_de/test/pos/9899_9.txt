The timing of the release of this movie could not be better, especially given the turbulence of today's world. The film is heartwarming, lovable and funny a piece. If you have siblings and still have living parents, this will be good for the viewer. If you have lost your parents, you will be deeply touched. The laughs come frequently, the ensemble cast works very well together and is credible. This film is written intelligently, and the lines that come from the actors often make the audience laugh aloud. There are moments that bring tears to your eyes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who respects the importance of the family and can pursue an intelligent movie.
