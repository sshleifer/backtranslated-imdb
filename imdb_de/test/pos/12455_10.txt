Observe it with an open mind, it is very different, nothing is vile. Very well made realistic story of Tarzan. The animatronics chimpanzees are doing well for '84, Christopher Lambert was a brilliant imitation of the chimpanzee language and behavior. I would not be surprised if he took lessons from Jane Goodall.
