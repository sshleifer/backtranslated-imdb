One of the best war movies I've ever seen, if not the best. It is very difficult to talk about such films because it is very difficult to point out a filming error. The "problem" is how it looks too real, and it pulls you into the ruins of Stalingrad and makes you suffer for both sides. This is because, unlike most Hollywood movies, this movie does not glorify the war or heroism of the main characters. Instead, the movie turns them into heroes just because they're human, and that's why anti-war is as much as the reasons can. Extremely convincing war scenes and such impressive acting make most scenes look like isolated plays. In addition, the German army is played by Germans, which is so convincing. The film is produced and realized by Germans, where you can see their love of detail to perfection. That's why "Stalingrad" is one of those films that I can see millions of times and never get boring. I saw the film with my dad, who fought in World War II, and the first thing he said was, "That's real, that's what the war against the Germans looked like." This is the place to see what it looked like to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of wartime history in history and at the turning point of World War II: Stalingrad.
