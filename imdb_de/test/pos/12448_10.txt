Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines, Iowa. Nine bandmates, all wearing custom booster suits and personalized, self-made masks (eg # 6 clown mask, # 0s different gas masks, # 8s shredded + torn crash test dummy mask with dreadlocks). The music itself seems to cross the line between normal and normal, yet it is so brilliant and psychotic. <br /> <br /> "Welcome To Our Neighborhood" sounds more like a generic title, but the footage itself is different. Interviews with the band, soundbites from their latest self-titled album, 2 live performances and a music video banned by MTV (a brilliant tribute to the classic Kubrick movie "The Shining"), the movie is not even half that size. an hour, but it is definitely worth it. It's perfect to introduce any metal / hardcore fan at Slipknot.
