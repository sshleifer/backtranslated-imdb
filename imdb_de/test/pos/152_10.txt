After seeing Oldboy, I was a little disappointed with the rest of Park's work. Part of it is good, but it never approaches the level of humor and originality Oldboy had. It does, it's nothing in the plot or style with Oldboy, but the same level of quality is there. <br /> <br /> The show is good when Kang-ho Song, OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin deliver excellent performances. Above all, Kim manages to switch from the horrifying horror scenes to the surreal comedy, without the slightest misstep. The plot is weird with lots of twists and turns and grapples with the vampire clichÃ©s /> <br /> The director is just right with tons of speed and humor and some of the most memorable scenes I've ever seen. It boasts the probably strangest love scene you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie.
