I have seen this movie a few times, and at every sight I still feel the excitement of a journey and the frustration of having to overcome the barriers that hinder the way. It is more than just a desire to find a home; It is about the basic human mind to navigate the world, to overcome desperation, to face the characters who deter our purposes. These human efforts are based on the challenge of rethinking the origin of life. Though infused with serious ideas, this movie has just enough funny lines to make the audience hopeful. It is surprisingly funny. The implementation of the plot is excellent! This is all packed with visually appealing animation. A must see. <br /> <br />
