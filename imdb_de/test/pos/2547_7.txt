Some critics have compared Chop Shop with the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote. I have seen both as good as Chop Shop and as in many cases I do not believe the comparison is justified. City of God and Pixote certainly had a much higher budget. Chop Shop is an independent low-budget movie about survival and hope, disappointment and survival. One of the scenes was allegedly filmed during the US Open and either the filmmakers had unbelievable connections or the scene was shot at another time and the US Open footage was added. I say that because I live in the area where this movie was filmed and the security during the tennis games is crazy. It is also noteworthy that the actual names of the actors were the names of their characters in the film. Back to the movie. It's an enjoyable story about survival. However, it got a 7 because ... the actors sometimes did very well. At other times, they just seemed to recite their lines. If the actors were less competent (such as the low-budget The Big Dis), I would have been more forgiving. In several scenes each of these actors gave exemplary performances. At other times they looked bored. The director could be responsible here. I also had problems with the end. This is one of those movies that "just ends". Maybe there is a part 2? Definitely worth a DVD. I will not bother to summarize the story as this information is already available on IMDb.
