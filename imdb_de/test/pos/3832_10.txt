This is one of the best of the early "Star Trek" episodes. Kirk and his crew venture into the unknown to fight with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise as they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racist offshoots of the Vulcans! The young Mr. Stiles, well played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikely characters in the "Star Trek" universe. His barely concealed hatred of Mr. Spock resembles the hatred and mistrust of many Americans for people of Arab or Middle Eastern descent. The atmosphere of wartime paranoia is all too real. Then there are the Romulans: they are the ultimate enemy of the Federation. The Klingons are evil, but fundamentally harmless. rather a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, mean business: they are the ancient Romans who were born again in the space age. Despite their volcanic features, they are clearly reminiscent of imperial Rome with names like Decius and titles like "centurion" and "praetor". The chainmail armor is really cool. Well-known star star Lenard, who later played Spock's daddy Sorek, as well as the Klingon commander in "Star Trek: The Movie" is a suitably crowned, war-weary commander who looks remarkably like Laurence Olivier's Crassus in "Spartacus". His interrogation of the Empire's insatiable thirst for conquest reminds me of the similar concerns expressed by Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) at the beginning of "Gladiator." A must for trekkers as well as for sword lovers.
