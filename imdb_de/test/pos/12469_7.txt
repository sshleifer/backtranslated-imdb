I liked the first part of this movie in Africa for about an hour until the animal cruelty of civilized people in Scotland came to me in the second half and made me so sad that I could not see everything. However, the filmmaker did so to argue that early scientists literally destroyed everything they did not understand by literally "studying" it without taking into account the rights and comfort of the animals we know about this should not be studied, but in the natural world in which they live, and as inconspicuous as possible. I recommend this film because it was a predominantly serious and honest tale of Tarzan and the cruel animal cruelty that was rampant in the scientific world of the nineteenth century, as well as the pure, simple, beautifully primitive life that Tarzan lived as a young man showed who, after the violent death of his parents in the African jungle, was found as a baby and reared by chimpanzees. Christopher Lambert has been wonderful and very soulful in his role as Tarzan, as has Ralph Richardson in his last film role as Tarzan's ultra-rich, aristocratic Gramps in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was pretty and pretty good, as Tarzan's tentative and civilized "Jane" in her first movie role. Because of his charismatic work in this film and his haunting eyes, I can not understand why Lambert did not become a big star later, but his really bad film choices may have hit him later. The fearsome Ian Holm, a wounded Frenchman in Africa With the help of Tarzan, who had then returned Tarzan to his previously unknown home in Scotland, he was as great as ever. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad that Tarzan got sick and did not stay cruel. At that time, civilized the world and ended up going home to Africa to live his life with his loving and affectionate monkey "relatives" who raised him instead of staying in Scotland and living like a king, which would have ruined him if he had not, kill him first
