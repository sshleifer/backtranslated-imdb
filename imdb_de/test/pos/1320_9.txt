There are very few films that can tell such a complicated story on as many levels as Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of storytelling is the ability to blend and forward without affecting the speed of the movie. This film not only flashes back with the greatest ease, but also flows through some of Yukio Mishima's greatest stories. This movie excels in every way and is a pleasure to see. Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass soundtrack.
