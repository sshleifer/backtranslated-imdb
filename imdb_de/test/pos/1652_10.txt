Fantastic movie! One of the best movie noir movies ever made. Bad guys, bad girls, a jewel robbery, a twisted morale, a kidnapping, everything is here. Jean Servais has a face that would make Bogart proud, and the rest of the cast is full of character actors who seem to know that they care for something good. Get popcorn and have a great time.
