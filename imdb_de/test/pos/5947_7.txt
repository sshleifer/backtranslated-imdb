Fans of Pink Panther, Naked Gun or Get Smart will certainly enjoy this farce, which won one César and was nominated for four more. Jean Dujardin is Agent OSS 117, a man who would not know a clue if it hit him on the head. It also reflects the colonial attitude of the West. <br /> <br /> All Russian spies, Nazis and Muslim radicals around him are just as stupid, but there are Larmina (Bérénice Bejo) and the Princess (Aure Atika) to keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> OSS 117 is incredibly capable of learning languages, playing musical instruments the first time and singing like a local, and all are more impressive than Bond's tricks, but he's still stupid.
