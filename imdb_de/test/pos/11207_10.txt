For those who are like me and used to seeing and enjoying Hollywood movies on a high budget, this movie seems so far away on big screens with surround sound. But it surprised me how close everyone can be when I see it. It is so natural that you feel that nobody has written a scenario or that nobody has directed it. You are the director and write the scenario while you see it. For me, the time I spend watching a movie is the only time I go to another world. For me, this movie is the first sample to show that looking at millions of dollars in budgeted movies is not always a must, and surround audio features are going to another world. This movie will take you to another world (or perhaps bring you back to yourself) with no millions of dollars or technical resources. I had the feeling that I read L'etranger from Camus.
