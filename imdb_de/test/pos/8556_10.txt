I've seen this movie maybe 100 times, never get tired of it. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 7 years old, and it has left its mark ever since. It's a charming love story that makes most people sunbathe, even in the darkest of times. I think this is a must-have movie and one of Anthony Quinn's best performances. I only wish that the TV stations would send this movie more often. It inspired me a lot and will surely do that to many others. If there was an actor I wanted to meet, it would have been Anthony Quinn. There will never be a similar picture of him on the screens. I wish Anthony Quinn was alive. May God bless his soul.
