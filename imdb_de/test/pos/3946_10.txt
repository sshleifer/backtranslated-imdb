The weakness lies in the confusing narrative that often comes from nowhere. But it did not really matter, because I still enjoyed it in full length. If you actually accept that these films should not be taken too seriously, you will enjoy it even more. It's basically a love story, at first a confusing one, but when it does, it's really worth it. Sure, it has been done so many times, but the complicated version of it is very stimulating and touching. <br /> <br /> The exaggerated imagination and CGI were overwhelming at first, but I still enjoyed their purpose. And people stopped whining like it was borrowed from other movies !! Guess what we know !! And that does not matter, because it serves humor and entertainment. Sometimes people have to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start complaining. A comparison with the Hollywood standards is absolutely stupid and ignorant. It's a completely different style and a different audience. For me, some of the best movies I have my eyes on are Eastern European producers and directors. There's your Police story 4, Shaolin Football, Kung Fu Hustle, Dragon Tigers Gate, Legendary Fist, Hero, Crouching Tiger, etc. ... Me for one like this movie and haling from the Philippines, USA, England, Libya and now Australia. I will always be interested in this kind of movies. Now try to judge my perception, but I warn you, I see things from the perspective of the five countries in which I lived. So you should be so experienced and open-minded.
