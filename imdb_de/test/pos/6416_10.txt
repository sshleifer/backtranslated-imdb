In the last days of 1999 almost everyone died in Taiwan. A strange plague has shaken the island. Allegedly spread by cockroaches, the disease promotes their victims into a psychosis in which they behave like insects. Finally they die. The Hole takes place in a crumbling apartment building (which is particularly well laid out, a compliment to the stage designer!). His two protagonists live directly above and below each other. The woman is in the basement, and the pipes above her flat lick violently, threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her sanity. She calls a plumber to look, and he accidentally pokes a hole through the floor of the man's apartment. The two have never met before and come in contact through the hole. <br /> <br /> The script is pretty brilliant. Few films are so funny at the same time, while remaining completely human and profoundly exploring the human condition, especially feelings of loneliness and despair. Tsai's direction is just beautiful. Like many other Taiwanese directors, he uses many long takes. But unlike Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai does not overwhelm her. In fact, I do not know if I've ever seen her better used. They are always effective and never boring. <br /> <br /> It would be wrong to check this movie without mentioning the musical numbers. Yes, The Hole is also a musical, a great one. In the best scenes of the film - which says something, considering how good all the other scenes are - the man imagines that the woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. These numbers are completely choreographed, often with backup dancers and singers. In a stroke of genius Tsai lets these elaborately produced numbers take place in the crumbling building, not to hide the signs of apocalypse and decay. This gives a feeling of pathos and absurdity. <br /> <br /> The Hole is a movie that must be seen. It should be a cult classic, if not different. Before I saw that, I was told that it was a decent movie, but probably the worst of Tsai Ming-liang. If that's true, I can not wait to see one more! 10/10.
