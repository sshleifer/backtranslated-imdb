This movie was different. It took a typical thriller story and sought a more interesting, deeper look at the struggle of a single character with faith. It helped, of course, that the main performance of Andrew McCarthy was very good. The other performances were also quite interesting, if not so constant. The end was a little disappointed, but there were many good moments. The filmmakers have tried something different here - they have not just opted for the obvious shivering conditions. This is a dark movie (not for everyone), but if you want to talk and do not want to talk about it, try this movie.
