I remember watching this series eagerly every Saturday night. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything about it, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music of Clannad (I still have her Legend album). I loved the way they solved the problem when Michael Praed left by creating another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I think there were legends of several Robins in the Middle Ages. Another thing that I loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors. I'm sure Robin and his men would be young after all humans did not live that long. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent looked like Robin's grandfather). The only sad thing was the end, it's a shame that they could not have at least done a one-time special to tie up all the loose ends and come to a happier end.
