Hilary was great as Julie and Pat was once again great as Mr. Miyagi, but there should have been more references to the other three films! I mean, come on! First of all, where is Daniel? Miyagi briefly mentions him and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and should at least have appeared in the film. He could have helped Miyagi to train Julie-san! On the other hand, the music remained true to the film, with a little more instrumentation (fretless bass) as a companion to the wonderfully played pan-flute! It does not feel like a karate kid movie unless you hear this panpipe! Thank you, Zamfir! All in all a decent movie! We miss you, Noriyuki!
