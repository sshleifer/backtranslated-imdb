This movie was one of three that was later grouped by Chapin into a compilation released in the late 1950s titled "The Chaplin Review." <br /> <br /> This was a strange movie in some ways. Later in life Chaplin was anti-war and his films emphasized peace and brotherhood. In contrast, this film is a propaganda comedy designed to support US efforts during the First World War. It is really strange to see Charlie as a "super soldier", single-handedly arresting 13 Germans, casually and coolly shooting several Germans as snipers within seconds and then stepping behind the enemy lines to capture the emperor himself! This really was a great departure for the Little Tramp, although at the same time it was very entertaining and funny. The film is exceptionally well done, well done, and I'm sure it has strongly supported the support of our troops at home (too bad it was a pointless and costly war).
