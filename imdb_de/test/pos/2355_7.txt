Saw this movie for the first time in 1953 with my older brother. It was one of the big films of 3 Demension released at that time. We have seen it at least thirteen times and were proud of it. Scott does a typical western shoot job while being surrounded by Indian arrows rather than surround sound. Oh, again for these Polaroid lenses.
