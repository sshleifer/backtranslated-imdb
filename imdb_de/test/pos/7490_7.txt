It's so reminiscent of movies like PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS that you can not believe that Tarantino's films were not an inspiration for THIS THURSDAY. This is not bad for a cheap B-series movie. The gangster story is captivating and witty and also has some dark humor and sarcasm that we can find in PULP FICTION. The resources were not safe, but the movie is well produced. The spectacle is good too. I enjoyed the scene when the girl sat on the sofa and teased the doctor ... It was hot and funny at the same time! The soundtrack is nice, too. I have not heard too many songs, but I've liked the ones I've heard. I score it with 7/10.
