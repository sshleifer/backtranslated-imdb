This is an excellent, little-known movie. Tom Selleck plays a prominent role in this film with the Japanese "Clint Eastwood". I would like to see if this movie was still released on DVD. There are some places that have been clearly shortened. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) has obviously cut some parts. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the movie. The baseball sequences are by far the most realistic of all baseball movies. I'm pretty sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players. I love to load the tape of this movie at least once a year. The best scenes include the lack of hat-tipping after Tom invaded the big game, and a highly sensual scene in which Tom has a hot bath with Hiroku. Dennis Haysbert is also doing a great job. It's good to see that he finally gets some recognition, not just in baseball movies (he's also in the Major League).
