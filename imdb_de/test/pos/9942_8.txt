Betty is a cast for the lead role in a production of Verdi's Macbeth. When a car mysteriously hits the lead, Betty is put in the limelight. Opening Night is a great success and Betty decides to leave the after-party to party privately with her boyfriend. As the friend leaves the room, Betty is seized by an unknown figure masked in black gloves. The unknown assailant ties Betty to a pillar, gags her, and puts needles under her eyes, causing incredible damage and pain should Betty close them. The friend returns to the room and is stunned to see Betty in such a position. He is even more shocked when the killer grabs him and pushes a knife through his lower jaw with such force. The knife tip is clearly visible in his mouth. And Betty had to watch all this. So Betty's terrible ordeal begins with a murderer who not only aims to hurt her, but also forces her to watch her maim her friends some ways off the model. Less emphasis is placed on the mysterious elements of the story than in Argentos Tenebre or The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. The black-masked killer is ubiquitous, but the clues and red herrings that are usually associated with a good giallo are missing. Instead, Opera is all about the thrill of an unknown killer and makes the audience uncomfortable. The focus is on the gruesome death scenes, Betty's fear and the obsession of the killer with Betty. <br /> <br /> Opera offers some of my most artistic death scenes in Argento. When the killer grabs Betty after her boyfriend leaves the room, you're sure Betty had it. But the sadistic killer just wants to force Betty to watch him stab her lover brutally in the throat. the knife appeared in his mouth. It's a well shot and designed scene. And those needles in the eyes? brilliant. Or take the seamstress's death. At first, her death seems like an ordinary, normal murder. As the seamstress inadvertently swallows the killer's medallion, another stage of death turns into another level, as the killer uses a pair of scissors to cut the girl's throat to get his chain. Finally, there is the most famous death scene in Opera, which baffles me every time I see it. Mira is shot in the eye while looking through a keyhole. This scene shows a lot of what I like about Argento. It has style to burn. As implausible as it may be, it is creative, memorable and a true sight. Argento certainly was not the first Italian director who focused on eye-breaking a new level. Needles that stop the eyes, a bullet in the eye, and ravens that pick an eye are part of Argento's vision (pun intended). And these scenes have the effect that I believe Argento intended. When I saw for the first time how the killer looked into the eyes of Betty, I could not stop blinking. It actually had a physical effect on me. What is it about the eyes that make them an abuse target in Italian films? <br /> <br /> To be fair (and not sound like a fan), there are problems with Opera that keep me from rating it as the best of Argento. One of my problems concerns the airline system that runs through Betty's apartment building. Although I have no doubt that there are duct systems in older dwellings connecting the apartments, the canals in Opera are HUGE. I'm not an expert, but I sincerely doubt that any building like this in this movie would have had such mammoth channels. It does not seem to be practical at all. And do not you think that someone would have done something long ago to keep criminals and curious neighbors out of the other apartments? It's handy for the plot, but not very realistic. <br /> <br /> But I suppose my biggest problem with the movie comes with the finale. What's wrong with this end? It feels totally out of place, and like a bad reflection. I do not know what else to say when it's awful.
