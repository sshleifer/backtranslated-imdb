Hal Hartley's entry into a European film series is one of his two or three best efforts yet, and fortunately one of the few available on DVD. With only 63 minutes running time, my only criticism of Hartley would be that I want more, but never as much as this time. Martin Donovan is amazing like Jesus. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting as Magdelena, but the highlight for me was Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry Fool) as Satan. Hartley gives him an excellent dialogue and the chance to bring his resonant voice to full effect. Look at three scenes with a microphone waiting for him, as if the devil were winning a poetry slam. I have read other comments on this movie and had to add mine as there is not enough praise. If you like Henry Fool, Martin Donovan in something (contrary to sex) and / or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas, you should get this as soon as possible.
