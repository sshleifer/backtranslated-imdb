This is an OK horror movie from the early 80s, in which a young girl (Meg Tilly) wants to take her "Goody Two Shoes Image" and becomes part of a gang of girls called The Sisters. Her initiation is to spend the night in a mausoleum. Too bad that the mausoleum is the "last" resting place of Psycho-Russians and he is not quite dead yet. It looks like this guy was found in his apartment. There were many things in the walls in his apartment. There was also a bunch of young dead girls in the closet. All the evidence that hitchhiking can be dangerous, so listen to girls. The daughter of this man (Reymar) is quite desperate about the death of her father and is confronted by a man who says he knows Reymar and has also given a tape to listen to. Her husband (Adam West, famous by Batman) is there to laugh and scoff and not much else. But it seems that Reymar's daughter may also have some abilities she does not recognize. Anyway, after depositing their unfortunate promise in the mausoleum, the other The Sisters set out to fetch things (like masks, sheets, etc.) to come back and scare the crap out of them, but they do not suspect what's up you get more than the crap out of them. For even in death Reymar is a busy guy and animates many corpses for entertainment. And it also seems that he has something for the prison bait. Overall, this is an acceptable horror, nothing too intense, but not terrible. The DVD from Media Blasters also contains a different version of the film, which is a rough cut. I guess I just saw a bit of it, so I do not know how different it is from the theatrical version, but from what I've seen, it's a "warts and all" presentation. 7 out of 10.
