The biggest movie of all time. <br /> <br /> What about a fight? But when we look at it cinematically, Three Colors Red is a masterpiece. It's not enough to say that - Three Colors Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not really good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to step back, then Three Colors Red is the most important masterpiece of all time. Three Colors Red works as a discussion of human morality on an extremely metaphysical level with a depth that can not suit anyone. Blue went almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped because it would pull the rabbit out of its hat. White forced us to think about the humanity of equality - in retrospect this was even better, but not quite there. Red, however, is the real thing. What he expresses in this film is an expression of what it is to be human. In fact, it expresses what it feels like to be human. It forces us to examine, down to the smallest detail, the nature of our souls, of our ethical selves. In red you can find meaning on one of its different levels. At the first level, Red achieves a high degree of probability - we could easily call it an exceptionally entertaining story. However, the inherent coincidences of the film and its imaginations compel us to regard the film as a film. It is as if Kieslowski would say: "Ceci n'est pas la réalité". In pursuing a humanistic goal, Kieslowski can challenge reality as well. It is a trick that Kieslowski has tried since Le Double Vie de Véronique, but it was only in this last film that he managed to achieve this divine entanglement of fate, philosophy and circumstance. Even the actors and actresses seem to be at the mercy of a greater power. Valentine (Irène Jacob) is an apt name, because she seems to be an almost pure love. Meanwhile, the idea of ​​the first impression of Jean-Louis Tritignant's judge Kern is questioned, a Kantian man who eventually becomes an almost omniscient observer of events - a figure that symbolically has the power to bring together characters - a force to make people happy, a power he could only achieve through Valentine. <br /> <br /> We have the ability to watch movies as more than just a series of pictures. In fact, films have the potential to be more meaningful than literature. Of course it will not happen, but at least we have the power to watch this movie, and know that it gives us the power to achieve something we can not define, but own all. A summary of this film was: "A movie about a woman who runs over a dog". Well, that's it. <br /> <br /> Is not it? <br /> <br /> -Simon Huxtable <br /> <br />
