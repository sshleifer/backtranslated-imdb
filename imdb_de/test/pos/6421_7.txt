It was the first time I heard of this when I was searching the Internet for reviews of another Italian giallo / horror, the contemporary perfume of the Lady in Black (1974, whose R2 SE DVD by Raro Video was recently purchased). ? where it is called similar, but just as well. Now that I've seen FOOTSTEPS for myself, I can see where the reviewer came from. both films deal with the psychological breakdown of her female protagonist. Stylistically, however, this owes much more than anything else to Art House cinema? in particular the work of Alain Resnais and Michelangelo Antonioni (and in particular LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD [1961] and THE PASSENGER [1975]); Accordingly, some have accused it of being "dead boring"? an epithet that is often associated with such an "overbearing" (read: cerebral) fare! <br /> <br /> In any case, the film includes the search of a woman (Florinda Bolkan) to determine her movements in the last three days. she does not seem to have any memory of that. After a series of cryptic hints, she travels to the "mythical" land of Garma (near places carry the equally fictitious names Muda and Rheember)? where she encounters several people (including Lila Kedrova as the resort's aristocratic regent), who is said to remember the heroine who stayed there during her "blackout"! Most prominent, however, are a young man (Peter McEnery) and a young girl (Nicoletta Elmi, by Mario Bavas BARON BLOOD [1972])? The former always seems to be on the spot in favorable moments, while the latter seems to confuse Bolkan with another woman (with long red hair and a bold stroke!). <br /> <br /> This is essentially a sentiment Still a gripping mystery: inevitably vague events happen at a deliberate pace ?? and where much of the film's strength depends on the remarkable central achievement (which may be considered an extension of Bolkan's role in the fine Lucio Fulci giallo, A LIZER IN WOMAN, [1971]). However, the contribution of cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (who offers a series of sweeping camera shifts and an effective color scheme) can not be denied by using orange / red / blue filters to create atmosphere and find a saturated look for the confusing finale) and Nicola Piovani's matching melancholic score (the composer is now known for his Oscar-winning work on Roberto Benigni's Holocaust-tragic comedy LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (1997)). <br /> <br /> With this in mind, it's worth debating how FOOTSTEPS was presented in the version I'm looking for: well, seemingly hard to come by in its original form (I can not be sure if it's uncut here or not, except that the movie ran for 89 minutes, while the IMDb lists it at 96, this issue is selected from a rather battered English-language VHS (the dubbing is surprisingly good in the light of the international cast) with branded Swedish subtitles (as well as the DivX Copy) for a few seconds at a frozen crucial point in the story around the 82-minute mark)! Nevertheless, we receive a welcome bonus, z. For example, enjoy a 9-minute 'Highlights From The Soundtrack' in MP3 format. <br /> <br /> I know that I have not yet commented on the Moon Mission subplot that Klaus Kinski belongs to: by the way, by that time he had a similarly short but pivotal role in another good arty thriller with science fiction films (and also in a unique place)? namely LIFESPAN (1974). While looking at the film, I could not figure out what the possible connection was with the central plot, except that Bolkan mentioned a recurring dream about a movie she had once seen, though not to the very end, called Footsteps On The Moon "(a slightly misleading alternative title for the movie itself)? Strangely enough, she first remembers the picture as BLOOD ON THE MOON (which of course is a classic 1948 Western Noir with Robert Mitchum and is directed by Robert Wise!). However, I took this "distraction" as just another foreign touch to the film (considering Bolan's former employment as a translator at a conference in which he spoke about the future of the earth)? And certainly not expecting the astronauts to emerge at the very end of Garma's beach to track the female trail, where the sand ominously merges into the lunar surface ??! <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie will probably make more sense on a second look. To be honest, this is best a visual / acoustic experience, and one should not really expect it to deliver a narrative that is clear and easy to rationalize in every way! The only other effort Bazzoni made before was mid-level Straight Giallo THE FIFTH CORD (1971) with Franco Nero (whom I recently recorded on Italian television). Some time ago I got his western spaghetti version of "Carmen" titled MAN, PRIDE AND VENGEANCE (1968)? also with Nero and Kinski ?? as DivX (after missing a matinee show)? but the conversion had somehow proved to be faulty and the disc could not be played properly!
