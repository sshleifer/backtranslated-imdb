Jack Palance (John Witting) was usually a bad guy in most of his films and showed in this movie his great acting talents that exceeded my expectations. John Witting unexpectedly returns to his son's farm after years and years of separation. Christopher Walken (Jacob) finds it hard to accept his father's appearance after spending the night in the family barn. Jacob's son and younger daughter greet her new grandfather and accept him as much as he, a very old man, at the end of his ropes. Glenn Close (Sarah Witting) takes on the role of John Witting and begins to learn the truth of what happened to him during his long absence from the family. This is a very warm and affectionate down-to-earth movie about real events that happen and go on in most families over generations.
