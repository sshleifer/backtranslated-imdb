I read the comment from Ashew and thought that they must have seen a completely different picture! <br /> <br /> I just saw the movie this morning and was pretty surprised. <br /> <br /> To comment on Ashew's comments: <br /> <br /> Trail Street is a very successful Western. <br /> <br /> And Randolph Scott was pretty much there! <br /> <br/> Gabby Hayes was funnier than I have ever seen him! <br /> <br /> The bad guys had very good experiences from my point of view. <br /> <br /> Plus: <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see Robert Ryan as a straight -laced good guy - he's usually so slimy. All in all a good western, played and written very well. <br /> <br /> I liked the back story of Kansas and the "winter wheat," which supposedly helped make it a state. <br /> <br /> I thought the girl, the Susan played was lovely - I can not think why she did not become a bigger star!
