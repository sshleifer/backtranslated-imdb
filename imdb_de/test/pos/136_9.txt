I had not expected much because of the harsh reviews and therefore enjoyed the movie a lot. Smoother colors and less stunning image compositions than some of his previous films, in my opinion, put the narrative in the spotlight. Although the religious conflict in a vampire movie was commonplace, I felt that many of the other things were not. For example: <br /> <br /> how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her. <br /> <br /> the very strong and well-made love scenes. <br /> <br /> The symbolism of The Man, whom they have killed to get closer to each other, separates them even more. <br /> <br /> Her strong differences in what it means to be a "vampire", created through her previous life experiences. > the absence of numerous other vampires that appear or arise through the film. <br /> <br /> I've heard and read a few things about 'tricks in other films'. Of course. However, I feel that tricks are used to emphasize what's going on in the scene, and I feel like he's doing well. I do not need a director to apply new tricks. I prefer that the tricks used are used well and appropriately, which in my opinion is the case with this film. <br /> <br /> I recommend it.
