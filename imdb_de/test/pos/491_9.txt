hi <br /> <br /> Blade is a sensational action movie. The hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain have lived up to their roles. <br /> <br /> The action sequences of the movie are better than Matrix! <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes is one of the best action heroes ever. <br /> <br /> If you like action / vampire movies, this is the ONE, given the fact that so many vampire movies have been made before, pretty well. But that's the best of them. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the ride.
