Following the last episode of the previous series Yes Minister. Jim Hacker is now Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at No. 10 Downing Street, replacing a cabinet minister and a government member. He is now leading Her Majesty's Government. <br /> <br /> All this after Sir Humphrey Appleby had planned some maneuvers after the former prime minister resigned at the end of the Yes minister. Sir Humphrey Appleby is now the head of the civil service. <br /> <br /> I thought this series was better than the first series, or did it last so long first series unfortunately.
