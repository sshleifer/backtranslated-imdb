Reading the comments, there seems to be a lot of nonsense about the emotional banality of La Pianiste. I find that hard to understand in light of Isabelle Huppert's excellent performance. Huppert is gripping - she manages to convey the woman on the edge, full of self-hatred and deception, perfectly. <br /> <br /> The film is wonderfully moved and judged. It would be so easy to portray the main role as a ridiculous figure - for example, the scene in the porn store. Somehow Huppert gets carried away, partly because of her brilliant performance, but also because the director makes her surreal life real and identifiable. <br /> <br /> Do not ignore this movie. It's one of the most amazing and interesting movies (and performances) I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Trust Boris!
