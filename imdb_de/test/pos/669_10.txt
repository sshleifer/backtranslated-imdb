The fact that there was so much fuss is ironic, since the purpose of the program was to highlight the way in which the media treats such "taboo issues" as pedophilia. the newspaper set, the suits, the complacent moderators, the men talking about things you can see behind them, the useless CGI graphics and statistics, all was a satire, a very funny satire. The way celebrities of c-list say absolutely nothing when their agent tells them it's good for their careers ("there's no evidence, but it's a scientific fact"). It may be hard to watch (with Milly Dowler and the Cambridgeshire girls and 9/11), but satire should be a challenge, and we should not be afraid to fight the obvious scare tactics and headlines. Just because it's a tricky business. How this show could not win TV prizes for intelligence, observation, courage, acting and provocation of thought is shameful, but if you see it, it will show, not in the least surprising.
