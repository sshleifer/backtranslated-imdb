Personally, I can only agree with Stephen-12: let himself be pampered. It really does not make sense to "capture" this movie. I like movies where (explicitly) nothing happens. Duke's "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" has the same nothingness, though this film is less convincing as the highlights are at the beginning of the story, so Duke had to focus on nature over Kinski. Morte a Venezia, however, is something completely different, as it has several highlights, turns, etc. From the point where Aschenbach's luggage is lost, the film "rushes" almost to its grand finale (its last grains of sand run through the Hotel Hourglass after the moment of bliss, in which it fantasizes to warn the Polish family and To stroke Tadzio's hair). <br /> <br /> You can, if you wish, find some real cues / symbols in this (his attempt to go behind his luggage from the moment of arrival, pointing Tadzio at the end, to the fact that all the contents and the form of the film are completely in sinc), but there is no point in doing so: it will not make the movie any better or worse, since its power lies in the entire lower reaches of the entire story, which is never made explicit. Tons of history, decaying Europe, the end of the "Romantic Era" as we have come to know it, which has only just begun (individual emotions and expression are more important today than ever before). But wait, now I'm starting to develop the film's tiny (tiny) flaw: the 'let's talk about art'. Now there is one thing that is never to be done. I myself believe that it could have been expressed in a different way. Besides, I think it's getting pretty clear in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not like explicit movies. I can read books, so I do not want an action that only leads to my justification. I prefer movies that you can not explain in words, but only in movies (Lynch's Lost Highway, Weir's picnic in Hanging Rock, and Roeg's man who fell to Earth are in that category), because then there's only one reason exist as a film and not just as a book. So what about Thomas Mann's short story? I never read it, but forget it! The film has a different point of view: it says things that you can never say in a book. It uses film art to convey the same feeling through images and music as you have experienced from a man with a text. As brilliant, but different worlds.
