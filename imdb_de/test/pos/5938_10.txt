If you enjoyed the TV series "Diagnosis Murder" you will love Murder 101. It's great to see Dick Van Dyke in a thriller again. If we are lucky, this will be the beginning of a television series or at least a series of films. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely had some great and notable actors filling out the roles. But it did not feel like a "face film". It was really a story that made you forget the glory of those on the screen. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the end and ended up so pleasantly surprised that I had to take care of it again. This is a must for any Mystery Buff or Dick Van Dyke lover!
