Although copies of this movie are hard to find, you should find it! !!! I believe that apart from In The Navy, this was the only musical by Abbott and Costello. Although they twisted the plot a bit (I've never heard a version in which the butcher goes up with it), you still enjoy the idiotic but lovable Jack and the greedy butcher Mr. Dinklepuss. Something reminiscent of DuBarry Was a Lady will make you roll on the floor in this startling movie - just to get up and dance while Lou Costello sings. (I do not know why they did not do that in other movies.)
