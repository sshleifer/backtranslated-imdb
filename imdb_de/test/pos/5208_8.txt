The film is about the Battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who know nothing about it, this was the worst battle in World War II. Over a million people died in the course of the battle. This is the only movie I have seen, and he seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked is that the two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were nowhere in the movie. Unlike most American films, the Germans are not seen as bloodthirsty murderers, but as the average German foot soldier is a person. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were taken there to conquer the city. The film follows these men from August 1942 to early 1943. During this time, they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle. Throughout the film you can feel the despair of the entire battle. Unlike "Enemy at the Gates," the filmmakers did not attempt to publish a juicy love story or beautify factual events of the battle. This film may be a fiction, but gives an insight into the bloodiest battles of the Second World War.
