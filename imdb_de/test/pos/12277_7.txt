You have to love the western spaghetti universe. The vision of a West, in which good people are shot without warning, cuddly baddies in extreme close-ups chew the landscape and the anti-hero leaves the girl in the end. Many people refer to Corbucci's films as "depressing". I find that somewhat doubtful in terms of the descriptions. I think gloomy and unforgiving are more fitting, because "depressing" suggests a sense of sentimentality that almost every Eurowestern director ignores in favor of painting characters in big beats before taking his firm place in the canon of Sergio Corbucci. It's a beautiful movie. And it makes sense that Corbucci wanted to vent some steam with COMPANEROS, after the uninterrupted two-stroke of THE GREAT SILENCE and this (though he would later return to his usual tricks with the cursed SONNY and JED). There is still a certain amount of caricature that distracts from the general cruelty of the movie. It hurts more than having three kids dressed like hippies walk around the city looking for gold and trouble. And it hurts that Mario Adorf plays the Mexican one-handed bandit El Diablo as well as he does. He always plays his little characters. <br /> <br /> Apart from the smaller handles, there is more than enough to moisten the palate of spaghetti lovers. Shootings galore, the population of a whole city had to crawl naked in the dirt, the iconic innocence of the laconic anti-hero (played by Johnny Halliday), the moral bankruptcy of almost every character in the film. Corbucci may never get the recognition of the more famous Sergio or the American Patriarchs of the genre, but you and I know that this is a gross injustice to a very talented director. His dynamic selection of shots, which provide a deep staging with objects sticking close to the camera in the background, his sense of quick steps and feverish energy in moving a story that was not always so, the way he photographs free space I'm sure if Corbucci was American and formed 15 years later with Mann and Hawks, the critics of the Cahiers du Cinema would have criticized him as a writer worthy of serious critical consideration.
