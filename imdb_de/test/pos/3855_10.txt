This is one of my favorite movies from Disney. It has everything you can expect in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a wicked villain and lots of adventures. The story begins in Paris, where the aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live in a villa with their mistress. Life is perfect for her until the devilish butler of Mistress Edgar discovers that she intends to leave all her fortune to the cats. He realizes that if he has any chance of claiming happiness, the cats are not in the way. An excellent, often forgotten masterpiece from the 70s - a time when the Disney studio created only a few animations - with songs like the track number "The Aristocats" and "Ev'rybody Wants To AA Cat" young and old with its permanent jazziness.
