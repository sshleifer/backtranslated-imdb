It is a shame that the audience who find this movie most useful will probably not hold the film to itself if it receives a limited rating. <br /> <br /> Imaginary Heroes follows the life of a teenager after the suicide of his brothers. Of course, not the most original story in the world, but she spends a lot of time humanizing her parents, the "imaginary heroes" who failed in the eyes of their sons. <br /> <br /> For teenagers They tend to give their parents responsibility for their failures, but they refuse to take on any real responsibility. The film sends out a strong message that in the end we all have our own problems to deal with and that we all make our own ways. <br /> <br /> But unlike other films that demand the independence of the youth, here the problems between parents and children are resolved, and they become a stronger entity. The fact that the eldest child committed suicide is unfortunate, but will not be overlooked later in the film, and the responsibility of all involved in the tragedy is explained in detail. <br /> <br /> Although the subject has been treated before, it has nothing. So the film was not covered - the film pulls very small blows. Well, why this earned an R rating is confusing - at this time, it's unlikely that you'll get in touch with a teenager without being realistic, but realism restricts this audience. <br /> <br /> While my junior high school class was shown this movie, two suicides may have been prevented. In this case, the censors seem to have exercised extremely poor judgment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
