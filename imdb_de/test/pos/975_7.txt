Much better than expected. Good family movie - catch him at reruns. The whole thing is more than the sum of its parts. Paul Giamatti chews up the landscape - he has far more talent than deserves the role. A treat to watch Inspector Uhl of "The Illusionist". The blue man scenes had my 11-year-old in Stichen. The cameos were especially funny for the parents - nice to see Lee Majors and Urkel (um, Jaleel) again. It will be hard to think of 10 lines for this movie, but let's hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents! Amanda Bynes does a good job when she is part of the sting. I do not usually like Frankie Muniz, but he's fine. Hats off to the casting director - if only for the setting of Giamatti!
