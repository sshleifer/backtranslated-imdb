The cover of the VHS says it all: "Without doubt the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre". I'm a big fan of the '70s and' 80s and I have to say I agree 100%. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as a ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere that only TCM offers, an amazing soundtrack that reflects the emotions and locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror. This is one of the most beautiful horror movies ever! Jeff Lieberman, as director of this 1981 low-budget movie, does a great job, and with his other work (Blue Sunshine, Wrong Turn) he added that he must be one of the most underrated directors in today's film industry.
