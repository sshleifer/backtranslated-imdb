I recently saw this movie for the first time. I liked it so much that I immediately bought the DVD. This movie is pure genius and only gets funnier with each ad. Anyone can write jokes or funny dialogues and let actors learn by heart, but the basis of this film is the improvement !! How do you do that? Thank you, Christopher Guest!
