As a former (nuclear) submarine officer, I have to admit that this is my favorite submarine movie (even about Hunt for Red October). Someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the movie. OK - not realistic - but it's a comedy - and has all the "insider jokes" of the submarine force. A great cast with the stereotypical submarine guys on the "Orlando" and our heroes on the diesel boat. Definitely "DBF" = This means diesel boats forever. But they want ten lines to publish this - is the admiral responsible here? <br /> <br /> Line 10.
