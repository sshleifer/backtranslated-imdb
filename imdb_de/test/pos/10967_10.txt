John Cassavette chose his first movie, obviously as one shot in New York on a shoestring, not even to have a script with dialogue, but delivers a 1959 feature equivalent to Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm - all actors know what they should do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they talk. In other words, it is one of the most realistic insights into the beat generation, which is sweetly rounded in its score and tells a story of racial tensions. A group of black siblings are in focus, with one trying to achieve better gigs than a regular strip club, and he has a sister who is much fairer-skinned than he, and intermarried with a white man breaks both sides. But the film is not all about it; Cassavettes likes to wander his characters around New York City (which were not many films in 1959/1960), and his narrative style is similar to that of the improvisational jazz artists of the time. Dated, to be sure, but worth a look for movie fans; Martin Scorsese called this one of his hardest influences.
