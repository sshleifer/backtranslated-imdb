Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) was hired by the British government to arrest the Swiss scientist Dr. To protect Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.). He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately, the evil Dr. works. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) with the Nazis and will stop at nothing to get the doctor - and his invention. Relocating Sherlock Holmes to the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea It works for a reason - Basil Rathbone. Presumably he is the BEST Sherlock Holmes ever brought to the screen. He plays the character so well (and accurately) that it does not matter at what time he solves crimes. As for Nigel Bruce as Watson, everyone has problems with it. He plays Watson as a fidgety old idiot ... that's NOT the Watson of the books. You seriously wonder why Holmes endures him. Nevertheless, he grows on you (in a way). Then there's Atwill playing Moriarty - the discussions and the argument between him and Holmes are just great! I've never liked Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade - he's such an idiot. Makes Watson look like a genius. And Post Jr. is pretty good as Tobel (though his accent changes amusingly all the time!). <br /> <br /> This movie is elaborate and only runs just over an hour. Nevertheless, there are slow spots, and I never understood the secret code section. Still, it's worth it if only for Rathbone and Atwill.
