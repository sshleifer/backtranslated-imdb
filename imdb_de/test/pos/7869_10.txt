"The Beguiled" is one of my favorite films by Clint Eastwood and a departure from his typical early roles. Directed by Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood has worked on several films, a year before Eastwood's directorial debut with "Play Misty For Me" was filmed. An alternative title that was considered for the film was "Pussy-Footing Down At The Old Plantation," which thankfully was not used. Otherwise, I'm sure that weird jokes about being in a girls' school would be hard to avoid. I first saw this movie in one of my college film classes in the mid-1970s and was taken away immediately. I just had an old, battered VHS cassette until I recently bought the widescreen DVD, which also includes the hilarious, horrible trailer that makes the movie look like a "Peyton Place" iron opera and none of the scary stuff <br /> <br /> Interesting Notes: Eastwood and Siegel had to struggle with Universal Pictures to maintain the original finish, and they won; and the movie was billed as a standard Eastwood Western, which he certainly is not. It's a gothic story of wartime fraud and horror, with a keynote of eroticism and sexual tension that runs continuously. <br /> <br /> I do not put spoilers in this report and if you want to watch the movie as it should be seen, you should be careful when looking it up on the internet. Spoiler reviews abound. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood portrays John McBurney, a Union soldier shot on Confederate soil and spotted by a young girl from a nearby girls' school. She saves him and brings him back to school. However, instead of notifying the local patrol for his imprisonment, the headmistress, Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), her assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman) and her black servant Hallie (Mae Mercer) and the mostly adolescent girls take him up, heal him and fall under his spell. The film sets its tone of ghastliness and gothic horror straight out of the tracks as it shows real battlefield footage from the war, while Eastwood's voice quietly sings a funeral song of the time. <br /> <br /> The opening scene The encounter with the little girl who saves him determines the tone of his character and the sound of the entire film. To say more would destroy the surprises in this first scene. More about the movie itself could ruin it for anyone who has not seen it yet ... if you look forward to scary gothic stories, find them and rent them. Eastwood is excellent in the film, and it's interesting to see him in an early role or role in which he portrays a character that is, for the most part, very unsympathetic. Geraldine Page had a plum role in the movie as headmistress, and I can not imagine another actress of the time being so good at the role; A long shot could have been Piper Laurie, but I do not think Laurie could have played the role in the same way as Geraldine Page. Elizabeth Hartman (whose wonderful performance in the movie "A Patch of") Blue "as a blind girl who falls in love with the figure of Sidney Poiter is another highlight in her short career), is at the forefront here, tender and masterful Unfortunately, her delicacy in the film was part of her real life, and she committed suicide at the age of 45. I conclude this review with this observation: A manipulative, lying Yankee man can make a house more fraudulent and libidinal southern beauties can not cope.
