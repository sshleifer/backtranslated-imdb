This is definitely a must-have movie. Award-winning director Alain Chabat (who also serves as Ceasar) has managed to capture the essence of the "Adventures of Astérix" (the French comic books on which he is based) and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy to the a homage belongs to the world of animated films. This movie is so funny, so full of jokes (visual and spoken) that it can take two or three screenings to notice them all between your laughter. The only downside is that a non-French audience (or at least a non-French-speaking audience) may not get all the "private jokes". There are so many dialogues that can not be translated, so many situations that directly relate to the comic books or the French way of life, so the fun is reduced. However, it is still worth seeing for the beautiful picture, the amazing stunts, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. All the actors are great, but the movie would not be the same without Jamel Debouze, Gérard Darmon and Edouard Bär. And never compare this great movie to the horrible previous film based on the same comic books: "Astérix and Obélix Contre César" and directed by Claude Zidi.
