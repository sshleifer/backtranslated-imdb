One of IMDb's message board threads had talked to two women about Colin Firth as they saw the movie just because of him. Obviously, these were two young women; What I noticed, however, is how little this movie was widely appreciated by the public. The brilliant and I brilliant performances of Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were hardly noticed, not only by the audience, but also by the Academy and most critics. I think I know why. First, the storyline - or just the setup - is a kind of bastardization of Shakespeare's King Lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three seductive daughters who will inherit. Their names even begin with the same letters: Regan, Goneril and Cordelia - Rose, Ginny and Caroline. And I think "Larry" (Jason Robards) works for "Lear". The obvious idea that Jane Smiley presented in her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was to tell a Lear-like story from the daughters' point of view, and to tell a kind of realistic late-twentieth-century style that the bard did not believe in Was considered. The problem is, in the story of Smiley and Moorhouse, that the two older daughters are very human, with strengths and weaknesses, while the father is an extremely despicable character, without saving the qualities. His only strength was his ability to make the farm financially successful. We can even guess that since his father and his grandfather built the farm in front of him and he inherited it. <br /> <br /> The second problem - and this is one that I can not personally testify to without reading Smiley's novel - is that the film has only a limited and partial interpretation of this novel. However, it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances, can not be faithfully translated to the screen. The vision and audio requirements of the film drown out the intricacies of a narrative, while the time constraints do not allow for the full development of the character and motivation of the novelist. In five or six hours Moorhouse might have made a movie that fits more to Smiley's novel. <br /> <br /> A third problem is one that may just be Moorhouse. Her directing work began with the very successful Aussie film Proof (1991) with Russell Crowe. She followed with How to Make an American Quilt (1995), in which women, especially women of a certain age, were celebrated. However, it was a bit cumbersome and determined and determined a chick movie. In a sense, A Thousand Acres stands out from there, showing us not only the point of view of women, but also in a way that seems politically motivated to some. Larry Cook is clearly a bad, bad dad. He beat his daughters and had a carnal knowledge of them. He led the household with an iron fist. Jess (Colin Firth's character) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a little fun. And then he goes to Rose, who is clearly going to be the power behind the new estate, and joins her while she accidentally gets her husband to end his life through a drunken accident. The rest of the men are one-dimensional characters without nuance, as they often appear in romance novels. I think most viewers were scared off by the cumbersome incest, adultery, and sexual betrayal woven into the story. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, the critics and the public are wrong. I think the direction was against men, but it had to be in this story. I think Moorhouse did a good job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that was not too pretty. And the acting of Pfeiffer and Lange was downright sensational. They seemed to feed in a way that I found absolutely authentic and deeply moving. Pfeiffer, in particular, was intriguing as she exuded her angry anger and hatred. The way Moorhouse has gradually revealed her character is a tribute to her ability as a director and Pfeiffer's outstanding achievement. And the skill with which Moorhouse guided the change in Ginny's character as she led from a "Ninny," as she called herself, to someone with self-confidence and understandable bitterness, was also excellent. The fact that she had left her husband was as sad as anything. He had to get her, forgive her and bring her back. And Robards was also very good in his intensity and madness. <br /> <br /> I assume that this movie, which was bombarded in the cinemas, will be better appreciated in the coming years when it is seen on DVD. My question is, what happened to Moorhouse? Her talent is obvious, but she has not staged her fourth feature yet. If she does that, I hope she remembers to go with what she believes, but also to be fair. I think she was actually fair to the two main characters in the film, but did not pay enough attention to the others. Jennifer Jason Leigh's Caroline was not finished yet, and she wondered why she did some of the things she did. And the husbands had to be more than just mannequins. They had to be committed and committed.
