Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for Egyptian things (I grew up with visiting the mummies at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts), but I think Maltin is a pretty difficult man movie. Production values ​​are great in terms of color and cinematography, and it seems that part of the historic authenticity effort has gone (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is a bit stiff in the lead, but you can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character. Victor Mature is Victor Mature. Peter Ustinov is a pleasure to see this role, which he has always done so well and so funny. Bella Darvi's performance as Nefer is a classic camp, and I find that even Michael Wilding's rather dry portrayal of Akenaten has its own appeal. <br /> <br /> The historical curiosity of Akenaten's monotheism, a short detour in the theological history of ancient Egypt, is interesting, as is Akenaten himself, and worth reading about; The religious wars depicted here actually have a basis. <br /> <br /> An interesting footnote to Darvi, whose maiden name was Bayla Wegier, was a Polish emigrant who was taken under the wing of producer Darryl Zanuck and his wife Violet (I think they may even have adopted her. Her stage name Darvi, made up of the first names of Zannuck and his wife, continued her acting career in France, but never achieved great success and died out of her own hands in 1971 following a rather unfortunate life. <br /> <br /> Overall this is one Interesting movie and it's fun to look at the picture values ​​alone - American Movie Classics occasionally shows this in the mailbox, which is essential to capture the scope and history of the story.
