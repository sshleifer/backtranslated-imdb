A group of cats searches for their way home after being abducted by a greedy butler. <br /> <br /> The Aristocats are considered one of Walt Disney's best 2D animations with their charming script and cool characters. The magic that Snow White or the Jungle Book has produced is pretty big. <br /> <br /> The slow opening will make younger viewers raise their eyebrows, but once the cats have established themselves in the story, the fun and entertainment will start /> <br /> The young cats will worry with a charming, youthful rivalry for the most pleasure, the special kind of bond that every brother or sister of all ages can associate with. <br /> <br /> Not the funniest picture of Disney there are some great funny moments, especially the cats and the dogs. The portrayal of gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing. <br /> <br /> After the boring beginning, the story is thoroughly entertaining and just what a family movie should be. There are hardly any gaps and no boring moments. The journey home is interesting and you get a sense of exploration, not to mention two very strange British swans. With Disney you always get a strong, meaningful message. With the jungle book you belong there, with Beauty and the Beast you explore the importance of inner beauty. In this picture of 1970, however, something seems to be missing. The film has the importance and relevance of home, but is not cemented enough; It seems very far-fetched and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My sister and I found it very strange to observe this as some of the main characters were voiced by the jungle book cast. A bad start and the confusion of his sermon message. This is a thoroughly funny family movie with good music and some cool, crazy characters that audiences of all ages can relate to.
