From so many excellent and so on in Nevskiy, a very compact * zing * tickled me so thoroughly that for me it is the definitive grandiose moment of the movie. <br /> <br /> Or at least the one who tends to get people to watch the movie and swing the disk in hand to make it stand out. <br /> <br /> The existing vague abstract recognition of the rather simple and concrete guilt associated with guilty pleasure truly makes its gel and pushes me to eventually pay the intellectual bill. <br /> <br /> Until then ... <br /> <br /> The downfall of the organist was right.
