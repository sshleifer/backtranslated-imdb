Project A II is a classic Jackie Chan movie with all the kung fu, crazy stunts and slapstick humor you expect. Not as good as the prequel, but it's still a great movie if you just want to have fun. The story is simple, Jackie Chan against the evil men. So if you want a movie you do not need to understand, I would recommend this movie to you.
