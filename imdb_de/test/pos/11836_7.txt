This is one of the better Marion Davies talkies - and one of the few that allowed her to show her skills as a physical comedy that was so appealing in her silent films. OK, so she makes a chunky number, but even Ruby Keeler's dance from that time does not last for younger generations. The problem here is the script. The story falls into an incredible melodrama of the last role. It's quite bold and obviously adapted to a play ... but not good enough. Nevertheless, there are a few crisp dialogues and slapstick everywhere. Worth a look.
