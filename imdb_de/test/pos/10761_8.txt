To the eight people who found the previous FIERCE PEOPLE comments from "Psycolicious Me" and "Topdany" helpful and to future visitors to the site they see before their authors delete them: these negative reviews are not just shorter than the website policy mandate, but they are completely wrong, not factually, wrong and misinformative. For example, Blythe's father is in a coma, NOT dead - Maya and Finn even visit him in the hospital. In addition, it was the wild-game warden Dwayne - NOT Blythe - who blew Jilly, the maid, etc., and so on. So if you have ads that you can not focus on the simplest details, please keep your condition for yourself being Siskel or Ebert. Otherwise add a disclaimer to your comments!
