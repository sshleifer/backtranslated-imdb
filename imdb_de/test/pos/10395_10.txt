I was stunned by this movie. After that, I did not want to see any more movies - any other movie would be so unsatisfactory in comparison. <br /> <br /> For many, it may be the worst of Antonioni's - very slowly, with no engaging conventional action, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions - and the worst Wenders-bound, confusing transcendentality. It is made up of short, distinct episodes linked to Wender's typical brainwave of consciousness so that it does not lead to a temporary oblivion of escapist cinema. The incoherent plot draws a single poetic image that spans the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that finds the heart of things. <br /> <br />
