As Muppet films, this is easily and clearly the best. It features a lot of cameos from big comedic stars of that time, a solid script and some great Disneyesque songs, and combines them into a culmination of Henson's best portrayal of talent. The story is fundamental and the jokes are complex to amuse both the adults and the children for whom it was marketed, without being exposed to ideologies that may not be desirable to their parents, but it is also fun a well made, well written, beautifully appealing classic. It rates a 8.9 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
