I agree with the messages here that the book is not like the movie. I read the book as a high school student in Sumter SC. I instantly fell in love with the book and waited anxiously for the release of the mini-series. As much as I liked the movie and thought it was done very well, I was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book. I was glad that Orry was not killed like in Love and War or N & S II. <br /> <br /> After growing up in SC and graduating from the University of SC, I fell in love with the Southern History mini-series and book. I had the honor of meeting John Jakes in 1988 at a symposium at the USC. I stayed and meet Mr. Jake. Unfortunately, I could not ask him a question. But meeting him was an honor. I had a degree in accounting, but my minor in southern science. In addition, I have recreated many of my mannerisms after Orry Main. Orry and I are very similar. I feel born 150 years too late. I am a southern gentleman and very proud of it. <br /> <br /> Well, I fell in love with two women in the movie ... Genie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne. Man, I had the shit for Wendy !!!! I could never find a real version of her. I hope one day too !!!
