This is one of those movies that has it all. I do not think I would be sick of it. Hopefully more films like this will be shot in the future. The casting was perfect in every way. In a sense, the song sung by Engelbert Humperdink "I Never Got Say Say Goodbye" brings the song to life. In any case, you will surely laugh and cry through the whole scenario. I'm just surprised I've never seen it before. I think it is absolutely worth seeing and your heart will be glowing. It would be nice to cuddle with your "sweetheart"; Drink a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy the presence of each other. Sometimes there is so much heart and emotion that you do not know where to go. You will know exactly how the character feels. Real family expression is available throughout. Sometimes you even think you are part of this family or you belong to your family. See it!
