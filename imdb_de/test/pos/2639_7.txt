It's almost not. But look at this movie, it has a heart. Pour something to drink and enjoy it. It's full of a plethora of stars just starting out. Sherilyn Fenn makes her first cameo appearance on screen. Chris Penn, Lea Thompson, Eric Stotz, Jenny Wright, Rick Moranis and so on - everyone looks so young. And if you look closely, is the wife of the policeman Nancy Wilson from the rock band Heart.
