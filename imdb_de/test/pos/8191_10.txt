This 3-hour epic (seems to be much shorter) explores the will to power and conquest and the conflicting motives underlying this search by pursuing two parallel lives: the Emperor Q'in, his desire to annex the Chinese feudal states unite, has its origins in noble goals but goes into violent repression, isolation and ultimate powerlessness; and the assassin Jing Ke, a mercenary killer, who recognizes the unintended consequences of the murder and finds a form of salvation. As with any great art, this can be understood on many levels. The film has evoked images and ideas from Homer, Euripides, Machiavelli, Shakespeare and Freud. <br /> <br /> The story itself is true (I've checked it on britannica.com!), so this movie will appeal to history buffs. It is ironic that Q'in spent much of his last years in a futile quest for immortality (not shown on screen, but in keeping with the storyline). <br /> <br /> The film can also be regarded as an allegory of Maoism and Cultural Revolution. Through the film, one can understand that the past 50 years of Chinese history have set a precedent over the last 3,000 years. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for the audience, these complex ideas are developed in a richly-screened movie, action and pagent. Only the fight scenes are worth the price.
