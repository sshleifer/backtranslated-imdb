Jean Renoir's homage to late 19th-century Paris is beautiful in many ways. It seems not only to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha, but also portrays the geographical Paris. the streets that are accessible only by stairs, the unpleasant end of the fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men who offer a product for sale, in an uncompromising image of show business, which stands in stark contrast to the image painted by Hollywood. It is an obvious comparison with Lloyd Bacon's "42nd Street", made about 20 years ago, depicting Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation, a fresh boy from the sticks who had come to New York to be there show business, the the show rescues if the star fails - "You go out there, a boy from the refrain, but you have to get a STAR back!" Warner Baxter's "Julian Marsh" is a director who suffers from his art and is not appreciated. Jean Gabin's "Danglard" keeps coming back to genital politics, but when he talks about the show, he's more like Knute Rockne than Julian Marsh. He deals exclusively with the game, except - because of his sharp point. He has sewn a profitable new venture until his lover becomes jealous of the woman who recognizes her as his next lover. His prospects rise and fall with every common journey he undertakes. <br /> <br /> Danglard brings Mistress 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix) to a dive where he discovers "Nini" (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover, Paulo, the baker that she is a spirited dancer. He uses his charm and the prospect of money to make Nini dance to get on stage. The prospect of money and fame enchants Nini, and she becomes Danglard's next mistress, as well as a suitable student of the Cancan, which Danglard has named "French Cancan" to do justice to the current Anglophile tendency in dance. <br /> <br /> Both "42nd St" and "French Cancan" are honors to show business - for modern entertainment - that has its own iconography and imagination. "42nd St." The focus is on Julian Marsh, a great director of Broadway shows, who he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual engagement. The male teenager is a middle-aged jerk with a lumbago, replaced by Dick Powell, the pretty tenor with secret wealth, to hide. Danglard, on the other hand, goes from woman to woman, seducing her with the promise of fame and captivating her with a very convincing gift. There is no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active. There are many postcoital scenes. <br/> <br /> Days after Nini was seduced away by Paulo, he spotted Esther, a Piaf-type, and began to prepare her for her job of singing the theme song of the movie while he did it on her violin plays. This of course arouses Nini's jealousy as well as she has aroused Lola's jealousy. (And of course, Nini had already given up the privilege of being a Czarina!) The whole movie is about how Danglard's concupiscence cost him money, but how even his annoying horniness is subordinated to his love of show-as the audience demands devotion - and it's this strong combination of phallic persuasion and tantalizing fame that makes Danglard a hero, while claiming that a true showman will never benefit as much as the money-man. After completing the film, Danglard, after convincing the creditors and the jealous babes, approaches a new attraction and looks at the incredible (and believe me, it's unbelievable) performance of the canister. "Did you ever think about being on stage?" he asks and the curtain goes down. Meanwhile, poor Julian sits on the fire escape of the theater and listens to the new fans of Peggy Sawyer, who belittle his contribution to the success of the show. (I will not even get into the central line of "42nd Street", "Oh, Guy, it was great of you to meet!"). <br /> <br /> Also, I'm not going to glimpse You'll get legendary Parisian entertainers, including a brief vision of Piaf or the vision of a Paris, both in cities and in rural areas. Sure, there is a selection of the styles that have produced Trenet and Aznavour. But it is the memory of an assertive and welcome masculinity, something that can not be found in any Hollywood musical to compare it with, a pleasant relief from the androgyns of the 30's Hollywood musicals (including my beloved Fred Astaire, quite not to mention Dick Powell) let alone the MGf announced Barf in films like the repulsive "American in Paris". All these fountains! We will save our comparison of this turkey for "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and its deconstruction of the American for another day. <br /> <br /> That Danglard could have been a kind of hope in post-war France of hyper-masculine mec that may or may not have existed is virtually irrelevant. That he is a man, neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton, may be more of a goal. That he is a man who likes the ladies, is never in question. I myself would not mind living his life. I wonder if Gabin was so happy. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this comment I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called "Boloney". I have never come this far. Moulin Rouge from Baz ... well, Paris does not bring such things into his own.
