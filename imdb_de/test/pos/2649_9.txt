Dear Readers, 2001: A space odyssey is at its best for Kubrick ... although I really can not say that, since Space Odyssey is his only movie I've ever seen. Still, it's a good movie. Strange, but good. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three acts, much like the novel ... which is not surprising since the author wrote the script. In any case, we start with the simple but spectacular opening, in which also Sparach Zarathustra roars on the speakers. Then comes the boring "Dawn of Man" series. Then there's the weird sequence "Finding the Monolith" on the Moon, played by Strauss' Blue Danube. It's finally getting good with Spaceship scenes and HAL berserkers killing people. After that, things die out and we have the sequence "Entering the Monolith", which was way too long, and the ultra-strange ending. Although, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a good movie. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator or The Abyss, but it rocks. My compliment to the chef, Mr Kubrick. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
