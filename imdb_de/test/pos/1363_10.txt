Simply put, there are two parts of this series that made me cry until my eyes fell out. First, the part where he wanted to wash the toilet, but drank the toilet water, while he imagined that the hot director gave him a golden shower !!! (I laughed so much!) Second, the part he wanted to prove worthy of being a swimming instructor. He seemed to be a pro, but as expected, he could not swim (at least not properly ^^). The fun part was, however, when he finally reached the end and said "how was that" or something. It was so damn funny that I could not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this anime series, I strongly recommend it. One of the best I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Definitely the funniest!
