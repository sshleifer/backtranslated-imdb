LIFEFORCE was one of Cannon Films biggest flops. It got mostly bad reviews and helped director Tobe Hooper after the dispute over Spielberg / POLTERGEIST not further. All this is unfortunate, because LIFEFORCE is actually a really great movie. It is extremely entertaining, moves at a fast pace and offers some of the most outstanding directions, production, performances and special effects that ever explode on the screen! It must have looked bizarre on paper: the producers of THE DELTA FORCE, the scriptwriter of ALIEN, the director of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, the composer of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, the special effects wizards of STAR WARS ... The spectators were not Get ready this crazy exercise in craziness. What do you want more ??? We have an alien spaceship with huge bats! We got a sexy, naked space vampire sucking people's souls! We have exploding bodies! We have zombies! We got possession! We have an S & M interrogation! We set the whole city of London on fire! It's Dracula meets NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD meets QUARTERMASS and the PIT meets EARTHQUAKE. It's probably the scariest horror / sci-fi / comedy / action / disaster / erotic / apocalyptic epic ever unleashed, that is, if there are others left. <br /> <br /> Try to watch this movie while chemically altered. Maybe then you will understand it. A really fucking experience and one of the most underrated films by director Tobe Hooper. Maybe someday it will find its audience.
