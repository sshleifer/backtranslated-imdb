The last person to die before the New Year is cursed to drive the phantom coach for a year and collect the souls of the dead. <br /> <br /> I saw a scene from this old silent Swedish horror movie on Youtube and decided to find the whole movie. It was worth the effort to find her because it is an absolutely amazing movie for the time he was made. It has a wonderfully scary atmosphere. The horror film makers of the old days really understood how to create the perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, many of today's filmmakers seem unaware of the importance of the setting and the atmosphere, and go for the cheap jump anxiety. The visual effects are excellent given the date of manufacture. If you find a copy of it, I strongly recommend to watch a clock. 9.10
