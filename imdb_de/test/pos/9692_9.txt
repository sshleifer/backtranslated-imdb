First, I'd like to say that most people who give a bad review do not like this kind of comedy. The movie is great if you are open minded and are not afraid to laugh at stupid things. <Br /> <br /> Just like the TV series, this movie is turned into a long film with many short clips. Some scenes do not even have a dialogue, someone just comes out and does something unexpected and it's funny !! The only downside I had was that I felt like I was wasting money on popcorn and icee. There was no way to eat or drink anything during this movie, which made me laugh all the time. I was frankly nervous about drinking some icee and seeing something that made me laugh and turn it all over. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind male nudity and Jackass likes the movie, put on the TV show and viva la bam, then check out her movie. <br /> <br /> And if you do NOT like the first movie or TV show. Do not see it and if you see it, do not write a bad review about it. Hardcore Christians who see and beat this just do not seem right to me.
