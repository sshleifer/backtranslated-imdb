SPOILER Every major regime uses the country's media for its own purposes. Whether the Nazi ban on certain leaflets or the Chinese alternative to Tianamen Square on television, governments have been trying to influence people through different media since time immemorial. In 1925, in celebration of the failed mutiny of 1905, the Russian Communist government supported the creation of this movie "Battleship Potempkin". It is a significant piece of film history and remains powerful and beautiful to this day. <br /> <br /> On board the battleship Potempkin, the crew is unhappy. In miserable living conditions and with maggot-infested food, they are furious with the oppressors of their upper classes. Well, after the rotten food, enough is enough. Led by Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), the crew turns to their masters and fights for their freedom. <br /> <br /> As far as propaganda goes, "Battleship Potempkin" is perfect. The film was a positive light for the first unsuccessful communist mutiny and a useful tool of the Soviet Union. Eighty years after its theatrical release, however, the USSR has completely disappeared. The amazing thing about this film, however, is that although the country for which its message was intended has disappeared, the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a pleasure to see. It is true that it is far from what we would call "entertainment" today, but the film is a beautiful work of art. <br /> <br /> Whether it's the scenes on board the boat or the often-discussed scene. On the steps of Odessa, everything about this movie is perfect. The music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is immaculate, even the acting is, though a bit exaggerated, perfect for the piece. Basically, there is no way to criticize the final product of this film. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to know how the Russian people received this film when it was released. We praise a country that has not existed for fifteen years, and it's hard for us to recognize the full spirits that inspired the movie. As a work of art, however, it is great. Nice from start to finish, it's anything but a simple clock, but worth it.
