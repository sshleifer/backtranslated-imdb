A number of full-length films have been made with the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, but "The Muppet Movie" was the first of them all and the first in the original trilogy, which also includes "The Great" Muppet Caper "and" The Muppets Take Manhattan. "It was published seven years before my birth, so obviously I did not see it (and I did not see either of his successors when they were first released), but I have many Muppets seen in my childhood, mostly after the premature death of Henson in 1990. I first saw this movie in the mid-'90s after hearing the soundtrack, no wonder I liked it at the time, and it was not disappointing to visit again in recent years. <br /> <br /> One day Kermit the Frog is sitting in the swamp with his banjo singing "Rainbow Connection." A hollywo Od agent named Bernie comes in a boat and asks him to pursue a career in Tinseltown. Kermit follows his advice and goes west. He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along. The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain that wants Kermit his mascot. As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by it, so he declines and goes to Fozzie. On their journey through the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo. On the way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper is unfortunately ready to do anything to force Kermit to become the mascot of his restaurant chain. Kermit sees itself in growing danger! <br /> <br /> Many people praise this movie for the songs, and I can understand why. Of course, at the beginning there is the Oscar nomination "Rainbow Connection", and there are more good songs, like Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song "Movin 'Right Along" and "I'll go back there one day", one sung by Gonzo Ballad "Never Before, Never Again", the song that Miss Piggy sings when she sees Kermit for the first time, is the only thing I would consider rather weak, and her romance seems awfully sudden, the Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like on TV, and some of them give a lot of humor, including Fozzie, who makes his first appearance in the movie, who hopelessly tries to entertain people in a restaurant with his standup and if you are with that famous If you are familiar with Muppets, you should know what to expect from each one of them, and some of the live actors who perform in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie th e Agent and Steve Martin as "Insolent Waiter". It's not a 100% comedy either. There are serious parts of the film that have made them well. <br /> <br /> When I saw this original Muppet movie again this year, I saw one of them for the first time since seeing "Muppets from Space" (one of the Muppet films) made after Henson's death ( 1999) last year for the first time. I was very disappointed to see this movie that had never happened when I saw movies or TV shows with the popular puppet characters. The movie is not only not funny, I also find it a bit too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I said in my review! However, I can not say that I think the same of the predecessors of this film, including the one published twenty years ago. "The Muppet Movie" seems to be the most popular part of the group, and not only because it has so much to like for kids, that's understandable. I very much doubt that there is much to say about "The Muppet Movie" that has not even been said in the last thirty years, but today it remains a good family entertainment.
