For a movie that was PG, this is a funny movie. I grew up with this movie again and again. It's really fun, I do not know how the audience would react today, but if you grew up with it or loved the 80s, this is a great movie. Stephen Furst is great as Harold, who I believe is one of the best characters in the film. Paul Ruebens also comes for about 10 minutes. I love nostalgia.
