There are several books that have called this the first gay cinema. I do not really see that as gay in the homosexual sense, but then to see two men dancing in the world's first musical that has its charm. <br /> <br /> There were already some comments on this film that did not include homosexual overtones. Those who dismiss this movie as simply stupid and make an experiment late at night for too many drinks ... Well, I've already heard that story. <br /> <br /> This film is interesting as a curiosity and if people want to consider it as the first gay movie, so be it. Better than the depressing unlike the others of 1919.
