A demon from a tree leaves in the shape of a human to love a young beautiful girl just to die. The demon's eyes freeze, two drops of blood fall on a bed he created especially for his coveted object. The bed uses up the blood and it stays hungry. Everything that comes in contact with the bed is consumed! This is explained by one of the victims of the bed, a painter whose soul is "caught up in" one of his last works, the artistic rendering of his final resting place (he died of consumption, coughed blood and died on the deathbed). You see the painter, whom we can see as if he were trapped in a small room that sees through his painting, unfortunately a spectator at the meals of the bed. The bed has a dark sense of humor, and we see this by allowing the painter to live, even receiving jewelry and other possessions that once belonged to possessed victims. The skull of a victim grows bright red, not far from the basement where the bed is located. The film shows three young women who come across the villa where the cellar where the deathbed is located. The painter (Dave Marsh) may have only one method of destroying the deathbed, but it will contain a human sacrifice to revive the body of the one whose death has caused hunger in the first place. Patrick Spence-Thomas delivers the gentle, depressing voice of the trapped painter, narrates the movie, laments his current situation, tells us about the victims of the past, and often scolds of his predatory nature. <br /> <br /> A definitive, real cult movie ... I expect his status to increase now, that DEATH BED: THE BED, which has found EATS the way to an audience (like me) that that Bizarre and grotesque appreciate. The bed itself contains a liquid acid with an apple and cider hue, in which we see how items and people (... fighting for nothing) are consumed. Many may well recognize a young William Russ (BOY MEETS WORLD, THE UNHOLY) in curls looking for his out-of-control sister and finding her in the basement, zombie-like and traumatized (of course, Julie Ritter was pretty much the movie, all in one Trance barely saying a word). In one of the most denied scenes in the film, Russ tries to sting the bed so that his hands are caught in the grip, the meat is acidified, only skeletal bones are left, and the cartilage deteriorates. One of the victims, whose legs were in bed, was almost out of the cellar when the sheets had torn their backs in the stomach where they belonged. The movie feels almost surreal, as if we were seeing a macabre nightmare in front of it. Director George Barry frequently launches gags about the victims who are in the most unhappy situation and choose their deathbed as a sanctuary. The painter reminds us of the different people who have been eaten. There is really nothing like this movie, definitely unique.
