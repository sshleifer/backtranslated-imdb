USA The Movie looks like this: You're taking a nap on a long, hot Sunday afternoon. It feels great to close my eyes and let go of the worries. You'll soon be lost in one of those intense, lucid dreams where you know you're dreaming, but you still can not wake up - not that you want it. You go with the river and soon you will be in a kind of weird Alice in Wonderland story with characters you do not think you can dream of. They tell you all sorts of crazy stuff about war and peace and guide you through a journey into the past and even into the future. <br /> <br /> The dream is getting heavier and you feel like you're on a path that you can not control. You may want to wake up, so try to open your eyes, but you can not. Now there is destruction and sadness and confusion and scary voices telling you what truth or lie could be. You see images that flicker and change and then become clear, but do you even want to see what your brain creates for you? <br /> <br /> Finally you are lost in a mythical world and know that the end has come. The end of the world and the end of the dream. It is off. What are you growing up with? What are you doing next? <br /> <br /> You may write down this dream because you know that dreams do not happen that often - and then they pay more attention. <br /> <br /> Or maybe you'll crack a beer and forget about it. Bad idea. Do not forget
