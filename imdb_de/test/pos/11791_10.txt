I really liked this movie. If other people want to give an average of 5.0 / 10, this is their choice. I would give it 10/10. Sutherland's performance as a private look is absolutely fantastic. The story is amazing, human, exciting, intelligent. The dialogue is good. The story may not be perfect, but still - the mood of the movie is good enough to make up for it. In addition, the end is incredibly cool and the puzzle really comes together. I liked it anyway. I also found the lead actress very good. I'm not a big fan of detective movies, but this movie was really good, also because conventions of the supernatural are no merit.
