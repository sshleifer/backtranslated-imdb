"Head" is one of those movies where you'll have trouble convincing your friends, but once they're done, they'll fall in love with him. I do not know how many times that happened to me. This movie is just so weird and bizarre, really a deconstruction of everything the Monkees have done so far in their careers. Much praise is due to Bob Rafelson, who has pretty much ended Monkee's career with this film. My guess is that he wanted to get out of the TV show and focus on the features he made great after this series. Micky Dolenz is absolutely funny. I can not believe he did not have a second life as a comic actor after this movie. This movie has a lot of great cameos and lots of wonderful psychedelic nonsense. I think the reputation of the movie is growing and it would not surprise me when it finally becomes a cult full of classics
