Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a hard-nosed, female congressman in Texas who has no identifiable legal requirements. In 1980 he is interested in the emergency in Afghanistan, which is in a brutal war with the USSR. Under the auspices of his old flame, the ultra-conservative Texan socialist Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), he travels to Afghanistan to assess the situation and is stunned by what he sees. He returns to the US and is determined to help the Afghans, just to make his colleagues very indifferent to the situation - and investigate himself for alleged drug use. Undeterred, Wilson recruits Herring and the vulgar, expelled CIA agent Gust Avrakoto (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to begin a sinuous arms trade involving Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and a largely unknown US Congress. In the end, the Afghans defeat the Soviets, but as America celebrates its victory, Wilson and Avrakotos fall on deaf ears to warn of the instability of post-war Afghanistan. The War of Charlie Wilson is a sly brain candy, a really decent movie for the intellectual viewer and a fun conversation for the average moviegoer. The film brings together a stunning array of talent in front of and behind the camera and delivers what it promises to be a damn good time. The film has only one mistake, which we will reach later. Examining the unlikely ways in which the largest hidden war of the 20th century was conducted, and perhaps the way in which the CIA and other intelligence agencies do so, is intriguing. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting on a number of levels. The story portrayed in the film - with all its outrageous double acts, underhand, covert operations, and perhaps most of all, its success - would be so foul of fiction that it could easily be dismissed as satire. But things really worked out, at least within reasonable limits. The film shows our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without masking their shortcomings. Wilson is a person who disapproves of (even embraces) their vices and yet is willing to accept a righteous cause. Herring is a bit elitist, and her reborn attitude of justice is daunting - and yet she is deeply committed to the Afghan people. Avrakotos is a CIA outsider with a posture problem he was looked down on for his "street background". His country love and hatred for communism, however, are unshakeable. The fact that this strange trio could play an important role in the downfall of the USSR is not only proof that everyone can make a difference, but also that the truth is stranger than fiction. It's also very interesting that this is all played out as a comedy - not too surprising, as our author is Aaron Sorkin, but it's an interesting way to approach this story. <br /> <br /> The movie does however have a drawback, which is a little surprising. The film seems to celebrate the performance of Wilson and Co. undeservedly. That's okay - nothing wrong with defeating the Soviet Union, right? - Bearing in mind that from the ashes of the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan came the Taliban and finally al Qaeda. Regardless of US responsibilities, this was the case, and the film's portrayal of Wilson's success is almost unmistakable. To be honest, the film addresses this issue in the end, with a fairly recent Wilson speech about the US inability to purify itself, but this is done in such a tertiary manner that the average viewer is unlikely to care much becomes . The overall impression will be that these three remarkable people helped the Afghans to defeat the Soviets. While this is not a serious drawback, it is a disturbing aspect of an otherwise brilliant movie. <br /> <br /> The talent of the film is remarkable. The legendary Mike Nichols delivers a sleek, awesome-looking production. The material fits perfectly with his unobtrusive, dry style of direction. Sorkin delivers another brilliant script; The film has dozens of quotable lines and classic Sorkin swaps (best of all is the "Scotch Bottle" discussion between Wilson and Avrakotos) and retains something of a political and historical perspective in mind. Casting the film is a miracle: Tom Hanks performs well as lovable villains with a certain thing, Julia Roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as intrusive but dedicated Joanne, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals each scene (as usual) as a scorching cast , The always lovely Amy Adams takes another step towards her fame as Wilson's boring assistant, and Ned Beatty, Om Puri, Emily Blunt, Christopher Denham and Ken Stott have fleshed out the side cast. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is a smart and entertaining movie, a wonderful bit more than light entertainment. The fact that it decides not to be more than that should not be counteracted; It's brilliant, what it does. <br /> <br /> 8/10
