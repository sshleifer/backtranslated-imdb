Author and director Dean Bell provided many surprises and rousing moments in this modest but compelling road movie. His dialogue was snappy, and his use of very short flashback sequences was particularly effective in the narrative structure of the film. <br /> <br /> At the center of the film is the figure of Alice fleeing her New England past in a desperate attempt to get to Florida. On the way, she travels with eccentrics, Bill and Sandra, who are incredibly trying to brush Alice as a prostitute who makes money on truck stops. <br /> <br /> As a newcomer in her first movie role Emily Grace as Alice is sensational. There is no wrong note in their character choices. The film is worthwhile, above all, for the cunning but sensitive character of Sandra, which Judith Ivey has masterfully created. In virtually every moment Ivey is on the camera, there is a particularly clever subtext. As a bystander, I realized that I was stopping the tape, bouncing back and checking their scenes to try to spot the psychological subtleties. <br /> <br /> The film raises the following question about the characters: Are Bill and Sandra good Samaritans, or are they a nasty pair of Dickensians plundering adolescent Alice? One of the film's strong points is that it never quite answers this question. Alice seems to be more confident when she started from her experiences with Bill and Sandra. But is she really a better person? <br /> <br /> Partial comedy, partial street scene and partial drama of growing up. This carefully crafted film manages to engage us on many levels.
