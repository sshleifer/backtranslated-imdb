The second in director Cohen's trilogy of comedies of the Second World War (the others are "Till Death Do Us Part" and "Adolf Hitler - My Part In His Downfall") is a film version of the long-standing (and popular) situation of the BBC comedy. Like most broadcasts of television programs, this movie also suffers from plot and is more of a collection of sketches. Some of them work better than others, for example the scene where a high-ranking officer floats down a river is a memorable, surreal moment. <br /> <br /> The joy of this film is the portrayal of a past that probably never existed and an England that is characterized by picturesque scenery and opportunity, experienced scene stealers like John Le Mesurier with their biggest movie roles to see. Arthur Lowe excels as Captain Mainwaring, a bungler who, when the chips are down, shows great courage and saves the day (the climax is probably the character's biggest moment). Of course, episodes of the TV series are funnier, but as an introduction to a British legend you can not find anything better.
