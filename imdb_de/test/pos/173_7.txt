An absolute classic of the 80s. This is not like any other, as it gathers pint-sized, wild, psychotic teens with an urge to kill against all the adults in the city. Bud of JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (80's gold again) plays one of the killer kids and has teamed up with one of the little girls Jake Blues is trying to buy in the BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blond boy who, for some reason, disappears from the movie. The violence is sometimes funny and in some places surprisingly cruel. The demonic gang of smiling children, though somehow obsessed in an outlandish way, bears little resemblance to the drooling Children of the Damned, who never thought of using pistols, crossbows and shovels to kill those annoying adults. Julie Brown (not Downtown Julie Brown - the other) shows her rack three times as she dances around in her bedroom. This film is a rarity that I can not believe I did not grow up in the 1980s. This would have been my absolute favorite movie if I had seen him. Where is the sequel that demands the end? This movie is just incredible. Look for it at any price.
