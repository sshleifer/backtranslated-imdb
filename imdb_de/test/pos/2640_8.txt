Great party movie after the adventures of Bill & Tom, two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life straight, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) takes nothing but serious celebration. When Bill moves out of his mother's house to live alone, he faces many problems, from his girlfriend to his brother to his landlord. In the meantime, his friend Tom moves in to keep the rent down, but turns Bill's life upside down. This movie is a non-stop comedy from start to finish and is a personal favorite of mine. The soundtrack includes all guitarist Edward Van Halen as well as cameos of rockers Lee Ving and Ron Wood. 70s pornstar legend Kitten Navidad also performs! A classic 80s movie is worth a look. Now only a DVD release has to be expected! If you enjoyed this movie, take a look at "The Last American Virgin," which resembles "Wild Life." I appreciate both very much.
