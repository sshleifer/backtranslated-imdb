This is one of the best sequels and a very good movie, although there were some mistakes, but I enjoyed it anyway. This time Charles is fighting not just one or two Muggers but a whole army. Death Wish 3 has a lot of great action scenes and I enjoyed it every second. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this, and Jimmy Page delivers the music. The producers Golan and Globus are still there and Charles Bronson is still playing well for Paul Kersey. In this movie, too, it looks like Michael is trying to finish the Death Wish series and I can not blame him and I love the weapon Charles uses. Death Wish 3 is one of the greatest movies of 1985 and can not be better. <br /> <br /> I give this 9/10
