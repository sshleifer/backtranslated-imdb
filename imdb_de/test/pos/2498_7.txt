The love letter is one of my absolute favorite books, so of course I was skeptical when I heard it was going to be a movie. But I liked it. I found myself grinning through the movie. I admit that this is not a great movie, but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. I thought Capshaw and Scott were perfect as Helen and Johnny. As I imagined. The city and the landscape were just right. I recommend this movie, but do not expect too much, just enjoy it.
