"Murder Over New York" is fun, but not as good as most other Fox Chans. This film would have better called "Charlie Chan New York", the working title of the film. This is Toler's chance to play Chan in the Big Apple. But there's a lot to like here, including guest star Shemp Howard of the Three Stooges. <br /> <br /> This has one of my favorite sayings from Chan: "Coincidence like old egg - leave an unpleasant smell." Toler and Yung are good in this case, as is the supporting cast. But there is little or no mysterious atmosphere to look for in these films. It is still nice to see.
