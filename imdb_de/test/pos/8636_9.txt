There are a number of films that we say must be seen twice. In most cases, this is mainly a recommendation: you understand the movie after first viewing anyway. When you look at it for the second time, you can see the twists you did not notice. For Mulholland but that is different. The order that worked for me was: I see it for the first time - spend a day on the internet to find out what it's about - and then for the second time. Otherwise, you will most likely not be able to fully enjoy this movie. Then you begin to understand that this piece is awesome, the camera work is breathtaking and the aftertaste follows you for weeks. <br /> <br /> 9/10
