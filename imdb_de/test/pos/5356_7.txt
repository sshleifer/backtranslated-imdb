What-ho! This one is very good. I say very well, old boy. Or should I say "old bean"? My mastery of British terminology is a bit dusty. Anyway, my motorcycle boots and I went into this screening without first seeing Wallace and Gromit. I am happy to say that my boots and I were happy to have made their acquaintance. While W & G is not as accessible to adults as Toy Story, it still manages to be smart enough to provide adults with a little sense of humor who is definitely over the heads young people who are too busy to laugh at the wake-up bunnies to get an indication that something is wrong. I strongly recommend that you pay close attention every time you see books or words on the screen, as you quickly recognize word games that you miss if you're not careful. My favorite is a monster book that calls the Loch Ness Monster "Tourist Trappus." If you've ever said, "I can really get on with Kevin Federline," or if you're just illiterate, not only will you miss those jokes, but you should probably spend your time reading to the movies. Consider this as a public notice. <br /> <br /> The most impressive aspect of W & G is the sound animation. Thanks to the lengthy process, it took us five years to complete the film! According to the press documents, there were a few days when the optimal goal was to reach only 10 seconds of the finished film. People, sometimes I struggle to find the motivation to respond to a handful of emails or add subtitles to images for my reviews (a point evidenced by the lack of images in this review); Therefore, I can not even imagine having the necessary patience for it. <br /> <br /> I really like the rough, practical quality of the clay figures. The fact that you can see fingerprints in the sound is a nice, personal touch. How can you not be impressed with clay figures that express more expression and emotion than Paul Walker and Keanu Reeves together? The Were Rabbit's Curse, as director Nick Park calls it, is the world's first vegetarian horror movie to entertain children and adults alike. I rely on (and as a man proud of his shaggy, cool-haired masculinity, I'm reluctant to use that word) sweet and (oh man, I probably should not use that word too) lovely characters instead of outdated M.C. W & G proves that DreamWorks can create entertaining animations when deciding on the cheap joke.
