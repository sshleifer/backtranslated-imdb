The opening night of the South Asian International Film Festival (SAIFF) in New York was an event that many of us have been waiting for. <br /> <br /> would I finally be able to see 'Hari Om'? I was tired of looping the "promo" and hearing the boring taste of Nitin Sawhney's song Angel in the promo, and I begged to hear the rest of it. I was impressed by the visuals? and extremely curious how the rugged rickshaw rider could win the hearts of the stunning-looking French tourist! I remember being pretty intrigued by the subject when I read a few lines in the papers a few years ago! Especially since I was very fascinated a few years ago, how flamboyant the rickshaws were in Jodhpur! The snow and the crowds outside the theater only increased my fear. <br /> <br /> As soon as I was in the theater, I realized that the SAIFF organizers were just a catastrophe. It was uncomfortable and embarrassing how bad the event was organized. I was in a difficult place trying to explain and apologize to my friends (mixed nationality) whom I invited to the VIP guest list. I was hoping to prove to them that Indian cinema was not always about Bollywood. Finally, and finally, the film began to send fresh air in our direction. Or did I think so? Hari Om ?? started with chaos and noise. Autorickshaws honking, traffic and a lot of chaos. I smiled as I felt "home" filling inside me. <br /> <br /> So began the journey of Hari Om? an auto rickshaw driver in Jaipur? The director could not have made a better casting call with this character. From monsoon wedding to Hari Om ?? Despite his non-heroic appearance, Vijay Raaz wears this film solely because of his acting skills and his attitude to the character, which is full of all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in Rajasthan. He is definitely a winner. But how and where he learned English so fluently is the question! His character, however, shows beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity. I love his innocent portrayal of a simple man from a village? Who has big ambitions to be famous someday? and yet he knows when to go to reality. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Camille enters the movie wearing clothes that EVERYONE does not dare to wear in such a place. But it's weird that nobody cares so much about their dressed-up person. She looks very very colorful! Especially in the second half of the movie, when she changes into Indian clothes. Her relationship with her boyfriend, however, seems very vague. It probably fits in with the reality of certain relationships. <br /> <br /> The film takes us through the most beautiful parts of Rajasthan. The surprising thing is that at none of the places is anything other than what they REALLY are. You see the dirt, you see the primitive houses? You see Rajasthan exactly as it is !! Still ?? There is only one adjective with which it leaves you? 'Beautiful'. <br /> <br /> This is the first director who probably knows how to portray India exactly as it is - with the filth and noise and all the negatives India is associated with! Nevertheless, it gives the impression of being one of the most beautiful places. <br /> <br /> Kudos! Him for it. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of the movie I could possibly see is the tempo. I found it in certain places rather slowly ?? But rest assured that you will never get bored. <br /> <br /> The background scores of Nitin Sawhney give the film a classic, international and yet very Indian flair. The song "Angel", which is played in the film at a very crucial time, blends in beautifully with the visuals. <br /> <br /> I also heard that in addition to the main characters, all other actors are actually just normal people who have never seen a camera !! That's commendable, considering that most of our so-called established actors? It is still not possible to present realistic characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> All in all, was it a nice experience to see this movie? It's a potpourri of emotions. It has romance, humor? Realism?? nice visuals and places ..., great music, a great cast? A PACKAGE OFFER! When I left the theater, I was proud to be Indian. A few days later I asked one of my Bulgarian friends who had seen the movie with me if he wanted to see another Indian movie? and his answer was? "Is it better than Hari Om? If so, then I'll go. If not, I think I'll pass." From now on, Hari Om will be the benchmark for every Indian movie I see. " Mr. Bala, are you reading?
