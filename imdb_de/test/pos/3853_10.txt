Duchess is a pretty white cat living with her three kittens in the villa of her wealthy owner in Paris. When the wicked butler hears that the rich old lady first leaves everything in her will to the cats, the butler is upset because he wants to get everything first. So he sets her to sleep and leaves her at the roadside. When the cats wake up, they go home for a long hike. A street cat called Thomas O'Malley meets them and offers help. When Edgar sees her coming home, he is angry and sends her to Timbucktu. But Thomas's friends come to save the day. The rich lady decides to leave her home for every alley cat in Paris. <br /> <br /> This is a charming movie. The songs, including "Everybody Wants a Cat," are lively and optimistic. The voice is superb, with Eva Gabor (who later played Miss Bianca in Disney's THE RESCUERS films) as Duchess, Phil Harris (Baloo in THE JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in ROBIN HOOD) as Thomas and her characters giving interesting personalities. Allegedly, Walt Disney gave the film before he died in 1966. Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10.
