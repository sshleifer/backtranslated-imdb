I've seen the best Australian movie of the year so far, Jon Hewitt's Acolyte. Acolytes is a stylish thriller with a killer premise. Can you get that? Two bemoaned and molested teenagers discover a local serial killer in their suburb AND blackmailed him to kill the bully who harassed them. Hewitt has selected a first-class cast including the outstanding newcomers Sebastian Gregory, Joshua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play the teenagers. Add to these three, yes, that's really three great psychos! Led by Joel Edgerton in an outstanding performance by serial hit du jour, Belinda McClory, his distraught spouse, and Michael Dorman as a raped teen bully with swastika tattoos. Once you add these teenagers and these menacing adults, hell breaks loose. Hewitt has created a serial wall thriller that is damned original and accomplished. You can see the influence of Larry Clark and David Lynch's Twin Peaks, but Hewitt makes it his own, in a Qld suburban backwater that always rings with the drones of emptiness. The screenplay by Shayne Armstong, Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tight. <br /> <br /> If properly marketed, this movie could be a breakthrough for teenagers. The next Wolf Creek? It could be good. It makes all the right moves. The teens are really ala Larry Clark. They do not suck and have an attached PC agenda, they are not communicative, handsome and hip. The killers are dark with real threat. Joel Edgerton steals his scenes as the meek native Ted Bundy, who wears a butterfly on his four-wheel drive John Fowles The Collector. Dorman's Gasoline Rapist spills on the threat that overlooks Suburban Mayhem, and offers a scary batsman who can not wait to buy the farm. Not only that, it shows a confidence and a directorial championship from Hewitt that will surely bring him an IF or AFI nomination, if not an award! The nuanced and poetic staging, the brilliant sound design, the excellent cinematography and the tight structure make it one of the best Oz features I've seen so far this year. <br /> <br /> Thinking and unsettled. It's a really great issue for the return to the genre, which is currently taking place in Australian cinema. It will certainly arouse the interest of Hollywood. Oh, and did I mention that it came to Toronto? Which other Oz feature films can say that much? The world should prepare for a new author, Jon Hewitt.
