Evocatively referenced and smoothly photographed psychological mystery thriller featuring an extraordinary lead performance by a gloomy Donald Sutherland and strong supporting roles by Donald Pleasence and David Hemming. The material decides to keep anything but depressing, moving from the investigation period into the victim's backstory. The rare and rather disgusting nature of the investigation drew me in, but when the flashback pointed to the victim's side, their last days were not so convincing and they became a bit tired and sticky. The script is very detailed and, to a certain extent, complex when it comes to joining us. However, the last and surprising revelation should have more bone noise and not be helped by its sloppy execution. Howard Blake's music score has an emotional accent that simply lingers, and Claude Chabrol's capable handling (for the most part) has a strong, stylistic, and tight style that makes the most of atmospheric locations and flexible occupations. The young faces Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry are also doing incredible work.
