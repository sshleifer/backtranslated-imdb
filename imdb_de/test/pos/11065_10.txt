I gave this movie a 10, just from my sick obsession with Ingrid Bergman :) Lol. I truly believe that she was the best actress ever to worship this earth with her talent, and all her films are absolutely wonderful (even if they're horrible) because she's in them. If it had not been for her and Vivien Leigh (as originally requested, I heard), I would have given a 9.0. Simply because I love Viv, but probably not as much as Ingrid. And any other actress might have made it a 6. It's a good story. Two wild people fall in love with a society in which it is bad to be bad. Reminds me a bit of GWTW, unless he is provided with a higher setting. Gary Cooper is as always very handsome and of course his voice never changes the whole movie, but hey Ingrid makes him so amazing and stunning and 20 times hotter than he probably should be.
