Beyond The Clouds is a stunningly beautiful and elegiac work of art. The general softness of the light in which this film is immersed lets you touch the screen. The uplifted autumn mood could only be achieved by a director who has experienced many summers of experience. In other words, an old man. I do not know any other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood in such a gorgeous quality as Beyond The Clouds. Almost all the people in this movie are beautiful, unless you think of a beautiful woman, a pneumatic blonde bimbo. The dialogue is actually not that important, not that there is much anyway and as far as actions are concerned, forget it. Some movies exist as well as visual experiences, this is one of them. Do not bother if you want "easy conversation", not for you. <br /> <br /> I could get excited about the visual perfection of this movie for days, but I will not do it. If you are interested in film, photography, film directing, etc., watch this movie.
