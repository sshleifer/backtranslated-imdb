I rarely watch short films because they seem to be seen only on late night television and are not well enough known to know which short films are worthwhile. Since The Room is an additional feature of The Hitcher DVD, I had a wonderful opportunity to experience a high-quality pair of shorts with Rutger Hauer in great shape. <br /> <br /> Artfully shot in black and white, The Room explores The obsession of man with a room that he passed by in early adulthood is expressed in a documentary / interview style. The dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man expressing his feelings for a woman, but he is also compared to distractions and occasional inadequacies in fluent dealings. This gives Hauer's performance a great realism and depth that is perfect as an eccentric man and has most of his life behind him. <br /> <br /> The piano music that Harry (Hauer) hears from the room is constantly in the background, adding to the touching atmosphere of the film and reinforcing the sad feelings of Hauer. <br /> <br /> Hauer proves that he is more than just a psychotic Hollywood villain with this role and brings out his more sensitive side perfectly. Mattijn Hartemink is also effective in the Flashback scenes as a young Harry with a silent role. He shows how much he is affected by the music and his disappointment when she leaves. <br /> <br /> The end is prophetic and lasts longer than many feature films in a thoughtful mood. A very good effort.
