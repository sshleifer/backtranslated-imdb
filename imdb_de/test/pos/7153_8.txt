It's always a pleasure to see characters in a movie who are totally kind and good-natured, even when surrounded by those who are not. The moderately stupid premise of the film is that the conservative, religious family Franklin (mother, father, teenager, boy and girl) is involved in an accident in which parents and brother have a near-death experience during which they meet Jesus, a pleasant, but a somewhat angry soul that removes the burden of original sin from them. When they return to their lives, many of their views and attitudes have changed, much to the dismay of the daughter who has not shared that experience. The religious side is, I think, represented with a good balance, from the good (Jesus) to the terrible fearless (those of his "followers" who are obsessed with the sins of others and are totally unaware of themselves). It's a thought-provoking film that will give you some good laughs along the way and give you the pleasant feeling that the world could be a nicer place than you think.
