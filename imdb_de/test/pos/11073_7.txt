This movie is reminiscent of "Boys' n the Hood", "Menace to Society", "South Central" and others, and even shares actors with some of them. The mentality "we vs the law" of the film is underlined by the completely black neighborhood against the almost white police. Here the cops are so bad that they look like cartoons, and in one scene they even rob the boys as they drive by in a car that they have just "liberated" from their owner. It's like a bushwurst from an old western, but its modern feel makes it all too real. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the young Jason Petty and his buddies, whose school costs only an inconvenience that takes time out of their "real occupation" of charging cars. This happens to be Newark, New Jersey, a rust-free city that has little work but is known to be criminal. In fact, the problem is so grave that the cops have written "Car Theft" on their backs to show that a whole unit needs to be dedicated to this particular crime. The boys use a "slender Jim" to "happily break into cars and enjoy driving as if it were not a big deal." They only get into real trouble when the police ambush in. The vicious, Nazi-like lieutenant has It is a revenge against the boys and does not see them as human beings worthy of salvation, but as human targets, in fact, it reminds a bit of this sadistic Nazi officer of the Warsaw Ghetto, who in the movie "Schindler's List" made Jews a pleasure If the boys steal an ambush retaliatory police car, it's likely to be downhill quickly, beaten hard by the cops, and Jason finally arrested - these are clearly "bad guys" who will drive your car in a minute but the movie demands that we see them as anti-heroes, Jason shows how he protects his sister and boyfriend, the s I take care of his own grandmother. The film has asked us whose side he meets and who he should feel saddened with: the boys whose lives go down the drain, the honest citizens whose cars are stolen left and right, and who at every shooting range in the crossfire Moment or the city of Newark itself could be advised, whose spirit is betrayed by brutal, soul-dead policemen. Despite the exaggerated portrayal of the latter, the film offers a realistic-looking portrayal of the ghetto, the protagonists and their families, and the culture of car theft in a city where there seem to be only two career paths - law enforcement and crime. Oddly enough, the entire topic of drugs is never mentioned. The filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are obviously prejudiced against the Newark police, who we hope will not be so bad as to be portrayed here. Still, they gave us another stunning story about downtown and the black youth that went awry, and Sharron Corley is doing well as Jason.
