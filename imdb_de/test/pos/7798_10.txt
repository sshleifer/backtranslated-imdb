I can hardly believe that this movie has such a low rating. It is probably one of the best comedies of all time and certainly the best Bollywood comedy of the 90s. The movie was not doing very well at the box office and people had diametrically opposite reactions after seeing it. My guess is that most people did not expect it to be a complete comedy and expected a regular movie. If you love comedy, this is a must. And Aamir Khan is outstanding.
