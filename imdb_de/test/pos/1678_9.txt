RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955) <br /> <br /> <br /> For me it seems to be a very risky idea to try a Hollywood remake of Jules Dassin's 1955 classic RIFIFI , Al Pacino, to be released in 2007, will apparently take the lead role and play the role of Tony le Stephanois. Risky business ... How will they do it? <br /> <br /> Ironically, Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood and continued his fortune in France to create this little masterpiece by some of "The Grandfather of All Capricorn and Predator Films." In my opinion, it's a unique classic beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable end results ever made on film. Whatever the opinion of the movie is. <br /> <br /> In recent years, RIFIFI has been dangerously overrated. Nevertheless, this French Noir classic should not be forgotten. Look at this before the remake is out there for some ammunition comparing them. Camera Obscura --- 9/10
