General Trelayne is a super thing who wants to play a little game with the Enterprise crew. A lot of extremely unlikely and senseless things seem to be happening, and Trelayne seems obsessed with human practices of warfare and murder. He seems to experience what he finds exciting and has created a human environment (albeit a few hundred years old) in which to play out his fantasies. The environment is subtle spurious, and the crew immediately begins to recognize the inconsistencies. It soon becomes clear that Trelayne is not only an immature, but a very fallible God. Regardless of how you feel about it, stay at the bottom of the Twilight Zone. It is worth it .. <br /> <br /> As many have pointed out, Trelayne's character inspired the more refined and amusing character Q - and you can see more than just shadows in John DeLancy's build up of that personality Campbell's Trelayne. It's fun to compare how the four captains we dealt with Q are so radically different.
