I saw this movie for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before ... <br /> <br /> There are more than a dozen modern, stunning French films from en couer de hiver to the three color trilogy and all are special. This movie is one of them. A real pleasure with so many great things, from homage to Hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in novels and monica. While Monica is very beautiful, Romane steals a very sexy woman and steals many of the scenes she inhabits. I'm not sure why people think this movie is confused, as the scenes are a perfect mix of the past and the present as counterpoint to the characters' own remarkable journey that makes the movie flow, and you barely notice that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have enchanted and enchanted the beholder. <br /> <br /> Like most French and European films, this story would never be broadcast across the Atlantic as no studio could capture the magic without blurring life with Hollywood bleaching, common in most movies is lost in the translation. Americans make brilliant movies, but not of that type ... If they let someone like a young Polanski work on it, they might not necessarily slaughter an English version ... For those who do this If you do not watch subtitled movies, you will spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss. For those who can read then, you would spit yourself to miss such films ... <br /> <br /> I would call this Neo-Franco-Noir, but only to the reviewer, this one Film elite has called to shit. I think I saw him add up to twenty four pies. He believes that Romane Bohringer is a kind of French mayonnaise ... It's a kind of art that pulp fiction is art ... but with more Gallic Savoire Faire ... <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 with everyone Consider ... and does anyone have Romane's phone number ... she's the perfect French Salad Dressing ...
