It's not perfect, but it's close. I love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Chief of Superman), the housekeeper, the waiter at the Felix restaurant, and the judge. I can go on like this. This film has been part of my family's holiday tradition since my youth, and my children grew up with it! "The baby swallowed the clock" was always my son's favorite line. <br /> <br /> The sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and dresses stole the show along with the cuddly, fun S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan also has some great songs. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie and suggest skipping the remake (blah).
