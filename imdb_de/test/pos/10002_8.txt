I saw this movie in a preview, and it's adorable. The cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good and the story is fabulous. If this movie is not going well then it's not because he did not deserve it. Before this movie, I did not know how charming Shia Lebouf can be. He does a wonderful, self-contained job as a lead. There is something incredibly sweet about him and that makes the movie even better. The other actors also do a good job, and the film contains moments of excitement, more than you would expect from a movie about golf. Sports movies are a dozen, but this one stands out. <br /> <br /> This is one that I can recommend to anyone.
