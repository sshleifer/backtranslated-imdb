I came across it by chance. I was with my friends and he had just started to look at it, so I sat down and thought we were going to shoot the breeze while it was in the background. Within seconds, however, I was immersed in this documentary drama, and spent the rest of the time focusing fully on it and not saying a word. <br /> <br /> I never got to know the story of the first solo around the world race, not to mention the tragic events in which a man took on the adversities that should be his salvation for all his misfortune but ultimately become an example for them. I did not know the story and looked at it with the same passion that I imagine when those who read about the race at the time it actually happened include the event and are looking forward to more information With the odds and pros beating, making the shocking twists of the story all the more tragic, I felt I lived the story. The story is told with great care, and the interviewees clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy, which offers great insights, but is also superbly used by archival material from interviews at the time of the tragedy, the photographs and photographs of lonely sailors. and the insights into the heads of the sailors and the effects of loneliness were great. <br /> <br /> I am shocked that this story is not known or turned into a movie, but also grateful. Thankful that we have this drama documentary to tell the story of those who knew the man, rather than a tiny, washed-out film adaptation, and thankful that I caught this gem by accident. <br /> <br /> It's a must if you like documentaries or not.
