Turning Isherwood's somewhat dark and absolutely brilliant novel into light, comic drama could easily have been a catastrophe, but at some point it was not. The story is moving at a rapid pace and the black-and-white images are great, as are Harvey and Harris, who are pushing through a crazy Weimar Berlin. Fun!
