15 PARK AVENUE is the address that "Mithi / Mithali" (Konkona) is looking for from the beginning of the movie. "Prof.Anu" (Shabhana Azmi) is Mithi's extremely loving and affectionate half-sister from Mithi's mother, the previous marriage. The film revolves around these characters and examines the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi by babbling incessantly on Anu and others. <br /> <br /> Konkona does not deserve one but thousands of awards (which I am sure she will get) for this handover of Mithi in this movie. From the first scene you can see the look of a patient on her face, her limp lips and sleepy eyes. Rahul Bose did a good job but was reduced to half of the movie despite his importance in her life. <br /> <br /> Pay close attention to the intense relationships between the characters of Mithi Anu, Anu and Anu's mother, and between Anu and Sanjiv (Kanwaljit Singh). Shabhana Azmi, as always, has done a compelling performance that should be remembered as a sister who sacrificed her life for Mithi. <br /> <br /> The film may not be an ordinary Hindi potboiler, but it may well make people look at schizophrenic patients in a different light. <br /> <br /> As usual, Aparna Sen brings the film to a different end than a clich√©, we may think. Hat to her, for this great movie !!!
