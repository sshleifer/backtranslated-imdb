As a 'physically handicapped' person (God, how do I hate this sentence) I just found this on cable where absolutely nothing else was seen - overall it was a fantastic movie. Yes, I was a little disappointed when I found out that none of the actors were disabled, and yes, I was a little disappointed that the film was no longer filmed from the "true" view of the disabled as if you were always the biggest person in the room and then have to live the rest of your life looking at nothing but the asses and legs of other people. You always have to wait for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only disability-friendly stand; all others are rude bodily expulsions while you wait?). and the scene in which he drove the car was absolutely me! was there, done, literally. But the movie was true enough to be important - even though I've never lived in a house or dorm, there were many times in the movie where I nodded and said, "Yeah, that's right ... that happened for me .... "What impressed me is that some of the commentators on this panel expressed the fact that the film has made them live a little differently and with a little more insight than the life of a dumb" Minority ". If you want more than a movie to make you think and see life differently, the films alone are extremely successful. For each child in the intermediate level, consideration should be required. <br /> <br /> For anyone with severe physical disabilities, independence is one of the most important aspects of our daily lives, from work to conviviality. For those of you who have seen the film as a "cliché", try to live our lives for a day - you'll see that the movie was "cliché" because ... it's true. The challenges faced by the actors just flew over the surface of what's happening to us every day. If we are lucky, we experience the same emotional and personal growth as the three characters (including the girl). Every day presents us with obstacles that we must overcome - it's just that there is no swelling, dramatic music that accompanies our lives, unless it's in our iPods ... lol!
