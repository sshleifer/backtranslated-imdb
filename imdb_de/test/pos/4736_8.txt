The movie someone had to do. Waco: The Rules of Engagement analyzes the evidence for the Waco, Texas dispute that led to the destruction of the Davidian Branch's farm and alleged government disguise. <br /> <br /> The first thing you need to know about this movie is that you see short but disturbing photos of the victims. This is not intended for the shock, but to show points on how they died, as if you were present at the examination of the medical examiner. <br /> <br /> The second thing you should know about this film is that it's quite cumbersome at two and a quarter of an hour, especially if you've been following the events closely at this point. If you know of events other than those reported in the mass media, or if the only page in the history you know is the official government report, this can be a significant consideration. On the other hand, if you want a more succinct (albeit unapological one-sided) version of events, you should see "Waco: The Big Lie." <br /> <br /> To summarize, this is pretty much the final documentary about this tragic event, and it's very sobering, but as a film work you could put your patience to the test, especially if you have a short attention span. And for those who have watched the CSPAN hearings and the 60-minute reports, it is temporarily superfluous. <br /> <br /> Maybe someday somebody will make a documentary that covers some of the strange aspects of this story, such as the bizarre chain of events that led to the ATF raid, or the psychological warfare tactics the FBI uses Rock music in the sect has blown up, and their charismatic leaders (all rock musicians themselves) pick up their instruments and turn their massive amplifiers outward to blow their own music back onto them.
