I've seen over 2000 studio-era sound films, including many by Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Shirley Jones, and Deanna Durbin's own universal features. There's also plenty of live music and live recordings recorded in the studio. And I assure you that nobody should sing in front of the camera and in front of the microphone, or maybe everywhere, EVER TOURED DURBIN'S SOLO HERE ... mono-soundtrack and crap of the 1930's microphones and so on. The Canadian boy sings this piece of "Il Bacio" as if he had lived and written himself, and then later on in his career came back for a retrospective in Italy, not like a kid who learned it from their music teacher Has. > <br /> If you skip this extra on the DVD - or before the Garland solo - then just take your hand, as this cheap MGM teaser happens to catch one of the best performances of the 20c.
