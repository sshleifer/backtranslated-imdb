I have never been interested in this piece in the past, although I love Shakespeare. I've seen most of his plays now and studied some at school enthusiastically. Something about this story and all the excitement seemed to reject me. I never bothered to see Hamlet until I recently decided to at least look at it, and I borrowed the Olivier version from the library. Well, I have to fight with it. Olivier looked far too old, not just in his looks, but in his role as well. The song had been cut to a conventional length, and I think it had missed too much when I found it hard to focus on it, it soon got boring and annoying. I still think that Olivier's Henry V is the best version I've seen of this rousing game - though I have to admit that I have not re-previewed the Beeb version and can not remember what it was like to she was shown for the first time. <br /> <br /> I have heard of the full length Branagh version of Hamlet. Although I liked his Much Ado very much, I think the Beeb version is a lot better and I was not quite impressed with his Henry V. But I was a bit off Branagh after seeing his disappointing effort on a musical from Love's Labor's Lost I really like and was so well done by the Beeb. <br /> <br /> Having recently purchased the full Beeb Shakespeare on DVD, I soon saw one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, Richard II, and I was simply thrilled with Jacobi and instantly convinced his Hamlet to be next to see. What a revelation is this piece for me now! Yes, it's great, but I think it takes an actor to play Hamlet, and that's Jacobi for me. Amazing. Interesting to note that while he is older than I understood the character Hamlet, he does not show it while he was in Olivier. Well, I realize he's also in the Branagh version and had a lot to do with Branagh's training, so I'll have to watch that to see what Jocobi does to Claudius! I'm interested to know that Jacobi trained Branagh as yes, you can see the influence. <br /> <br /> And now I will look at everything again ....
