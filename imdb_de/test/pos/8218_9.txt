If you actually read this report, I give you a lot of credit. They take care of the movie that most people forgot and then read after the first review. So for your reading pleasure ... I assume that you already know the plotline, so I will not waste time typing that. I would like to mention that Sandra Bullock has done a great job with this film. She was very understanding of the role of a computer programmer, which is often hard to do. I can say that because I happen to be a computer programmer. Anyway, I thought the basic plot was a very good one. You can easily create sub-plans on the mainframe and make a very entertaining movie out of it. The premise is also scarily realistic, as it can all really happen if the right precautions are not taken. Too late! If you like it, when Sandra Bullock wants to bring a role to life and watch a very well made movie for the time, take a look at this little gem. You will not be disappointed. :-)
