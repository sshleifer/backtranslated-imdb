Impressive! It's hard to put my feelings into words for this episode. Ice is certainly one of the best episodes of the first season. It's my favorite of the season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure, isolated in the middle of the Arctic, causing an unknown organism with murderous aggression, can not make the drama any better. Paranoia rules, as even Mulder and Scully have doubts about each other's reason. I've heard people complain about the similarities of this episode with the movie 'The Thing'. I did not see it, so I would not know. Ice is worth seeing, just to see Mulder and Scully testing their ever-growing trust among themselves. This episode is intense and exciting to the end. You will not be disappointed!
