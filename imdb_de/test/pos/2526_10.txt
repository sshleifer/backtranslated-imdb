Pixote is headed with a touch of sentimentality. And yet I can not imagine that Hector Babenco owes some of his filming to the film to the neo-realistic style of Vittorio De Sica, especially Shoeshine (this movie, like Pixote, usually takes place in a children's prison). And though I might prefer De Sica's film when it comes to choosing between the two, it's so close because it's not a pun, like choosing between two kids. Both are wonderful works of raw drama, and with Pixote, Babenco has an added advantage and a staggering quality to deal with, that is not filmed under conditions after a World War. So it was in Brazil - you would see it with a little more flair and awe in City of God, maybe in some of the same places - and these kids were on the street before and after the movie. Some are not more than 20 years later for anyone living. <br /> <br /> The "star", the street kid Fernando Ramos da Silva, plays the title character, a teenager without a father, or any family that will take care of him, and dozens of other street children and offenders in a reformatory for Boys accommodated. The conditions could not be much worse and become even more unbearable as two children are killed one by one by a sentry. There is an uprising and an escape, and halfway through the movie we find Pixote with a few other teenagers, including Lilica, a practical transvestite, not even 18, and they turn into pickpockets, drug dealers, or whatever. None of this, I should repeat, is shown with a kind of ham-fist seriousness - surely you would not get Ron Howard or Paul Haggis to direct that picture in a million years - and yet there is an emotional honesty for everything, because nothing is trivialized. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene shows how fragile life is for Pixote and how he could be killed or die at some point without having to reach puberty at the level of those around him, the are a little older (though not much) and become things that will haunt that person forever. Despite the use of Babenco's tender and sad music and one or two scenes where people cry a lot, nothing feels forced. As with De Sica, perhaps even more than considering the consistent conditions of street children in San Paolo and Rio, he is a natural director of children, and he can convince himself of Ramos da Silva and Jorge Juli√£o and other some really good works just setting the right accents of "cinematic" drama (which is not so real that it becomes documentary, which is not a bad thing) and in some scenes even subtlety. <br /> <br /> Pixote is not as well known as it is Brazilian films of the late 21st century that look back on the horrors of Rio or even on neorealistic films, but that's what it should be. If you want to take a good, hard look at what it was like, look for it in a library or in the other library and immerse yourself in the best foreign film of 1981.
