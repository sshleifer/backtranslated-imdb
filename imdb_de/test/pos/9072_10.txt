The crowd of stars of the box office is phenomenal in this movie !! William Baldwin, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts !! This film was also shot in one of my favorite years in 1990 !! I am a Chicago and the scenery in Chicago was very identifiable and artistically accelerated! I liked this movie and the excitement that sparked the climax in this picture was a strong element in the storyline that was absolutely sensational.> "Flatliners" is a group of angry students who feeling upset by the doctor, to be shallow, to achieve some sort of social justification !! If life does not make sense, it would be illogical to be curious about apocalyptic nightmares !! At the same time there is no turning back once her excessive curiosity has defeated her. The king of the hill (so to speak) is the one who screams vehemently: I'll do two minutes !! Who else will do that !! EVERYONE WOULD TRY FOR TWO AND ONE HALF !! Ultimately, all these newly arrived and very unwelcome accusations now have an extremely omnipresent bias in the life of this rebel !! The completion of their justified or unjustified pathos required a full 360-degree perspective on the issues that plagued them !! Whatever the purpose of this reckless and academic harassment, it is definitely an original approach to empowering your personality! I liked this movie, 1990 was also a good year for me, things seemed to be going down this year !! When I saw this movie in November 1990 in November, I was very glad that I did that !!
