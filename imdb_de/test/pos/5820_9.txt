This love story, slightly heated for Cassavetes, is conveyed in a pleasing way by two wonderful performances by Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassell. Rowlands has never been as beautiful as an oppressed, damaged woman in her mid-thirties, striking her match in Seymour. Cassell is a powdery grain full of energy and romantic ideas (on his terms). <br /> <br /> There is a great supporting performance from Val Avery as Zelmo Swift and an unusual (as always) Timothy Carey, who is well worth the price. The film was made between husbands and a woman under the influence. This is Cass's most accessible film that should touch anyone's heart (especially the Cassavetes hatred), who claims his films are too long and cumbersome. I did my top ten this year and did not see enough people. An 8 out of 10.
