I had never heard of this movie until it appeared on cable TV, and I can not understand why. Geena trumps Arnold as action hero in this movie! Geena is a former CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a school teacher with a peaceful family life in a rural town. She lives with husband and daughter for 8 years. There are hints that she may have been someone else, especially if someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she has never died and they want to take care of it. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, who is a former police officer. Together, they form a couple as entertaining as Mel Gibson & Danny Glover. When Geena finally regains her memory, she turns into a killing machine, where she once played with the song "She's Not There" in the background. What follows is that Geena and Samuel go after the bad guys and hopefully live. For the rest of the movie, Geena has to decide who she really is. The killing machine without feeling? The mother / teacher with the quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially as the bad guys grab Geena's daughter. Great action scenes that rise in the Die Hard movies!
