This is my ever popular Looney Tunes cartoon. It's a common conspiracy: Daffy Duck tries to convince Elmer Fudd that it's really bunny time and shoot down bugs. But you can never outsmart the rabbit! In addition to the usual comic comedy, this cartoon is backed by great puns that let you roll on the floor.
