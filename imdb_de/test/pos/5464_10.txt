Captivating story of grasping behind the curtains. The film follows the plight of David Letterman and Jay Leno as they battle for the elusive Tonight Show spot. Letterman cited his desire for the coveted time window and Leno, led by his agent and the little devil on the shoulder, Helen Kushnick. Kathy Bates (Kushnick) is excellent in this movie and alienating even from top dogs like Bob Wright, Warren Littlefield and Howard Stringer. Towards the end of the film, you are so fascinated by how she handles every situation, from guest booking to delayed recording, and you want more. John Michael Higgins (Letterman) plays his part for the tee. Sometimes I wondered if he had a relationship with the real letterman. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of business negotiation.
