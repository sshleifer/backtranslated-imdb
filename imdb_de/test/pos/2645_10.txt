That was such a great movie. It was made with such a beautiful design, such a symmetry. I love the way classical music is connected to the classical art of the earth, of space and beyond. It was so fluid and a masterpiece that made me think. I loved how the monoliths never changed, though primates, earth, and space did. I loved it, as it was a question of "Do you need me / us now"? The film expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. What could you ask for more from a mere movie? Maybe a supplemental movie. Any appreciator from 2001: A Space Odyssey will find that the 2010 film is the Complementary Film of 2001. 2010 is more story-driven than in 2001.
