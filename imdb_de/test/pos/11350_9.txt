Two people who live in the same residential complex have found that their partners have an affair. While trying to find out how it happened, they embark on an emotional journey that hurts to find a solution. <br /> <br /> Building on his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar Wai gives us this rather old-fashioned and wonderful story of awakened passions, yearning and unfulfilled love. <br /> <br /> In the Mood for Love may not be everyone's taste. It gets pretty lazy in 98 minutes: not very long for a movie, but it seems longer, because not much happens. But behind this lazy feeling hides a pretty tightly constructed film. Most of the story consists of a series of role-playing games in which the characters play suspected scenarios between their spouses and try to figure out how the affair began. I say cunning because of course it is difficult for the audience (and the characters) to recognize what is in-role and what is real. <br /> <br /> If it all sounds rather artful and self-confident, that's because it is so. Shamelessly so. It is perfected by two of Hong Kong's best, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with outstanding support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan. <br /> <br /> It is also a virtuoso performance by Wong Kar Wai, who treats the audience to a sensual and sensual overload. Christopher Doyle (who later used his lush, overripe style on Hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose delightfully understated style can be seen in a small town in the spring) was a genius film genius. It has all the bold beauty of Doyle, without the Athena poster cheesiness of his work on Hero. The music is prominent as always at Wong. From Nat King Cole, who sings in Spanish, to the haunting strings of the main theme, it fits in perfectly with the eclectic beauty of the images. <br /> <br /> All in all a top movie, whether by plot, acting, cinematography or soundtrack. Similar but more accessible than Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, this is a beautiful, old-fashioned story of lost and regained love. <br /> <br /> And look out for Tony Leung's hotel room in 2046, which featured Wong's new movie of the same name.
