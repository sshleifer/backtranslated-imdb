I enjoyed it. There you go, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and it was a lot more fun. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer movies like these that like Die Hard 4 holding up the box office and getting critical encouragement just because you have an old guy saving America. Van Damme is doing well for a man of his age (47 I think) who remembers kicks on kickboxers. If you like old school action and explosions, this is the movie you can watch. This is one of Van Damme's best works. <br /> <br /> The films of Van Damme and Steven Seagal appear theatrically where I live, and I never miss the chance to see our vintage action stars on the big screen.
