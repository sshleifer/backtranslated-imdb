<br /> <br /> "Let's swap Murder - your wife, my dad" - apparently innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines as they meet during a lunch break on a train journey. Guy, a solid, respectable tennis player whose problem is that his wife, the flirty Miriam, does not divorce him so that he can marry Senator's daughter Anne, laughs the whole conversation as a joke. The next week he does not laugh anymore. In a scene with classic Hitchcock excitement, Bruno brings Miriam through a carnival and strangles her. Her glasses fall off and we see the murder twice reflected through her lenses. Cold-hearted and amoral Bruno, having completed his part of the business, approaches a horrified guy who even expects him to "make his or her contribution". Matters are not helped when Annie's precocious and decidedly younger sister suspects the murder of Guy of Miriam. Accused of murder he had not committed and expected to commit another. What will Guy do? The power of this film is that people by nature have a murderous side - and this Hitchcock is perfect.
