I saw that during the demonstration at the GenCon in Indy. I had some time to kill and decided to give it a try. In a crowded ballroom with only standing room available, he played about 1000 people. <br /> <br /> Wow, what a ride! The script was scarce. The action is tense. The pace is perfect. The character exhibition was excellent. One thing I really appreciated was that you knew this was not a big budget movie. However, it quickly became clear that the creators pushed their sets and effects as much as possible despite their limitations. And it was more than enough. <br /> <br /> It's true that this movie was aimed at a specific audience - gamer / tabletop player - and the creators have no trouble concealing it. But other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. Because when she takes care of the jugular scene after scene and does not worry about whether Mom, who is watching, "understands", she always gets the biggest laughs. But there is enough universality that Mama will laugh too, even if she is not part of every joke. I think too often that I see films that try so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator so that they appeal to most people, but the movie just has to suffer for it. <br /> <br /> But not this strip. In fact, this movie was so solid that the audience from the opening credits lay around the finger. And although the viewers around me really wanted to like the movie, they were not poppers - gamers are among the most critical niches on the market. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw it in a big crowd. At least ten times the audience had such a good time that it burst into applause during a joke or a scene during the movie. How often does this happen during screenings? It should come as no surprise that there were big standing ovations as the final credits rolled. <br /> <br /> I myself can not wait for this to be published. After the end, one of the producers said that he was shooting for a simultaneous TV / DVD release. This date can not come soon enough.
