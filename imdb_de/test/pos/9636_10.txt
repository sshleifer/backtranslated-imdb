This is another classic Seagal movie. He goes, no, crosses through the Patriots, just all the other Mega Seagal movies. There's nothing close to Seagal in this movie, except maybe the part where he has to find a cure for this so-called "epidemic," and he's starting to throw things over the lab, but everything works out, me My, we see it, his master Seagal, he has to win. What about his outfit in the movie, masterpiece, he must have chosen it himself. It's great that everyone in the movie dies after being exposed to the virus, but Seagal does not even get a cough. The incident at the end, when he kills the fat guy with the broken glass, Genius, I bet, Seagal thought about it too. This movie is great and easy. great plot, great characters and Seagal.
