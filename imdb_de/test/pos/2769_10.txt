I love this movie. and Disney Channel is ridiculous if you do not play it anymore. I think they should definitely send Susie Q back into the air for at least one night so we can pick them up !!! but if someone does not know where to find it? My e-mail address is cristin6891@aim.com. Please send me an e-mail if you know where to find this movie. Online or everywhere. I told my kids about this movie and I think they deserve to see it too. All those Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring. I need Susie Q back !! It was a great movie and had great actors and I do not see why it was blown out of the air. If everyone loves this movie so much, why was it taken from the air? Please consider my comment and all other comments on this film. Thanks, have a good day.
