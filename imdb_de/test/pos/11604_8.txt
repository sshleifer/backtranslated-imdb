I bought the DVD a long time ago and finally looked at it. I really enjoyed watching this movie because you do not get a chance to see many of the more serious Bollywood movies of better quality. Very well done, but I would say that you have to pay attention to what is going on, as it is easy to get lost. When you start watching the movie, do not do anything! I would advise people to read all the reviews here ... including spoilers before watching the movie. Raima Sen gave her first great performance I've seen. Aishwarya was in a good shape. All performances were strong, directing and cinematography ... look at it!
