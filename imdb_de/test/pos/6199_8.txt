* Be warned of possible spoilers * <br /> <br /> A friend told me to watch this series, and I'm glad I took her words for it. <br /> I read the summary of the DVD cover and I was immediately fascinated. The main protagonist is Muslim? No way, this is a first! It's about an FBI agent, who is in deep secrecy to penetrate into a possible sleeping cell in LA. and understand that - he is a practicing Muslim. I was a bit skeptical at first, half expecting a hero or opponent to spit out stupid, meaningless, and mindlessly sacred than any other fanatical tricks. Let's face it, many shows are guilty /> <br /> But then I looked at the first three episodes and thought: Okay, that's good. It was not until the fourth episode ("scholar") when I was really impressed. I want to praise the great writing as well as the outstanding achievements of the actors. I just love how complex each of these characters is - they're not straight two-dimensional cardboard cutouts, good guys / bad guys. Michael Ealy is a wonderful and credible performer as the Muslim FBI agent Darwyn Al-Sayeed, who crosses the line between the good Muslim and the man with mistakes. Oded Fehr gives his character Farik an interesting depth - Farik is not the typical oily stereotype of the Middle East, but simply someone who really believes in his cause and considers himself not as a fanatic, but as a man who is ready, his extreme Measures to justify beliefs. He is very charismatic and authoritarian. But I would say that Alex Nesic's performance in "Scholar" clearly left an impression on me. His portrayal of his character's emotional struggle was astonishing, torn between the soft-spoken words of a Muslim scholar who urged him to return non-aggressively, as this is the only acceptable path in God's eyes and Farik's belief in believing otherwise. <Br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing more shows like this, and not a ridiculously high-octane one-man show series. It is smart and open-minded.
