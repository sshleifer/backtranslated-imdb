This movie was better than I expected. I do not think it deserves an R rating. I have seen PG-13 films with poorer language and violence. I found this movie entertaining and I enjoyed it. If you're a person who dissects everything, you'll find a lot wrong with it, but if you think it's fair, you'll find it entertaining.
