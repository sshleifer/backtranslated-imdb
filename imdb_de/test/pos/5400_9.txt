Before Barton addresses all of my comments, we remember that opinions are like asses, we all have them .... <br /> <br /> I loved Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, I loved the dialogue and thought the Acting is great. Simply played down and unobtrusive. Unlike some others, I found this @ unpredictable. <br /> <br /> I found Sigourney's role refreshingly humorous and realistic, especially in her scene where she confronts the bully in the trailer. <br /> <br /> I found it pleasant and I did not expect to recommend it to anyone. That's why there are different types of ice cream that please everyone ...
