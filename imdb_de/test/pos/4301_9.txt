This was one of the worst Columbo episodes I've ever seen, though I'm only in the second season. <br /> <br /> The typical activities in Columbo are both amusing and irritating. His cigar-bag, which causes him problems, has been seen before, and the part he always identifies with the killer somehow - in this case while cooking - distracts the scene in the TV cooking show from the main theme. <br /> <It also did not explain why the brother severed some of the mixer's wires at the beginning of the show. The reason was never explained or served no purpose. But most of all, I did not like the bride's death. This has never been explained and it is the main reason why I rate this episode so low.
