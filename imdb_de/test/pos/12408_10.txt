This film about a group of small town adolescents who decide to rob the local bank is excellent. Brian (Justin Walker) wants to leave his little town, much like Jimmy Stewart in "It's A Wonderful Life". However, unlike George Bailey, Brian will rob a bank to finance his dream of attending art school, even if his father does not seem supportive. The offer to Brian is to behave like a customer and distract the guard. It is a tempting offer, if I give it to many, I ask what they would do. Brian does it anyway. As the sheriff (James Remar) and his troop surround the bank, things get worse and worse. It's a stalemate as even the Feds move in to kill the kids if they have a clean shot. The sheriff must prevent this and try to end the conflict in a peaceful way. Unfortunately, the tensions are rising and the teenagers inside are turning on each other. Some are out of control. The paper cutter scene is cruel and difficult to watch. Very intensive!
