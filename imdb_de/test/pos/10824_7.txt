More and more French cinemas are showing that this is the only one that can confront Hollywood and spend large sums on the money in their films. If Bon Voyage had been made in the US, nobody would be surprised. Perfect in France, in the 1940s, when the Nazi invasion was technically sound, and with some of the most international French actors (Depardieu, Adjani, Ledoyen ...). Bon Voyage deals with two parallel stories: a scientific one and his pupil (Ledoyen), who tries to hide one of his discoveries (a kind of water that can act as a nuclear bomb) from the Nazis; and a poor man in love with a well-known actress (Adjani) who ends up in jail, charged with a crime he did not commit to protect her. <br /> <br /> Gute Journey seems to have been done in the old style, without unnecessary camera movements and effects. Without major twists in the plot. As I said, the production itself has done a great job. But the main problem with this movie is the script. Is it a spy movie? A romantic comedy? A spy comedy? An intriguing comedy? It is unclear. That makes Bon Voyage a bit unbalanced. If you think you're seeing a comedy, suddenly a different, more dramatic, slower storyline changes ... I think they should have focused on one of the lines of reasoning (the espionage plot), leaving the romantic parts in the background. <br /> <br /> My rating: 6.5 / 10
