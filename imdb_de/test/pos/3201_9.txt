I think I was not sure what to expect from this movie. He had a good cast, an interesting storyline, and a lot of other things aimed at him, but I still could not shake the feeling of fear I had in my stomach about what it would be like. I am happy to say that I was very pleased with the result and I regret that I always worried about it. The opening scenes of the films were extremely interesting and sufficient to arouse an early interest in the film. Later in the film, we were introduced to the characters of the film, as well as to the battle uprisings. Like most reviews for this film, I have to admit that there are some unnecessary stereotypes, but it can not erase the overall power of this movie, which reads like a good novel. The cast is great, especially Chestnut and McGowan, and the movie is one of the better TV movies ever made this year. Definitely worth a look if you are looking for a good courtroom drama.
