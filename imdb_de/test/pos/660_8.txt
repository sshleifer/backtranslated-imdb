I just saw Baby Blue Marine after 30 years again. I still find it a pleasant and romantic film that captures a time that has been lost forever. The innocence and purity of a bygone era is truly recorded in this short film. The acting is above average and Richard Gere's short appearance as a Raider Marine war hero, who is shocked by the musculature, is very interested in any movie fan or Gere fan. Jan-Micheal Vincent is at his best and looks like the "All-American" boy. The late Bruno Kirby (who was billed as B.Kirby Jr.) has a meaty role as a "pop", a peace-loving Marine Marine refuses and dreams of coming home to his wife. If you're looking for sex, drugs or rock and roll, this movie is not for you. If you're looking for action and adventure, the same applies. However, if you want to recapture a time of innocence, honor, romance, and love in America, Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you.
