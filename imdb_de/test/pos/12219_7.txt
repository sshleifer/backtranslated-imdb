What can I say? I got up this morning and turned Sci-Fi on and watched half of Season One and found out everything. Strange, unusual and brilliant. There is every potential, and at first to think that this looks stupid. This must be the second best thing since X-Files, but as always, in my opinion, this show will never stop. I tell you, it is scary and then exciting and then mature. Towards the end you have Miles as a love pup with a weird pet that is a new species. You have two people fleeing from authorities. And a killer tsunami about to attack! Impressive! And I mentioned that Miles Pet is a potential killer (the rest of his species is). Surface is a brilliant show with twists and turns that offers everything.
