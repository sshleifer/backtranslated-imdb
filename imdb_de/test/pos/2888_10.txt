After 6 months I found this DVD. I can only say it was damn worth the wait! "Rush in Rio" is possibly the best rock DVD out there. I am not joking. It's incredible! The whole fuss about the crappy sound is true, but makes the concert not unsurpassed. I think you feel like in Rio, when you look at the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons why I love this DVD. It gives you the feeling of actually being there. Also Geddy, Alex and Neil have never been in better shape! Geddy's vocals are immaculate, Alex's guitar playing is still incredible and Neil - absolutely no words. The camera work on this concert was very good, I have to say. They gave us a good look at everything that was happening on stage and in the audience. Kudos to the cameramen! Enough of my rage! Take a look at "Rush in Rio". You'll be amazed. I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
