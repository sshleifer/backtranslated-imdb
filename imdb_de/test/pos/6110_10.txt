After seeing Desperate Living, I was thrilled with John Waters films. I've heard of Pink Flamingos and had to watch it, and Boy was worth it! Believe what you hear, it's garbage! It's full of everything dirty, which is actually the main feature of this movie. It includes: incest, cannibalism, rape, chicken shagging, nudity (as you've never seen before - watch out for babies as a birthday party), poo food, arson, trailer waste, perversion, transexuality, egg products, cross-dressing. .. you get the picture. This is a must! Just watch out for the Birthday Party Entertainer and ask yourself how Divine wanders around the park!
