A boy who admires Maurice Richard of the Montreal Canadiens receives to his horror a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater in the mail. I've just seen this in a class where only a handful of students were interested in hockey, but almost everyone knew about Maurice Richard and the rivalry between Toronto and Montreal. Very entertaining, amusing and accurate.
