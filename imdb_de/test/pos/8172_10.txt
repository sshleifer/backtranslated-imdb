I grew up as a Mormon and dealt with the bigotry of the Church towards Blacks (they were not allowed to keep the priesthood of the Church in my membership). I did not know about the organizational policy of excommunication of gay men and women until my departure The Church in 1966 - (I was 20 years old). I was stunned when I learned that gay friends were also excommunicated after mission missions. LATTER DAYS reveals the persecution of gay members by Mormon. The movie is LONG overdue. It is an excellent job to show how the two leading men deal with each other as they manage to grow in size and develop as individuals. LATTER DAYS has a great heart, wonderful original music and an extra class by Jacqueline Bisset. The film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who transcends the boundaries of organized religion and reclaims his soul.
