This American masterpiece was as close to perfection as popular art seems to be, from the wonderfully ambiguous and suggestive title to the great performance that William Wyler elicits from non-professional amputee Harold Russell. <br /> <br /> The film embodied both the dream and the reality of the post-war world. This intimate engagement with the psychological facts of American life gave him an almost universal audience. But in contrast to contemporary and previous "news pictures" it was not a sermon? It showed Americans how they are, presented their problems as they see them, and provided only those solutions, in part, temporarily, personally, as they themselves would accept. The values ​​of the image are the values ​​of the people in it. <br /> <br /> William Wyler, an outstanding director, three-time winner of the best Oscar image, adds a special flavor to melodrama, epic and western ... With his outstanding visual style and his keen sense of solemn material, he gained a reputation as a meticulous, serious artist ... Wylers most clever use of Deep Focus shows the true commitment to emotional content ... <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three men who left the war in a small Central American community The three heroes are: a middle-aged sergeant (Fredric March), great as the devoted family man who succeeds in breaking the ice with his family ; a terrible Air Force Captain (Dana Andrews) returning to an unfaithful wife; and a tormented sailor (Harold Russell) who lost both hands in action and was replaced in real life by hooks ... <br /> <br /> Winners of 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, "The Best Years of Our Life "is eloquent and compassionate, a deeply personal film with touching wordless scenes of homecoming: <br /> <br /> - The sergeant's beloved wife's first words as he unexpectedly returns home:" I look awful! " They storm us like this. "<br /> <br /> - The involuntary sob of the sailor's mother when she first sees the mechanical hands of her son ... She flutters out," It's nothing! "<br /> <br /> Myrna Loyy combined with her dry Martini voice charming maternal woman qualities, Teresa Wright is as nice as the sergeant's cute daughter who falls in love with the pilot Virginia Mayo is hard as the unfaithful, flashy blonde woman whose first love is money and life, and Cathy O'Donnell is wonderful and sensitive as the fiancee of the sailor ... <br /> <br /> The situations and even some characters seem to be a little bit obvious but this is an excellent example of high-quality film production in the forties, with a smile and tears cleverly arranged between the two, and a movie that says what matters in an important topic ...
