"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is an entertaining and very cool action thriller and a breakthrough in career for Geena Davis. The storyline is very familiar to The Bourne Identity, but it does. The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plot is strong enough to keep you busy for the 2 hours. <br /> <br /> She has a skilful sense of style and avoids most clich√©s. Geena Davis is great as an action chick and overcomes her usual "good wife" role. Samuel L. Jackson is as good as the supporting player. However, the villain of the movie is too cheesy and you can tell what's going to happen to him. <br /> <br /> It breaks away from ordinary action-packed actioners like Commando and On Deadly Ground and is definitely one of the best actioners in years. Have fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4 / 10.
