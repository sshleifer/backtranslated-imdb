Johnny Crawford is great in this movie about a troubled teenager who becomes of age in a generation in the midst of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham can portray life well in this sweet, sometimes stupid but sincere way. Not only does he give us a look at the social scene, but he gives good sound advice on morality, decisions, generational differences, teenage dating today (some of the statistics given in this film are amazing statistics today). Seeing Billy alone in his younger years is worth seeing. It's a great movie. I realized that human nature does not change, even if hair, fashion and language can change. People are still struggling with the same problems they have been struggling with for thousands of years.
