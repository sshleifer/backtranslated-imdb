So many literary adaptations are disappointments. There are many reasons for this, but usually a complex novel needs to be reduced to the size of a script. The Dead is unusual - it had to be "padded" because the short story itself is a tiny, relatively short gem. It may actually be the most beautiful short story in English. In a beautiful free language, it tells of the realization of Gabriel Conroy that his life and the lives of so many around him are controlled by the memories of the dead. Even his own wife, who has been living for many years, loved a man more than him. <br /> <br /> Bringing such a short story to the movies has always been difficult. John Huston did a great job. He never gave in to the temptation to try it or use a fancy technique to broaden the story. It is simple and true, with excellent acting. The only small step is the use of music as accompaniment to the devastating graduation soliloquy. <br /> <br /> It is indeed rare that a movie version of a literary masterpiece is a masterpiece itself, but I think it's fair to use that term for this movie. It's not a brave piece of film, but it's simple and pure - I always think of Ozu's films when I think of The Dead, it's purity and simplicity and profound wisdom on this level.
