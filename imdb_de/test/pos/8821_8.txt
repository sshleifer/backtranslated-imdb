This is a "docu-drama" (mostly) of KW's later years, with almost all roles being played by actors (but the spot the TV station plays itself!). It was created for the BBC4 Arts Channel, but I think there will be syndication and DVD releases soon. KW is skillfully played by the outstanding Michael Sheen, who repeats his previous stage role with great success. Most of the cast are also very good, and a nice touch is the replica of TV performances with the new actors. However, this is not an easy consideration - anyone familiar with KW's diaries and general unfortunate behavior already knows how twisted he might be later in life. So do not expect 80 minutes of Carry-On Buffoonery to be in the foreground. Recommended, but it is indeed tragic-funny.
