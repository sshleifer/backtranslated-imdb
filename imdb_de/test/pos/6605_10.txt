Dogtown and Z-Boys <br /> <br /> Summary: Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers exploring the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice (Dogtown), California, as we know them today. has changed. With their low-key style, they embarked on a journey influenced by Larry Bertlemen, which would lead to countless successes and a few failures. After the Dogtown articles were published in a rebuilt skateboarder magazine, the sport was revamped and the members of the Zephyr skateboarding team forgot Jeff Ho. He appeared to be in the summer vacation for the rest of his life, facing other skateboarding Teams joined, who could afford to pay them like movie stars. The original Zephyr skateboard team, assembled by Jeff Ho (owner of Zephyr Surfshop) and Craig Stecyk (photographer), included Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantineau, Jim Muir and Peggy Oki single wife), Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV, Allen Sarlo and David Ray Perry. All original members except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill are still good and surf / skate. At the time of the documentary, Jay Adams turned for drug offenses. Chris Cahill was in Mexico for the last time at the time of the documentary. <br /> <br /> Themes: The topics of this documentary are a kind of reading between the lines, but if there was a clear point of view, it would also be possible for children to trigger revolutions. Other topics include the extensive past party that can lead to an unfulfilled future, and planning and carefully tracking your assets could create a very rewarding future. Other works: Stacy Peralta (writer and director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has either written, produced or directed. Most have a common theme for surfing or skating, such as Riding Giants, Sk8 TV, The Bones Brigades and Lords of Dogtown. He has also grown up with movies about growing up in America as a teenager, films like: Influences: From Yesterday to Today, Crips and Bloods: Made in America and The 70s: The Decade That Has Transformed Television. <br /> <br /> Themes: The themes of Dogtown and Z-Boys are the original members of the Zephyr skateboarding team, with the exception of Chris Cahill. Peralta included Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk in the interviews. Other topics included people who grew up in the 1970s and who read the Dogtown articles, as well as skateboarding enthusiasts. Skaters from the Dogtown area, but not from the team, were interviewed. <br /> <br /> Editing: Editing this movie was phenomenal in my opinion. There were scenes in which the subjects talked so that the audience could see who was speaking and getting a feel for the character, but had immediately cut himself with archive material that would explain what the speaker said. If a song could better explain the subjects' emotions, such as when Jay Adams's unhappy life was a topic of conversation, the song Old Man was played by Neil Young, who evokes many emotions. Sean Penn was the narrator of the film and he explained the transitions throughout the movie. The film was chronologically presented from the time the Zephyr Surf Team was put together, from the skateboarding team to all the Z-Boys who left the team to join other skate companies or start their own business , <br /> <br /> Camera: The movie was shot in interesting ways. The movie of the talking subjects was all in black and white, and all the z-boys archival material surfing or skating was in color. Of course, the material from the 70s was grainy, but that only improved the movie. Most respondents were shot in the same area as they looked, but all were outside. All footage was very well controlled, even the archive material, which I found very surprising. <br /> <br /> Music: "Seasons of Wither" - performed by Aerosmith "Toys in the attic" - performed by Aerosmith "Generation Landslide" - Alice Cooper's "One Way Out" - played by the Allman Brothers' Lollipops and Roses and Whipped Cream - played by Herb Alpert "Into the Void" and "Paranoid" - performed by Black Sabbath "Godzilla" - Blue Oyster cult "Aladdin Sane" and "Rebel Rebel" - David Bowie "Fastcars" - The Buzzcocks "Good Feeling "- Devo" I give you money "- Peter Frampton" Funk 49 "- James Gang" Ezy Rider "and" Foxy Lady "and" Freedom "and" Bold as Love "- Jimi Hendrix" Sidewalk Surfing "- Jan and Dean "Achilles Last Stand" and "Hot on for Nowhere" - Led Zeppelin "Six Underground" - The Sneaker Pimps "Surfrider" - The Lively "Cat Scratch Fever" and "Motor City Madhouse" and "Wang Dang" Sweet Poontang- Ted Nugent "We and Her" - Pink Floyd "Bad Boys" - The Pretenders "Maggie May" - Rod Stewart "I want to be your dog" and "Gimme Danger" - The Stooges "Children of the Revolution" - T-Rex "Bad Reputation" - Thin Lizzy "Disco Inferno" - The Tramps "Hannah" - Rob Trower "Rocky Mountain Way" - Joe Walsh "Old Man" - Neil Young "La Grange" - ZZ Top <br /> <br /> The music in the film makes the film. Each of these songs contributes to what the subjects say and evokes emotions that one would not otherwise have thought of.
