"In the Line of Fire" is one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. This movie really pulls you into your heart, it beats and you're out of breath from the plot. The cast shows strong performances, especially Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. This film is expertly directed by suspense master Wolfgang Petersen. Thrillers do not get much better than that, do not miss it.
