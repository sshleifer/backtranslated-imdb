This episode of Charmed has changed everything! The show ends just before season three and hell breaks loose in this episode. The Charmed bring an Innocent named Dr. Griffiths to the farm, protecting him from Shax, the source murderer. When Shax attacks, he shoots in as a tornado and then corporalizes into his demon skin. He blows up Prue has thrown a wall that totally upsets her and practically kills her. Then Piper shoots what's left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the loft and says the casting magic before Shax came killed the doctor. But because he is the power of the one, that only hurts him. Leo comes to heal the other sisters, and Prue wants to find Shax and destroy him forever. Phoebe is in the underworld looking for Cole. When Prue and Piper take to the streets to find the demon, the demon finds them. After their fight, the witches realize that a camera has captured everything! When they return to Manor and try to fight the media, and after defeating Shax, a witch from the Kookoo shoots Piper. Prue uses her telekinesis to get people out of the way so she can get to the hospital. But they are late and Piper dies. And just as Prue is about to be shot, time is being rewound to where she was. Bring Griffiths to the Manor. Shax blows in and shoots Prue and Piper. But Phoebe is still in the underworld, so Shax kills the doctor and shoots out of the manor. When Leo finally comes, he can not cure Prue. Prue is dead and the power of the three too. For now. Personally. This episode was sad. Prue was the strength of all. I would like to have her power of telekinesis. I really do not think Phoebe should go to the Underworld, otherwise Shax Prue would not have killed. But Paige brings The Power of Three back together and I'm happy with the progress of the show
