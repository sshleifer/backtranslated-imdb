This movie was a piece of heart-stopping cinema that helped show the dark side of childhood and the little things that shaped Tom Hank's character. With a very cryptic story they could give you an idea of ​​what really happened to Tom Hank's character as a child. And although scenes like the aircraft have never happened before, this has shown how denial can see the truth. With a clear conscience, I could not rate that lower than one out of nine out of ten great achievements of all the actors, and though many have not understood the cryptic ending in which the brother is murdered by his stepfather and Tom Hanks covers it if you have a far-fetched story Using a flying machine, pay close attention to the small details, such as the turtle he still has, although his brother has "flown away" with it. Really, a nice piece of cinema, and every actor deserves credit.
