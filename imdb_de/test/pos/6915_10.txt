Inferno gives Los Angeles what it deserves - a baptism of fire, death from above. A superb cast of obsessed characters could survive and sweat out the coronal mass ejection but that would not be fun and certainly not dramatic. A really lame review in Variety criticized the characters for caring for their personal salvation instead of banning them together to save the world. However, refreshing with this great heat is that no one can do anything about it. We are therefore mercifully not exposed to any "heartwarming" scenes of fascist presidents and other heavy extras, as they have implausible plans to rescue a chosen al-stake (al Deep Impact). Here, the sweaty and lusty dirty half-dozen work on their own salvation or face their personal experiences in an old-fashioned way - together as individuals or ... alone with the Alone. All in all, an excellent TV movie. Obviously not denatured by the destructive interference of over-zealous Network Execs. I highly recommend.
