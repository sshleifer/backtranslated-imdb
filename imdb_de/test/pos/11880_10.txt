Critters 4 is a good movie. A small turn to the series, since it takes place in the universe, not in an earthly community. Good effects and acting make this film a must. I would recommend this to horror / science fiction fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this one should enjoy Puppet Master, Skived Alive, Sleep Away Camp, Slumber Party Massacre and other full moon pictures.
