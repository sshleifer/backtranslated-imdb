1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey movie that gained some notoriety. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much broader release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. These two films were mean to the point that they had stalled the prince's film career for several years. <br /> <br /> The theme is Putney Swoope. And it's a great farce / satire that you have to see to be believed. I will not go through the plot here. What kind of land? People looking for a conspiracy scratch their heads. Scratch on !! This movie is not about PLOT! You could compare that to a Mel Brooks movie; Only without the Hollywood parody party that Mel has always thrown. I also see a bit of Monty Python in it. By the way: This movie was shot before Monty debuted on the BBC !!! <br /> <br /> I find that the jokes and lines that are totally funny are NOT well transmitted by word of mouth. You have to see them in the context of the movie. There are some shortcomings in the film. But also the defects are unique. For example: actors repeat the EQUAL LINE over and over again. and somehow it works. How many syllables Mario? Putney says the Borman Six Girl must have soul! etc ... <br /> <br /> The black and white photography is outstanding. The sound / score is even better! The editing is just so-so. The action is above average. The script is priceless. The jokes are as un PC as you can get: MR. Bad News says, "Sonny Williams has just been caught in a motel with a 13-year-old girl," says Putney. "Well, at least he is not superstitious." The anti-establishment mindset of this movie will lead you straight out of the room. Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are many things that relate to today: NO SMOKING !!! Surrounded racism; with African Americans treating Caucasian people like garbage. The manipulation of mass media over the masses; Madison Avenue, Deroit, Hollywood, which intentionally pedals what every 8-year-old can say is garbage. On the internet, I speak of "the drum"; Interracial Dating; I could go on and on .... <br /> <br /> I should also mention that this movie was shot for about 8 minutes in 16mm color. These are the commercials shot by Putney's agency. The spots work pretty well the first time. However, they become tiring on repeated consideration. The real magic here is in the black and white sections of the movie. It's the non-scenic lines that stay with you: "Rent Yourself A CHORT Jewelry". "I love you, I love you, I love you ... did you take your pill?" "Everything I have to say would be superfluous." And many others. I also like the bit with the mounted Minnow on the wall: "The ranger wanted me to throw him back ... I've had such a fight, I've decided that it will be mounted!" <br /> <br /> Buddy Buttler as Putney's Bodyguard # 1 is among the standout performers. He should have been a much bigger star. Antonio Fargas as the Arab. He went on to become famous on television and in movies. Arnold Johnson has the right look as Putney Swoope. Instead, Robert Downey used his own voice because Arnold could not remember some of his lines. Downey also realized that he would later be able to fill in further dialogues / jokes if he had named his main actor. <br /> <br /> The film has some shortcomings. The short term is one. I wish the beginning with the members of the White Board had been extended. Stan Gotlieb and Allen Garfield are outstanding. The end seemed to have been thrown together, as if he just could not think about gags anymore. All in all, this is one of the best low budget independent films of its time. A time when only a few Indys were played in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and the United States of America. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see this at least twice. Downey Putney Swoope is ahead of and behind his time.
