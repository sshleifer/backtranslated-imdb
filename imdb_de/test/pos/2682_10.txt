I can not believe how many excellent actors can be on a show. It's the realism and the good acting that makes it look real. This must be the best comedy ever created. I love Seinfeld and Everyone Loves Ramond. It's just great and it seems everyone in my family agrees. This is not an isolated opinion of me. The whole world seems to be talking about different incidents, and they are trying to replay them. My hat to the crew. Some shows have an actor who does the whole show. This plot comedy has a lot (8) of them. That's what makes it so incredible. Some people pray for health, prosperity or fame. I pray that the show never ends. Sicilian John. LKHUBBLE2@talkamerica.net
