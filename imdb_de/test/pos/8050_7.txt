While I rated the movie with a 7 point rating, I should also point out that it's historically interesting (like Mae Marsh, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore, when they were all younger and lesser known) and that it provides pretty exciting action for their day , <br /> <br /> The plot is strange for a Western, as the trouble with the Indians starts for the strangest cause I've ever seen! The Indians opt for a huge dog bank (no, they do not feed dogs, but feed on dogs), and if two Indians arrive late, there are no more puppies! So they steal two dogs, belonging to two orphans, from the nearby White Settlement, which causes a war !!!! This is not only stupid, but also seems to affect the prejudices of the audience. I do not know if the Indians actually ate a dog, but it sounds like a clich√© that was later applied to other ethnic groups. All about dogs! The movie features some excellent fighting scenes and exciting moments - like when Ms. Marsh crawls across the battlefield to save a baby! Exciting things! But also strange!
