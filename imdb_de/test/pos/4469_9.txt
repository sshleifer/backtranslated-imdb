Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films such as The Beyond and Zombie, years ago was a master of the Italian Giallo (along with Argento and Bava) with duels like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece Do not Torture. This movie contains all the elements of the Italian mystery / thriller genre known as Giallo, but really captivates audiences by having every key figure with a skeleton in its own closet. So you can do as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who kills the boys in the city? The young rich woman, so bored that she sexually mocks the potential victims, the reporter, who likes to go to a crime scene to take a better picture, the citizen with a mentally retarded daughter, the local witch, the town idiot. ..the list goes on, and you have to keep mental notes like a real game to play and solve them. The themes in this film are very brave and were created in the early 70s with this perfect Italian style. It is certain that no American studio would have considered making a movie with such strong content, and for that very reason, this film is so satisfying (despite some unusual accent choices for the dubbing) and will definitely talk about the importance of the films Watch As the saying goes, they do not do it anymore, so get a copy and appreciate an important movie like this one!
