Better than the original, "The Gamers: Dorkness Rising" creates a witty comedy with good acting, fine special effects and a comedy that surpasses the knowledge base of the "gamer" and this on a small budget. I've seen a lot of low-budget movies that were horrible and almost none as good as their high-budget counterparts. This movie blows away most mainstream movies! The parts are a bit weak (the bit with the pirates and ninjas - while funny - goes a bit long without explanation and takes you out of the movie for a bit), but overall this is a very powerful movie. <br /> <br /> I am very happy to say that I bought this movie as soon as I saw it and brought it home. <br /> <br /> Can we look forward to another feature gamer movie from these guys? :)
