Everyone likes the cool, memorable Heist movie. Alain Delon offers the anti-hero, Melville the Cool and a handful of other talents (mostly Yves Montand, Gian Maria Volonte and Andre Bourvil) to add an exciting movie ... <br /> <br /> ... with very little dialogue , This is great, because one particular aspect of the genre tends to be many dialogues involving the minds and their various escorts. However, this movie could be viewed with the sound off and there would not be too much missing. Not to say that the sound is bad, oh no, the jazzy soundtrack and the crisp audio that captures the little movements make the patient's slow, patient consideration very intriguing that the color cinematography is quite fantastic. When it comes to cinematography, black and white films usually tend to stay in my head, but this film has some very strong and beautiful images that make the movie pure visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
