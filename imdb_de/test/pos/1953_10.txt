Apparently this movie is based on a true story. I am not sure how accurate it is. But it really reminded me that it's amazing when I see someone being killed in the news. Sure, I think it's awful, but I honestly do not care. I go on. It seems the murder is trivial now. That shows River's Edge. No one really cares about this girl and her death, not even the murderer. What is the point? <br /> <br /> The killer in this story is John, and for most of the movie he's hiding with another killer named Feck, played by Dennis Hopper. Feck is older and you can see the gap between generations. He says he loved the girl he killed. When he asks John if he loves the girl he killed, he simply answers, "She was okay." The film seems to offer only one solution: life is more important than death. The life of a character is spared, the people have second chances and a hopeless case is killed. <br /> <br /> Acting is really good. After seeing this movie, I could only conclude that Crispin Glover is either a brilliant or a terrible actor. I still have no idea. However, he was my main reason to watch this movie. However, the best performance is clearly given by Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> Even though the fashion is really '80s and the characters sometimes mention the current issues, I still think that River's Edge is as up to date as it has never been before. > <br /> My rating: 10/10
