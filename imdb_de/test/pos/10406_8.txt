NOROI follows documentary filmmaker Masafumi Kobayashi as he slowly discovers something mysterious and evil that leaves a trail of corpses. After Kobayashi has interviewed a woman who claims to hear loud baby cries from the house next door (where there is no baby), she goes to the neighbor. He is greeted with hostility by the confused, disheveled woman (Maria Takagi), who opens the door (and immediately slaps her face) and gets a glimpse of her 6-year-old son through a window. Strangely enough, both the wife and her son disappear a few days after his visit (they leave a pile of dead pigeons on the back porch), and the woman who first complained about the noise as well as her daughter are both mysteriously killed accident not long afterwards. This awakens Kobayashi's interest and he sets out to find out what's going on. Soon he discovers that people with psychic abilities and extrasensory perception are attuned to something sinister, inexplicable and possibly even apocalyptic. Well-known 10-year-old psychic and TV celebrity Kana (Rio Kanno) seems to believe that we are all doomed to fail, but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of great help. Another female actress (Marika Matsumoto) participates, as does Mr. Nori, a mentally unstable Kook / psychic who wears an aluminum foil hat and jacket, and believes that people are eaten by what he calls "ectoplasmic worms." become. Clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village now covered by a lake and the legend of an ancient demon known as the Kagutaba ... <br /> <br /> Unlike many other hand-held horror film Movies, here depends as much on the action as reactionary ego-anxiety. Fortunately, there is something here about an action, a very interesting and complicated one, and it does not always depend on recognizing terrible things through spastic camera work to protect your interest. The way Masafumi was on the lookout for the truth in search of the truth - with well-placed bumps along the way - reminded me a little bit of THE OMEN on the pace. The film is also not entirely made from footage filmed by the documentary filmmaker, but dumps news and TV shows as if it were a completed documentary. This helps break up the monotony normally associated with films shot in this style. The performances are good enough not to interfere with the realism of the "actual" material. All in all, it's a well-made horror movie, with many shifts in plot, some tension and some really spooky moments. It's worth it. My only real criticism is that he could have trimmed a bit here and there and seems a bit too long. Otherwise pretty good stuff.
