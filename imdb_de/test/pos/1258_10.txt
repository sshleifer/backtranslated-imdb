The Kid is a really good family movie about a clogged image consultant, Russ Duritz, who has a lot of money, a good job, a nice house, etc. like him because he's not always very nice. Someday, things will change as an eight-year-old version of itself seems magical. This gives Russ a second chance to get things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role and he delivers a really good performance. The Kid is a beautiful, heartwarming movie for everyone.
