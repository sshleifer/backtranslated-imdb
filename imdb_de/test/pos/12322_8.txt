An exquisite movie. They just do not do it anymore! We overhear a middle-class family in Dublin at the beginning of the 20th century. They are organizing a Christmas party for their friends and relatives. Your table talk is just an idle chatter, but it's written so well that you're engrossed. Away from dinner, fine piano playing helps to create an intimate atmosphere as if you were one of the guests. Maybe a bit too perfect for an amateur player, the strange mistake here and there would have increased the magic of this film. Not a real story, but real entertainment and a lesson for aspiring filmmakers.
