A strange but acceptable mob comedy, with a covert FBI agent (Matthew Modine) flirting with a worried widow (Michelle Pfeffier) ​​to tie two murderers to an elusive mob boss (Dean Stockwell). The film shows that it does not have to be exaggerated just to be funny and director Jonathan Demme ("The Silence of the Lambs", "Philadelphia") prevents the film from appearing to be restrained. That's good and it also avoids being predictable.
