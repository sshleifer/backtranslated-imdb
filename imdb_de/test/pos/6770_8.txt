I'm not sure if I've ever seen a black comedy from Denamark, but that's really good. The humor is correspondingly unobtrusive and dead calm to accompany some of the cruel activities. Svend and Bjarne are tired of working for their boss because he always puts them down (in fact, he mentions that they were not smart enough to open them before they pee in one place). They do what they need to start their own butchery, and when a worker accidentally locks himself in the cold room overnight while fixing a light, they come across something that makes his butchery far more popular than that of his old boss. In fact, he's the one to whom they sold their first "fillets" and it's partly his fault as he served them at a Rotary dinner in his house and the guests loved it and the next day at Svend and Bjarnes appeared. Bjarne is a bit appalled by what Svend did, but it does not stop. Svend has outgrown his sad little existence to be a popular acquaintance new to him, and he does not want to let that go, and the freezer continues to fill up with all sorts of acquaintances (and at one point "a little Swede the park "). However, it comes to suspicion because ex-boss Holger is of the opinion that something is wrong. Bjarne is also persecuted by his twin brother Eigil, who lived in a coma for years in a sanatorium and wanted the Bjarne to pull the plug so he could get inheritance money to open the store. When Eigil was taken off the respirator, he was revived, much to Bjarne's horror. And Bjarne is also interested in Astrid, who works in the cemetery. Neither Svend nor Bjarne are well adjusted individuals and things get out of control. The loud humor really does that, and while this is not a loud laugh, it's certainly amusing. It's a bit scary to look at the pieces of meat and body parts lying casually, especially since these two are all so natural. If you are a fan of black comedy, this is recommended, I liked it very much myself. 8 out of 10.
