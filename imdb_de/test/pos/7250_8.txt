Plunkett and Macleane is a fun, fast and refreshing movie. Refreshing because, unlike most other epoch films, it's not about giving the audience a history lesson or preaching pompously - in fact, historical accuracy is almost ignored. This film does not take itself too seriously and tries to entertain rather than enlighten. Plunkett and Macleane play in the 18th century, but director Jake Scott offers a full 90s version. There is action, sex and cursing in abundance, and in the inevitable ball scene the aristocracy dances to disco beats. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are as brilliant as ever, and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming as a flirting fop, is also very entertaining. The film is visually spectacular and is a mix of comedy, action and drama. Liv Tyler has a love interest with a shaky English accent. In short, if you're looking for a few fun hours, this is the movie for you. It will not make you think, but it could put a smile on your face.
