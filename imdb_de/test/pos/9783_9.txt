This movie was great and I waited a long time for it. When it finally came out I was really happy and looking forward to a 10 out of 10. It was great and matched my potential. The performances were great among the adults and most children. The only bad performance was from Milo personally. There was a problem I encountered with this movie (and other similar movie). All the characters I wanted to live were killed. Overall, I give this movie an excellent 9 out of 10 points. Maybe we should pick better people to kill next time, ok?
