One year after her triumphant first special, "My Name Is Barbra", Barbra Streisand re-formed with her production team to produce this episode CBS-TV special in revolutionary color at that time. "Color Me Barbra" was first aired in March 1966 and has a similar format to its predecessor - three segments, the first two with unique concepts. The first event takes place in the Philadelphia Museum of Art's after-hours halls, where she wanders through the galleries dressed as a maid and becomes part of the artwork through a song. In various forms Streisand expresses different moods, from the comedy "Minute Waltz" on the melodrama of "Non C'est Rien" in a Modigliani painting to the beatnik style of "Gotta Move", which relies on abstract art , My favorite moment in this special is when it turns into a dead ringtone by Queen Nefertiti singing a haunting interpretation of Roger and Hart's Where or When. Sequits, this time in French, is the second segment back in the studio for a colorful circus mix in which she interacts with animals, including her beloved poodle Sadie. She finds a suitable context for "Sam, you make the pants too long" with a flock of penguins and funny compares their profile with an anteater with "We have so much in common". As with the first special, the program ends with a captivating solo concert in which she sings some chestnuts: "Everywhere I hang my cap", "Where do I go?" and "Starting Here, Starting Now" among them. Also included is the short introduction she made in 1986 in ironically-clad all-white film when the special was first released on the VHS. The juxtaposition of Locale and Song is even more effective than their first special, and a 23-year-old Streisand is in top form.
