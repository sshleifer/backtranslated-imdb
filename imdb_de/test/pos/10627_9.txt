I absolutely disagree with the comments of one of the critics who beat the movie. After reading the book and being impressed with it, although this is some kind of literature you can not really like (similar to Hubert Selby's), I expected you to be shocked, but the effect was more subtle. Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress who conveys a complex character. There are many scenes that are fully focused on them and their subtle changes, and I can imagine a few actresses who would do so well if they ignore their own reputation or image. There is this coldness, distance, cruelty and at the same time helplessness, pain and pain. There is one person who is controlled and controlled at the same time. Maybe that's not realistic - even though you read the newspaper much worse than here - but there is a truth that is very hard to bear. I think it's an excellent movie, but I did not like it. It is not boring, but sometimes I wish it would end. By the way, her male counterpart is also very well played (and I think she is well chosen as well).
