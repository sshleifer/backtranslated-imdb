Mama has to be one of the most uncomfortable movies that you can always watch. It shows an elderly lady that you would like to have as your nanny who becomes the nastiest mother a monster would like to hit in a dark night! <br /> <br /> This dinner eats the nanny of a young lady at the opening of the movie and it is getting sicker as it continues. A cross between the howling and the brain dead sounds to me when she describes Mom: <br /> <br /> A must for horror fans who have the guts for it (if you have a re-animator or a brain dead see this will be the case.) Float your boat) and be ready to turn off the brain for an hour or so ... Let the blood flow! ... 8/10
