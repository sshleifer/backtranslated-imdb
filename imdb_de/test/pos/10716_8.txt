The Oscar-winning Kramer Vs. Kramer follows the crafty businessman Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce with his bored wife (Meryl Streep). One day Ted's wife leaves him and his child in search of a better life and forces Ted to come closer to his son (Justin Henry). The pair connect and become very tight (but only after a bit of friction), and just as everything goes perfectly, Ted's wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of her son. Then Ted goes on a mission not to take his son away from him, and fights in court with his wife. Dustin Hoffman does a great job with Meryl Streep, and young Justin Henry is impressive. It's a sad emotional roller coaster ride of a movie, but it's a very well done and inspiring movie. The film received the Academy Award for best picture at the 1979 Oscars, along with best actor for Hoffman and best supporting actress for Streep. If you do not mind having a tearjerker, 'Kramer Vs. Kramer 'a great movie you can watch. Note: B +
