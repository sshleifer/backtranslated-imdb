The noteworthy thing that is left out in the other reviews I have read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the life and behavior of gays in the epoch depicted in the film. While Courtenay's character is apparently gay, he is not the only one: The one often discussed by Mr. Davenport-Scott is the other, and the reason he's never been seen seems to be the reason he's disappeared from the police for homosexuality Activities imprisoned - a crime in England at the time. <br /> <br /> We can read below the surface that this recent event has unsettled Norman, Courtenay's character. Passing Oxenby, the Edward Fox character, the quick renunciation of a connection to such a person, if that Law is Affected: The fear of associations affects many of the characters and is part of the portrait portraying the film colors of a time and movie people who inhabit it. The termination of Courtenay at the end by Sir was consistently anticipated, with this subtext included. It is also both for the otherwise inexplicable omission of his dressers from the list of those whom he thanked. The flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure leads to the combination of longing and fear that Courtenay must "step into the spotlight" as he does when announcing the upcoming air strikes, a scene that would otherwise be useless is both a symbolic as well as literal representation of the inner torment of the man. <br /> <br /> So while the drama is about the demise of Finney's sir, much of the tragedy of the movie and the game comes from the "fatal flaw" of Courtenay gay, and turns it into a movie about him, like the title suggests. <br /> <br /> The artistic direction, the tempo and the cinematic style of this film seem to date back to a different time than the 1980s, and in some ways even World War II. The implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order, and the sympathy of the figure, battered and destroyed by the atrocities of this order, necessarily trapped in the closed world of the theater; and the knowledge we have about how much of it would be carried away after the war makes this movie all the worse, despite all its shortcomings.
