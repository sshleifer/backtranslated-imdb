I loved this movie. To be quite fair, the movie starts very slowly, and none of the characters is terribly sympathetic. This will continue for a good half of the movie. <br /> <br /> But if you are patient, you will be very rewarded. What the first half of the film lacks in character development and / or sympathy will be sufficiently compensated in the second half. It's a bit of a roller coaster ride - a slow, uphill climb and then speed, turns and a few surprises. She is the best actress of our time. William Hurt is good, albeit a bit wooden. Renee Zellweger does a very good job and shows that her performance in Jerry McGuire was no coincidence.
