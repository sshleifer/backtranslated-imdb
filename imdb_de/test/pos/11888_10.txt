Some martial arts purists believe the comedy was the worst thing that happened to the old kung fu kick. and it is true that the introduction of comedy into the genre signaled the end of the "chop-socky" period in Hong Kong film. However, the fact is that you can only perform a mainly physical performance exhibition for so long, then everyone gets bored. And that's why the Chop-socky died and the action movie "New Wave" in Hong Kong was born: the producers, the actors, the directors get bored because they hit people for ninety minutes in a row. <br /> <br Given this and given that Liu Chia Liang is a professional film director, with a sizeable list of films on his CV, this film must be understood as something other than just another kung fu comedy. It is more of a comic film within the martial arts genre, and indeed one of the best ever made. What Liu has done with this film is really a pleasant surprise: He has made a martial art plot and reconstructed it after the model of a Hollywood musical! Complete with singing and dancing! At the time of this film's emergence, some filmmakers and film fans realized that the martial arts cinematic performance (which really derives from the acrobatics of Chinese opera) has more to do with the dance than the fight. (I'll continue to point out this relationship until most Americans realize what they should be looking for when they watch a martial arts movie - using well-choreographed body movements and the action movie action as an excuse for their performance.) At any rate, very clearly, Liu Chia Liang made this connection and decided that he would explore her near her borders. The result is an incredibly charming conversation, filled with wonderfully human characters, the wondrous kung-fu (and.) Trying to stumble over their own shoelaces, if they do not) The movie, which dates back to the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries plays, gives Liu the opportunity to explore the nature of westernization and modernization of China, which have contributed so much to the emergence of today's China. Therefore, the film also has a considerable historical impact. <br /> <br /> Also fans of Stephen Chow's recent Kung Fu Hustle should really watch this movie, as Chow clearly learned before creating his own movie. <br /> A very amusing, well made movie. Oh yes, and the kung fu is really good. Purists do not admit it, but that's probably the best movie by director Liu.
