Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The film is less concerned with the rude science of Darwin's beliefs and focuses heavily on his relationship with his family, especially his wife Emma and daughter Annie. <br /> <br /> Toby Jones makes a wonderful turn as Thomas Huxley, the great defender of Darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the cast has the task of sharing screen time with Bettany and Connelly. <br /> <br /> But it's the two who wear the film. Their true chemistry is evident from beginning to end, but develops transcendence as Darwin grapples with his demons. The scene in which Darwin tells the end of the story of Jenny, the orangutan, with his dying daughter Annie is most poignant. The world premiere of the TIFF was fascinating. Bettany's performance will be among the best of the year in a short time. Just as great is Connelly's work, in which he plays the religious wife of a man who, in Huxley's words, has "killed God." <br /> <br /> The film moves slowly through the full spectrum of Darwin's grief, enjoying every detail of Bettany and Connelly's acting. <br /> <br /> Brilliant.
