The inspiration for the "Naked Gun" films throws Leslie Nielsen - who only recently started the comedy * - as the incompetent, but heroic Frank Drebin, who always had to solve an absurd case. Like "Aircraft" and in the films based on the series, the humor is based on Mel Brooks-type stain dumplings and stupid comments (namely, that's "yes"), along with the fact that Nielsen, despite the nonsense around him remains very serious. And of course the last picture in which something moves. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the series had only six episodes. At least that's where the movies came from. With Leslie Nielsen you can not go wrong in such roles. I suspect that it was fun to film it. Really funny. <br /> <br /> * Before "Airplane!" Leslie Nielsen had starred in such films as "Forbidden Planet", "Harlow" and "The Poseidon Adventure". As late as 1987, he appeared in "Nuts" alongside Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss. But since the first "Naked Gun" movie it's always funny.
