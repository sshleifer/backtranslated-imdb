Man, I'm excited, I can give feedback for this 10-minute game. I love it. <br /> <br /> After not seeing it for years, I came across it the other day and watched it again and again. <br /> <br /> 'Stop shaking your eyes' and 'shake a rock'n'roll band' and 'stop saws the table' are fancy classic lines. <br /> <br /> The art is wonderfully raw. The dialogue is sparse and wonderful. Find it easy and love it. I can not recommend that enough. <br /> <br /> Thank you for showing art teacher Mrs. Kogan in high school for us. Thanks, NFB, for letting me do it. Thank you for showing MTS (at least for now). <br /> <br /> I want a Big Snit T-shirt now. I would love an animation cell, but at 440.00 a pop, that will not happen. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and look at it.
