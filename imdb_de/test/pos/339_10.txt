This movie was amazing how good he was! The plot is extraordinary and the spectacle spectacular. At first I thought that would not be so great because of a summary, but after about five or ten minutes of the movie, I realized that I was completely wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this movie, and yet I still have to see the same scenes about thirty times in a week! No, the song scenes were not as great as they could have been, but the plot is what really excites you. American or Asain, I would recommend it to anyone - and I have it now. I guarantee you that, once you have seen them, you will get the most out of them and their actions. I hope you feel the same way and also write an enthusiastic review!
