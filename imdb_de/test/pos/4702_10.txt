Oh so beautiful, oh so whiny and so torn. <br /> <br /> Everything seems so superficial, so pale, so meaningless in comparison. Sister Helen is not a real saint. <br /> <br /> She is a real human defect, raw and dull, but passionate and with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> What I find most interesting is this handful of miserable, miserable people People found meaning and laughter. <br /> <br /> What I love most about the documentary is the polarity of human nature.
