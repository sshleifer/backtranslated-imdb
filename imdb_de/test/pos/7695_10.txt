I was @ 13 years old when I saw this heavily undervalued film at the ADAMS Theater in Newark (New Jersey, NJ). I bought the program and later bought the soundtrack ... still have both ... I'm 55 years old now. and have not seen it since (maybe once on Network TV in the 1960s ???) One of the biggest casts ever assembled, great cast and production, please let another generation see this great movie ... It was my introduction to the opera, and supported with my understanding of tolerance .. Please family of Gerswhins or Premingers, release this classic soon !!
