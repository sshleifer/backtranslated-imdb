All comments on this movie are negative so far, but I have to say that I found "The Net". Only a few films can keep me on the edge of the seat, but this one has done it. Another plus is that most action / suspense movies are full of language, but this movie had little profanity. I found it a pleasant movie to watch. I'm a bit biased, a big Sandra Bullock fanatic. *to wink*
