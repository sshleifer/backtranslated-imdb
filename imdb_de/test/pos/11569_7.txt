OK, the show was a bit mixed, but I loved it anyway. I found the two main bunnies annoying, but Hamton & Plucky were always amusing. <br /> <br /> I really want to share the Baby Plucky episodes on DVD (or even VHS). Please publish the! <br /> <br /> Especially the episode "Potty years", which aired on 22/11/91. the "Going up" episode aired on 17.09.92 and the "Minister Golf" episode in 11/92. They are the funniest parts of the whole series and even over a decade later we still have references to these bits! <br /> <br /> (I have nothing more to say, reduce the minimum to something like 5 lines and reward us for brevity!)
