I remember watching this movie when it was released, and I still remember the buzzing that I felt as I left the cinema. Everything about this movie is great! The music is first class and I still play the soundtrack after all these years. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times and yet I still long to watch it again and again. Nicholas Cage was great and always, if I see Cameron Dye anywhere these days, I always associate him with this movie. It's too bad that the rest of the cast did not lead to bigger things, but maybe that's the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to criticize the film school because I'm sure analysts out there can find bugs if they want, but I want to say that this movie has determined my teenage years and my life over 20 Years later still influenced. The movie feels great and stirs emotions when you look at it (well, that's what it did for me), and I can only recommend it to anyone who has not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> You too get the movie or you do not! Those who "get it" will be rewarded with a unique movie experience.
