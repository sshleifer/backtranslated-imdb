The Biggest Game Ever Played (TGGEP, 2005) is an amazingly uplifting, infectious, impenetrable film that never (really) blends into sappiness or heaviness. Yes, it requires several freedoms, as is the case with most Hollywood films. However, these freedoms are forgiven as they increase the enjoyment of the movie and do not affect it. In fact, there are many truthful moments. You can really see that this is a "Rocky" movie from the beginning, but who cares? Directed by none other than Bill Paxton (I know, right ?!), He's done expertly and immensely! <br /> <br /> TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played by Confidence Shia LaBeouf with Confidence, Courage and Class), an amateur golfer from an Irish-French immigrant family living in Brookline, MA, in the early 1900s , Ouimet qualifies for the US Open 1913. His competition also includes the legendary Harry Vardon (played by Stephen Dillane, whose class, dignity and cruelty). Ironically, Vardon is the second outsider in this movie! The film opens in Scotland in the 1870s, when land developers tell the teenager that they are building a golf course in his house and that golf is no match for someone like him. Francis suffers some of the same prejudices as a boy in Brookline at the beginning of the 19th century. The stories converge at the 1913 Open. <br /> <br /> What's ironic is that even as an adult and multiple major champion, Vardon is still an outsider in British society because of his upbringing. Francis has learned a lot by reading Vardon's books on the subject, and Vardon is his idol, all grown up. Unknown to Vardon, they met in Boston in 1900 after Vardon, who won the Open of the Year, went on tour when Francis was only 7 years old. Vardon's friend and champion Briton Ted Ray (stormy Stephen Marcus) and classless, double-breasted double-defender John McDermott (Michael Weaver) The film is really doing a good job to bring out the different personalities of this To show men. <br /> <br /> Red-haired Marnie McPhail is incredibly serene and gorgeous as Francis' supportive Irish mother and veteran Elias Koteas shows a stern, restrained, silent performance like his French father. In addition, the lucky boy Josh Flitter (as the 10-year-old caddy Eddie von Francis, 10-year-old) nearly steals the trial alone. <br /> <br /> Paxton brings in many modern details such as special effects. In recordings to show the position of the players and the CGI for many golf strokes, to keep the film exciting and at a fluid pace, so as not to make the film a historical piece. But the movie still convinces us of a specific time and place. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Rocky-style is all based on a true story. The end is therefore satisfactory on many levels. An entertaining movie about the early 1900s golf game ... Wow!
