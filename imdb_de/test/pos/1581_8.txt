I know that "Jokes of a Beauty" and "Bliss of a Virgin" are crap films and are hated by many, but I'll sit here under the bus and say that I like them, especially "Jokes of a Beauty" (aka Entrails a beautiful woman)). I saw it with some people on the pad the other day and I was surprised how well it went by. Runaways are the kind of madcap-billo-horror-softcore sleaze epic that you really do not find much outside of Asia (especially Japan here). It's basically a rape / revenge movie with a reborn monster instead of stupid shotgun murders or a motorboat driven noose or even a crazy father with a chainsaw ... The stuff is just stupid. Would not you rather see a hermaphroditic monster with a witty little snake monster for a dwarf? <br /> <br /> PERVERSION FACTOR: This movie is full of graphic, sometimes crazy rape sequences, fake pop shots and satisfying masturbation monster sex sequences that you like, if you like corman nuggets like Humanoids From The Deep. I do not know, maybe it's a stretch, but I personally do not think Entrails of a Beautiful Woman has let me down as an avid fan of Asian sleaze and bizarre b-pics. <br /> <br /> Yes, sometimes I know something about it My recommendations are not always cuppa tea for everyone (even for those who like the same garbage as me), but I stand behind it. 8.10.
