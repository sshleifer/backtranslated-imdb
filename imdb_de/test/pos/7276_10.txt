If you like subtle psychological dramas / thrillers, this is a movie for you. Those who want to see a common erotic thriller will certainly not understand this movie, as Colin Firth obviously did when he called it garbage. But Jennifer Rubin is the true star of the movie anyway. She is such a brilliant and beautiful actress! Along with the confusing and twisting storyline, this becomes more and more psychological and leaves you thinking of yourself, the wonderful direction, the photography and above all the music make this film a masterpiece. Even the small parts are very good, especially Belinda Waymouth is great in her little scene. I hope it will be released soon on DVD and a soundtrack album would be a dream come true !!
