I absolutely enjoyed every minute of this movie. Jack Black and Kyle Gass definitely brought the thunder in this epic story of friendship, hard rocking and destiny. This movie is a must for die-hard D-fans in the world. <br /> <br /> We follow the journey of young Jables (Jack Black) and Kage (Kyle Gass) while they are trying to make the choice to win the Open Mic Night and the biggest band in the world to become. The duo must overcome obstacles like a room full of lasers, a man with a leg and the devil to fulfill their task. I'll let you see if they can do it or not. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack itself is great enough, and now we see the D in person, which makes the experience even more magical. A must for anyone who calls himself a stubborn D-fan. Watch out for the insider jokes from the first album!
