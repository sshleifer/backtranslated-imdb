I can barely remember what DECADE I saw this movie. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I saw it as a late-night movie sometime in the mid-1980s, and so much has stayed with me since then. When I saw other comments, I had NO idea that it was shown in theaters or that anyone else was new than new. I do not think I mentioned the movie to anyone else. <br /> <br /> But half a life later, I remember the movie I saw a long time ago a long time ago. I think that the innocence of the characters, their situation and their mutual affection for a long time have a long-term influence for reasons that I do not quite understand. Maybe it's because at the time I saw it, I was a teenager, and it somehow touched me ... I really do not know! I really wanted to know what happens when the end of the movie happens. Oh, the agony !! <br /> <br /> I have not seen it before or since, but I would love it. I keep a casual eye on it, but now I doubt it's being shown and it seems it has been forgotten. But I miss it in the TV guide, even if it came up. Pssttt !!! <br /> <br /> Reading the reviews here has renewed my interest. If anyone knows of its availability in Australia, please email me and let me know. Oh, and Sean Bury ... nice that you saw the comments here. I watched your movie story and saw your last appearance in a James Bond movie. What are you doing today? Oh, and do YOU ​​have a copy of the movie? CHEERS!!!
