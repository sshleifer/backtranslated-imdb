I loved the movie, not only because of its plot, but also because it was magnificently portrayed by the great cast. I read that Drew Barrymore as Josie Geller was not exceptional because she is beautiful. Yeah, she might, but in the movie she played outside of herself, making a simple girl look for who she is in the world. The story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics out there. David Arquette is crazy like her brother Rob, and Michael Vartan is beautiful as Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did an excellent job as her buddy Aldys, someone who was not afraid to be herself. I think this film should get more credit than being branded as a "Teeny Boppy" lettering
