Unlike the many who posted here, I'm not familiar with movies. I accidentally stumbled upon this movie (Channel Surfing) and could not surf anymore. This is a truly incredible movie that deserves all the praise that the critics and those who have accumulated on this site. The actors are great. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her fiance Boris is cute and patriotic. They can not help but feel that Boris Vater's anger and grief are so great that he denounces his son for such stupidities as volunteering for the Great War. Others have summarized the movie so well, so I'll just mention a few scenes that moved me the most. When Boris' brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and "has to marry" Tatiana, Tatiana's distorted mouth shows her disgust for this betrayal (though her role in the unfaithfulness may have been caused by rape). They fear the rest of the film could correct this wrong by visiting only the destruction of Tatiana and the brother, or, worse, destroying Tatiana by an immoral descent into the decadence of cigarette smoking. Since this is not a "French existential cinema", the latter does not happen. Thank God! <br /> <br /> Another scene that tore into your heart is when the unknown "musician" soldier rescued by Boris returns to tell Boris' father about his son's death. Unknowingly he brings the news to Tatiana. I can not describe the suffering of this scene ... Nevertheless, Tatiana finds a straw and hopes Boris will come home. The musician has never actually seen Boris buried. <br/> <br /> I will not mention any more scenes, but I would like to say that the influence of Soviet political correctness did not affect the film at all. Boris's brother reveals himself as the anti-Soviet slacker playing piano that someone who steals his brother's future wife would have to be. No doubt he gets at the end of the movie at least a "tens"! The end, when Tatiana finally finds out for certain that Boris is dead, still manages to end up with a happy and hopeful future. They do not even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater, as survivors of this war with their own losses have seen the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable. Look at it.
