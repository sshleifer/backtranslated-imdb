Ghillie, a remake of Telugu "okkadu", is fortunately a clearer version of the original. It's the same punch and Dharani is true to his cinematic brilliance and delivers style and momentum. An impressive career of Vijay with the entry of Surya and other Vikram in the battle, got the necessary boost with this movie, which could turn out to be the best movie Vijay was ever shot on, considering what decisions he has made since then Has. The hard-working actor seems to have lost his bearings With talented newcomers who are both accepted by industry and the public alike. <br /> <br /> The tight-fitting script that is on-screen revolves around Velu, a strong-willed young man who wants to make a name for himself the game of Kabaddi (a popular game among boys in India): the events after the chance encounter with Muthupandi, his rescue of the distressed girl and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own make up the linchpin of film: Vijay thus fits a "T" into the character and the essays, a muted one and credible portrayal of the boy next door. <br /> <br /> Trisha has more than one stereotypical Tamil heroine coat to play. The role is much more complex than just a girl in trouble. With limited dialogues, Trisha occasionally uses subdued expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. This is a classic case of a front page girl who wants to become a professional actress. Trisha became my personal favorite after this movie. <br /> <br /> The film ends in predictable lines, although the director must be acknowledged that the audience has come across many things, including Trisha's decision to leave the country. Prakash Raj deserves praise for being the perfect counterweight to Vijay's role. His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the obvious cracks in the hero's armor make a perfect trick to guess the audience. All in all, this is a great movie that deserves at least a single sight. I give a clear 8 out of 10 points.
