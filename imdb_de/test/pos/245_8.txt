Rita Hayworth is exactly where she should be - as "Cover Girl" in this 1944 Technicolor film starring Gene Kelly, Phil Silvers, Eve Arden, Lee Bowman, and Otto Kruger. Rita plays a beautiful showgirl, Rusty, and works in a small club of the man she loves, Danny (Kelly). Every Friday they go to oysters with Genius (Silvers), the club's comedian. They all hate oysters, but they are looking for a pearl. If they find one, all three will have good luck, they believe. <br /> <br /> Rusty audition and win the role of covergirl for a magazine - she starts in front of the other participants, because she is the owner of the magazine (Kruger) sees a similarity between Rusty and the girl he once loved and that turns out to be Rusty's grandmother. Once she becomes the title girl, the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on Broadway come true. Danny wants her to succeed, but at the same time realizes he has lost her. <br /> <br /> "Cover Girl" has exhilarating dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern, with Rita being dubbed by Martha Mears. Rita plays in her best form both Rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past. For such a sexy, desirable, beautiful woman she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men. None of this was ever on screen, nor was it the fact that she did not want to be a movie star. She is one of the true goddesses and has brought everything she did to life. Gene Kelly plays a serious role here, but has many opportunities to dance and sing. Phil Silvers is very friendly and funny as an in-house comic and best friend. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie with no boring spots. The only problem I had is the idea that Rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves. When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg, who plays herself in the movie, speaks of marriage, she is warned by her boss not to do so that she is too necessary for the modeling business. We're not told if Rusty will continue her career or work at Danny's - but all signs point to the Brooklyn Club. Why could not she have had both? Still, you can not win "Cover Girl" for top entertainment, beautiful colors, lovely music, great energy, good performances and its fabulous capital, the glorious Rita Hayworth.
