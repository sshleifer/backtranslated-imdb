I have read most of the comments here, as all have seen only the flaws of the movie. I agree, the director is not Kuprik, the actors are not Oscar winners, but it has something that everyone can identify with. I do not want to spoil, but tell more than the plot. The end of the school and the trip to a big party, or if you want to look beyond the metaphor, is the way through life. Do you remember the days of youth? the days when you or our friend behaved like the characters? Or do you think you should act like one of them and now you regret that you did not? If you can return at this time and if you can ask yourself one of those questions, maybe the movie was not that bad.
