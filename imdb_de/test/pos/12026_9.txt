This was really one of the nicest specials I saw on TV. He is just an incredible performer. His personality shines through in each of the songs he makes. I really wish it was available as an uncut DVD, so I could watch it over and over again without the -beep- for explicit language. I did not have a chance to see him live, but that's something I really want to do now. I can not forget his backup singers. They have really added a lot of substance and humor to the show. With their Campy style and their flamboyant dance moves, they really complement Dan's true talent. I wish there were more songs on his live CD, which is unbelievable. It's refreshing to see someone like him. So incredibly personal and real, I really can not say enough good things about Dan and this show. Again I just wish it was available as an uncut DVD.
