This is apparently the first film to feature Gloria Swanson - the movie that made her a breakout star. While she was good at the movie, I can not see how that particular performance was so remarkable back then - but it was still a very good movie. Gloria plays the wife of a rich slob who takes her for granted. He cares little about his care, eats onions and forgets the anniversary! At the same time, a Lothario comes into her life and begins to make Gloria very attentive, and her weak husband does not even notice or give her a reason not to cheat on him. Finally, she divorces her husband and marries the well-spoken Romeo. Although the film could only have been an exaggerated melodrama (they were quite common at the time), it requires some interesting twists and turns and is a resourceful and funny movie. Although not the best silent movie I've ever seen, it's an outstanding movie and deserves to be remembered. <br /> <br /> The DVD release by Image Entertainment is surprisingly good - with a decent print and music. This was not always the case with other image releases (especially how impractical they were with the Chaplin releases).
