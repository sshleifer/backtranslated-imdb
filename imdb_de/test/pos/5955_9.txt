So I would summarize it! Others said: Naked Gun meets James Bond. I think mine is more accurate, but I'm not neutral on that point ...; o) <br /> <br /> This movie is a kind of explosion from the past. It's reminiscent of the old movies (from the 50's & 60's), and that's not just because it's playing on this screen (1955, with the flashback exception)! The main actor here (who is very popular in his native France) is perfect in his role. He's the number 117 spy. There's a character who puts him in the movie by asking a question whether he's good or not ... You'll see if you watch the movie! <br /> <br /> Very funny indeed, and if you like your spies, mixed with comedy with old-fashioned flair, but do not take yourself or anything else seriously, then you need to watch this. :O)
