I saw this movie on 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. <br /> <br /> The Beaglees are just a few short flashbacks. The story is about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when he was held in Kent with his growing family. 200+ pages of Origin had already been designed and he wondered if he should complete the book. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Randal Keynes' book Annie's Box (Annie, Charles's daughter, who died when she was 10 years old). It is mostly a family drama, but also includes sex scenes - but the participants are married, both on and off screen. Not too exciting, not much science, but a well-made film that is pleasant to look at and pushes the right emotional buttons. A bit like a romantic wine. My guess is that the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic, free-thinking scientist from an atheistic family background and still be an emotional romantic and a great father. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters and Darwin himself say or wonder if he has killed "God," but the viewer may doubt it. What is beyond doubt in the face of the deadly struggle for survival and the rotting net on the Meadow Bank (known and unquestioned before Darwin) and the failure of Darwin's prayers is the notion of a benevolent, provident God, his "creatures are unsustainable. <br /> <br /> I really can not see many Americans who strongly oppose it, some have issues with the title, which is probably the most controversial theme of the movie, or the fact that Bettany has no horns, no tail and no pitchfork ,
