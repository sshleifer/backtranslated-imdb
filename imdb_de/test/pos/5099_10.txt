Peter O'Toole is Arthur Chipping, a Latin American teacher with strict attention to detail and thoroughness to help young spirits understand the meaning and definition of Latin words and phrases. He is considered cold and unfair and is not in touch with time. But after meeting with stage actress singer Katherine Briskit (Petula Clark) not only at a late dinner after a London performance is London, but in an amphitheater in Greece, his closed world begins to open. <br /> <br /> Goodbye Mr Chips is an MGM musical remake of the 1939 film, also by MGM. During that time, musicals were on the go, and the Hollywood studio system was completely confused. At the premiere in New York, Los Angeles and London, the musical numbers had remained intact, but when it came to the local Main Street theaters around the world, it was Sans songs that made the movie shorter and rife , <br /> <br /> Thanks to MGM / UA Home Video under Ted Turner in the late 1980s in the early 1990s, when VHS and Laser Disc were the main home video formats of choice. The musical numbers were restored and the gaps closed. However, Laserdisc was the only format in which Goodbye Mr. Chips was displayed in widescreen letterbox format. <br /> <br /> For some time now, the original motion-picture soundtrack was only available on the original vinyl and cassette. It can still be found on Ebay today. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the wonderful people of Film Score Monthly.com in 2006, the soundtrack was digitally remastered and remixed into a 3-CD set with the fully reconstructed original 1969 score. Album score, and told sequences, source music and interviews. They also get an unused song, a real lost gemstone, "Tomorrow with Me" by Petula Clark, who would have been selected before "you and me" before hand. <br /> <br /> This movie is both a classic musical and a real tribute to educators everywhere. I would certainly buy this movie, if Warner Bros. MGM and Sony would use their money where the mouth is, and restore this movie from all the master movie sources and put on DVD and Blu Ray with all the bells and whistles Place with all the extras you can find and put into a publication.
