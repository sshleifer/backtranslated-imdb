Some of the reviewers have foolishly judged this silent film on the basis of today's political correctness. <br /> <br /> "Battle" has been a great movie for many reasons that rational reviewers have rightly noted: great cast, a lot of action, cutting-edge editing and photography. <br /> <br /> His stars were indeed the D.W. Griffith Stock Company and for this silent movie fan, that's incentive enough to see and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago and just watched it again on YouTube. That was a very bad print quality, but along with my memory of a good print in a real theater, I can recommend the legitimate people to sensible people and film historians.
