I really enjoyed this movie! Few parts were slow, but it just set the mood and built up the action. I found this film very educational, teaching me more about my Croatian heritage. I also learned more about Louise Arbor, and I can say that she has a huge impact on me. Time Magazine named Louise Arbor one of the 100 most influential people in the world in April 2004. I recommend this movie to people who (obviously) like historical films. This film was very dramatic, but still told the truth about the events in former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbor is a brave heroine and I am glad that she made a movie in honor. If you see the movie, I hope you like it.
