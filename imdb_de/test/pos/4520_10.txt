Recently I was fortunate enough to see "The Kite Runner" in a small theater surrounded by seasoned moviegoers who appreciated a masterpiece of such sophistication. With all the controversy surrounding the central scene of this film these days, I expected a piece of rough and violent. But the way Mr. Forster handled the sensitive topic was touching and really deeply moving. Although the screenplays in the film listed China as the main location for the shoot, I could have sworn that I saw Kabul in the scenes that are set to take place in Afghanistan. The acting, both amateur and professional, is excellent and the casting is great. This is a movie that I would see again and again, for though it is indisputably sad in its theme, the masterly manner in which it was made awakens a whole new hope in modern cinema.
