COMMITTED TO A NUTSHELL: Dave Seville, father figure and manager of the Chipmunk brothers Alvin, Simon & Theodore, has gone on a business trip to Europe and left the boys at home with Miss Miller as observers, much to the chagrin of Alvin, who wanted to go to Europe , While playing against her female counterpart Brittany, the leader of the Chipettes, her younger sister Jeanette (Simon's female colleague) and Eleanor (Theodore's female counterpart) were in a fierce arcade game of Around the World in 30 days. They attract the attention of two evil foreign siblings who need to smuggle money and diamonds around the world, but they need a way to do so without attracting the attention of their arch-enemy, Jamal. The two evil siblings, Claudia and Klaus, eavesdropping on the banter between Alvin and Brittany and decide to use them as a delivery boy and girl for their prey (rather Claudia's idea than Klaus', the latter initially turns out to be too dangerous for children). The two siblings make an offer to the boys and girls - travel with balloons to 12 drop points to have dolls (which resemble the children) containing diamonds and / or money to indicate their arrival, with the promise that the one wins, who wins the race will get an obscene amount of money. But when the two different siblings talk to animals, they are persecuted by the henchmen of Jamal - but who is Jamal? Is he a friend or an enemy? <br /> <br /> TOTAL: Pleasant, light-hearted farce based on the 1980s television series by Alvin & the Chipmunks. Beautiful animations are a highlight, it lacks the coarse humor that creeps into today's family movies and rousing songs (Boys & Girls of Rock & Roll are outstanding). Eagle-eyed fans will likely find that Brittany's character design has been adapted from the animated series, giving her a less round face and giving the cheeks (which also show Jeanette & Eleanor) a seemingly permanent glow. <br /> <br /> Keep an ear to Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson.
