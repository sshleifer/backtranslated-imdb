I know that the movie would have taken several hours to record everything in the book. I think they have done their best to record things that are crucial to the story. I thought the casting was great, the kids who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great! The scenes between him and Baba were particularly touching. I found the places they used interesting. Scenes were filmed in Afghanistan, and a scene was filmed on Treasure Island in San Francisco in Fremont, California (the closing scene). I worked one extra day on "Kite Runner" and that day they shot the final scene. We registered with Treasure Island this morning, checking everyone in the dressing room to make sure it looked like they were in the late '80s. Then we took our seats in the audience. They kept shooting the scene until they were satisfied. It was cool to see the actors up close and also to see the author of the book, who was available as a storyteller. I found this book excellent and I recommend both the book and the movie to everyone. This is a moving story about friendship, love, guilt and eventual salvation. "There is a way to be well again."
