Oz is the television program that is constantly adrenaline. It is a show that is not aimed at a large audience, but a specific one, as the themes are very adult oriented. It was obviously not a mainstream success, as this was an impossibility, but he had a lot of publicity and many famous actors were either guest stars or part of the show. <br /> <br /> Oz is a series of fictional stories based on the film a prison somewhere in the state of New York. There are many different ethnic groups that play an equal role in representation. These groups are the Muslims, Homeboys, Aryans, Cyclists, Italians, Latinos, Irish, Christians, Gays and others. Some have some form of connection with each other, like the bikers and the Aryans, while the Aryans are the enemies of numerous groups, such as the Muslims and the Homeboys. <br /> <br /> In Oswald Penitentary (official name) there is a policy that not too many members of an ethnic group are allowed to be admitted. It is the maximum security prison and the regular prison where prisoners are sometimes sent to or from the exhibition is referred to as "general population" or "gene pop." The main character of the show is Augustus Hill, who also tells the story before and after the main segments, crossed between a documentary and a biographical type. Hill is bound to wheelchair users due to his unknown past. He is part of the "Other" group, where there are people who do not fit in with the other prison gangs. <br /> <br /> Of the many groups, it is the smaller ones who are most difficult to avoid from the times when the bigger ones are in conflict. Some of the most notable characters are as follows: 1) Ryan O'Reilly is responsible for his Irish compatriots and somehow he is always voluntarily engaged in deadly activities for the weakest link. 2) Miguel Alvarez is the observed Latino who is constantly struggling to cope with his popularity within his own group and with others. 3) Simon Adebesi is the Nigerian who was the former leader of the Homeboys gang. He is also very physically very tall and solid. For these two reasons, he is one of Oz's most powerful inmates. 4) Karim Said is the Muslim and Black nationalist who is very defined in his views and desires. He fights on many levels for the rights of his people through the show, from his own Muslim group to his broader black group and even for all groups against the unjust rules of authority. His character seems to be somewhat identical to Malcolm X, the famous black rights fighter who was also a Muslim. <br /> <br /> All in all, Oz may be the biggest (fictional prison show or ethnic show) relationship for his genre. If it does not sound like it's a series of its own, it probably should not be tried, but if it's interesting, it's definitely worth a look. The biggest problem of the show is that it makes you addicted. Some people feel wrong when they look at a lot of material like that. The researchers argue about whether it is harmful or not, but in the end, it is just a reflection of the society of the world in which we live today. This means that it serves as an informant and indicator of the world as an aggressor.
