This really was a deeply moving movie in the truest sense of the word. I myself was a Mormon missionary, and I know first-hand that I want to complete my mission, but conceal the fact that I'm gay. Like the character Aaron, I was sent home to be found out and excommunicated, but being the only Mormon in a Catholic family was not as bad as for the main character. This movie really brought me back to that time and helped me realize how happy I was having a family that accepted me and understood what I was going through. I applauded the end of a movie when Aaron and Christian accidentally find themselves at Lila's restaurant. I was really moved to tears. I warmly recommend this movie to anyone who has read this review and also declare that it is a must.
