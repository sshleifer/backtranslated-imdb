Okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from a thriller to a romantic goofball comedy and back, so fast that it looked like two different films being played at the same time and put together again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater also found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) funny. I almost vomited, but I think that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. He has the ability to portray these over-dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and vocal intonations. His scenes with Betty seem like "Sleepless in Seattle" or another romantic comedy. They almost forgot that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are looking for Betty. Morgan Freeman's fascination for Betty was pretty scary, considering he could be practically her grandfather, but the scenes in which he talks to her photo are definitely worth a laugh! Chris Rock's performance looks rather wooden, but he has his moments. Renee Zellweger is as sweet as Betty, the lovable waitress with the clumsy, unfaithful man who treats her like dirt. It is very unlikely that she would actually have gotten a job without real evidence in a hospital, but, hey, it's a movie, just join in! Her roommate Rosa also shines as a woman who takes care of Betty, but does not know exactly how to deal with Betty's illness. And finally there is Crispin Glover. Of course, as a fan of his, I thought the movie might be funnier if it had been more. No one else has the same style as Crispin, and the quarrel between Chris Rock, Crispin, and the soap opera sheriff is hilarious. I think I say that I liked this movie pretty much! If you can tolerate blood, violence and a lot of bad language, it's worth monitoring and you'll laugh a lot!
