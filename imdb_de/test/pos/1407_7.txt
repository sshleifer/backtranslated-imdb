I found West Point to be a pleasant movie, though I doubt I would watch it again. The performances were convincing. William Haines was another pushy amusing young man who came to the end of the movie. It is hard to believe that Joan Crawford became famous less than a year after this film, as she sometimes seems awkward. <br /> <br /> I would also use another's comment on Ramon Novarro's "Huddle" (1932) on this movie. There is a great movie waiting to be shot, but something is missing. The background and integration of the corps were well utilized, but I was less committed than I had thought. Maybe Haines' character went too far or overcame it. His "regret" did not seem to be real enough; and what kind of message did he send each piece in the final minutes of the Army Navy game? Where is "the Corps" in there? Could have taken the other ten men out and let him do it all himself. I also doubt very much that William Bakewell's weak, surly character at West Point would ever have a real counterpart. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the movie is sometimes very moving and inspiring. It is a good insight into the daily habits of an honorable institution. Thankfully, tradition also means something in West Point, in contrast to the vapid "traditions" of the Ivy League schools, which have been half-hearted these days. But there was a significant overuse of the snare drums. The use for knocking on the door, scene transitions, ALU and in well over half of the scenes was pretty boring. It reduces the viewing experience sooner. I was ready to say "I'm getting the point already". <br /> <br /> Enjoy the movie, but do not expect too much emotional engagement.
