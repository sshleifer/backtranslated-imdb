I had my son for the weekend and my parents called me and said they wanted us both to meet in the cinema. When I got there my mother said that she really wanted to see "The Women" and asked if my son and I would object because it was called a chick movie. I reluctantly agreed because I thought this would be another "First Wives Club" movie. I have to say that I was very surprised that I really enjoyed the movie from the opening scene to the end credits. It was a great production and the cast was perfect in their roles. My son and I laughed through the movie and we are glad we saw him. It was great for a great Saturday afternoon movie and I would recommend it to anyone, man or woman.
