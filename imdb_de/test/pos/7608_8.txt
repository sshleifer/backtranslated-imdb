Of course, really experienced reviewers who like things like Star Wars and professional crap will definitely pull this movie and make really bad comments on it. But it's a brilliant teen comedy with a great story and good acting. <br /> <br /> Josie Gellar (well played by Drew Barrymore) is part of a news reporting team and she was offered a ('real') job) - she needs to go back to school and find out how teens is nowadays. Well, that's fine, until Josie remembers her terrible time in high school and is freaked out. But she was never hip, never cool, never been popular! <br /> <br /> Lean back and enjoy with Never Been Kissed! <br /> <br />
