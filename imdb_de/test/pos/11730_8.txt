This is how Burt Reynolds describes this film, which is his best yet. He plays Tom Sharky, a deputy detective on the track of an international gangster (Vittorio Gassman), and the man he finances to become the next Governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In the novel by William Diehl, the story is more complex because the guy is running for the president. This is a very long film that feels like three hours rather than two hours. Filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza Hotel set the mood for the story. Reynolds does not laugh much here compared to his comedy films. He is very serious here, especially at the beginning of the movie because he is demoted for a dope bust that goes awry. Sometimes, however, the film plays more of a voyeuristic drama than a thriller in which Burt tries to approach the gangster's wife. Only towards the end of the film, the violence is raised, which leads to the bang-bang highlight. Just like the great jazz score in DIRTY HARRY by Lalo Schifrin, Sharky's Machine offers an outstanding urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including Chet Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim & Buddy de Franco, The Manhattan, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams. Al Capps deals with the score with magic. This movie has become one of the best thrillers. Check it out. <br /> <br /> score, 8 out of 10 stars
