A dark and painful look at the dangers of drug addiction. Sinatra is wonderful in this movie. Suffice it to look at his raging winds and screams and destructive rage at the end of the movie to make everyone wonder if he's trying heroin. Maybe they should show this to children in the health class instead of the thoughtless feeling we have to endure year after year. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a man who simply tries to create a new, clean life After he was in jail, he tried his habit of trading drugs and swapping cards in illegal gambling operations to be liberated, pulled down and pulled back into the dirt by the evils of human nature. He is exploited by his employers, the drug dealers, and even his enigmatic, cunning, but stupid wife. <br /> <br /> Even if you did not like the movie itself, it is only worth watching for the soundtrack. It's all heavy, swinging jazz with big drum and brass sections. This, with its groovy but somewhat weird sound, helps to set the mood, along with the grinning, drowsy drug and card traders who always seem to hover like vultures around Frankie Machine. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone - especially if you like movie noir, zoot suits, fedoras or jazz.
