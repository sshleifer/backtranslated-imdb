When I entered the theater, I thought that this would be a great movie. And I was not disappointed a bit. IMPRESSIVE! This movie is brilliant! The emotions throughout the movie are extraordinary! Great show by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman This is probably the best Tamil movie I have seen in years. Mani Ratnam has proven once again that he is the best at making meaningful and warm films. <br /> <br /> This film is basically about a young girl (PS Keerthana) looking for her birth mother (Nandita Das), who gave her up in a refugee camp, just like her husband (JD Chakravathy) to fight for their land. A young writer (Madhavan) learns the story of this young girl and decides to write a story about her. He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this young child, but one day they learn that they are not real parents and decide to look for their birth mother. <br /> <br /> This movie really screams EXCELLENT. The way Mani Ratnam presented the film is great. <br /> <br /> My rating - 10/10
