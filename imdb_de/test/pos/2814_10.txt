At first glance, the concept of this show seemed like a joke and a joke, just to Stan Lee's amusement. I expected nothing less than a gritty, animated version of Barb Wire with low production levels, much like the short bitches you see on Adult Swim for short-term entertainment, but never taken seriously. I was wrong! <br /> <br /> Stripperella has even better production values ​​than comparable Marvel Toons. The animation is very good and it seems that they took this series very seriously and tried to make it as professional as possible. <br /> <br /> The humor is good too, sexy. suggestive and slippery side. It's very similar, though not exactly like the Simpsons style. You may find clichés and a lot of predictable humor, but it's still fun. If this was going on today, I would certainly see it regularly. It's surprisingly one of the better toons ever made.
