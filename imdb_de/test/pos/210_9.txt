The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not all original, of course. Young lovers are separated by war; both of them are doing bad things. We have seen it many times. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, we have not seen how well this was filmed, with bold shots requiring freedom to emphasize separation, destruction or hopelessness. All the more remarkable came from the Soviet Union and the reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in Soviet cinema of modern times. I recently read Chekhov's "Three Sisters" and came to the choirs what can be the meaning of the title of this film. In Act 2, Masha turns against the idea that we have to live our lives without meaning and understanding: "MASHA: Surely mankind must believe in something or at least seek the truth, otherwise life is just emptiness, emptiness, to live and not knowing why the cranes fly, why children are born, why there are stars in the sky, either you need to know why you live, or everything is trivial - just pointless nonsense. "<br /> Also Veronika finds it hard to believe that the war and the suffering of her and the others were meaningless. It is better to give meaning, to live as if life were important, and not yield to despair. It is perhaps this thinking that inspires her to her last act in the film. <br /> <br /> By the way, as minor correction of another comment here - there might be a pattern of Vs in the movie, even though I did not do it. I did not notice them myself. But the first letter of Veronica's name is not another example; In the Cyrillic alphabet, her name begins with a letter that looks like an English "B".
