One of the greatest achievements of The Decline of Western Civilization, filmmaker Penelope Spheeris' indie film's breakthrough, is that he may also appeal to non-punk fans for hardcore fans. More importantly, it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely "marketable" when bands (or at least in some cases tried to play) in damp, dirty clubs in front of an audience that had so much self-esteem, like they respected the bands. For the fan like me, there are valuable interviews with some quasi-legends of the punk scale of LA, some dead, some still live and work hard in the scene. <br /> <br /> Performances and interviews include The Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag (before Henry Rollin's Days), Catholic Discipline, Fear, the Alice Bag Band and the most memorable (in my opinion)). While I knew of some bands and performers in the movie (mainly The Jerks and Black Flag), I had heard only rumors about the singer (the late) Darby Crash, and from the footage in the movie he seems to be one of the epitoms of punk -Move. He does not take himself too seriously, he likes to drink, sometimes he is totally crazy and the attitude he brings to the stage is both funny and frankly exhilarating. A performer like that would probably scare Steve Miller and Jackson Browne out of their skins. <br /> <br /> Decline of Western Civilization can not activate every non-punk fan looking for this movie (hard to find on video), but it should not necessarily turn it off. As a kind of anthropologist who has crept into the party, Spheeris brings down the behavior of these people, their motives, their likes and hatred, and the power they have on and off the screen. Some of them are almost normal, others are not, but they are only offensive to those who are not too open-minded. In addition, the film is an absolute must for kids who consider themselves punk fans just because they hear Good Charlotte and Blink-182: If you want to engage with the movement and the genre rock to love, give it to you Pioneering a chance.
