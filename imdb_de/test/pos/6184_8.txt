This movie appeared on Channel 13 in the 1990s, when he played a series of Hollywood comedies in the 1930s and 1940s. To the tune of "The Jolly Fat Policeman", they had assembled scenes from the movies to introduce the series of laughing people, including one by Gary Cooper, who gurgled when he saw a movie in a movie house - a sequence of it film. <br /> <br /> It all starts innocently when millionaire Cooper goes to a fancy department store in France to buy pajamas. But he just likes to sleep upstairs. The clerk (Tyler Brooke) insists he can not sell half pajamas, as Cooper wants. Claudette Colbert hears the argument and offers help - she just likes to sleep in her pajamas. What if Brooke sells every half? Brooke has never had such an offer before, so he goes to the Floor Walker (Rolfe Sedan) and asks him if this is possible. He is also disturbed - the request is quite unconventional. Finally, they turn to the owner of the store (Charles Halton). Halton is in bed and gets out - his narrow frame is just a pajama top (if it's a decent length for censorship reasons). Can you sell a pair of pajamas to the two customers (half each)? Halton answers in horror: "No, of course not! That's communism !!". The sale is not allowed. Apparently no one believes that Cooper can buy the entire pair and sell half to Colbert. <br /> <br /> Lubitsch's BLUEBEARD'S AIGHTH WIFE has a reputation for falling flat because most viewers do not like it because Colbert's character is misunderstood. She is seen as a pretty mercenary to Cooper - she sells to him on her terms. <br /> <br /> In fact, Cooper's character is the more vicious, since he is rich and he thinks everything has a price. He is usually right. Look at how Colbert's aristocratic father, Edward Everett Horton, sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. Cooper's willingness to marry Colbert somehow includes the agreement that if he hesitates or decides not to marry her, he will pay damages. When Horton realizes that, he fetches a watch and says (in a most reassuring voice) to Cooper, "Take your time, my boy!" To make a decision. Later, we see that Horton's wardrobe has become more modern and chic. <br /> <br /> The film, written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, gets on well with the script for Mitchell Leisin's MIDNIGHT (also with Colbert, but with Don Ameche and John Barrymore). There, Colbert is ready to sell for a money marriage (to Francis Lederer), which is hampered by a fictitious marriage with Ameche. She really loves Ameche (a taxi driver), but she explains to him in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents married "out of love", but poverty made them hate each other. This is not to be found in BLUEBEARD'S AIGHTH WIFE, where Colbert has no such background (after all, she is the daughter of a marquis). Your mercenary plot is to teach Cooper a lesson about its standards. <br /> <br /> The film has some nice work from the aides, including Herman Bing as a private detective, who turns out to hide things that Colbert finds out about, and a young David Niven, who has a selection of moments as a kickboxing stalwart and has a willing ear for Cooper. Coop tells Niven about his problems with Colbert and how angry she is. Niven listens respectfully. In the end, Cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he had to say. "Albert, how much do I pay you?", Cooper asks him. Niven thinks and says, "Thirty-five francs a week, sir." Cooper looks deep into his soul and says (shaking his head): "That's nice!"
