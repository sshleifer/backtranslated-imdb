I do not know if this movie hits my heart like this because of the feelings of friendship, love, closeness to others, or the warmth of this transformation that Babette's cooking creates, but when the festival starts and for the rest of the movie, I suffocate often. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a feel-good movie, but with no hint of mawkishness or slight sentimentality. Please note that elements of the presentation are discussed. Babette's festival tells its story with reserve and care, and lets us discover the values ​​of grace and love. All we need to know is that Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) was a French refugee hosted by two aging sisters in a small community on the Jutland coast. The sisters lead what is left of their father's flock. He was a pastor of conviction who taught that salvation comes from self-denial. The sisters made sacrifices and beliefs. Those who still remain honor the teachings of the now long-dead pastor and his spiritual guidance. However, as we get older, the tiny community has become questionable and argumentative. The sisters do what they can. For the 100th birthday of the pastor, Babette wants to cook dinner for the small group that invites the sisters. The sisters reluctantly agree, but when they see the supplies Babette has ordered, she and her guests are uncomfortable. They are used to the usual dishes of the dried cod, boiled meat and soup made from bread, water and a small ale. Although Babette has improved over time, what they see seems close to godlessness. The dinner will also feature a visitor, General Lorens Lowenhielm, who years ago had chosen his ambition for one of the sisters. <br /> <br /> What do we experience? There is the strict beliefs of the aging community and the stony, wind-filled huts in which they live. It is the warmth of candlelight in the small, crowded dining room of the sisters. And then there's the transforming power of Babette's art as we watch her cook, like Erik, a little boy helping her serve, watching the old parishioners with fine wine and exquisite cooking, gradually renewing their community to discover love and friendship. The general serves as an unexpected leader because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes he takes. The General tells a story to his incomprehensible roommates, a story about a famous woman who was the model cook in the famous Café Anglais in Paris. "... this woman, this chef, had the ability to turn a dinner into a kind of love affair ... a love affair that made no difference between physical appetite and spiritual appetite." He, too, is transformed into a man who accepts what he has become, and yet always recognizes the value and love of what he has not accepted long ago. An old couple kiss. Two old men remember earlier friendships. And Babette, who had spent all that she had won in a lottery at this dinner, had the opportunity to be the artist she once was in France, an opportunity that she accepted with love and friendship. <br /> <br /> Babette, now as poor as she was when she arrived punctually years ago, will continue with the sisters. The general in a carriage with his aunt returns to their estate. And the elderly guests leave the house of the sisters to return to their own huts. They pause to look at the clear night sky and the stars above them. They spontaneously hold their hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn ... <br /> <br /> "The clock strikes and time goes by forever Let's use this time to try and join the Lord Heart and will to serve spirit, so that we will find our true home, so that we will find our true home. "<br /> <br /> They smile at each other. Everything was reconciled. <br /> <br /> Babette's Feast is a wonderful movie full of restrained emotions, unspoken understanding, wisdom ... and, of course, a meal that will leave a growling stomach as you leave the theater. If you win a lottery so you can afford what Babette created, and what skills and crafts they have, Potage a la Tortue (a rich turtle soup) served with Amontillado Sherry Blinis Demidoff au caviar (small buckwheat pancakes with Sour cream and caviar), served with Veuve Clicquot Champagne Cailles en Sarcophage with Sauce Perigourdine (fried quail stuffed with foie gras and truffle in puff pastry with truffle sauce, enriched with Madeira), a fine burgundy salad cheese and fresh fruits Baba au Rhum with glacee fruits and fresh figs coffee and fine schnapps
