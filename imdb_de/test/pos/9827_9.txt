I really enjoyed "Random Hearts". It was shocking to see such a low rating in IMDB, but Chacun, a son, Gicht and all that. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I have to admit he was poorly cast in this movie. The reason why I gave him 9 instead of 10 was wonderful. She was believable and beautiful, though she'd made up half of the movie, as if she had been crying for days. Could "Random Hearts" have been better? Sure, but it's well worth seeing, as it is.
