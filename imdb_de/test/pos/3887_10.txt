Garlin is undoubtedly a comedian and comedian for anyone looking for a good time. His first film, which is all about his own creation and production, tells the story of a fighting Chicago actor James Aaron, with whom Jeff obviously identifies. He miraculously contrasts James James and Paddy Chayefsky's "Marty" and Jackie Gleason's Poor Soul as he unveils James Dilemmas with a number of actors who are Jeff's friends, many of whom are fellow second-city stars. <br /> <br /> He lovingly uses Sarah Silverman's silvery cuteness and hatefully absurd humor to illustrate that despite common sense and talent, life's contentment can all too often believe in relentless frustration. Bonnie Hunt offers a charming performance as a romantic interest. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by a simple story, the characters and conflicts are well thought out and sound true. Those who follow Garlin's career and understand that his humor is based on humorously narrating reality and not necessarily creating a fiction that is too easily invented will appreciate his dialogue-driven story. <br /> <br /> We will certainly see Garlin working a lot more as a director and writer with other talented intelligent actors who take the big challenge of making fun of life.
