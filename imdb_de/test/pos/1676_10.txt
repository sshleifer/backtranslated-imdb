After five years in prison, Tony le Stéphanois (Jean Servais) meets his dear friends Jo (Carl Möhner) and the Italian Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel) and invites Tony to steal a few jewels from the showcase of the famous jewelry Mappin & Webb Ltd but refuses. Tony finds his former girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), who became the lover of the gangster owner of the nightclub L'Ege d'Or or Louis Grutter (Pierre Grasset), and humiliates her, beating her back and taking her jewels. Then he calls Jo and Mario and suggests a burglary in the vault of the jewelry. They invite the Italian specialist for safes and the elegant Wolf Cesar (Perlo Vita) to join their team and plan a perfect robbery. They succeed in their plan, but D. Juan Cesar makes things wrong by giving his mistress a precious ring. <br /> <br /> "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes" is certainly a great movie noir among the best I've ever seen. The script is believable, backed by a great direction by Jules Dassin, impressive performances by the performers and great cinematography. Jean Servais has an outstanding performance in the role of a criminal whose principles are based on the rules of the underworld. The famous long silent sequence of the robbery is amazing and extremely tense and certainly one of the best in cinematic history. I introduce this great movie to my list of favorite movies of all time. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rififi"
