After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a double set with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy them as both films were favorites of childhood. <br /> <br /> The Aristocats is definitely a classic. It may not be a five-star classic, but it's a fun movie and makes for great entertainment. It's a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats are trying to be a carefree musical comedy, and I think it's about succeeding. <br /> <br /> The plot does not really make much sense and I do not think the plot is particularly strong it's certainly not weak. The animations and backgrounds are somewhat scratchy in some places, typical of Disney's 70s films, but it has a rustic, old-fashioned charm. <br /> <br /> The strongest points of Aristocats are the characters, the music and the music humor. The music is very memorable - try to get "Everybody Wants To A Cat" out of your head in no hurry! The songs are written by the Sherman Brothers, who also did the music for The Jungle Book. There was a song called "She Never Felt Alone" that would appear in the movie, but unfortunately was not included in the final movie. It's a shame because I think it would fit very well. <br /> <br /> The characters are unforgettable. Thomas O'Malley is voiced by Phil Harris and is basically Baloo in Cat form. Eva Gabor gives Duchess that warm and maternal feeling and the kitten's voices actually sound like children and not as actors imitating a child's voice. The secondary characters are in the dozen and yet you still understand their personality. Edgar, the "wicked" butler, plays a role similar to Cruella De Vil, but is weird rather than scary and often lands in fun situations. Although he is the villain, he is still adorable. <br /> <br /> The two British geese Abigail and Amelia really got me together with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like the dogs who argue about who the leader is. I could go on, but I will not ruin it. But I can tell you, The Aristocats is funny and will entertain anyone without resorting to rudimentary toilet humor. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The Aristocats may not be Disney's crowning achievement or even their strongest 1970s movie (this award is a link between the rescuers and the many adventures of Whinnie the Pooh). But it's an entertaining game and will certainly entertain. If you are looking for a dazzling piece of art, you should see Bambi better. But if you want to spend a fun night, The Aristocats is the way to go. It's a charming and lovable movie and it's impossible not to like it. Enjoy! (It's also good to have a movie where cats are not seen as villains).
