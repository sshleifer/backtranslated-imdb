I have watched thousands of movies in my life and believe that this movie is the "most perfect" movie ever made. By perfect I mean storytelling, action, acting, staging, camerawork, etc. (This is a layman's opinion, I have no background in film production.) Many movies have perfect scenes like the bartender doing a report to the cops in that Submit Movie Fargo. (In fact, this scene could also play as a short film.) In The Dead, each scene is performed perfectly, making the entire movie perfect. Maybe John Huston sold his soul to the devil to make such a movie. Hopefully Daniel Webster got him out of the contract!
