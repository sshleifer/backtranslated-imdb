I saw this movie at the Rotterdam Film Festival and was pleasantly surprised. The photography is just so stylish and beautiful, and the story is simply not a normal mafia movie. Actually, this plot is pretty much in the background. It is rather the personal journey of a middle-aged man trapped in an existence to which he was forced to live. The actor Toni Servillo is great, he surpassed this "quiet man". The girl, Olivia Magnani, is the granddaughter of Italian actress Anna Magnani and lives with the family name. <br /> <br /> If you expect a typical Italian movie in which all big-screaming families, that's NOT your movie. There are no average clich√©s and it is definitely worth a visit.
