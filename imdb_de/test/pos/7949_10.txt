I was fortunate enough to see this film at the recent International Film Festival here. I could actually see another South Korean movie (The Power of Kangwon Province), but Christmas in August caught my attention more. The story is simple enough, the ordinary boy-meets-girl (or should we say girl-meets-boy?). What made it special for me was how it was done. We can say that the movie was quiet and adorable. Here we have no flashy and contrived romance, just two ordinary beings wonderfully made to each other by their friendship and unspoken love for one another. I also loved how the film used images as expressions of past-present relationships. I wish this would be shown here as a regular movie. I'm sure it would call to a larger audience.
