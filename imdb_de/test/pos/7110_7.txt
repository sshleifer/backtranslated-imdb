All-Monster Convention in graduation film in Universal's well-known cycle of classic horror stories. Count Dracula (an intense, elegant John Carradine), who calls himself Baron Latos, comes to Dr. Nobleman (Onslow Stevens) and asks to be healed of his suffering. That's just a cunning, of course. Then, by chance, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney) aka "The Wolf Man" shows up, and of course he * really * wants to be healed. <br /> <br /> As others have noticed, the monsters do not get the same screen time. The Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) is thrown in the end only to include all Universal monsters. Also film material and library music are reused here. The film may spend a little too much time on the Dracula part of the story, though Carradine in the role of the count provides an impressive, non-malicious performance. The film is primarily a showcase for Stevens, who goes through his own tragic arc of character and does an excellent job. The women are great and I have to say that I loved Jane Adams as a glowing nurse - who happens to be hunchbacked. <br /> <br /> Of course, it would not be complete without the involvement of angry villagers. <br /> <br /> Professional and professionally made cooler is not really scary for my taste, but still entertaining. It is altogether a respectable serial entry. <br /> <br /> 7/10
