Symbolist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to unravel the Illuminati mystery before a new scientific experiment blows up the city. The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006, but for the vast majority of Dan Brown followers it did not do justice to its award-winning book, and although it ran for over two and a half hours, it seemed boring to many. After reading the book, I was perhaps one of the few who did. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou attempted to solve the mystery of the Louvre's murder, but for Angels and Demons, the scales once again became lead star and director levied. After the survey, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to the Da Vinci Code for entertaining reading, and it seems that critics and fans, while not fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release. <br /> <br /> This Howard image certainly has more clinical energy and exercise than unlike Da Vinci, Robert Langdon of Tom Hanks h As only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican, and because of the time constraints, the action, and the despair, putting the ante high and delivering a thrill that certainly surpasses the Da Vinci Code, but also lots of twists and a stunning murder produces sequences. <br /> <br /> The interesting factor of this 2009 release are the constant elements that are justified for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are contained in drastic and powerful sequences to give the situation a sense of overall power. This really justifies the thriller with a constant tension and a sharp drama. The themes and beliefs got a complete overhaul again. <br /> <br /> As was the case three years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols that were once lost forever, and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and between the controversies of other pressing circumstances , <br /> <br /> It's fair to say that Dan Brown is a complex writer; He certainly likes to stuff themes and dramas into his action and exciting sequences. In addition to the attempt to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of choosing a new Pope, dealing with a new scientific experiment and the power of religion is back. Anything interesting to discover and hear, when occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to drift your mind, but since the novel contains so much, this was probably always very likely. Ron Howard, who has kept himself open An ordinary kind of directional scroll in Da Vinci may be the worst case. His jerky, ever-moving camera styling does not help maintain the pressure, and we can never accept what's happening on the screen, thanks to this honestly terribly portrayed style. He is certainly not Paul Greengrass and that is by no means Bourne. <br /> <br /> Slick and stylized, that's faster and more interesting than Da Vinci
