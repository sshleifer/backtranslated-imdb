This is a confusing, absurd short. A white-dressed miller comes towards us from a windmill in a lonely landscape. Although the picture is reduced, there is an obvious logic here. However, he is stopped by the work, all in black. They start beating each other for no particular reason - did the snappy miller offend the soot-sweeper? Is this the class war? Anyway, he bombards his opponent with bags of grain that fly around in combat, and makes everything he had done before the fight redundant, so that the windmill becomes superfluous, so so too meaningless becomes like the fight. The grain of the miller brightens up the blackness of the strip - later Westerns would not be so subtle, heroes and villains were marked in color. Is there a race color here? <br /> <br /> If this was not wonderful enough, the fighters will be chased out of the screen by a crowd coming out of nowhere, a reasonable Kafkaesque end with a weird story (or is it just the social conscience that rises) against a fight that negates order and purpose?) and very unusual in the days of the early silent movie. This mix of comedy, surrealism and absurdity is an obvious precursor to Buster Keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, Hitchcock's "Foreign Correspondent".
