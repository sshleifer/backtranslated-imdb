As a late patron of car artists (1970-80s), there are many films that I have seen and forgotten. I can never forget that. Despite their cheap exploitation style when shooting the STORY was very well done. The isolated asylum in which patients practice their fantasies to cure their illness, the head physician's accidental murder when the new nurse appears, the (supposed) resident doctor takes over the various crazy parents The revelation that the resident is actually a patient and finally the rescue of the young nurse by the simple-minded Sam who killed everyone else in the house to escape unscathed made for a great HISTORY that kept the movie together. I emphasized the word STORY because that makes a good or great movie. No matter how much blood, blood, nudity, sexuality, or outrageous behavior you put into a movie, if the story is not good, the movie is not good. The movie credits show clips of all the actors, including the old witch with the last line asking you to go out and never come back. This is a great ending to this movie. If it appears on video / DVD, see it and enjoy it.
