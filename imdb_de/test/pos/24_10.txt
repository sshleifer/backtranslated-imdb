"Sir" has played Lear over 200 times, but tonight he can not remember his opening lines. Sitting at the mirror, his eyes reflect the madness of the king. His dresser gently asks him to utter the words. There is a hint of desperation about these two men. The great actor, knowing that his powers are disappearing, disappears knowing that he can do no more than facilitate his death. "The Dresser" is really a love story between the two. Over the years, they have made each other so dependent that they can not imagine a future without the other. During World War II, it is the property of an honestly secondary Shakespearean Company consisting of an equal number of children and would-be names led by "Sir," a theatrical knight of what might be called "The Old School." No matter what role he plays, he grabs the stage and roars over the spotlights, yelling his audience in applause. But somewhere inside, he's usually buried deep under the ham he rinses out regularly, and there's still an occasional glitter of his former size. It is a look that his audience hopes for hopefully. Mr. A. Finney skilfully focuses on the hams, often to the point of caricature, and if you are willing to reject his performance as mere exaggeration, he will create a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that will make you feel like a great actor playing one great actor. The same goes for Mr. T. Courtenay. It is easy to write off his account of Norman as an exercise in stereotyping. Here we have more of a female female than a theatrical dresser making his way through life. I enjoy the company of "The Girls" and love the nasty insider gossip in "The Theater". There was - and I suspect it still - many men like Norman in The Profession. Finally friendly and patient, more about playing than many of the actors, they walk backstage with wisdom and affection. I think the vast majority of them would scream with appreciative laughter at Mr. Courtenay's portrait. I saw "The Dresser" on the London stage, where Mr. Courtenay's "Norman" was more subject to perceived wisdom than film. "Sir" was played to great acclaim by the great Mr. Freddie Jones by the audience was a memorable performance that overshadowed Mr. Courtenay 's performance and reduced him to "even - running" compared to an actor on level billing. The idea that "Sir" and "Norman" may have been almost incomplete without their having come into contact with each other's windows. "Norman" was reduced to his puppet, which Ronald Harwood did not mean exactly, but for a breathtaking theater. Messrs. Finney and Courtenay correct the balance of the film and restore the equality of the relationship. Both men have come a long way since their early appearances in British New Wave imagery when they became the darlings of the vaguely Leftish - "middle class and ashamed" movement. When the British cinema Hari - kiri almost committed In the 1970s, they quietly focused on the theater, apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door. With the renaissance of more extensive films, they reappeared and blinked in unfamiliar bright light. <br /> <br /> "The Dresser" marked her return, which still raved with energy and talent, and called to the whole world "We are still here". It's not a big movie, but certainly a great one.
