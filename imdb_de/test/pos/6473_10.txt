Some time ago we read about the results of a survey done by some newspaper sports writers. The questions asked were only two and were short and sweet. Question # 1 asked the respondent to say who his favorite college football team was. In question # 2, the fan was asked to name his most hated college football team. The answer to both questions was simply Notre Dame! ND is on top of both lists! Yes, I love them or hate them, but you certainly will not ignore them. <br /> <br /> The roots of this unique position of this Indepent * College Football Powerhouse lie in the life and career of a man. The adult, small immigrant Norweigen from Chicago is called Knute Rockne. As a biopics, the production of KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-American (1940) came close to the death of Coach Rockne relatively close to a plane crash of 1930. It was about 10 years later, when the film was released. This would mean that the preliminary work on the project began about 8 years after Mr. Rockne's loss by our nation. His portrait and voice were known from newspapers, radio and motion picture news reels. Both the widow of Knute, Bonnie Skiles Rockne, and the University of Notre Dame had the right to choose the actor as lead actor and to accept the script. We believe that they could not have done the job better. Pat O'Brien looks really good and was a football player at the university. Ronald Reagan plays the key role of George Gipp **, a free-spirited student who goes to Notre Dame on a baseball scholarship! He was a walk-on footballer. <br /> <br /> The cast is full of talented players. We have Griffith Veteran, Donald Crisp as Miss Callaghan, C.S.C., Notre Dame President. Albert Basserman is Fr. Newland, the mentor for Chemistry Prof and Rockne. Gail Page appears as Mrs. Bonnie Skiles Rockne. Owen Davis, Jr. is Rockne's cohort, Gus Dorais (the passer-by on this historic ND vs. ARMY game at West Point.) <br /> <br /> The cast will feature Kane Richmond, Nick Lukats, William Marshall, and William Byrne as Four Rounded Riders The real-time Big Time College coaches Howard Jones, 'Pop' Warner, Bill Spaulding and Amos Alonzo Stagg appear in scenes from Congressional Probe at College Sports adding an authentic accent. <br /> <br /> As for biopic, one can only say that it is on the ground and does not slow down from start to finish. There is no waste of time either. Full screen time is used to advance the story. <br /> <br /> The use of the Notre Dame Choir, the campus itself and all the marching band brass band rah-rah makes you feel really there. *** <br /> <br /> * To Even though her basketball team and other sports teams are attending the Big East Conference, Notre Dame remains an independent football club for the NCAA that day. What that means is that The Fighting Irish actually adhere to a national timetable. <br /> <br /> ** There was no such agreement with George Gipp's family. A few years ago, there was a complaint about the scene in which the young Mr. Gipp held the famous "Win Onr For The Gipper Speech". Television prints of this KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN were without talk in the deathbed scene. Other Notre Dame films have been made over the years. The Spirit of Notre Dame (Universal 1931) introduced J. Farrell McDonald as a Rockne-style coach. There were also Lew Ayers, Andy Devine Nat Pendleton and the members of the real Notre Dame Championship teams with the real four riders represented. Then of course we have RUDY (Tri-Star 1993) with Sean Astin, Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton among others in a good cast. There has also been talk of an unauthorized movie critically called Notre Dame, GOLDEN GLORY, but nothing has materialized, has it? (Let me know, dear reader, THANK YOU !!) **** Warner brothers always had great music in their opening motifs and in the minor music. In this Rockne movie they have added THE NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG to the score. They included STEP NOTRE DAME and THE NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, who premiered in 1930 at the Rockne Funeral in the Notre Dame Basilica.
