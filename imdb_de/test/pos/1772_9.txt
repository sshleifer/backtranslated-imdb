Sometimes it's hard to be a pirate ............... But Miss Jean Peters loves to give it a try - and that's especially evident in her first friendly sword fight Blackbeard (Mr. Thomas Gomez (pronounced hissable), with the sheer pleasure of running on her face.) After fifty years in retrospect, feminists seem to aim to use this film as a kind of hymn for empowering women in a male-dominated society but I have serious doubts that either M. Tourneur or Miss Peters have such a concept in their minds time.It was an exciting, entertaining family movie that had no claims, hidden meanings or alternative agenda, it was fun Louise Jourdan is both in love and treacherous as her love interest.Mr. Herbert Chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical physician.Mr. James Rob ertson Justice is just a bit unbelievable as the airfield. But it is Miss Peters who remains in the memory. She is incredibly youthful, illiterate, tough but vulnerable, wonderfully agile and ultimately brave, she is everyone's idea of ​​a lady pirate. There was a certain window of opportunity for her in fiery costume roles - that she did not choose to take it is a regret.
