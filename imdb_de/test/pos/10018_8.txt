I certainly have not seen all of Jean Rollin's films, but for the most part it seems bloody vampires are nude women's festivals, which, considering these kinds of things, is not bad, but this is a big departure and Cronenberg could almost be without the biography , mechanical nightmarish stuff. Except in French with subtitles of course. A man driving in the street at night encounters and picks up a woman in slippers and a bathrobe while another woman is still in the background while she is still in the car. As they continue, it's obvious that something's wrong with the woman, because she's forgetting things almost as fast as they happen. However, that does not prevent the man from having sex with her when he returns to Paris and his home. The man goes to work, and some strangers come to him and bring the woman to this "skyscraper", a huge dwelling called the Black Tower, where others of their kind (for whom the "no memory") seems the least their problems) are being held for some reason. In the film, time and events are spent trying to find out what's going on and getting out of the building for that woman, and she manages to call Robert, the man who first picked her up, to call to save her. The revelation of what's going on comes in the final moments of the film, which has a strange but touching ending. By avoiding his apparent "typical" formula, Rollin created his most intriguing and disturbing film in this regard. I like this very much, look at it. 8 out of 10.
