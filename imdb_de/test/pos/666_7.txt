This PASSO GEDDON Special Action by BRASS EYE was flooded with complaints (more on that later) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate over a possible "Sarah Law" following the kidnapping and murder of student Sarah Payne. In fact, planning was delayed when Phil Collins sought legal advice after discovering that he had been misled by the creator of the show, Chris Morris, into a campaign titled "Nonce-sense." It can be said that this show probably more reminiscent of the controversy than the content, which is in very bad taste, but I have to confess that I laughed out loud. The issue focuses on pedophiles and how society treats them and their victims. Chris Morris plays the moderator, who tells viewers that a notorious pedophile was shot into space, and confesses that an eight-year-old child was inadvertently put in the capsule along with the pedophile. Cue the child's scared cries. As I said, very bad taste. <br /> <br /> Further highlights of the show are Dr. med. Fox, who gives a scientific lecture that pedophiles have an identical nervous system as crabs ("Nobody knows that, but it's a scientific fact") MEP Barbara Follet publicly warned that pedophiles put their genitals on while surfing the Internet, and Kate Thornton warned viewers that pedophiles could send gas through the internet, making young children vulnerable to sexual predators including a victim, and who now has the sexuality of a sixty-year-old colonel. "Morris also shows a cop on the child protection team that photographs him taken seriously and wanted to know if they were considered obscene, including Barbie, who was surrounded by spouses, and a composite photo of a boy's head, a dog's body, and an erect penis that could only belong to John Holmes. I never said that this show was tasteful, was it? <br /> <br /> It is impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without condemning the hypocritical confrontation in which politicians, children's organizations and police officers were, because she made fun of a very serious topic. The show had a bad taste, though I had laughed all the way, but it's a biting satire. Perhaps the critics should take a long look in the mirror, where a liberal elite is running the condemned pedophile slime through the streets of Britain before criticizing a mere television program for the intensification of tensions.
