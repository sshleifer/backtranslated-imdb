This was an interesting study of social sexuality and the "dark interests" of man. <br /> <br /> Although I can not say that the woman is a strong personality - she was the wrong choice for the part. In my opinion, she was a rich kid looking for her life as a drool. She was indeed a rebel and never fully matured for her husband, a lawyer (Rickman). It is obvious that he married her for her money to cover his sexual desires, which is taboo. Rickman played his role for a tee, his flirtations with the young man, and very subtle undertones of gaiety. The young man was gay until the very end! When he made Marilyn's impersonation, the woman should have learned everything. He was also perfect. He wrote everything about him. <br /> <br /> I was not crazy about the end because I knew what was coming. Overall, Rickman's acting was great, Reedus was good, Walker was okay, but I was worried. It was average for a gay theme film, but not blatant at least. It's worth seeing if you do not have "Truly Madly Deeply" lying around for a round.
