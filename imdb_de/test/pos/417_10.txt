He is not your usual taxi driver. <br /> <br /> These guys have problems. With his wife, his son, a priest, all his farewells, his ex-partner, and above all, himself. And best of all, they just throw us all in. So we have to keep watching to find out more about his past. <br /> <br /> The idea may not be original, but David Morse does it. I think this is a great show and I hope people will prevail before the season starts. <br /> <br /> VIEW THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!!
