If you are looking for an erotic masterpiece, it is not so. If you're looking for a comedic masterpiece, it's not like that. If you are looking for some hardcore, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an example of the art of European erotic comedy from the early mid-1970s, this is the place to go. <br /> <br /> I see a lot of people complaining about the quality. Please understand that it was made in 1974. Yes, women do not meet the modern ideal of attractiveness. They are by no means ugly women, but they do not have the same look that is idealized in our silicone culture. Yes, the synchronization is not great, but they speak German, and anyone who speaks German will find it quite difficult to dub a word with 12 syllables. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the DVD before, it will be marketed with two covers for the 80s and, more recently, the 90s for adults. The film is an R-movie. Those who complain about hardcore should have realized this. The film was edited from the original, BUT it was also edited before its appearance in the Drive-Ins in the late 70s. I saw this movie for the first time as a young man and judging by some comments, many are in the same boat that got a look at Cinemax. Many people are upset if they do not live up to their former memories later in life. It's understandable, considering that the heap and nudity of today's eroticism are packed. If you compare 2069 with a modern softcore erotic comedy, you may be disappointed. The movie is fancy, but the jokes, while anecdotes and double meanings still persist and can cause a giggle. If you compare it to a hardcore movie, you will continue to be disappointed. Compared to today, you see very little. <br /> <br /> It's still one of the best examples along with Bottoms Up and The Other Cinderella by European Erotic / Comedy Cinema of the 70s.
