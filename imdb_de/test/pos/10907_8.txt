This is really a funny movie. His dance scene recorded with the band is one of the funniest scenes I can remember. I found the scene "I'm gay" at the graduation ceremony of the high school somewhat surreal, even though it was funny. As I saw it for the third time, I began to track down small segments that I had missed. For one, Matt Dillon's girlfriend, a classic Ditz, tried to use a phone she had never used before. Kevin Klein has made this movie together with Tom Selleck successful. This was also the first time that I appreciated Debbie Reynolds; She has proven that she can be funny. She confirmed this in the TV series "Will and Grace". One find I found after the third visit is Lauren Ambrose from '6 Feet Under'. She stands out with her red bangs, but it's obvious that this is one of her first films. Bob Newhart is also very funny about the principle of high school.
