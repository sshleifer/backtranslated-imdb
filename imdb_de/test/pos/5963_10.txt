Wladyslaw Starewicz was a Russian-born animator who lived in France and did incredible things with stop-motion. I have already seen a few of these films and they show his favorite topics - insects, frogs and various animals. They are extremely realistic and lifelike and still worth watching - the quality is just fantastic. <br /> <br /> Here many, many frogs are highlighted. They appeal to their god Jupiter to give them a king. Why do they need a king, Jupiter wonders - their lives are now perfectly fine. To teach them a bad lesson, he makes a heron king and begins to eat his subjects! Then the frogs turn again to Jupiter, who has the obvious morality that it is best to be content with what you have! <br /> <br /> Although the animation quality is incredible, this is a very scary movie for kids. I think that would scare her, both by the real look of the animals and by the story itself, which is not for the faint-hearted!
