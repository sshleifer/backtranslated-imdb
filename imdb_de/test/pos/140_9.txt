The definition of a vampire is an inhuman body that should leave her grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakjwi almost turns this concept upside down, without the clich√© of sharp fangs and neck biting. Since I was an R-rated movie, I knew that this would actually affect vampires who are actually vampires. Which means that the characters in the movie do what vampires actually do without restraint, and rightly have no glamorous moments compared to Twilight. After watching Chan-wook Park's previous Oldboy I had very high expectations of Bakjwi. <br /> <br /> I expected some unpleasant action sequences with our antihero, known as Priest Sang-hyeon, and was very impressed with his performance as a saint, who is forced into this dilemma of being human and thirsty as a vampire to obey. (SPOILER) Having first survived the defective blood transfusion, he longed for blood and discovered his superpower and flight characteristics. The screenshots make his transitional phase without overstraining the exposure. He drinks the blood of the dying and those who want to be euthanized for moral reasons. The often tragic and dysfunctional love affair that the priest has with the manipulative Tae-joo is very intriguing as they are played by the Kanh-ho song by The Host and actress OK-vin Kim. The special effects are placed right in the backdrop and although they offer nothing new in terms of stunts and CGI, they have not been memorized in the plot-driven and character-based premise. The story and the crucial plot points are very perverted and grotesque and yet very original in their own Korean style. <br /> <br /> There are not many negatives that I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I wonder if the priest's transitional phase would have revealed more of the priest who had an emotional crisis with his transformation, but on the other hand, the film would have been making the movie for 3 hours. The movie took a long time. On the other hand, vampires really do not have much emotion to express emotions. As already mentioned, this movie is very tragic. So do not expect anything hopeful when you see that. <br /> <br /> Overall, Bakjwi is wonderfully dark, morbid and original. I strongly recommend this movie to serious viewers who have passed the teenage phase of Twilight. This is definitely the Korean answer to the Swedish Let The Right One In, which is also a good movie.
