Although the plot of this film is a little far-fetched, it is only worth seeing for Michael's Caine and Gambon. The latter provides a really wonderful Dublin accent. Caine sums it up ... exactly what the character he's supposed to be doing. Entertaining and entertaining, this is one and a half hours easy to watch.
