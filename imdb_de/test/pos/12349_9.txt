I actually saw One Dark Night in the theater and wrote a review of the movie for my high school newspaper. I loved it and I still love it. The plot revolves around two persons. First of all, a woman learns that her father has a telekenesis after his death. She then has feelings about her father's strange powers, even in his death. The mausoleum in which he is buried houses the other main character, a high school girl who does everything she can to get together with a group of girls she just wants to torture and dare to stay in mausoleum all night to join their group. They go back into the night to scare and frighten them. The cast is by Meg Tilly with supporting roles of Adam West and one of my personal favorites Elizabeth Daily aka E.G. Every day. If you love 80s movies and kitschy horror movies, you will not be dissatisfied.
