The entire civilized world now knows that Emil Sitka is here holding his immortal "hands, you love birds". But Shemp Howard, professor of music, steals the show. Watch him teach Dee Green as she breaks the "Voices of Spring". Watch Shemp shaving on a mirror hanging from a string on the ceiling. Watch him as he is knocked over by Christine McIntyre. Watch him and you will laugh and learn. Moe is also not slippery. Watch him as he tries to get a woman to put herself in a bear trap. Larry is, as usual, the Zen Master of Reaction. All in all one of the best Stooge shorts. You will not find a weak moment.
