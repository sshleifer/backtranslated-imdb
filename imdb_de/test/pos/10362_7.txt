I liked this movie. Many call it "Sabrina, the teenage feminist". They do that with a lot of movies in which Melissa Joan Hart is. Still, she really surprised me because she was great in Mary's role fighting for justice when her roommate is raped. You could see that Hart was very determined in this movie and it showed. I also liked Lisa Dean Ryan as roommate of Mary. She was very effective at apologizing for her character after her rape. Josh Hopkins was good as the brave and selfish rapist. Lochlyn Munro convincingly played his character. The acting in this film is better in my opinion than in most TV movies. <br /> <br /> The movie was pretty predictable though. I also expected more from the end, it was too abrupt. The delivery could have been better. But the performances and the overall presentation make up for these problems.
