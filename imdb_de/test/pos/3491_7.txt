No real plot, no character development, no direction on the scorese level, but seriously, did you really expect it? The only thing that matters is that this streak is absolutely funny, almost at the level of Borat. Sure, the end draws a bit, but if Borat's cameo has not shaken you, you have to be the worst boy in the boys' history. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the biggest comedian ALIVE and here he laughs more than Jude Law on a nudist beach. I dare you not laugh. <br /> <br /> If you can pull the five-meter-long rod out of your ass for an hour and a half, and just some timed and extremely silly jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character, see this stupid movie. You will not regret it. Keep it real!
