I recently had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally charged movie by director Mani Ratnam at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. I have given this film my highest honor in the film festival. Make sure you have no chance to let this cinematic gem pass by you ... But be curious: this movie will bring you to tears if you belong to the species known as Homo Sapien! A 10 !!
