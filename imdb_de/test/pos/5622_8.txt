Chris Smith is a superior filmmaker with the rare talent of discovering a good story and then avoiding hell. Smith's "American Movie" is the lifelong record of filmmaker Mark Borchardt, a loser aiming to demolish his older uncle for the money to complete his horror film. But under no circumstances to work or support the children he has fathered. That's the ability of producer Smith to make Mark seem more likeable than usual. Even as he lures Uncle Bill with sugary dreams and executive producer credits, it's his desperation to be someone to associate his name with people like Scorsese and Spielberg who us touch. <br /> <br /> "American" movie "is also part of this rare, often-tried, but seldom-achieved sub-genre that successfully blends hilarity with horror, and the humor comes from Borchard's Ed Wood belief in his own genius.
