After a summer of retreading and disappointment, Sister Betty is a breath of fresh air. The movie is like no other I've ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can show more than disturbing images of men and women and how they deal with sex (his two previous films were the brilliant In Company of Men and the almost brilliant friends and neighbors). Renee Zellweger shows the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who disappears into a fantasy world as she witnesses the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute-Mainstay Aaron Eckhart). Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play the hitmen who killed their husband and are in court. The trick of the film is that Freeman and Zellweger are really parallel characters. While Zellweger in a soap opera in the image of the handsome and polite Dr.. Dave Ravell falls in love, idealized Freeman Betty. Sister Betty is a brilliant movie, full of life, humor, love and violence. My grade: 10/10.
