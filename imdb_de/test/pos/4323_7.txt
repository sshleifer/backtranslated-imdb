Woaww Did you first notice the connection between all characters? Of course it's Libby! And for the guy in the hatch with Desmond, some Deja Vu ??? Yes !! He was the "same" guy who gave Sayid money after killing or torturing the other soldiers in the 14th episode of the second season: One of them. In fact, it's not the same guy, it's Joe in the 14th episode, and Kelvin in the last 2 episodes. Twins ?? :) Who knows ?? JJ Abrams ... mmmm I'm not sure :) There are hundreds of such links between all the characters. <br /> <br /> But that was just a response to the comment from Libby. <Br /> <br /> I found these two episodes much more interesting than the entire 2nd season. Throughout the season I felt that there were many things that I have missed, and very few things that I have learned. Especially at the beginning, the first episode of Season 2 is excellent, and then the 2nd is a kind of flashback of the 1st episode ... I found that disappointing, although I'm pretty sure everything in Lost tends to be one Meaning This was just one example of how frustrated I was with seeing these episodes. <br /> <br /> Let's get back to the last two episodes. I think we've learned more new stuff in these two episodes than in the entire season. But all we learn is small pieces for the next puzzle, such as the involvement of Desmond's "relatives" (sorry, if I spoil too much, believe me or do not try not to do it). So many things that have been created in the last 2 seasons are still unclear or have been developed, then nothing. And yet there is new material, as if not all the holes in the picture were enough. Of course we all want to see the big picture, but I think we have to be very patient. I hope there will only be 3 seasons. I'm not sure if I'll see more than 3 seasons anyway. In the last episode there were also many actions. And a good cliffhanger at the very end. <br /> <br /> So basically, I loved the last episode ... and yes, I want to see the third season.
