North and South is a miniseries from the "golden age" of the mini-series of television in the 1980s, in which long epochs with high production values ​​and many star cameos took place. It is largely outstanding for what it is, though I personally prefer the less soap opera-like elements of the story and the overall impression of the story. <br /> <br /> James Read and Patrick Swayze provide excellent performances - especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as a kind of emotional anchor amidst the often melodramatic story. The series also includes world-class works by Kirstie Alley, Wendy Kilbourne, Hal Holbrook, Lewis Smith, Genie Francis, George Stanford Brown and others. The costumes, filming, sets and music are also first class. <br /> <br /> Do not take it as a history lesson, but take it for what it is - a well-made, sweeping epic from a bygone era. Book 2, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but I would advise the audience to skip Book 3, which came out 8 years after Book 2 and was not nearly as good as the first two parts. Although books 1 and 2 are classics, even with their more economical elements, it is worth looking at.
