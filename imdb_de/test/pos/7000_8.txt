Let me waste a moment of your time explaining how I approached this film. 1. I released the trailers because the movie was a non-credible remake of Aliens, which I consider to be one of the weakest movies in the Alien series. Unfortunately, the film continued to quit the film after hearing from positive people I had a positive opinion that I completely missed the show. I was then fascinated by Farscape in the 3rd or 4th season of the time and found Pitch Black around the bed one night - and I said, "Oh, why not, at least it's Claudia Black in there." Soon I recognized Keith David and realized that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why would that surprise me, I do not know). I was fascinated I have been fascinated for four years now. I've just watched the movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. <br /> <br /> This is not an art movie, not an independent, and it is not original, but it does not break much new ground, it manages absolutely, interesting, realistic characters, persistent action in a captivating but simple storyline and to provide continuous entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. Sound too good to be true? Do not take my word for it ... see for yourself. <br /> <br /> The film also highlighted the radiance of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel and introduced the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would later star in the somewhat Riddick ulous chronicles (which I enjoyed, though I recognized his rather big flaws) and is now a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big and so interesting to see, that it's easy to ignore the fact that he's not just a talented actor, but also a smart actor. If you look at the DVD version of Pitch Black with the audio comments, you may be blown away. <br /> <br /> The film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded after a crash on an unknown planet. Landing, where her captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced, but intelligent and heroic (Mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who was surgically altered to see in the dark (diesel) , That's all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited and the inhabitants are hungry. <br /> <br /> As unoriginal and unlikely as that is, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well told and beautifully performed. Do not expect to learn anything, and do not think much about it, but expect fun with this modern science fiction action classic.
