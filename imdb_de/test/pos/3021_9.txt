A blazing and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who is desperately asked by two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber), to give her therapy to Carl Stargher (Vincent D '). Ofornio), a serial killer (used strange and terrible torture tactics) by the authorities in coma. What Novak wants in return for Deane is the whereabouts of Stargher's last victim and whether she lives. Once Deane finds his way into Stargher's mind, whose appearance and atmosphere are reminiscent of a colorful combination of David Lynch's "Dune" or "Blue Velvet" and Wes Craven's "A Nightmare on Elm Street", the adventure begins. Deane sees a plethora of people ranging from Carl as a youngster (a delightful Jake Thomas) to a Freddy Krueger man without the razor claws. I do not want to say the end, but the movie is great overall, apart from the dynamite performances, Howard Shore's scary music and directing (by Tarsem, who shows here he can direct).
