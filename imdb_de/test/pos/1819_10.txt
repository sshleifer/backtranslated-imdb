This gemstone captures the life of the early '80s excellently. As a Degree '83 kid <br /> <br /> I have to say that Valley Girl (along with Fast Times at Ridgemont High) is the class of teen sex movie br /> genre. The characters are exact representatives of the era; The weak mall-chicks, pseudo-punk rebels, neat jocks are all represented here. <br /> <br /> I've seen this over ten times. The music in the movie was first class. Unfortunately, these tunes were never as popular in their era as those of arena cockrockers like Journey, Styx, or Loverboy. Before the soundtrack existed, I sampled records and tapes (after all, it was the 80s!) By Josie Cotton, Sparks, Plimsouls and Modern English. <Br /> <br /> This movie deserves respect. It's not just a good teenage movie from the 80s. It's a great movie. Period.
