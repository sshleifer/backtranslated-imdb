I borrowed this movie last night at the video store. Since it is new and was published here not so long ago, the rent was only overnight. Me, my little sister, and my older brother, who usually does not hate these kinds of movies, sat down and watched. After the movie started and after sitting for a while we all laughed historically. Even my brother. This movie is weird, I actually laughed. No matter how funny some movies are ... even if I find it funny, sometimes I can not laugh. But this movie ... I laughed. My brother thought it was the best movie he had ever seen. I watched the movie about 2 or 3 hours later.
