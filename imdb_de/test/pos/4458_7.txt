If you like Who-Dun-its, you'll like this movie, which is considered the best Italian detective story (Giallo) Fulci made. There are scenes that are meant to disturb anyone. Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was still naked and he would have taken the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest. <br /> <br /> Young boys are missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to be careful to discover the killer. Can you? Do not jump on the first guy, it's way too early and he's too obvious. Anyone who knows Fulci will be able to guess the murderer who died a violent death at the end. What crazy reasoning did he have.
