When I borrowed this movie, I half expected it to be on a small budget, less for Indy movies, but I thought I would try. I started watching Part 1 and was only able to tear myself off after three hours. It was by far one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. From writing to staging, to performances, I laughed, cried, and sang all the way through Nan Astley's rite of passage from innocence to adulthood. Rachael Stirling is phenomenal in this movie. I had never heard of her before, but now I will forever remember the vulnerability and strength I felt in her performance. You, Keeley Hawes, and Jodhi May are unbelievable as they guide you through the emotional turmoil that most feel when engaging in an alternative form of sexuality. The fact that the film takes place in the 1890s not only informs the public about homosexuality during that time, but also makes a statement about our society today. You need to watch this movie, and you probably want to go to the store, like me, to add it to your collection.
