Latcho Drom or Safe Journey is the second film in Tony Gatlif's Roma Trilogy. The film is a visual representation and historical record of Roman life in European and Middle Eastern countries. Although the scenes are mostly planned, rehearsed, and staged, there is no conventional plot, and the dialogue does not explain activities from scene to scene. Instead, the film allows the viewer a glimpse, sometimes a deeper look at these people in different eras and in different countries, including India, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain /> <br /> The importance of music in Roma culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. It is an integral part of any event and an important means of communication. Everything they do is expressed in music. Dance is another important activity. Like Romany music, she specializes and is deeply personal, something that only she understands properly. We get insights into their day-to-day activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. It is a testimony to their culture. It focuses on the music and the dance that created it and made it unique. <br /> <br /> Mr. Gatlif portrays the nomadic groups positively. However, we also experience the rejection, mistrust and alienation that they receive from the non-Romanian population. It seems that the culture they have developed over countless generations and are inspired by different countries will be forgotten because conventional society has no room for nomadic ways. 1983) and Gadjo Dilo (1998).
