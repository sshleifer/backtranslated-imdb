10 respected directors each made a short film with opera arias as inspiration (and music). I do each one individually: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg (you) - Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination in Vienna in 1931. Theresa Russell (Roeg's wife) plays a man! Not bad - very nice and exotic. Russell is great. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - Verdi. No story, but there are some haunting black and white pictures that go perfectly with the music. Jean-Luc Godard - Jean Baptiste Lully. Terribly pointless, boring, no conspiracy, nothing nothing. Filled with superfluous female nudity. The worst! <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - Verdi. Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo, and Anita Morris play a major role in this fun, though obvious, story about a cheating couple. Pretty good. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - Erich Korngold. Short, voluptuous and romantic. Very well. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - Jean-Philippe Rameau. Stumpf. A Yawner. <br /> <br /> Fran Roddam - Richard Wagner. This is what Bridget Fonda has in her film debut. Beautiful love story with a pretty explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - Giacomo Puccini. Really strange, but OK. Derek Jarman - Gustave Chapentier. Lyrical view of youth and age. Very cute. <br /> <br /> The last one is from Bill Bryden playing "I Pagliacci". He has John Hurt (!) Dressed as a clown lip-sync with Caruso (!!!). When this came out, it almost got an X rating (for the luscious nudity and the sex scene). He received an R with a strict warning that the R rating would be widely enforced. After the bombing of the film, this warning disappeared. <br /> <br /> The idea is not bad and 6 of the 10 segments have paid off. Worth seeing, even if you do not like opera. Just avoid the Godard segment. I give an 8.
