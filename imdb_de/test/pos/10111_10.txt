The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost / horror films from the East was grim. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or something similar. <br /> <br /> He is well photographed and the sound is superb. The display on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS capable sound system is recommended. Obviously it's subtitles, so if that scares you off, then I would not care. Dubbing rarely works here and just would not do it. <br /> <br /> It is also really scary, with outstanding performances of a cast unfamiliar to the Western public. I would especially highlight the stepmother who was absolutely brilliant. In the end, you want to look at it again if you can handle it. The plot is inexorable and offers no comforting moments along the way. <br /> <br /> If I have a little criticism, there may be some influence in certain scenes of the Japanese version of The Ring. However, we have for years accepted direct copies of the ideas of other peoples for Western films, and so my point of view is a limited point that did not stop me from giving 10/10. I think most of the fans of this genre will be making a huge "pleasure" out of this movie that I hope is a classic.
