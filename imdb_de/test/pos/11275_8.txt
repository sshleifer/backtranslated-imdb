First of all, this is an art film and also a good movie. I loved the presentation and how it was filmed. Very cool. Certain scenes were some of the more graphic horror sequences I've ever seen. This movie scared me, not because of tension or shock, but because I was scared to death that I would soon see something really REALLY horrible. That happened in some places, but mostly at the beginning. This movie also drew and the 74 minutes seemed to be long. However, if you are interested in film, you need to see this. I have not seen anything like that until today. 8.10
