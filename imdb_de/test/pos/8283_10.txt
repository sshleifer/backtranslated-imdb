This was one of the best movies you could find as a kid. I lived with The Chipmunk Adventure from 4 to 8 years old. The story of this movie was: Dave is on a business trip to Europe and keeps the boys on Miss Miller. In an 80-day video game around the world, two villains, Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister), the Chipmunks and Chipettes play an adventure in which the children have to travel around the world in a hot-air balloon. What they do not know is that the "game" is really a diamond smuggling ring. And if they are found at the airport by the villains, a chase follows! And that ends with Klaus and Claudia in prison and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor in safety with Dave and Miss Miller. But I'm warning you now, this is a musical, damn good one. Most people hate musicals, but I'm not one of those people. I love music like Rocky Horror, Grease, Sound of Music, Cats Do not Dance and just everything (except My Fair Lady). If you see this, share it with your children (if you have one)!
