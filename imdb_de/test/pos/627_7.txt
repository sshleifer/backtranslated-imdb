I've been waiting 9 years to watch this movie just because I never saw it on TV. Finally I got it and it was worth it to wait. It's a lot better than your overheated scream or the rubbish of last summer, because it's all pretty fast, without getting boring and creeping around the house to cheesy music scenes. Only the bad synchronization slows down, but do not let that put you off. What lies underneath - hacked and crap. Mute Witness - low budget, not hyped at all and very good.
