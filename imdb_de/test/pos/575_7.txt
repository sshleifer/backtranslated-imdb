This is a pretty obscure, stupid horror movie that plays Everglades in the 1970s. It's really stupid and lame for the first half, then it actually starts to get well for the last half. There is a scene in which the hero is running to rescue his friends, who are sung by recordings of a church group. I dont know. It is fascinating. I was impressed by the nocturnal scenes because it actually looked like nighttime, unlike most low-budget horror movies that still look like it's daytime. I think the director was really talented, but he worked with a tiny budget and a tough schedule. There are a few scenes towards the end, the ones mentioned above and also the credits, which are extremely cool. This movie could have been a true classic if it had left its Scooby Doo conventions behind and straight down its throat. I was surprised how well this movie turned out. I could not take my eyes off it and I had to ask myself "why?"
