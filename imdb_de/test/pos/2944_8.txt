This movie was entertaining and thought-provoking. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great show, director and Canadian! It's a movie that families and serious movie lovers can enjoy. The places in Ontario evoked such nostalgia for the epoch. With so much garbage and superficial hype sales these days, it's great to see someone supporting an independent film. For any family that has overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financially or ill - this film is a true success! It approaches the idea of ​​the afterlife in a timely fashion, without the costly use of all the "gohst" and supernatural themes that have become an integral part of Hollywood and TV channels.
