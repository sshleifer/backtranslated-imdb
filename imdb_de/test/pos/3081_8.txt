Robin Hood; Men in Tights is well worth seeing, I recently looked at it because I just became a Cary Elwes fan and this is one of its main roles. Some moments left me so hard! I did not expect you to know, it was so funny. The second time you would still fall off your chair. The cast is great, especially Robin by Locksley himself, Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (do not be fooled by the name, it's very tall! Lol) and everyone else! <br /> <br /> Of course, there were some moments when the movie tried to make a comedy scene out of it, but you do not necessarily laugh, .... but OK. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Cary Elwes and Patrick Stewart appeared in a movie together. Both worked on "Lady Jane" in 1986. and it was fun to see her, 7 years later, older, awwww. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth looking at!
