I loved this movie !! Jack Black and Kyle Gass have probably made one of the best comedies since Up in Smoke. This movie has something for everyone: rock, drugs and Satan. What can someone want more? I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to sit back and forget all the worries of the world and laugh well. Even if the movie does not go well in cinemas, it certainly becomes a cult classic. I suggest anyone will record the movie D's first album, since many of the jokes just get funnier when you've heard the songs (like JB's obsession with Sasquatch and the epic fight against the devil) It's guaranteed, laughs, even if you have not heard their music yet, but the songs are so great that you can not miss them.
