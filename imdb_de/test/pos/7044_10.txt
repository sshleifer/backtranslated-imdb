Meatballs works like no other movie in conversations. Especially in summer. Be it the song about the CITs (Counselors In Training) or the cuts or the inspirational speech of Rudy the Rabbit or It Just Does Matter Speech. Poor Mickey / Morty, who knows where he would wake up next ?! A great snapshot of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that non-PC is really fun no matter who you are! Wheels and Spaz are favorites, as well as the hot dog food contest with the famous line "What? No Mustard?" Oh, how many times have I repeated this line and was the only one who laughed! Many thanks to the authors, actors and directors! Cheers, applause!
