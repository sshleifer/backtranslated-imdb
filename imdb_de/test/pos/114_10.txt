I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece. I would recommend to buy this movie on DVD as it is a movie you would like to see more often than once. And believe me, you would still find small meaningful details after looking at it several times. <br /> <br /> The characters - except maybe the grandmother - are all very balanced, not black and white. Although you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists, there is also empathy for the other characters. <br /> <br /> I think the IMDb rating for the movie is way too low - probably due to its politically contentious content.
