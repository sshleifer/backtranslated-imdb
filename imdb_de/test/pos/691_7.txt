If you are in the midst of a cruel war and it is still unclear that you will be at the top, it is important, among other things, to uphold the morale of the civilians ... to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery, ingenuity and have the dedication to overcome all odds of a noble cause. And that's exactly what director Anthony Asquith provided to the British with the War War movie We Dive at Dawn in 1943. After more than 60 years, it is not surprising that the film is partially outdated. It does not help that the class stereotypes that help define the men registered by the officers can be terrible. As in so many other British war films, the men invariably have strong regional accents of the working class, while the officers speak with an educated fluidity that would make them at home in the best English ruling classes. In this movie Freddie Taylor (John Mills), the submarine captain of Sea Tiger, is smart, self-confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with his men, humorous with peers, and can make quick decisions. And it helps that he is lucky. His men are mostly jolly tar, competent in their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense. Although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these folks on vacation, things get tense soon afterwards. <br /> <br /> Taylor and his submarine are to destroy the Brandenburg German warship. They only miss the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and travels to the Baltic Sea. Taylor estimates the risks and decides that the Sea Tiger will be tracked through minefields, anti-subnets and with the real risk that it will not have enough fuel to return to its home base. After several tense situations the confrontation takes place. The Sea Tiger unleashes six torpedoes but has to dive without knowing if it has done its job. After a clever deception, Taylor outwitted some German destroyers, but found that not enough fuel was available. He plans to sink his submarine and surrender when James Hobson (Eric Portman), a sailor who was grumpy and a loner and speaks German, just at the last moment states that there is a small Danish coastal village that Fuel was depot. He thinks it could still be for the Germans. The final third of the film is a rousing action sequence as the submarine's crew tries to stop the Germans from pumping enough fuel to bring the Sea Tiger to the UK. This is a war propaganda movie, so do not expect any failure. And did the sea-tiger actually put down the Branden? Are the men reunited with their wives and lovers? Did Hobson reconcile with his wife and son, who made him smile? Did Freddie Taylor finally have the chance to use all those female names in his little black book? You have to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, like Powells and Pressburger One of our planes missing and The 49th Parallel, can still see each other today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators did not use obvious clichés. Others, like We Dive at Dawn, had enough clichés that when we looked at them we had to remember how dark the time was when the movie was filmed. Nevertheless, Asquith can build a lot of tension with a few clichés. The sea turtle pushing through a subnet was tense. The stalking of the Brandenburgers and the conspiracy necessary for the torpedo shot were realistic. John Mills no-nonsense attitude, while preparing for an attack, was treated well. The fake preparations to make the Sea Tiger appear as if it had been destroyed by deep raids were as realistic as might be expected both inside and outside the submarine, and the battle for the tank farm was dramatic and exciting , We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war movie, but it's a well done, well-done example of its type and time. <br /> <br /> John Mills had a long, long career. Especially in the fifties he played in a series of serious films that looked at the time of the Second World War. He had the ability to show resentment, cheerfulness, and perseverance, but also to be trustworthy, a man could be proud of England while he was at war. The best actor in this movie was Eric Portman, a good actor with a unique voice and the ability to make looks so cold you want to wear a sweater. Everyone in the submarine is joking, but stiff on the upper lip, but Portman creates some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman have done a good job on this film.
