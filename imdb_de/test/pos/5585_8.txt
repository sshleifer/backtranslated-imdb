I saw this movie as a kid about 30 years ago and have not forgotten it until today. I can not say if it's a good picture. But at that time, I immediately fell in love with Jean Simmons. The memories focus on the very erotic feeling of the film, but I still remember the plot. Simmons was still very young at the time and there is another film that gave me the same feeling: David Lean's GREAT EXPECTATIONS. And again it was the young Jean Simmons. Too bad that BLUE LAGOON is not available on video. I want to correct my memories ...
