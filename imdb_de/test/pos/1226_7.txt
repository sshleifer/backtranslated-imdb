This film is about six men charged with transporting money from bank to company. Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for the war that serves his country. Now he's helped earn a living by making sure his friend Mike Cochrone (Matt Dillon) does not lose his house. Mike tells him that this was not the life his parents expected him to do, and he should lead a better life than he does now with his brother Jimmy Hackett (Andre Kinney). Ty tells Ty that he and Jimmy have always been a family for him and would do anything to help them. Mike tells Ty about a plan to raid. The money would be around 43 million, divided into six different ways between the other transport men, although Ty does not like the idea he's telling his friend Mike as long as nobody gets hurt in which he would be. Last night, Ty had to talk to him about a charity lady who puts his brother into foster care and gives him the dilemma of losing what's most important in his life. Although the plan sounds safe at first glance, greed is not everything when it comes to taking human lives. <br /> <br /> When it comes to raids, you're either inside or out, so if you do not have one, it's hard to play the hero and stop greedy people when it comes to big sums of money. This film is cast with stars to star in with Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne, Amaury Nolasco, Fred Ward, Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia. In short, I just remembered him in "Stomp the Yard," which was about a kid who lost his brother and lives his dream of going to college. This was probably one of his best films I saw him in, and in this movie he fits so well with him that it's great to see him in action again on the big screen.
