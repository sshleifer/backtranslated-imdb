Although it was dark and oppressive and sometimes difficult to observe, You Are Alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialogue. It has really captured the fear of romantic teenage relationships. In addition, the soundtrack was amazing. The lyrics and tone of the songs added so much to the sadness of the movie that you wondered if the tracks were created specifically for the movie. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl is the best actress I have ever met. Her convincing and credible performance made the film. I wondered if she really is a prostitute. Who knows. The movie was definitely worth seeing. LOVE, YOUR SISTER! Yes that's right....
