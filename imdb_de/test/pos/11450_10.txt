I neglected this movie when I went to the movie store, but then I became curious and decided to give it a try. I loved it!!! The film begins with Judy and Jay on their way to a Halloween party at the abandoned funeral home Hull House. Then we meet some characters, Angela and Suzzanne (the hosts), Frannie, Max, Rodger, Sal and Helen. Then, of course, they start celebrating and when they are really in the mood, they decide on a s√©ance that wakes up a demon. The demon owns Angela and she begins the cruel slaughter. Will they survive the night of the demons? <br /> <br /> The movie was great overall. The blood was fine, but the nakedness provided by Linnea Quigley (Trash from ROTLD) put it off again. I have never been a fan of her and never will be.
