During the short period between Clint Eastwood's Western Spaghetti series and his Dirty Harry movies, he and director Don Siegel made this unusual image. Eastwood plays a wounded Union Army corporal during the Civil War, who is picked up by a southern girls' school until he recovers from his wounds. It has been a while since the young women (most of whom seem to be teenagers) had a husband on the premises. Therefore, they hesitate to let him to the local rebels. The resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic, or even downright grotesque, as Eastwood slowly regains his strength and begins to ponder the establishment. We have a male man who is suddenly surrounded by young, naked women. Most of them are sexually attracted to him. And he is more than willing to spread the love among them. However, the material never really slips to the level of "tasteless". Eastwood, Siegel and cinematographer Bruce Surtees are such talented filmmakers that the film always retains its dignity. <br /> <br /> John McBurney of Eastwood is like no other character he has ever played. McBurney is an amoral, compassionate and lustful charlatan. He knows that most women, even the youngest, want his body, and he lets more than one of them shoot him. McBurney often uses flattery to lubricate women, and then uses it with its sturdy look. He's like a drunken player at a cocktail party and often meets different women, even in the same scene! In the end, his lustful ways cause great agony and loss in ways that you have to see for yourself. This author would not dream to reveal the specific consequences of his actions, but there is little doubt that he will let them come. <br /> <br /> Eastwood offers a typically great performance. He seems to enjoy the role until things get really ugly, then he becomes mean and ugly. Geraldine Page is a treat for a steely bachelor who runs the school. We know she wants McBurney as much as the other girls, but with her eventful past shown to us in flashbacks, we find she has not gotten it all over! Mae Mercer as a slave to the school also offers an excellent performance. She knows, of course, that McBurney is a skunk from the beginning, and she never allows her fake charm to diminish her alertness. This is a character that you want to know more about after the movie ends. She seems to have a greater knowledge of the world than anyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> The Beguiled has been working poorly on his movie release. No one was quite sure what to think of it, and no doubt part of the content raised some eyebrows in 1971. For example, in an early scene, we see Eastwood kissing a 12-year-old girl romantically. Is he just trying to keep her quiet when the rebels get close, or is he really enjoying it? Probably both! A fantasy sequence later even shows that Clint is not only doing it with Page, but also with her young assistant! Really some interesting events in this. It's a good thing Eastwood became the star he made, or could have forgotten. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
