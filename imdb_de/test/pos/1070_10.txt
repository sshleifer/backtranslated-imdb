This Christmas present has arrived by courtesy of TCM. We had never seen the movie before, even though we saw most of the films by Barbara Stanwyck. This comedy made us laugh so much that sometimes we had to hold back to hear the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially in the Christmas environment. It would certainly lift the mood if you just let go. The film would be a perfect gift in the form of a DVD or a VHS cassette. <br /> <br /> "Christmas in Connecticut" was conducted with great verve by Peter Godfrey, based on a story by Aileen Hamilton. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the successful combination of two of the most popular stars of the time: Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck always played strong-willed women, obviously this was a tempo change for them. In this movie, as well as "Lady Eve," Mrs. Stanwyck shows a knack for the comedy. She and Mr. Morgan, who have starred in many musical comedies, make a successful combination. <br /> <br /> There are no weak performances in the film. Sydney Greenstreet, an actor known for "Heavies," is a joy to see as rich and fat Alexander Yardley, the man who had a media empire and knew a good cause when he saw it. Reginald Gardiner, an accomplished English actor, gives the star casting behind the two main characters shine. Z. Sakall is another source of constant joy. He plays the Hungarian chef Felix, who has a hard time with his own version of the English language. In addition, Una O'Connor makes a perfect Norah, the housekeeper of Sloan Farm in Connecticut. <br /> <br /> If you read other comments in this forum, it is sad to learn that the magnificent black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people. After all, color was not widely used in the 1940s, and most classic films have to be seen in their original format, because what would be achieved by "coloring" them? <br /> <br /> This film should be A must for anyone who wants to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun during the Christmas season, because total happiness is guaranteed. Look at it with open heart and heart and maybe you would like to see "Christmas in Connecticut" every year.
