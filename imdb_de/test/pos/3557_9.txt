I'm sick of the sitcoms; You feel that you always know what's coming, and it stops being funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what's coming and it laughs out loud. I have just bought the second set of the series (series 3 -4) and am amazed how much I like it again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many invisible crewmembers) because the entertainment they offer is worth the wait. The gems that come from this series and the respect that the actors have earned speak for themselves. Croft and Perry created pure gold, some of which shine through Hi De Hi.
