I really love this movie !!! I did not play Final Fantasy VII, but I still loved the movie, it's really funny and I love the work the voice-over actors did. The visuals are SO fantastic and all the lines are so well done. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have a pretty good idea, so I was able to fill in most of the gaps the movie presented and I suggest you watch it twice, because many things are "suddenly" Make sense. <br /> <br /> Also (which is pretty funny), you should watch it with the subtitles, because what they say and what the subs say are sometimes completely different. It's usually pretty funny, but sometimes it helps you understand what they say better. <br /> <br /> See it !!! Dear Marnie
