In September 2000 I saw Nurse Betty twice at the International Film Festival "Films by the Sea" in Vlissingen, the Netherlands. I was so impressed that I kept smiling all day long after seeing it for the first time and most of the evening when I accepted the film as the festival's last taste. What I knew about 'Nurse Betty' was, in a nutshell, that Renée Zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap opera star. But what I saw was much more than that! Gorgeous roles for Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock and Renée Zellweger. A strange mixture of romance, violence and road movie. And for everyone, a story that takes different directions every moment, if you think you're on the trail. Many lovers of soap operas will love 'Nurse betty' - both the movie and the character !!! - but they can bring all the non-soap lovers, because they will enjoy the story even more because of the hard and humorous lines - Freeman and Rock - for the cruel scenes, the thriller aspects and the beautiful pictures. And I'm pretty sure that in the end every "nurse betty" will love for her charming and innocent charm !!!
