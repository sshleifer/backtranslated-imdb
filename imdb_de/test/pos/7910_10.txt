Finally, I discovered what I remembered as a four-year-old. After watching the color version of 1960's on the VHS, I kept saying, I remember seeing them twice in black and white. Now the IMDb has helped me to find out the truth that in two successful years, 1955 and 56, it has been broadcast twice (two productions) in black and white. I remember that best when I was four years old. I did not know that the 56 broadcast was not the same as the 55. I was 9 years old in 1960 and the color production just did not do that for me. The black and white version was wonderful, just as impressive as today's high-tech films, even without computer effects. You must have been there! Please comment if you had a similar reaction to the black and white version.
