and I think that's a good thing. I've never been a Rosalind Russell fan, even though the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and was thrilled to hear that she did this. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the production, I think that was a bit less than the original movie. One of my favorite minor characters in the original was Mazeppa. Her scratchy fingernails on the board sounded, "HEY! It takes much more than no talent to be a Strippah!" and although I missed it, I was glad to see that the producers had the courage not to make a copy. <br /> <br /> I also liked the fact that there are big parts of this movie that were filmed as if they were you. When you look at a stage, you do not feel like you're in the theater only in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I think the other thing that I liked about this production was that there was a little less repetition in the song "Let me entertain you" that gets annoying after about the fifth time, though you hear it.
