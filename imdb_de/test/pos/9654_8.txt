Philippe Garrel lets us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the Nouvelle Vague, almost lost among the remnants of its old splendor, but ready to rise again from the ashes, remembering the past. Those who are a little familiar with the director's subjects might well know how obsessed he is with a perpetual loss of feeling about the impermanence of reality. "Les amants réguliers" shows us the parallel stories of an "Amour Fou" and an attempted revolution, which was ruined under the guidance of young French students. The first part of the story is about the dramatic events of May '68 in France, which are evoked in a series of amazing sequence sequences, a kind of Cinema Verité style that places the student uprising in something other than an enviable light against a pitch-black background. <br /> <There is much to say about the peculiarities of black and white photography, which describes the struggle between students and the police, where the high contrasts give the sequences an unrealistic atmosphere and the excited bodies that surround them to be seized by darkness in secret. The completely wordless images show the real steadfastness of the myth of brute force, which is increasingly highlighted by the annoying reality of filming. The individual does not count anything here: he tends to disappear in the crowd. What really counts in these battle scenes is the importance of the mass suggestion, the blind rage of youthful assault, sinister eulogy of the power of the mob, even though they are designed independently of any kind of emotion, with the cold and with every kind of emotion Entomologist intending to catalog his insect collection. <br /> <br /> The second part of the story is described in a quieter and most intimate way. On the horizon stands the shattering portrait of a selfish generation in search of their lost time, utterly disappointed with the individual values ​​of the people who turn their own axis between opium vapors and want to eulogize Last defeat. <br /> <br /> "Les amants réguliers" seems to evoke from time to time the shadow of the great Robert Bresson, reworked and corrected by Garrel's special sensitivity, without turning away from the main argument and expanding in general perspectives on human disappointment that can painfully lead us to the truth. If I try to penetrate deeply into the underground of history, if he lets himself go and play things with his ear, in my opinion he will probably find that he can produce the dark sides of his self with dire and irretrievable consequences.
