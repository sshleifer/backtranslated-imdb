I would expect that film to get rave reviews in Canada - especially in Quebec. That's because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey, and the Canadians of Montreal have been like gods in Canada for decades. As Americans, the New York Yankees are closest to us. If you are a fan, then you are the best and most successful team in history. If you are not a fan, then you are Satan's team !! Well, at least that's how it was when I grew up with the Dallas Cowboys in Washington, DC. I was pretty sure when this film was shown in the North that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction - their national sport AND what they come closest to a national team in the NHL. Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it starts, and the main character talks about growing up in Ottawa and rummaging for the Canadian AND Maurice "The Rocket" Richard. When his mother accidentally bought him a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey and forced him to wear it, I immediately knew what a terrible and shameful thing this would be for a little boy. This ability to connect with the character - even though he lives in a faraway country - makes him a very special short film. The way the other children treated him and his conversation with God in the end make this movie a beautiful nostalgic movie. Very clever and memorable.
