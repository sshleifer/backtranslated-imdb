I'm the first to realize that Chan-wook Park's thirst is exceptionally good, but spending more than two hours with Tae-joo (OK-vin Kim) is enough for anyone he tolerates for so long , Sang-hyeon (Kang-ho Song) is a priest who volunteers to volunteer to conduct experimental studies of those undergoing severe injections for a specific virus that kills infectiously. Instead of dying legitimately, Hyeon becomes a vampire and always craves for the sustaining blood, which causes him to fend off an infectious disease that recurs, causing the symptoms that plague him to begin (bumps / wounds , and the body vomits blood). Sunlight, as known from the vampire genre, causes a painful death if left exposed to Hyeon for extended periods of time. Hyeon falls in love with Tae-joo, the wife of sick childhood friend Kang-woo (Ha-kyun Shin). Tae-joo was taken by Ms. Ra (Hae-sook Kim), who was considered a puppy and was practically used as a pet to be ranged in the area. Ta-joo is unhappy in this situation and begins a fierce affair that incites her to Hyeon. He soon manipulates him to kill Kang-woo by believing he is an abuse victim. Hyeon renounces his priesthood and dives into the relationship with Tae-joo who is soon ready to kill Kang-woo. This incident to which Tae-woo contributed (a boat in the middle of a lake buried him both underwater.) Tae-woo prevented him from reappearing kang-woo when he tried to reenter.) Both will as circumstances occur in which Kang-woo is "missed" (Hyeon was released, where the police would not find his body). Soon, Ms. Ra suffers a stroke (though, a finger and the ability to blink her eyes adds significantly to her being more aware than she thinks), and Hyeon pays Tae-joo special birthday present .. vampirism. Hyeon created a monster. Tae-joo admits (... though tongue failure) that Kang-woo never hurt her, and as she thirsts for blood, it quickly becomes clear that killing for a supply does not bother her morally or psychologically. Tae-joo is such a handful, Hyeon must take desperate measures to stop such a threat to society, including himself. <br /> <br /> I'll say thirst is one of the best horror movies I've had. I've seen it in relation to 2009. It is a methodical approach that follows Park, and we are being led down a dark street with Hyeon and Tae-joo, as they are doing terrible deeds and bringing nothing positive out of their unholy union. Innocent people die for Tae-joo because of Hyaeon's love (which once turned lust into an obsessive love) and it stops ending if he makes no painful decision. We look into their heads, into their souls, and it's not always pretty. 2 hours with them can be quite exhausting, but it is thanks to the director that he has made no effort in terms of sneaky behavior and how the vampiric forces can be given to the wrong people. Hyeon, at the opening a very pleasant soul, accepts "hell" for Tae-joo, so Thirst could be considered a unique love story, but not exactly healthy. <br /> <br /> In terms of violence, while Park has a tendency to break away from extremely graphic details, enough sadism is involved, perhaps to turn the stomach a bit. At least the way the violence is carried out can certainly leave a lasting effect. The sexual situations between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be quite heated and erotic, while they are also dirty and morally reprehensible. I think the movie is still a rather complex exploration of the lengths you get attached to an object of affection (lust).
