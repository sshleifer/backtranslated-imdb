Film historians have said a lot about ancient epics that many directors have been interested in since the beginning of cinema. The pioneers of such epics, especially the biblical ones, were D. W. Griffith with his "Mother of All Epics" INTOLERANCE (1916) and Cecil B. DeMille with his flair for great plays, costumes and lavish scenes. Who can forget his TEN SURVEYS (1923, 1956) or THE SIGN OF THE CROSS (1932)? Nevertheless, here comes another epic from the fifties, which was staged by Michael Curtiz and based on the novel by Mika Waltari, "The Egyptian". Michael Curtiz, known for his great classic CASABLANCA (1941), manages to wonderfully adapt his film to the audience at the time, bringing along the most important ideas and facts from the thick novel and recreating the lifestyle of the Egyptians who lived there. One of the most amazing times in the reign of Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> The first and most important fact in this film for me is the psychological development of the main character Edmund Purdom plays. Sinuhe, who was educated by his stepparents in a simple family, becomes a doctor. He never stops asking a question all his life, "Why?" and look for the answer. The tantalizing love he finds in a courtesan Nefer (Bella Darvi) leads him to a financial and spiritual disaster. He needs to fix the mistakes through hard work in the House of Death and build his reputation out of nowhere. First, he thinks the only cure is revenge. In the long run, however, he realizes that "eye for eye" is not a solution. What stands before him in very strange circumstances is, after all, the temptation to be a pharaoh. Nevertheless, there is a moment when he finds the answer to his questions that have touched him all his life ... The story of the main character, although based on the book, is psychologically so interesting that every open-minded person has that aspect in the movie. The psychological struggle of the main character is intensified by the times in which he lived, the times when - probably for the first time to this extent - the power of the sword collides with the power of thought. Even Curtiz's film is preserved A rule that all films of his time have kept: great cast and lavish sets. There are mainly British actors and actresses who give very nice performances. How can you not mention the mainstay of the ancient epic Victor Mature? This time he is not Demetrius, Hannibal or Samson, but Horemheb - a fighter, a lover, finally a pharaoh. Jean Simmons appears in a very delicate role of Merit, a woman who loved Sinuhe all her life, but it was too late when he noticed. Peter Ustinov, probably famous for his great performance as Nero in QUO VADIS? Three years ago, he does a good job as Kaptah, Sinuen's friend. The film's licensing fee is also being played by two great actors, Gene Tierney and Michael Wilding. Tierney is excellent as cold, yearning for Baketamon, Pharaoh's sister. Wilding gives a wonderful performance as a "crazy" Akhnaton. When I was in the Louvre in Paris and saw Akhnaton's original stone-carved face, he looked exactly like the actor in the movie. Bella Darvi, a Polish-born actress, is quite memorable as the evil courtesan Nefer. And there is another actress who appears only in a scene that is hard to forget, Judith Evelyn as Taia, Pharaoh's mother. That voice, those eyes! <br /> <br /> The sets are great. The director restored the most likely image of the outer temple of Aaton, the god whom the Egyptians worshiped under Amenhotep IV. I also loved the scene of Pharaoh's first entry. What a wonderful picture that will be remembered forever !!! However, there is one aspect that I would like to draw attention to anyone who wants to see the movie. The Egyptian resembles other epics in many ways, but is also characterized by a unique film. There are very few films in which different curiosities are so wonderfully used as in ancient times. Iron is first mentioned by the Hittites. It is also the only film about ancient Egypt that speaks openly about the great healing abilities of the Egyptians. It shows in a memorable way the contrasts of lifestyles, in particular the moment of the death of a slave whom nobody cares about, followed by the announcement and consequently the widespread mourning after the Pharaoh's death. Finally, "The Egyptian" shows a historical fact: There were other nations besides Jews (before Christ) in whom the Spirit of God shone in some human hearts. The only difference, however, was that it did not survive as long as the Jews because it had no strong foundation. The scene of Akhnaton's death provides you with so many biblical and Christian values ​​that you believe you see a religious movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, I recommend the movie by Michael Curtiz. It's a great production on several levels: a conversation for epic fans, an admiration of fantastic performances for movie fans, a spiritual festival for spiritual people. After all, it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things that happened thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.
