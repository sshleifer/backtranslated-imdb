I saw SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival in Providence. It was the featured film of the festival and won the best picture of a few hundred submissions. The director and some of the stars answered questions about the show. One star, Suzy Lorraine, was personally even hotter than in the movie and she was an eye-catcher in the movie. <br /> <br /> This film is independent, but it has many cinematic accents a quality feel. It even has an original music note in the classic style. <br /> <br /> I'm a Savini fan and he's the star villain here in the black cloak. He is more of a bad force than a real person, I think. He sucks the souls from the people and uses them as soldiers to establish his version of the kingdom of God on earth. In his opinion, Christ was all about suffering, and Savini wants everyone to suffer. <br /> <br /> The main story that interests you concerns a young doctor, Stefan, who is sent to investigate the strange events caused by Savini in a remote city. He suggests an aristocratic chick on the way, but their SOB father challenges him to get lost. Then he meets a strangely obsessed but seductive country girl. I think she falls in love with him, but she also tries to kill him, as well as a number of hot women in the movie. <br /> <br /> I found the scenes shot in the forest the scariest and most eye-catching, with strangers along the street (the evil little twin girls scared hell out of me). <br /> <br /> The movie has too much to offer. There is a lot of blood, torture and blood. Hot chicks lick blood from the guys' fingers. A scared girl's head explodes. That was unexpected. Throat gets slits. Some brutal stitches. <br /> <br /> Sometimes they make it laugh and have fun with the whole evil Black Forest genre. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Hammer films and Ingrid Pitt, it's fascinating to see them in this movie. She releases one of the lines by pushing a cross into his skull. Excellent. The man who played "Multiple Miggs" in silence of the lambs is great in an ax fight. <br /> <br /> The movie is surreal and with the end I am not sure if the events happened or if they were there Stefan's head because of his rejection of his fiancee. He returns in retaliation and this scene is brutal. <br /> <br /> The director also talked about religion being abused to support wars and murders. I'm sure Savini's view of religion was scary. <br /> <br /> This was a weird extravaganza with some stars like Savini and Pitt, a lot of good supporting actors, including hot babes, great gore scenes, action and all the time asking yourself what the hell is going on and what will happen next. <br /> <br /> That deserves ten stars because it's an excellent independent movie, I do not think the budget was low, but it had to be a lot less than a big studio budget, and yet they managed to do something really attractive, Creating something unique and stimulating thought.
