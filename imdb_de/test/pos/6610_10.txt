In the mid-1970s, a crazy bunch of young Venice, Californian teenagers from broken houses and the bad side of the city known as the Z-Boys, broke with their fierce punk attitude, radical unconventional riding, the hitherto more serious world of professionalism Skateboards style and unbridled spirit of pure aggression in your face that revolutionize the sport and pave the way for the many extreme variations of the sport that emerged in their influential direction. Director Stacy Peralta, who is himself one of the legendary Z-Boys, narrates the incredible achievements of this amazing Ragtag crew in a forceful and visceral manner that is both informative and wildly entertaining: the snappy rapid-fire editing, the unremittingly fast pace, and rough The stubborn photography delivers an incredible, infectious kinetic buzz and projects a sense of pure joy and full of vibrant energy that is an absolute pleasure to behold. Better yet, this documentary does not rehabilitate his motives nor romanticize them: these harsh boys were so fiercely fought over and on their own that they all went their separate ways as the lure of fame and fortune manifested in their lives. The ultimate destiny of certain guys is poignant and heartbreaking.

The other guys are very colorful and sympathetic. charismatic ball of cheeky and defiant fire Tony Alva acts primarily as an arrogant, but impressive piece of angry assertive work. Wonderfully narrated by Sean Penn with awesome easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance. The terrific rock soundtrack also smokes seriously. But what really makes this documentary such a winner is its refreshing sense of pretension: it's just as dynamic, ebullient and larger than life as the gloriously revolting Z-Boys themselves.
