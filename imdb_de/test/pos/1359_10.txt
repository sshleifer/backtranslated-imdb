Someone says this anime could be offensive to girls ... not really. Embarrassing situations are funny; The first time I saw this series, I was in the video library. The people around me have begun to laugh no matter how old or gender they are. A teacher said to ensure a person's attention in a book, the beginning must be entertaining and the ending should not be obvious by reading the last page. In the first few minutes of the series, the boy is hit by a car, in the last moments of the series appears the same car. The episodes had a touching and funny ending, especially the last one. I do not regret buying this series.
