Clint Eastwood scores in this 1993 thriller. With an absolute seat edge master, Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood delivers as he can. What Rene Russo regards as Clint's love interest, I think, said Kirk Douglas best when he said He himself said, "I'm getting older and my lead actor is getting younger and younger." very effective thriller with enough twists and surprises to keep you going. Eastwood and Peterson should team up more often. First class movie.
