I first saw Robin Hood: Men in Tights in the movies in 1994. I looked at it because I always liked Robin Hood and I saw the trailer for this movie. I found it funny. After watching the movie, I have to say it was even better than I thought. It's not only very funny, it's also a very well done movie with beautiful sets and costumes and a very nice score by Hummie Mann. Acting in the film is also good, Cary Elwes is funny as Robin Hood and Tracey Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, David Chapelle, Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks. But the best part of the movie is played by Roger Rees as the evil sheriff of Rottingham. He has the best scenes in the movie and also the best dialogue ("King illegal forest to kill wild killing in it", which means "It's illegal to kill a wild pig in the king's forest"). He somehow mixes up all the words and utters a sentence that nobody understands. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is one of the best Mel Brooks movies in my book, and I can not say I laughed so much about a movie like this one. It's just a constant laugh.
