Man, I never laugh so much this year and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. While I was expecting a movie in the hostel-style, the smile came to me from the beginning to face. This movie inside film features a woman who was stabbed to death when she messed up the whole set until she finally "dies." Her exaggerating trick, which drives the directors crazy, and his funny reaction, tell us the audience that Mute Witness is not a typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> The main character, the dumb American make-up artist Billy Hughes, is played by the beautiful but talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. Your performance is first class; Her character can not speak, so the body language and the emotions in her face have to be compensated. And, oh man, she did a wonderful job. Her sister (Fay Ripley) is the girlfriend or the fianc√© or the wife of the "In-Film Director" (Evan Richards). They were both very funny most of the time. I will not spoil anymore, but the scenes after the bath time, with them two, the fake policeman and later the angry neighbor, were simply brilliant black comedy. The plot may be misleading towards the end in a certain moment. But do not worry. Such a delicious movie can be seen in the family or with your friend.
