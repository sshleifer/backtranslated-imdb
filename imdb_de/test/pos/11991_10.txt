I have no idea why everyone hates this movie because it calls garbage a travesty. An unsurpassed sequel is just unfair. I mean, what else could she have done for a sequel? Because seriously, I think it should have had a sequel (Rodney Dangerfield) says: Hey, everyone was all put down and then a little dancing Goffer. and the second one was (PG), it was still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
