A bus takes a nameless man off to a run-down Standard Oil service station in the middle of nowhere. We never know where the bus is coming from, why it is driving or who it is. Why is he the only passenger? Is he a prisoner? Is he the "annoying man" referred to in the title of the film? Did he die and go to heaven or hell? Like our man, we have no chance to stop and ask. He is received by a kind of gatekeeper and taken to a nondescript city. From day one, all decisions are made for him. An apartment was rented, a job found, an office assigned. In fact, his life is not completely dissimilar to life in the virtual reality of company cabins and suburban condos. Women are heartless, dinner parties are cumbersome, office jobs are shit. But some parts do not fit in the puzzle. Silently efficient, gray-clad thugs roam the streets. Is it a kind of paramedic or the secret police? And why are there no children? Is the story even in the real world? Whenever we believe we get answers, new secrets are discovered. "The Bothersome Man" makes you half relieved that it's over and wants half more. I hope you can make it into a computer game soon.
