This is actually the first movie I've ever seen in a theater where people did not leave immediately when the credits started. Instead, they sat for a few minutes, gaping open-mouthed, staring at the infinite, trying to understand what they had just seen. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say: Try to watch the movie with as little knowledge as possible (me too)! I gave it a 10
