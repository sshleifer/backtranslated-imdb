It's really nice to see that Van Damme's film has been getting better and better lately, and especially compared to the floppies of the C class "Derailed" and "Second in command", both of which were tragic and not in a good way Way were. The Sheperd: Border Patrol is a good action movie with some really great action / combat sequences. It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to see him, since his last movie "To Death" had no martial arts at all !!! <br /> <br /> But if you say that this film is clearly inferior to the film "To the death" was a really good turn for Van Damme. "To the death" lacked the towering action of most Van Damme films, but was dark and bleak and Van Damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in this film. Nevertheless, The Shepherd is definitely a movie, which pays off especially for Van Damme fans or generally for action movie fans. However, if you are looking for a movie with more story, you should skip this movie! <br /> <br /> I really think that this movie was done well enough, especially with what budget. The only real problem I have with this movie is the title. "The shepherd"? I do not understand it I think "Border Patrol" just does not have the same sound without the word "Shepherd" !!! <br /> <br /> My rating for this film is 7 out of 10, but that's past Van Damme movie standards, which are not included in any other movie category. <br /> <br /> ie It's good for a Van Damme movie.
