I can remember how I saw this movie when I was very young and several times on TV. I always liked it. I noticed on the deduction shown on local television that one scene reversed the movie. It is the place where they hide behind the ledge (it looks like Vasquez Rocks near Los Angeles) and watch the Indians go by. If you look closely, you will find that suddenly all soldiers are left-handed! It's just a short section, and I have to admit that it took me years to do it. <br /> <br /> As far as history is concerned, there were often expeditions to rescue white prisoners from the Indians. The direct link to the final battle scene is the Battle of Beecher's Island. In this action, a group of volunteer boy scouts equipped with repeating carbines (Spencer carbine, not Winchester) were surprised by the Indians and retreated to an island and held several charges. At the last indictment, they killed Roman Nose, one of the more famous Indian chiefs. I have no idea if the script writer had this in mind, but it fits in pretty well. <br /> <br /> There are several Guy Madison movies that I hope will one day be released on DVD and this is one of them.
