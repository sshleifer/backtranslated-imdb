After a few years of searching for the Humphrey Bogart movie "Two Against the World," he unexpectedly appeared as a TCM offering titled "One Fatal Hour," a First National movie from 1936. Bogey's character is Sherry Scott, the man who runs WUBC, a radio station whose program is losing its listeners. The owner Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass) is a pathetic leader who sets the shots at the station, but hides behind his decisions by pledging them to Scott. <br /> <br /> In an effort to empower the audience, Reynolds has the idea to revive a twenty-year-old murder case and offer it as a fifteen chapter radio play. Scott asks for help from dr. Martin Leavenworth (Harry Hayden) to write the piece and present it in the air. The case of Pembroke Murder concerned a woman who was acquitted when she murdered her husband, who were not made clear. However, Gloria Pembroke has married and now lives as Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and her daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is close to being on the same day as the radio play the Identity of Gloria Pembroke). Martha and Jim Carstairs are about to face the devastating effects of this revelation and begin a crusade to stop the program. At the same time, Edith's future in-laws respond with the demand that the marriage does not take place. <br /> <br /> Without showing the end result, the movie takes a devastating turn to shake the viewer. Edith Carstairs confronts the heads of the radio station and admonishes Scott and the snarling Reynolds urgently. Scott accepted his share of the blame for the result and partially disbanded himself by giving up his job, firing his secretary and pulling her out of the office. She recognized her for the conscience he once had. With a completely abrupt departure, the film leaves one as confused and unsettled as any movie that has no happy ending. <br /> <br /> With about a dozen films under its belt, Humphrey Bogart gets the chance to focus on fascinating results. Without having a name to support the players, Bogey embraces this opportunity by assuming responsibility for the radio stations and performing the show as if it were his own. In an interesting characteristic, he expresses his despair by clasping his hands in front of his tilted head and getting half a dozen years older. A similar effect we see in "Casablanca". For Bogart fans, catching an unexpected nuance like this is a real surprise.
