Low-budget, but memorable wannabes who instead emerge as a theater of the bizarre. The vulnerable, naive nurse, Charlotte Beale, arrives in a secluded mental hospital and does not know that the only healthy people were murdered despite the red flags that are constantly attached around them. <br /> <br /> The lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers more than just a sense of style and a bunch of crazy characters. The pleasures of this movie do not come from the rather tame shocks of the movie, but from the comic atmosphere. First, we have the madman who thinks that her baby doll is real. There's also an ax murder judge, a shocked war veteran, and old Mrs. Callahan is like the old grandmother of all who is amok. A young patient named Allyson gives the term "nymphomania" a new meaning. A tall man named Sam is a bit slow after a botched lobotomy, and Jennifer suddenly bulges between catatonia and violent outbursts. The only other sentient person in the place seems to Dr. Masters, but does she have a secret? <br /> <br /> "Do not look in the basement" is a great example of inexpensive commercials. There is not much plot, but the movie is cheap. Several performers show memorable performances, notably Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick, and the way the director adds small, crazy details to the film can really stay with you. <br /> <br /> The scene between Allyson and the telephone operator "is a classic for all time, and particularly delicious are the facial expressions of Dr. Masters, as she goes over the edge near the end of the film Brownrigg also uses the cheap soundtrack very good, different musical cues are really reminiscent of the characters that accompany them, my favorite cue is the "crazy" cue, a sitar that bends whenever one of the patients does something pathological <br /> <br /> Also wonderful is how Charlotte herself falls into hysteria at the peak and the patients are revealing that Dr. Masters is just another inmate, and then suggests that CHARLOTTE is also a patient who is allowed to play her delusions (she has surely a weak grip on reality, why else should not she question the ominous lack of telephone contact?). The scene in which Charlotte succeeds hardly living Dr. Doing Stephens with a toy boat has to be one of the biggest moments of low-budget horror. Yes, "Do not look in the basement" could very well be the "American Beauty" of Class Z garbage.
