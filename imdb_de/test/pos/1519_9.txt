This movie has captured me in this endless loop of contemplation for days afterward ... Although I'm not the movie snob some people seem to be here to be, I thought that was amazingly good and a powerful creation when it came to finesse missing in the execution. I admire movies that can effectively portray the feel of a stage play, and create a discordant weirdness that works well with this movie. I'm also a big fan of Alan Rickman, that could be my passion. Personally, I found the lack of spatial landmarks a good thing - this could and indeed is likely to be everywhere. I say, be careful with what has been a powerful experience for me, and probably for anyone involved in political activity.
