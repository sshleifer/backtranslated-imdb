This movie is really sick and funny. I got my friends to describe it to them. I saw it about 8 months ago and I still have the song "Should we gather at the river" echo through my head. <br /> <br /> It's basically a Tromatized Romeo and Juliet, but it goes beyond what you would expect. Let's just say incest, evidence of child abuse, of course (gore), but unfortunately it has a kind of happy ending ... somehow ... it's weird rather than happy. Cappy Capulet was brilliant! He has this intellectual snobbery tone, he is abusive but civilized. He cites more Shakespeare than anyone else in the movie ... while engaging in his sadistic role as husband and father. <br /> <br /> The meat guy was pretty cool too. He was Julia's fianc√©e, enchanted with her, and heartbroken over Tromeo. And Tromeo, a true romantic. He's a handsome, really sweet guy, desperately looking for true love. "She's making torches to burn bright!" Unfortunately, Troma had only to resort to this terrible green vomit and her other antics. They are sometimes really carried away. But hey, this movie really impressed me. How often do I refer to it in real situations ... wow that is pathetic. Anyway, have fun!
