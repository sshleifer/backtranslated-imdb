All the difficulties and difficulties of making a no-budget film straight out of the mouths of those involved. They feel all the sweat, courage, determination and dedication that Stuie has banished into this work of love and the frustration that he gets stuck after all his work. The video clips of the interviews with everyone involved provide a fluent narrative and convey the confrontation, the hardcore punk, and the almost anarchic attitude required to make "Waldo" and then the documentary. Stuie and his company earn all the props of the world because they did not give up when things got tough, and bring out "A Texas Tale of Treason" so we can see what it's like for the aspiring filmmaker on the street!
