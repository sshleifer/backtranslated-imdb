Ed (random editor) is set to cut horror movies in Europe (where the standards are much stricter). But he finds the films very destructive and gets a little crazy. Okay, "a little bit" could be an understatement. <br /> <br /> Let me say this first: best. Opening. Scene. ever. A man in an office blowing his head off with a grenade. His boss then says - with a straight face - "you're fired". The entire film does not maintain this intensity, but it definitely tries. <br /> <br /> Take the shotgun scenes, the beheading, the clips of "Lost Limbs" (which my friend Jason wishes to be a real movie)). The author of the film thought of the idea of ​​a woman being raped by a beaver and immediately shot in the face with a bazooka. That's something you will not find in any other movie (at least I doubt you'll do that). <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake of this movie is the quality. The picture is not as sharp as a movie from 1997 should be and the tone could be upgraded (though it is not bad). I thought I was watching a movie from the 1980s. It gave me a little boost in my mind - the film also had the 80s style of writing and governing: a sense of fun and something more special to the audience. I miss those days. <br /> <br /> I wish I had more to say, even though I'm not strong enough to praise this movie right now. I think you should see that. You've seen the box in your video library where the ax is splitting your head ... maybe you've given it up a few times. Maybe you thought it was cheesy. Pick it up. Enjoy it.
