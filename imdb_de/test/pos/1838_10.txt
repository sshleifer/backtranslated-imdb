Return to Me is a charming gem of a movie. Who can do something wrong with a star-studded cast on this modern fairytale? It also contains many, many jokes, written by the funny girl herself Bonnie Hunt, who wrote and directed this film. David Duchovny is also very good and shows a different approach to his everyday alter ego-mulder in my favorite show, the x-files. a great date movie!
