At this time, with just about every other message including discussions on waterboarding, images of Abu Ghraib, or stories of forced arrests in Guantanamo Bay, Gavin Hood's "Rendition" is about as up-to-date and timely as any movie is likely to be from the entertainment mills of mainstream Hollywood. It's by no means a perfect movie, but it does not deserve the war-prone opprobrium that critics from all walks of the ideological and political spectrum have received. <br /> <br /> The term "transfer" refers to the CIA's ability to arrest people suspected of terrorist acts and then secretly transfer them to a foreign country for indefinite term questioning and torturing, all without due process Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian who has lived in the United States for twenty years and has an American wife, a young son and a new baby along the way unlikely candidate for a terrorist, but one day Anwar is arrested without warning or explanation and taken to an unknown location, where he is subjected to brutal torture, until he admits that he is arrested by a terrorist organization, which Anwar claims not knowing about. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, Rendition occasionally drops in its storytelling abilities, often biting off a bit more than it does hl in relation to the act as well as to the character. The alleged focus is on Douglas Freeman, a rookie CIA agent, who is invited to join Anwar's "interrogation" by Egyptian officials. The problem is that Freeman, as conceived by writer Kelley Sane and staged by Jake Gyllenhaal, seems too naive to find a very plausible agent, and he does not have the time he needs to develop completely as a sign We know little about it in the beginning and even less about it in the end. He "goes through the motions," but we learn little about the man inside. Without a strong center of gravity holding everything together, the film sometimes feels as if it were torn apart at the seams, and the elements of the story flew off in all directions. A similar problem occurs in Anwar's Distraught Woman, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we never know much about except for what we see on the surface. Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have proven to be good actors under other circumstances, but here they are constrained by a restrictive script that rarely leaves them with more than a single recurrent note in their performances. <br /> <br /> What makes "Rendition" an ultimately mighty film, however, is the extreme seriousness of the theme and the way two parallel lines in the final stages of the film are elegantly interlinked. It may make for a slightly more invented story than we might have liked on the subject, but hey, that's Hollywood, and the film has to pay some homage to the expectations of the mass audience if it wants to get the go-ahead. Do not let the light of the world appear as a completed project. <br /> <br /> Two of the supporting performances in the film are particularly convincing: Omar Metwally, who feels the horror of a man caught in a real Kafkaesque nightmare that he can not raise, and Yigal Naor, who is out makes the main transporter / torturer a surprisingly complex figure. Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard are also noticeable in smaller roles. The warm and strong cinematography of Dion Beebe should also be emphasized. <br /> <br /> Does the film simplify the problems too much? Probably. Is it stacking the deck in favor of the torture victim and the evil government forces? Certainly. (One wonders how the film would have been if Anwar really was a terrorist). Nevertheless, the film has the courage to enter controversial ground. It is not afraid to ask dubious questions or to risk the disapproval of some. She openly asks how a nation adheres to its hard-won principle of "civil liberties for all" in the face of terrorism and fear. And how much courage does it take for people with good will to finally get up and say, "Enough is enough," even at the risk of being labeled as terrorist-placating and unpatriotic by the rulers? (The film in no way denies the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism.) In order to dismiss "Rendition," it would be possible to use the Perfect as the enemy of the good. "Rendition" may not be perfect, but it's good, and it has something important to say about the world we live in now. And that alone makes it very worth seeing.
