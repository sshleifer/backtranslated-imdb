The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French "Emmanuelle 2". This amazing woman did not go unnoticed and soon became the lead actress in this new Italian series, in which she is the centerpiece. A beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism of the world. In this first episode, Mae Jordan / Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the humans as well as the stunning scenery and wild exotic animals. Much like the character of Sylvia Kristels, Emanuelle has not won out when it comes to being open and familiar with her own sexuality. The essence of this first film is how it becomes the "Emanuelle" that most exploit cinema fans are familiar with. Filled with beautiful cinematography, beautiful people and an intoxicating 70s score by the legendary Nico Fidenco, this one will surely please. Those who like the more story-oriented style of the original French "Emmanuelle" should definitely do so. The main story here is an interesting cat and mouse story about a happy playboy who has come to the conclusion that he has fallen in love with a woman who is his female version! Sexy, funny and totally entertaining throughout; A soap opera, to be sure, but one with enough skin and general eye candy to entertain the male onlookers. For some reason, this is the hardest in the series to be found on DVD. There has never been a legitimate DVD, which is very strange. The bootlegs, who sometimes appear online, have to do this until someone publishes this movie's diamond properly.
