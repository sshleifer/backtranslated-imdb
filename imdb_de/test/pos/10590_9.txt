If you expect Jackass to be anywhere else, this is a real movie, and for the budget that was well done, acting is not great. Even the writing is not the case, but the director was there and so the story was definitely worth the rent and possibly the purchase, if you really like it I did. But for the person who only likes donkeys, rent it first.
