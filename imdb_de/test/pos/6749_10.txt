This is an excellent B-movie horror movie that borders on horror and comedy. It is a genetically mutilated scorpion in space. Can it be unreal? It is a hybrid between "Alien" and "Chain Saw Massacre". The film was shot in Stockholm with a mixed cast of Americans and Swedes who interact wonderfully. Director Martin Munthe has found a great job finding the weird highlights in this script and laughs some good laughs from the audience. The movie was shot with little or no money and it's inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger has all the qualities of a B-movie horror movie. It's funny and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. It's nice to see that films like this one can still be made! I would recommend it if you like this kind of movies.
