I actually saw the last parts of this movie when I was a kid. Thanks to the search function of Plots, I was able to find out the name. I did not know the name for years, but I remembered the movie. The end left hope that the protagonist would eventually return to Earth. It was a shame that it did not come to a series. This movie reminds me of Journey to the Far Side Of The Sun. Also known as Doppleganger. If you liked this feature, the other one is worth a watch. It was made before the stranger, but shares a similar conspiracy. Still different. I just picked The Stranger from eBay on VHS. I hope they make a DVD, but it is doubtful if it does not appear on Dollar DVD. A few pilots make it on budget DVDs, and maybe this will be one.
