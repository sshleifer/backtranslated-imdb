What a movie! It certainly has an entertaining theme (unless you are a dupe) and a sophisticated, funny and complex script by Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, Hard Eight). PT Anderson will undoubtedly be around for a while. The proof is here in this epic and ambitious masterpiece. Each character is skilfully played and touched and fully formed. From Burt Reynolds as director Jack Horner to Julianne Moore (his movie star) and Mark Whalberg (as Dirk Diggler) they are all fabulous. And the story? IMPRESSIVE! Honest look at business and failure and consequences and family. One of the best movies ever! I'll give him a >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
