I do not understand these movies as well as an average rating! <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. I even got up early in the morning to finish it on late-night TV are three excellent characters, excellent characters. Danny DeVito played a gem, a pretty big achievement, considering he was also directing. His down-to-earth, sometimes ridiculous character was brilliantly written and surreal in an absolutely believable way. There are people like this, Owen was just at the finish line without crossing them. Billy Crystal's weird style and timing were PERFECT for his role. His frustration / comedy was interesting and captivating and you could also understand his feelings. To truly feel that you know a character is hard to get from the authors' point of view, finding the right actor to pull him out is an art in itself. Both were reached here three times, who else could have played Mama? There is no one who can play this role so well. There is another style, something you like to see, I was waiting for it to appear on the screen ... and not because the rest was bad, oh no, but because Momma's character was so line without crossing it was excellent to see. <br /> <br /> And what's more? A happy ending with new friendships, nobody gets hurt and everyone gets what he wanted in life ... WITHOUT a big piece of cheese in the end. <br /> <br /> Brilliant script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, great movie.
