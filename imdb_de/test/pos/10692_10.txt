Impressive. I have never heard or heard of this movie. It just came on TV (2:00 pm) and I'm totally impressed. Structure: A few fat cats are playing golf. You hit a ball in the rough. It lands at a NINJA !!!! A man in a tuxedo comes over to pick up the ball. The ninja grabs it. Crush it in his hand. Man pulls weapon. Ninja pulls blowpipe. Ninja blows an arrow in the gun barrel. GUN EXPLODES !!!! That's just the beginning of size, folks. Everyone has to see this movie. 10 big ol fat stars of familiar.
