In the spirit of the Great Space Coaster, but a few years earlier. Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic children's shows I grew up in. Seymour was a tall, fuzzy, green doll with a crescent-shaped smile of huge teeth that almost broke its head. I remember he wore a variety of Elton John glasses. <br /> <br /> He "played" piano, and had a Jesus who saw in a white tuxedo a guy sitting next to him. They would have a moral discussion and then make a song about it. <br /> <br /> Do not remember anything else than the opening theme, Seymour and the hippie. <br /> <br /> Nobody else, I know it at all. I grew up in Jersey. So when it was produced in Detroit, as it was said in a previous post, it was not just local. Seymour reminded me a lot of Sherlock the squirrel from the magic garden (other psychedelic kids show it, if there ever was one.) People always talk about the effects of LSD on 70's music and movies, but it seems they have the show Authors also get a dose.
