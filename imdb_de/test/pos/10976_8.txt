Manna From Heaven is a light comedy that entertains the audience with an exaggeration of human weaknesses. Throughout the film, it is expected that the good comes into play in every situation. The result is that the movie viewer finds himself with that stupid grin on his face, calmness in his heart, and high expectations of humanity. Watching the movie was a very enjoyable experience. (I would dare to say uplifting, but some would say that sounds crazy !!)
