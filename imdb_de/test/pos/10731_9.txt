Kramer Vs. Kramer is an almost encouraging drama about shocking, drastic enlargements of the two subjects of a failed couple. Meryl Streep, in the sign of her maternal sensitivity, plays an unlucky mother who feels limited to such a role and leaves her inattentive husband within the first five minutes of the film, finding another role in a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman is baffled and has absolutely no idea what to do with himself. He has taken so much for granted that he does not know the first thing, if he can bring his son to school in the morning. Hoffman seamlessly distinguishes this husband as such a juicy burden of setbacks. He is restless, unyielding and impatient, but even if the positive side of these three adjectives is exactly the opposite, he is tirelessly focused on what he concentrates on. He has focused on his advertising career, and when he can raise his son Billy alone, the chaos starts immediately. He is the one who throws out tantrums and stops angry during an activity. After a while, while friends with his neighbor and Joanna's former friend, played by Jane Alexander, Hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left. In the meantime, his boundless energy is channeling towards Billy and he loses his job. <br /> <br /> The custody battle for the title is a brilliant gray matter. Even if the ending is a little bit unmotivated and subjectivized to the audience, the last line and the last shot still have the witty touch of the screenwriting that seemed to fade after the magical 70s.
