(Some spoilers included :) <br /> <br /> Although many commentators have described this film as surreal, the term does not fit well here. To quote Encyclopedia Britannica's quotation, surreal means: <br /> <br /> "Fantastic or Inappropriate Pictures": One need not explain to the uninspired one how a brave ten-year-old boy can be at large and seek his fortune Driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: the curious could read James Kincaid; But if you asked the boy how inappropriate he was behind the wheel of a sports car, he would certainly protest, "NO!" What fantasies and disagreements the film offers, usually occur within the first fifteen minutes. After that, we get more repetitions of the same, in an ever more frightening and annoying development, which in no way proves to be incompatible and soon proves to be predictable. Not that it would be literally credible on the other side - but it was unfair to tax Motorama with this error in particular. Any plausible suspension of unbelief has fallen dramatically to the value scale of the typical filmmaker and viewer since the Raiders of the Lost Ark became a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> "Hallucinatorium": How do we know what a hallucination is? Anyway, some people do know that they like "hallucinogenic drugs" - but if Motorama characterizes the outcome, then I do not know why someone would take them more than once Of course, the occasional bad trip.The movie must be one of those, wordplay and all. <br /> <br /> "juxtaposition of words that were amazing": how many times a ten-year-old can frighten you by saying "Oh, my God! "When he likes something or" damn! "When he does not do it These two interjections are roughly equivalent for this script Unfortunately, every sense of the surreal in what is considered dialogue could only be directly related his naivety about the language patterns of the emerging American generation. "A world that is well-defined and meticulously portrayed does not make sense:" The world of Motorama does not make sense, but is roughly defined as a cartoon in a primary school newspaper. The numerous guest stars in the cast all have even less intelligent roles than our little hero, the "Damn!" In the blink of an eye, but takes a few seconds to brew the lying lie. And even * his * character, though performing in almost every scene, does not experience any significant development. There is hardly any reward for any spectator who, as I have, has enough sympathy to get to know him better and to understand "where he comes from". You vaguely feel a much better story and a protagonist trying to get out. "Fully recognizable, realistically painted images are removed from their normal context and reassembled in an ambiguous, paradoxical or shocking setting." No, we see a series of stereotypical and increasingly run-down billboards, gas stations, spoons, cheap hotels and their simple ways of life along the highways, right where they are stereotyped. <br /> <br /> "Largely responsible for maintaining the traditional emphasis on content." Motorama has little content from moment to moment. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: British millionaires disguised as clowns or pirates on the way to a posh costume party, laid back and silent as cautious chauffeurs Push their Rolls-Royces like fragile skiffs through a seething sea of ​​desperate humanity, Chinese who plead with them through the windows and smear the glass with blood. Or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques, limousines as they now rust, and white pianos barked by ghosts. In this detritus wander an exhausted boy and a sickly woman, in which he considers himself a mother figure, who becomes a friend who sleep next to each other in the grass. He is awakened at the festival of transfiguration on the "white and glittering" day 1945 by a bright lightning on the horizon, which is not the rising sun. When he finds out that his wife has become a corpse, he first believes that he is the witness of her soul ascending to heaven. Later he explains just a little less innocently: "I have learned a new word today: nuclear bomb. It's like God taking a picture. Well, there are only two examples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism, whose irony is carried far enough to break into the title of the movie: Empire of the Sun. If you are looking for surreal, please do not miss it. But as hard as he steps on the accelerator to race his car through the desert, no scenes that are so strangely strange, rich, subtle, or gorgeous await Motorama's poor little Gus in his quest. <br /> <br /> None of The above is necessarily a thumbs down to this movie. Although somewhat disappointed, I can not dismiss it given the respectability of another genre that exemplifies it, certainly influenced by Surrealism, but also by Expressionism, existentialism and the pessimism of Franz Kafka in the midst of omnipotent power structures. Let's try it for the size: theater of the absurd. <br /> <br /> Let's turn to EB's article on this style. I am amazed at how the theater of the absurd represents a valid artistic style. The above objections to Motorama disappear like a cloud of smoke. I am tempted to quote the entire text in support of identification. Theater of the absurd attempt to show "that the human situation is essentially absurd, without purpose ... humanity feels hopeless, confused and anxious.": Immediately after overcoming its goal of overcoming a depressing domestic life among contentious parents Gus is unconscious until he passes a glittering board labeled "Motorama" and decides to win the lottery he promises. As others have shown, this ambition is illusory: even though the game never "expires," the sponsor does not intend anyone to ever win, and has the ability to outwit, confuse, and leave behind any aspirant of the reward , He is, like others, ultimately disappointed in his dream. <br /> <br /> "Absurdist playwrights therefore renounced most of the logical structures of traditional theater: there are hardly dramatic actions, as they are traditionally understood, but in desperate ways characters play, their activity underlines the fact that nothing their existence changes ... a timeless, circular quality emerges. "" The language in an absurdistic game is full of ... repetitions ... repeating the obvious until it sounds nonsense. " Under a sometimes "dazzling comic surface" we find an underlying message of metaphysical suffering. "Gus's obsession with a stupid game, his inhuman language, the storyline in which he imagines a bleak future and / or returns to an earlier date and takes a different, but still grim, turn-so much fits in. While an admirer Surrealism should be better with some of Spielberg's films anyway, so admirers of Motorama, as it really is, should find fellow travelers - not instead but as an adjunct - in the works of Beckett, Ionesco and Genet. <br /> <br / > But you can not quite stop here: After his disillusionment with the game, Gus returns to "Phil" (ie, Love), the first companion he met, and the only person who had treated him decently, even though he was also had insulted - at a gas station, the "Be" was full! ". Under Phil's guidance, he learns how to wait for cars. We may note here that the absurdist playwright Beckett had titled his most famous piece "Waiting for Godot" and that we should read "God" for Godot. God is also one of Phil's concerns. As an indirect result of his previous encounter with Gus, Phil is also badly injured and walks around with his arms outstretched. In the last scene, Gus, now Phil's protégé, says he wants to hear music. We hear nothing, but we see Phil shake his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm, and Gus leans closer, and Gus responds. The end. <br /> <br /> Finally to an author I'm reading, the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. If this rebellious lawyer is not recognized as an architect or an advocate of liberation theology, which is more of a Roman Catholic than an Anglican movement, perhaps he ought to be. Police brutality and corporate greed are a cliché in cinema and literature, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports and illuminates such feelings with impressive guarantees of scripture, tradition and reason. <br /> <br /> His most significant work is a revelation of the earthly activities of the fallen angels, to which the Bible refers as principalities and powers. Principalities, wrote Stringfellow, stand behind all our beloved three selves: images, institutions and ideologies. All of them recommend our worship by making false promises. The deeper a picture, an institution or an ideology of a person is connected, the more his own personality is "exhausted" and becomes a slave. They promise power, control and immortality and relentlessly deliver helplessness, chaos and death. As essentially fallen, defeated powers, they can not do more. However, they do infatuate people with this "dominion over the earth" that God has promised in the Book of Genesis, while in fact none of us controls a picture, institution or ideology that inevitably depends on their own hegemony and self-preservation. They accept their own lives. "Dominion" is a mistranslation: A closer reproduction of the Hebrew would be "stewardship". However, this is a problem in addition to a more fundamental problem: neglecting most of us to notice that God had delegated this power to Adam before the fall. We have no reason to assume that we, his descendants, are still exercising it: on the contrary, it should be obvious that demonic powers stole it from us. <br /> <br /> One could add two observations from CS Lewis: First, this "conquest of nature by man" is a mere illusion and a trick to cover the fact that one is really going through the conquest of some men other people talk to nature as an instrument. and secondly, contrary to popular belief, Satan is not a good Charlie. He may be happy at first, but he is very rude to them, and will keep them firmly in his custody by every man, perhaps leaving his prey in front of the fire, miserably repenting himself, and boiling with resentment. <Br /> <br /> If we apply these insights to Motorama now, we seem to have remarkably reflected in Gus' experience. He is, if not nice, at least a handsome little boy before he falls victim to the Motorama game. The first signs that advertise glitter with glamor. However, the longer he goes and the lower he goes to the sponsor company's headquarters, the shabbier they become. He is lonely and does not meet another who plays the game. The stations that hand out the cards are either in ruins or occupied by zombies. The people he encounters on the way are always uglier, deceitful and hostile. (The fact that the Principalities respond to a common dictator does not mean that they can bear each other apart.) Gus' humanity is removed from him because he not only becomes completely selfish and unaware of the needs of others, but partially blinded ... disfigured ... has aged prematurely while being infantile in the literal sense of language, and eventually even his precious Mustang is lost in an accident, and he has to continue in a wreck of a dead man after doing all that he had expected, he finally presented himself to the principality in his proud tower in order to receive his prize, using the biblical power to deny, confuse, and confuse those who erected such monuments for their own vanity his agents deceive him, insult him and eventually throw him out of the top floor g and hard, finally ends up in a body of water. In other words, in classic symbolism THIS. He has met the inevitable end of anyone who has trusted such a cheater. <br /> <br /> However, this fate is only a warning against a changing future. He repents and returns to Phil, and when he sees him, he performs the first generous, selfless act we've seen of him for nearly an hour and a half: he notices Phil is now disabled and barely a hose in can introduce a tank. he asks, "Can I help you with this?" When he sees the sign "help wanted", he decides to apply for the job and tells the motorist he's trampling that he thinks he'll get out of here because it does not look so bad <br /> <br /> Of course, this interpretation is presumptuous and may surprise or even outrage the "cult classics" of the film who see very different points in it. <br /> <br /> If Motorama is not my cup of tea, I'm convinced that it's hardly the worst film ever made.
