I am impressed that "Hail the Woman" was ever made. Only a year after American women's voice was released, this drama makes a serious plea against sexual double standards that judge women's sexual behavior more than men. <br /> <br /> SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD. A prologue playing in the Plymouth colony in 1621 shows a pilgrimage girl convicted of flirting with a boy to the duck stool; The boy is not punished. Now we are in the present (1921) to Flint Hill, New Hampshire. Oliver Beresford (Theodore Roberts) is a bombastic bible-fighter: What we call "a god-stealer" in Britain and Australia. Beresford is determined that his son David (Lloyd Hughes) will be a preacher, no matter how David feels about it. Beresford's daughter Judith ... Beresford is confident that women are not important enough to be more than women and mothers. Apparently, God told him this personally. David's evangelical career is in jeopardy when he impregnates Nan Higgins, the stepdaughter of the local odd jobs. (Tully Marshall's character is identified in the credits only as "Odd Jobs Man," but a close-up of a check reveals that his name is Jake Higgins.) The prejudices of 1921 require him to be only Nana's stepfather and not her birth father.) Um To rescue his son from a scandal, Beresford buys Nan's stepfather with a check. Nan goes to the city to be forgotten as another unmarried mother. Judith, of course, is upset by the restrictions imposed on her sex. (Or rather through other people's perceptions.) She meets Wyndham Gray (excellent performance by Edward Martindel), an author who encourages her to overcome sexist stereotypes. But Judith is informally engaged to the local lout Joe Hurd, who will not stand such nonsense. Hurd is played by Vernon Dent, a proud actor who nowadays only remembers comedy roles (as a second banana for Harry Langdon and as a villain in Three Stooges films). He performs well here, outside his usual range. Unfortunately, Dent spent his last years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. <br /> <br /> In the end, Judith works in an orphanage. I expect the orphanage in 1921 would consist only of whites, and I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out there was a Chinese boy. (And unpleasantly surprised when used as a butt for a race joke.) The movie makes a weird mistake here. In a Christmas sequence, we see the orphanage mistress recite "A Visit to Saint Nicholas" ... but (in a dialogue title), she prescribes six instead of six reindeer to Santa. This is followed by a short animation sequence in which Santa Claus is depicted with six reindeers hanging from his sled. I assume that the animators (either by accident or to save money) skipped two reindeer, and the title card revised the poem to reflect the mistake. Lloyd Hughes was usually a bland and unassuming actor. His most famous performance is his role in "The Lost World," where he is easily staged by a raging Brontosaurus. For his climate scene in "Hail the Woman," Hughes gives a memorable performance as he finally rebels against his father's tyranny. Theodore Roberts was accused of having done too much in his performance as a gospel-screaming father to make his role a caricature. I do not agree with that: unfortunately, decades after this movie was filmed, I continue to encounter "saintly" fools, just like this man ... who is ready to destroy the lives of all around them, firmly convinced that they have God's authority In the central role of Judith Beresford, Florence Vidor delivers a sensitive, realistic and intelligent performance. Usually I do not like Vidor, who was more glamorous but not pretty enough to justify her. Here, the physical appearance of their character is less relevant than usual. <br /> <br /> The entire film is impressively directed by John Griffith Wray, a director who deserves to be much better known. Unfortunately, Wray died at the beginning of the talkie era, mid-thirties: If he had lived another ten years, he would certainly have signed several early sound classics under contract. In 'Hail the Woman' there are some very nice screen compositions: I was particularly impressed by a scene in the New England Forest when Vidor and Dent have a fight in front of a huge uprooted tree. (I wonder where this was actually shot.) 'Hail the Woman' deals with unpleasant topics, but it deserves to be much better known, and I'll rate this ambitious drama 9 out of 10.
