This is the only Christopher Guest movie that competes with Spinal Tap and Princess Bride for sheer entertainment value, but is never seen near recognition. The plot surrounds the participants - dogs - and their owners, while venturing into the world of the rival dog ... OK, it's about a dog show. The owners are truly characters, how to hang them on their dogs. That's all, but that's funny enough. <br /> <br /> You would never be able to convince me that ridicule about dog shows would be funny before he makes fun of the scene where Levy and O'hara visit Larry Miller's house on television ... but that is really everything that is needed to convert doubters. Spinal Tap was non-stop merriment, kidding, while Best in Show had a few more breaks (and I mean 3 minutes at MOST, where some exciting comic does not happen), but the big laughs are even bigger. <br /> <br /> The casting in this movie is great and even the usually inappropriate, um in movies in general, Parker Posey does a good job. In fact, their tirade against Ed Begley Jr. and a pet store owner is probably the funniest run gag of the movie because of a lost dog toy. <br /> <br /> What's amazing about this movie for me is the nature of the authors Somehow, it was possible to weave a simple story around these great jokes, making it feel like there was direction. I think there is a freedom to have such a small action. Everyone's role here is very well-designed and the characters are rarely over the top. The realism of how pathetically they appear to the outsider makes him funnier than Mighty Wind or the odd Guffman. I actually meet Wierdos from time to time. If you like Guest's stuff at all, you should definitely own this.
