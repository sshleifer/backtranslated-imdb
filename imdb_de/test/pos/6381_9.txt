This streak is strange, but I really liked it. It's about a good girl who loves her bad boy and the jumbled honeymoon. he does not love her and he is a common son of a bitch. He's starting to love her after a couple of really crazy things happened on her honeymoon that I'm not going to reveal. it's weird yes !! But unlike other films, I think. I do not know what to compare, but it's a love story. but also has a lot of funny stuff. like James Franco in a wig. I really liked the notebook and it somehow felt because of the love story. The rest is different. nothing like that. Sienna Miller is really good. I saw this movie with a test screener because I really like her and her fashion. I liked her in factory girls, but this is a better movie than that. You and James Franco really look in love with this movie and I hope they get together in real life but do not know if they see it !!!!
