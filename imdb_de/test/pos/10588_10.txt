The movie was fantastic. If you are a fan of Bams' cky videos, Jackass or his show Viva la Bam, you can not help but like it. I have a few friends who were not fans and others who did not like it. Those who did not like it were mostly female friends, they did not really appreciate the coarse humor, which made the movie so funny in person. I'm pretty sure the entire movie was filmed in Bams' hometown, where many of his regularly visited places are. The cast consists of all his friends and friends, but also some famous skateboarders. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with music from HIM. In my opinion, Haggard has everything. A great storyline, characters you will not see anywhere else. A lot of humor, great music and a cast dedicated to the project.
