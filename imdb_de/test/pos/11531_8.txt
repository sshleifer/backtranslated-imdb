I caught this on late, late Mexican cable and must scold it. The title was translated as "Secretos" (Secrets). Well, there is a secret that plays an important role in the movie, but come on! We are not stupid. We know that there is a novel behind it. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite interesting and is supported by its solid, ramatic performances. The always beautiful and breathtaking Jordana Brewster and Christopher Eccleston deliver great performances and have a great chemistry between them. Cameron DÃ¬az is also good, although she has little time on the screen. Blythe Danner is perfect and his last appearance in the movie is touching and sad. Great achievements. <br /> <br /> Jordana's character and her sister's former boyfriend travel to Europe to deal with his demons and understand why their sister died. Through flashbacks we experience the sad truth and we can not help regretting the whole family. The end is really moving. <br /> <br /> So there's nudity, but it's minimal. In fact, the sex scenes are artistic and do not intend to be steamy or sexy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I've always watched Joranda Brewster's charming and beautiful beauty on screen. And I liked the story and the dramatic presentations. <br /> <br /> Try this movie if you like solid dramatic features. Great movie. The last, last scene was very sad .. The two little sisters by flashbacks.
