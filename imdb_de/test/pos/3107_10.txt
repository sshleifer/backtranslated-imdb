The Ghost Walks is a clever little mystery with a great twist, snappy dialogues, and above all, a pansy played by the character actor Johnny Arthur to chirp that never humiliates or denigrates his character. Mr. Arthur is splendid in his role as Homer Erskine, who brings great comic relief as Secretary of Broadway producer Herman Wood, played by another great character actor, Richard Carle. <br /> <br /> They are going great. <br /> <br /> Although the acceptable words of the time Sissy and Cream Puff are used to describe the character of Homer, it is never meant mean or as a denigration and is not pronounced by the male males of the movie but by his Employer firing and reinstating him in every other scene and showing an almost angry affection for his devout employee. <br /> <br /> There is a great scene in which Homer tells his boss that he spent the best years of his life for him and was anything but a mother to him. <br /> <br /> The mysterious angle of the movie is very entertaining and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches. For a low budget picture in poverty, this movie has a superb set decoration and a great costuming. <br /> <br /> Direc Tor Frank Strayer cleverly deals with his performers, and this film stays together much better than some of his low-budget secret attempts, but he had a great script to work with, and some wonderful actors who enforce him. <br /> <br /> This movie is an absolute must for poverty line lovers, old Dark House mysteries (they actually managed to work in the lines "It was a dark and stormy night") and has the extra Advantage that they are an early representation of a gay character in the film, where nothing bad happens in the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is available for download from the public domain section of the Internet Archive at archive.org.
