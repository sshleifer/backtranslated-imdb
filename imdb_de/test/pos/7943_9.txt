At school I was taught how to shoot a few shots and two directors were constantly mentioned: Orson Welles and Sergei M. Eisenstein. That was not so important to me at the time (I was a kid!), But now I know why, Eisenstein is a genius and it's a shame to see what was possible in 1938, where we've spent countless empty films for nearly half a century ! Some say that this film is not worth the irony of Eisenstein (then they have to look at him over and over again until he can say something bad) or, worse, it's just a propaganda movie for the Russians. Put it the way it is, it is indeed pure propaganda for patriotism, but is not it "Saving Private Ryan" or "The Longest Day"? I could put together so many films that take America to the top. So why not Russia, and besides every war is fought for its patriotism, why else should they set up flags? Aleksandr Nevsky is a must-have for anyone interested in cinematography since almost every shot is a great picture. Maybe everything is overlooked, but I wonder why this is not included in IMDB's Top 250, as there are so many overrated Oscarcrap files.
