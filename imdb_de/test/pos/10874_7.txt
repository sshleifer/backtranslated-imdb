I do not know if I would go so far as to say that this movie belongs to the "Aussie garbage" pile, but you can say that there are no Oscar nominees here. It's important to remember that most of the actors in the movie were not actors, just kids, who had nothing better to do at the time. There were many others who were offered roles in the film but refused to surf the coast; All in all, it was not a bad movie for the time. In some ways, it really is no different from today, when peer pressure is still alive, just without mobile phones, computers, and other similar devices that children did not have in contrast to this generation. Anyway, I have to rate this streak as an old fave that I once see in a blue moon and never take too seriously ...
