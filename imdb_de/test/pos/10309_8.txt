I saw Bandit Queen in 2005, over a decade later, when it was rampant in India. The language, the blatant treatment and the natural spectacle (of a then relatively unknown occupation) were perhaps even more shocking for an Indian population that is more familiar with the fantasy cinema at that time. The film, the cast and Shekhar Kapoor deserve recognition for their breakthrough. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in India. In fact, there were several fictitious reports about this particular story. The reason why this is so striking is that this is a first-person account of someone who has actually gone through all that, and much else that has no screen space and has survived the story to tell. Survived long enough to at least see their story transformed into a movie. Phoolan Devi did not live long after he was released from prison in 1994. The film scores in several ways. The cinematography is brilliant. The music is suitable. The cast, many of which later became known, is very good. But the script is inconsistent. Sometimes things move too fast and jerky. However, it is understandable because there are just too many strands that need to be connected to make everything self-contained. Or maybe I felt that because I read Mala Sen's book, which is more detailed and better, although it's obviously not as shocking as the visual report of Phoolan Devi's efforts and supposedly one of the main sources of the film. <br /> < br /> There are also some factual ambiguities. According to Phoolan Devi, she was not present when the Behmai massacre took place, and although she claims to be the dictated report of Phoolan herself, she is shown to participate in the massacre and actually initiate it. Then, the last scene in which Phoolan surrenders shows that she touches the prime minister's feet while in reality she had surrendered to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Only symbolic value, but shows that Phoolan did not want to show bondage to a living, ordinary person. It would have been nice to show the Prime Minister that he has something to do with Arjun Singh, whom many remember, was then the CM of Madhya Pradesh. <br /> <br /> But these are small gaps in this superbly made film, a rare jewel of the Indian film industry made by a man previously known for the ultimate Masala movie of the late '80s - Mr India.
