This is undoubtedly the most horrible black and white war movie I have seen. In fact, Samuel Fuller was the only Western director to approach his intensity and pure visceral power from afar. Incidentally, I attended a Kon Ichikawa retrospective at the National Film Theater in London in September 2002, but was only able to capture a few of his works from 1960 to 1973. <br /> <br /> The movie is certainly as depressing as it is supposed to be; but it also shows a welcome touch of black humor - the "dead" man who wakes up to answer a questioning soldier and instantly "dies," the deliciously ironic shoemaking sequence, a moribund eccentric who tells the starving hero what part of it is body should he eat, etc. By the way, the script was written by a woman - Natto Wada, the wife of the director! <br /> <br /> Ichikawa is a versatile and prolific filmmaker whose reputation may not be so high. It was in its heyday (1956-65), but its direction here is often striking - the startling sequel (the hero is violently reprimanded by his supervisor for his premature discharge from hospital!), the death of a surrendering Japanese woman in the hands of a Filipino woman, the bombing of a hospital (with the medical staff trying to escape to save herself, leaving the wounded soldiers behind and crawling out of the hut at their limited pace), the automated March in the rain of the disillusioned soldiers (as for the footwear business mentioned above, which is actually related to a similar scene in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. 1930), a hill dotted with corpses of soldiers attempting to climb the mountain, the finale, etc. Certainly, the film is the impressive film backdrop of the unforgiving and desolate mud landscape. <br /> <br /> The film is notorious for treating the taboo topic of cannibalism (almost 10 years before it became a staple.) Ichikawa's approach is not only subtle but also very effective: the flesh is actually considered to be "Monkey meat" means while the hero is only seen once (and spits it out with most of his decayed teeth!). ); Conversely, when the weak submissive soldier (played by Mickey Curtis, who despite his name was a Japanese pop idol of the time!) Angrily gives in, the ground nearby is spattered with blood. <br /> <br /> In the additions, Ichikawa remembers that the lead actor Eiji Funakoshi (which incidentally is memorable) arrived at the starvation point on the set - with the result that the production had to stand still for two weeks until he had recovered! Donald Richie's shrewd interview prefers the film's nihilism over the underlying patriotism behind such a handsome, recent Hollywood diet as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998). FIRES ON THE PLAIN is generally regarded as one of his most respected directors' bests and from the various films by Ichikawa I've looked at, THE BURMESE HARP (1956) are the closest to the mind. Another character-oriented war film, but with a spiritual tone that is also available on DVD Criterion) and ENJO alias CONFLAGRATION (1958), which received a limited theater performance a few years ago on site as part of a foreign film week. Personally, I also have a special weakness for the breathtakingly stylized color extravaganza of director AN ACTOR'S REVENGE (1963), which I caught twice in 1999 at the NFT and the 2002 retrospective mentioned above.
