I recently bought this DVD, and I was totally surprised that Rush's songs sound exactly like when I heard them in 1980 for the first time. The cast of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart is so talented that I want to perform them again and again. <br /> <br /> Songs I remember like Tom Sawyer, XYZ, The Big Money, The Trees, Freewill, Closer to the Heart, 2112, Limelight and The Spirit of Radio were played and the 40,000 plus Fans sing along and have a great time, and I swear half of the audience was under 25! Writers who have crushed Rush, as far as Rush fans like myself are concerned, are a bunch of jealous Dunderheads who like to taste rancid sour cream with soda in taco. <br /> <br /> Rush does not decorate himself, does not wear spikes, lip sync, wears lipstick, gets into trouble with the law and has a band member about how long they were unmarried. Everything they do is entertain! <br /> <br /> I give this DVD a 100 out of 100.
