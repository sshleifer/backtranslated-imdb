This movie is true action at its best. It is not better. This is one of those movies where you can just sit back and watch some really good non-stop shots and killings. There are also a few excellent lines that fit. My favorite is that there is a villain breaking into this old couple's home. He steals a TV or something and he goes straight to her and shouts, "I'll come in here whenever I like !!!" and just before he jumps out the window, he yells "Anytime !!!" I mean, it's all a classic thing, so you have a choice, you can watch crappy Will Smith trying to shoot an action movie, or you can see one of the Masters Charles Bronson !!!!
