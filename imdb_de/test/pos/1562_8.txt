Judith Ivey as the fraudulent old whore is great. Emily Grace the young girl. Is innocent and exciting when she learns what's going on. Excellent direction and camera. The story is dark and disturbing. To support the cast is good. Shows what happens and can happen with a lot of bad luck. Great independent movie. Small cast The tempo is slow at first and then good. A good movie to show your teenage daughter who wants to leave the house early for the road and adventure. This film, movie, has a low budget but works because of the low living space and areas in which these people move. I'll never rest again without thinking about this movie and checking my tires before leaving.
