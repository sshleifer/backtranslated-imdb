This was Charlie Chaplin's first film. Yes, in his previous movie MODERN TIMES some sound and language had been built in, but it was still a silent movie. It was not until 1940 that Chaplin heard the speech in the film. <br /> <br /> The film is incredibly famous and enjoys an excellent reputation. Although I enjoyed the movie, I was not nearly as impressed as Chaplin's other mid-20s and 30s long films. That's because I felt rather annoyed when Chaplin played Adenoid Hynkel, especially when he made his speeches. The stupid pseudo-dialogue only seemed to be something a smaller comedian would use (like the Three Stooges). Besides, it's hard for me to play a funny Hitler. <br /> <br /> However, when Chaplin played the Jewish barber, he was not particularly funny (he was not supposed to be a funny character), but He was a tremendous voice for reason and decency. This movie should not be remembered as a comedy (especially because it does not really stand out), but because of its outstanding acting and humanity. The closing speech of the barber (imitating Hynkel) is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes. Just look at the movie for that reason.
