As an adventure series that's about as good as it gets. I saw it when it was originally shown on HBO. Sigrid absolutely believes in her role as Philadelphia and the entire production was first rate! See it every 400 minutes if you can. I highly recommend this mini series. Amazing that I can not officially rate it, but for your readers / users I'll tell you it's a solid 10!
