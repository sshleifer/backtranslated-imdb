If you want to see what can be classified as a stage version of GYPSY, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> If you want to list GYPSY (ed)'s MERMAN recording, you really want to look at MIDLER as Gypsy's mother, ROSE. I think Midler has the volume, vibrato, and gifts that Merman once had. <br /> <br /> It's not so much these days when listening to update versions of musicals that I get the tingling sensation that puffs my hair. My neck tingles but Bette Midler certainly shows her talents in this movie - you see How you like apples ... <br /> <br /> I know you may not like it, but for me, Ms. Midler is the deciding "gypsy".
