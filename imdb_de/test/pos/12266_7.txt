Basic consideration for anyone watching television news, as this can help to become a little more skeptical or even more cynical. I remember a few years ago that I took part in a course that was about being interviewed for television - what to do, what not to do. The instructors impressed us that the television news was a "branch of show business." This depressing view, which is probably even more valid today than it was then, is reinforced by this film. The journalistic integrity does not matter, what counts is the ability to look good and smile well. And make sure you do not sweat in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The interactions between the three main characters form the centerpiece, each with its own ambitions, abilities and beliefs. Brooks picks up on these differences and puts them in the volatile atmosphere of a television news studio, adding more than a pinch of love interest to the mix. The result is a complex, if somewhat overlong, account of how we compromise every day to fulfill our ambitions and take others along. It is always entertaining, even if the final scene was perhaps unnecessary in the light of its predecessor.
