Checking Out will be released on September 15, 2006 via the AMC Theater chain in New York City. Times Square, 66th and 3rd Avenue, 84th Street West. This movie was from the heart, for the heart. Mark Lane, Jon Karas, Richard Marcus, Jeff Hare, Dana Harrloe, Matt Jensen, Ed Abrams, Nick Pike, Peter Falk, Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold, all the cast and crew knew from the beginning that this movie was something was special. The need to comfort the elderly is intentional, the closeness to the family is now more apparent than ever. I would recommend this movie to all ages and races. This story directs the truth to everyone with or without family.
