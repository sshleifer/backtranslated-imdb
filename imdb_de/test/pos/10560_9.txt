I have never read the book by Sarah Water. Although I did not read the book, the 3-hour movie is very interesting. It starts with an interesting plot with a twisted ending. I have to say that these 2 actresses are amazing. Sally Hawkins has amazingly succeeded in portraying the character who falls in love with her lover and betrayed her love. Their romance is slowly blossoming as they spend more and more time together. The love scene is very tender and emotional, well played. The end is pretty intriguing and these two ended together after what they went through, which is a blessing. All in all, it's a great movie, a very interesting plot with great performances.
