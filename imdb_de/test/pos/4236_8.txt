I would say "Bride of Chucky" is a "return to greatness", but the series has never been really great. # 1 was very good, # 2-3 was thrown away, and I think that this fourth installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitles / tagline: "Chucky gets luck." In the role of Jennifer Tilly, who has rejuvenated this series, such as Jeri Ryan for "Star Trek: Voyager". Tilly has not only created a presence; She added a lot of needed humor, backstory, drama, suspense and a great little buddy / play-thing for Chucky. And, as much as I liked her in the movie, she can not find all the acclaim: the props (watch for the first 1-2 minutes for horror homages), the writing, the inside jokes (again the opening + pinhead) and Chucky lines were great ("In fact, if this were a movie, it would cost 3-4 sequels just to meet," among other things.) Luckily, Chucky and the Andy series have given up the "Hide" the Looking for the soul and just decided on a new way out of his body. He collaborates with his ex (Tilly), whom he transforms into a "bridal" doll, and a few teenagers from Bonnie & Clyde (Really, Heigl?), To reclaim this follower buried with Chucky's human corpse. This is for any Chucky fan, 1980s Slasher horror fan, or even for those who have never seen one of the earlier "Child's Play" movies. It's funny, dark, harmless, bloody ?? but not over the top, and despite Tilly's literal 20 minutes of screen time, watching her is always great. After all, you hardly ever see her playing poker anymore. (Side note: Of course, I took up the Superman reference to Hackensack, NJ.)
