Outstanding episode, has shown that Dean not only has good taste when selecting Cassie for his girlfriend, but also shows that he has a heart and only a woman can love, and he is not just a guy who loves her and leaves! Aweso e episode. Applaud her for that. I just hope they will return to the Cassie relationship next season (if there's a next season?). I want her to return to her "supernatural" life, especially in Dean's life. I also like the fact that an African-American woman was the special lady in his life who somehow got away. I hope they will not screw it up and end it when it ends. The girl Cassie played was really an eye-catcher, and it was good to see the World Cup turn into what we all see in everyday life - the interacial coupling that has become general and acceptable (finally!).
