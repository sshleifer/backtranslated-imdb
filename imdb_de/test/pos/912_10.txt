This film is not just about emotions and human emotions, but about everything that could be, but not. Poetry in movies can be terribly boring and annoying, but this movie is something to be proud of. Not to mention the amazing Irène Jacob, a great actress in France - actually one of the best. When the movie is over, it can only be sorry. If something is really great, we want more (Well, for another great movie by K Kieslowsky with Irène Jacob we can always watch La double vie de Veronique)
