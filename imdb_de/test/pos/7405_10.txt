I had never heard of Silverwing before, then I saw it at Toon Disney and loved it immediately! I also think that it is not just for kids and that it would appeal to people of all ages. It has a great storyline, great impact and cool characters. I will always love the show and I have heard that it will soon be released on DVD worldwide and I will get it! I have not read any of the books, but I intend to. The show earns 10 out of 10 points, and I hope the books are just as good. Well, that's all I have to say. But I have two more lines to fill, so ... who do you all think is the coolest character? Mine is shadow and my second favorite is Marina.
