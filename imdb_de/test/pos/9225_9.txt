RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER are in my opinion an outstanding masterpiece. I felt warm and tingling when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) began to take revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and devilish. For me, she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys revenge on him. However, I liked her castle as well as the rest of the area. In addition, I thought that Lurky (voice of Pat Fraley) and Murky (voice of Peter Cullen) are devilish. Before I summarize, I would like to say that all were perfectly staffed, the direction was perfect and Disney has achieved great success. Finally, I commend this excellent masterpiece to anyone who has not seen it yet, especially die-hard fans of the TV series. I guarantee you that you will enjoy it.
