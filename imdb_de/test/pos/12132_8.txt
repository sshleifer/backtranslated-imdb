Surprisingly good "Mean Streets" -type drama. Displays the items of "Goodfellas" and "Casino". Joe Pescis first big role. Clever dialogue. I think the Maltin leader gives this a bomb rating. I can only assume that no one really bothered to look at it. <br /> <br /> I saw this at Tarantinos Filmfest and said Scorsese had used some of these actors in Raging Bull.
