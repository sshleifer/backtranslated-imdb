For those who like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent people who love movies, work with attention to detail, and enjoy indie films with funny, intelligently written dialogues, this is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> For those with a weak attention span, high expectations and no brains .. well .. um .. you will get bored sometimes and find it exciting sometimes. <br /> <br /> This is charming, modest and cheerful movie with the actors that give their roles a feeling of depth and warmth. I chuckled almost all the way through. <br /> <br /> This movie is a little gem.
