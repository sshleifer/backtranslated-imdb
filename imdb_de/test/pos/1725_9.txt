I'm a next-generation person ... I've never met the original doctor, but I've heard about the series, which has attracted a large fan base in the past and still has its mark on the 21st century. the new "Doctor Who" started in 2005, but for those who live here in the states like me, we quite often see it as new episodes on the sci-fi channel or BBC America; From the first season, we introduce ourselves to a new player, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), and a pretty cool new doctor played by Christopher Eccelson (misspelled surname, sorry). These two do some amazing and extremely dangerous missions to save the world ... every now and then they have companions, from Rose's ex-boyfriend Mickey to the now ubiquitous Jack Harkness (now on Spin Off). From the first to the second season, the pace is just right, the stories can range from the strangest to the most action-packed tempo-driven, but it's a kind of rollercopter ride from the beginning of the title track, the is very catchy. "In the second season, he changes and changes, and now the new doctor (David Tennant) continues the fight to save the world with Rose, and from then on, there may be some who say something in The season was not the case As good, but I do not have to agree, and it was sad to see Rose and the doctor separately, but Martha (played by the very sexy Freema Agyeman), who is fighting for the rescue of Mensc Martha leaves the opening role. The third season is now more action / adventure level and sometimes emotional, but not as much as on the first two seasons. Here, the relationship between the doctor and Martha is appropriate, but the appeal CAN sometimes be rushed, and it is obvious that she did NOT climb because Tyler has experienced her experience in the first two seasons and not in the third season Somewhat awkward It was for me because you've gotten used to getting up and seeing your ways, and now seeing somebody who sometimes does not really question the doctor on an emotional level, but still makes the pace very much for the viewers exciting, what holds up the seat edge. All in all, this is an exciting ride on a television program that I would give more, but there are also some shortcomings in this show that I can not sometimes mention hard to learn, but only one does Doctor and Martha's relationship is rushed and not grounded to get to know your base; I've seen good shows on British television, but this is by far one of the coolest sci-fi adventures for the old and new generations, but you do not have to take my world for it ... step into the Tardis and join in the adventure ,
