Better than I expected from a movie that sold under the premise of nymphomania and racial liability. The music is great and the cinematography is very much focused on making Ricci a trailer, Betty Paige. Samuel L. has a lot to scream for, what he does well, and also play a lot of blues guitar, which makes him look cool. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as a mentally disturbed friend. I feel that this material was among all the other s *% #, but instead it managed to stand out from its own weird little transgressive pulp niche while still being an effective drama.
