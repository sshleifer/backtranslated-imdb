A really scary movie. The encounter with James Kulmer's spirits led me to recently formed weblogs such as Life After the Oil Crash (LATOC), Energy Bulletin and The Oil Drum, and the data behind Hubbert's Peak theory. Like this film, LATOC and artists paint a bleak picture of dying or dying. I hope they are premature, but in mid-2005 rising gasoline prices, rising oil prices, Chevron's Will You Join Us campaign, BP Beyond Petroleum and even T Boone Pickens make us think we're at or near a climax oil production. <br /> <br /> Following extensive research on limited data, oil investment banker Matt Simmons has suggested that the Saudis may no longer be able to increase production in their huge but aging areas. In view of the increased demand (especially from the US and China), the Saudis have not responded despite higher assurances with higher production. According to world production from the years 2000 and 2004, the light, sweet crude oil has actually reached its peak. This means that the finishing becomes more expensive. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be geared towards baby boomers, but younger people, our children, must also understand the implications of a high-energy future.
