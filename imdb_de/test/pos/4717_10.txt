This is a great movie in many ways. Perhaps the most important thing is to make the Western audience aware of the remarkable and tragic story of Aung San Suu Kyi and her fight for freedom and democracy. Wonderful drama, breathtaking cinematography, breathtaking action and excitement: "Beyond Rangoon" has it all. I've seen this movie several times over the last ten years and each time it means more to me. Not everyone will like it (hence the relatively low rating of IMDb), but that's because it's not a conventional Hollywood stupidity. it challenges the viewer on several levels. I have never seen it, without sobbing and promising to lead a meaningful life.
