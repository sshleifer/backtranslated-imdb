There's a lot to like in this movie, despite the modest Preachy PC story about rape and the offender, who is always better off than the victim. The film has created a certain tension in the mystery in which the notes were sent. (In any case, I was sure that it was the teacher, in fact, that would probably have been more likely because the idea of ​​best friend's best friend came from nowhere, I think that's the meaning "Rape is omnipresent." You never know who she will be ") Ms. Beller is as always enlightened (see KB discussion forum for my qualification of this statement). As with all sermon films, the plot lasts 15 minutes after the climax, so you want to stop watching at this point. Unless you're really curious about what's going on with Phillip. Blythe Danner plays as mother in the role in which she was born: the annoying, overprotective mother. Some good 70s scenes for 70s fans. (The dark bar the father goes to wash away his pain consists of dark-stained beams, barrels, oaks and corks). A must for fans of the Beller and 70's high school melodrama or 70s kitsch fans in general.
