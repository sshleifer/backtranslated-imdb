Although I lived in Australia in 1975, it did not take me long overseas. I was fed up with the constant industrial unrest and the general worship of mediocrity - unless you are an athlete! - and the complacency of many Australians who wanted to ignore the rapid pace of change in their northern countries. <br /> <br /> As a result, I've missed The Dismissal, along with many other Australian-produced television dramas of the '80s and' 90s, such as the outstanding series Janus and Phoenix, which I have since seen along with Wildside. <br /> <br /> For me, the filmed history of The Dismissal is fair and, as far as I know, accurate. Regarding public "outrage", however, it shows only one side of the picture, not how families were torn apart by the controversy. I know how my two brothers would not talk to me for months. <br /> <br /> But the comment is in my opinion very one-sided. The inevitable fact is that, despite fiery outbursts from a considerable part of the community - and two years later - the Australian electorate has decided firmly on Fraser. <br /> <br /> This is a historically accurate and well-functioning docudrama.
