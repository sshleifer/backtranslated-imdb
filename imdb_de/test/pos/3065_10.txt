Just like all other Mel Brooks comedies, Men in Tights is hilarious. But when I see this as an outrageous comedy, many will not understand that the movie is so funny because the characters themselves are so well played. Elwes is the outspoken former British nobleman, Lewis is an eternally angry king (I hope it's all worth it!), DeLuise is a fantastic godfather, Roger Rees is a worried and cynical sheriff. The actors and actresses So loyal that the jokes flow with ease. Yes, we've already seen this kind of comedy, but the only comedy I think leads to better character development is The Big Lebowski. Very funny.
