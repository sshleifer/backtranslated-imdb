I suppose I like this movie as well as anyone I know. It's not perfect, but under the title "The Americanization of Lily," this enchanting and memorable semi-musical satire could be more than appreciated and still loved by those who love their special kind of gentleness, crafted by Blake Edwards, smart, have recognized humor and solid narration. The unlikely but delightful plot follows Lili Smith, a top spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt, who passes as Smith, helps her uncle, who is also patriotic, for Germany, but neither cruelly nor politically, but only opportunistically. Lilis goal is William Larrabee, a charismatic leader of the US squadron, who can provide valuable information. The storyline thickens as Lili falls in love with Larrabee, her eyes open for the aftermath of her spy game, seeing the effects of a fight on wounded men in a hospital and realizing what it could mean to his men who hit her Likes. She becomes jealous of a rival for Larrabee's affection, then realizes that she can not do what she has done and abandons the spy business. The logical end of the film comes when, after the end of the terrible First World War, the motto of the film "Wishing" sings in a darkened theater, the members of the Larrabee squadron appear one after another, including their lover, who forgave her and her former opponents; and even Uncle Kurt enthusiastically sings the song of "It's a Long To Tipiparee" to show that everything is fine with the world again. This is a bold and sometimes brilliant story idea, written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of "John Goldfarb"; and it's a delightful story. The Larrabee squadron, which also has a constant crash, and other lovable types populate this vibrant movie. and the feeling of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic in both scope and implementation. Jack Bear and Donald Brooks must remember the costume creations, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for sets, Fernando Carrere for another beautiful production design, Henry Mancini for his sensitive and decent scores, and Russell Harlan for his brilliant cinematography. The main actors are Julie Andrews as Lili, Rock Hudson as Larrabee, Keremy Kemp as Lili's uncle Kurt, Michael Witney, Lance Percival as captivating pilot, the beautiful Gloria Paul as Lilis striptease rival and many other good actors in smaller parts. It's hard enough to say nice things about the pace or wisdom of the broad comedy. This element is being introduced by Edwards to dismantle the horrors of actual warfare in order to illustrate the almost comic-operative approach that men have used to wage war on human civilization in an innocent time. This comedy also helps pave the way for Lili's conversion From the uncritical assumption of duty to the German state to accepting the reality of what it does and possibly what it may cause. This is a rare "lifestyle" film about Lily's "Americanization," her self-assertion in the real world, and then, among other things, before a tragedy can happen. I find it haunting and beautiful in many ways. I consider it Blake Edwards' masterpiece of directing; and under the title "The Americanization of Lili" I believe that with almost all changes it was recognized as the polished sapphire of a movie.
