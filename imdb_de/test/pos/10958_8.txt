Seven months after apparently seeing Faces, I finally found a loanable DVD copy of Cassavete's first feature. Shadows was shot on ad-hoc sets in Manhattan in a drama workshop and was the culmination of months of improvisation rehearsals in which the (mostly amateur) actors formed bonds, invented their characters, and refined their techniques. Their filmed performances are just the right tenor for spontaneous familiarity. This intimate approach led to an incredibly daring work in Faces, ie Seymour Cassel pressed Lynn Carlin's hands down her throat to revive her from an overdose. As well as the convincing beliefs of the actors here are bloody honest moments like Lelia and Tony's post-coital assessment of their relationship and Ben's disgust at the touch of a black woman as a manifestation of his race confusion and self-contempt. Homemade production in the best sense of the word, synchronizing and synchronizing sync signals, as well as detailed cinematography and close-up camera settings create an impressive atmosphere that perfectly fits Cassavete's differentiated view of human relationships as a perpetual work. marked by desperate emotional fluctuations and wistful attempts at communication and understanding. Charles Mingus' largely improvised jazz score is an ideal complement to the film's vision of living the moment, a mantra that Cassavetes worked with and apparently lived on.
