This is a very dark movie, slightly better than the average asylum movie. It was a lot better than I thought it was a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The voice on the phone is really scary - this unfocused voice, this unknown and threatening voice works very well in the movie as we never see the killer's face left to the spectator's imagination /> <br /> The action and the excitement never come to an end and after the first half of the movie it becomes dizzying; There's not much gore in this movie, just enough to serve the story, and the director also does well to grab your attention. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an 8/10 because of the clich√©s.
