Yes, this movie is another remake. Yes, this movie can be considered a chick movie. And yes, this movie is not perfect. The Women, however, is a clever, modern update on the social behavior of all women, with an impressive cast of A-listers like Meg Ryan, Debra Brass, Annette Benning and Bette Midler. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four main characters: Mary (Ryan), her best friend, editor-in-chief, Sylvie (Benning), Alex (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Edie (Debra Messing) and the responsible female creature For the most part of the drama of the film is called Crystal (Eva Mendez). Mary tries to deal with her deceitful husband (who is never actually seen in the movie) by following the advice of her friends and her mother (Candice Bergen). Besides Mary, Sylvie is torn between her social and her professional life. She has choices to test her moral and ethical values. Then there is the writer Alex, who is a lesbian and has a lot of spunk, but knows his way around words. And finally, Edie is traveling with four girls and another baby who loves children and has a heart of gold, with a hidden secret at the end. <br /> <br /> Together, the women are out of vengeance to rely on both others, and give each other life lessons. But there are the cameos of Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Carrie Fisher and Debi Mazar, which show the cruel and usual behavior of women. Bergen plays Ryan's mother, she is tough, silly-tempered, experienced and still feels like what her daughter could do later. There is Fisher who shows how to test and test the limits of selfishness, morality and betrayal. Mazar, the gossip girl, shows no mercy for what she says and who she says it to. Leachman, who plays Ryan's cheeky housekeeper, knows where and when she's needed, and how she can deliver a good one-liners. Finally, there is MIdler, who plays Leah Miller, a crazy versatile but wise Hollywood agent. She is the only character who gives Ryan's Mary a revelation of who she really is by discovering "what I want." Despite Midler's scene, in which performance and memorable quotes were stolen, it was not sufficiently used. But back to the movie, the women together show the audience what it means to live in the 21st century, without knowing exactly what they want until then. The time comes when you answer this very own question. It goes against feminism, what it means to be a woman (wild, reckless, malicious, cheesy, smart, smart, smart, shy, proud, unaware, self-confident, careless, beautiful, strong, independent); and also what women want, why are women the way they are. It's funny, modern and definitely not a masterpiece. But the bottom line is, it's worth the money and time when veterans and younger actresses learn all about women.
