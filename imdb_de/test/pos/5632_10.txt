This is perhaps the most beautiful movie of 1999. No, I'm not kidding. This documentary by Chris Smith captures the spirit of artistic compulsion. Smith does the smart thing that every documentary filmmaker should do: he remains invisible and refuses to judge his topic. <br /> <br /> As the viewer watches Mark and his efforts, no matter how funky aggressive they are, they can end his films. He refuses to compromise and suffers from it again and again. But if we do not forget it, remember that Speilberg, Scorsese and others started just as humbly. <br /> <br /> And what great theme he chooses. Mark, his family and his friends are all fascinating characters, far more than all the characters created in the fictional cinema products of last year. This film oscillates between comedy, tragedy, touching compassion and ultimately leads us to inspire every viewer with a creative urge Despite talent problems, to get rid of the butt and make something. <br /> <br /> The film is about unusual artists and their passions. It is also about families, no matter how co-dependent and unfunctional they are and how unique and beautiful this organism really is. Mark proves in the film that he is totally dedicated not only to his dreams but also to his family. <br /> <br /> Why this film was not nominated for the Documentary of the Year is superior to me and the criminal (assuming it was eligible last year). This film should be sought and appreciated.
