Stanwyck at her most wicked best, Robinson her equal man - as ruthless land barons in this more ordinary Western. <br /> <br /> Some good action scenes, strong use of location, color and cinemascope. But why is the obvious use of footage in the Stampede scene as reliable and Foster as strong as Robinson's daughter, but it's the movie of the bad guys. And it's not just Stanwyck and Robinson - Brian Keith is a surprisingly crazy villain as Stanwyck's lover, and Richard Jaeckel is memorable as a cold-hearted killer.
