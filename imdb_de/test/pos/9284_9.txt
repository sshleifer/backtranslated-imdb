The hunters fight against everything. 5 words that I like to look at. The War of the Persecutors Against Everything is an excellent Australian comedy. As the name suggests, they wage war on everything. They seem to love it, to hit the pole. <br /> <br /> The Chaser is one of the best comedies I have ever seen and is the first choice in Australia. It's on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), where some of the best comedies are. <br /> <br /> It has won the Australian Film Industry (AFI) award, but has not won the best comedy at the Logies. <br /> <br /> Last year (2006) the chaser aired on ABC on Friday night when everyone was out so nobody could see him. Well, they were postponed at 9:00 pm Wednesday night (a much better window) and best of all, if I miss an episode or just want to see it again, I can get it from www.ABC.net.au/chaser download.
