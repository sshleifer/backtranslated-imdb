I wish Hollywood would make more films like The China Syndrome. Because it scores on every level. <br /> <br /> It has a smart, credible script. It shows you that not only the nuclear power itself, but also the money that goes with it causes dangers. And the film also gives you a great behind-the-scenes look at how television is made. <br /> <br /> It scores as a thriller: When I saw it for the first time, it kept me on the edge of my seat. And it scores as a character movie: I really took care of the main characters. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilford Brimley and especially Jack Lemmon are great.
