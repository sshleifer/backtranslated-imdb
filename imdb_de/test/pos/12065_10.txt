Hilarious show with so many great stories that it reflects today's world as we know it. So strangely, she literally stole my laughs for other shows. I laughed so hard that I did not find any other comedy shows right now. The unique confessions of each character are a great original technique that makes the show just funny and very humorous. You may think that this is an average comedy show about a hard family life. That's what I thought at first, but I've found that it includes new and unique techniques that set it completely apart from any other average comedy show. Michael Rapaport is a star. I really wish that this show was not canceled.
