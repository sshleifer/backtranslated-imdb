This is a decent movie. Even if it is a bit too short for me, it brings a lot of action, grit, reason and emotions in this timeframe. Matt Dillon and the other main character do a great job in this movie. The emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the movie. It's not a typical, expensive Hollywood CGI action movie, but for the price it was a very satisfying movie. My evening was great because of this movie. This movie is a traditional action movie with great acting, story and direction. I would recommend this movie. The character development of the characters was good and lets you believe that an event actually happened. Since this movie was made on a cheaper budget, in my opinion, the quality and quality of the drama were much higher.
