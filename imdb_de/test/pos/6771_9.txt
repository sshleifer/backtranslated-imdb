I'm not sure how I stumbled upon this movie, but I'm so glad I did. At first, the subtitles scared us off, but my dyslexic brother, who hates to read (especially on weekends), enjoyed this movie as well. I thought the script was fantastic and the way it was delivered in such a unobtrusive way only added to the puddles on my sofa. Not quite sure if it is quite funny for the native Dane, as the comedy is compounded by the soundless subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation. I have not seen many Danish films (or none), but after this movie I appreciate that they are not limited by the same political correctness as elsewhere (gawd bless' em), which brings the character of Eigel to breath of fresh air because we see that special needs are funny. There are so many great one-liners in this movie that American sitcoms are ashamed.
