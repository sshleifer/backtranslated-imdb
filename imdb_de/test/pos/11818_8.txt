The topic of children being terminally ill is heavy and sad, but "The Cure" successfully demonstrates the idea that it does not have to be all doom and, if anything, children need to have hope and joy in their lives when they are come to rest at the end. It is also a film with remarkable ties between friendship and the innocence of childhood. The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional, youthful boy with a distant mother moving to a new area where his neighbor is next door, eleven-year-old Dexter, who contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion. After eliminating his initial fears and ignorance of AIDS, Erik becomes friends with Dexter and their almost fraternal friendship drives them down the Mississippi River, where they heard from a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease , <br /> <br /> The talent of Brad Renfro's and Joseph Mazzello's two young leads, each playing Erik and Dexter, is extraordinary. Brad was able to portray Erik's harder edge, without representing the subtle, childlike innocence inherent in the character, while Joseph portrays the feeling of vulnerability to Dexter's character, but brings the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and eagerness to emphasize that his illness does not mean that he is still not ill No kid who wants to run and play like any eleven-year-old boy. The couple's interactions give the audience the feeling that these are two boys who are really close and wear the movie well. Annabella Sciorra also delivers a touching performance as Dexter's mother, Linda, who adores her son and rejoices that he thrives on this new friendship with Erik and eventually becomes a surrogate mother figure to the other boy. <br /> <br /> Set "The Cure" is a very bittersweet movie that blends the story of youth friendship that lives unerringly in the midst of prejudice and deadly disease, without resorting to sappiness or unnecessary saccharine-sweet scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that it is the adults who have the problem with the AIDS status of Dexter, while the children, even the "bullies," accept it like everyone else. It is also very touching how, despite Erik's austere nature, the naÃ¯ve one is in his determination to heal Dexter, while the younger boy has this insistent feeling that he knows his fate, but is carried away by the enthusiasm of his best friend for a cure /> <br/> I highly recommend 'The Cure' as it is rare to find a movie that is both sad and uplifting.
