Assy McGee is a show you really have to have a certain age to appreciate. Otherwise, you'll probably miss the references to the '80s cop films and just think that this is a gag that talks about a running rectum. Do you think it's brainless, infantile humor? Take a look at the Stallone movie "Cobra" and you'll see what I mean. This show actually has a very subtle sense of humor that says a lot, both for a show aired as an adult while swimming, and for a show about a going ass. Films like Dirt Harry and Cobra are so great and mature for parody. Sanchez is Assy's partner who is genre-savvy and always apologizes for the murder behavior of his partner. The police chief, of course, is a fire-breathing, hard case who lives to scream: "I want to have your ID on my desk tomorrow morning!" The exaggerated and sometimes completely nonsensical way in which the "Renegade Cop" movie of the eighties is parodied fits in well with the theme. For example, when a bus robbery breaks in, one of the criminals stops and asks Assy: "Hey, where are you going, asshole !?" Whereupon the title character tears off the one-liner: "I will ... shoot you." <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for those who love the 80s action movies and have actually looked at enough of them to understand the humor.
