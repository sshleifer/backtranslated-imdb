Many people remember the Waco dispute that took place a long time ago. Most people have probably anchored themselves in the minds, the "cult leader" David Koresh and the images of the bond burning to the ground after a long argument. Many people believe that Koresh was a kind of madman who believed himself to be God. He was accused of being a child molester and credited for the collapse and death of his followers. In addition, many people believe that the cult committed suicide when the FBI stormed the Mount Carmel Center and burned the building. Most people believe the cult was guilty of not agreeing with the FBI on reasonable terms. Most people believe the cult was brainwashed by Koresh and followed with everything he said. Nothing could be further from the truth, as there is strong evidence after the nightmare, and this unique documentation pretty much proves it !! <br /> <br /> This documentary is one of the most balanced investigations of the situation. It's far more thorough and detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media. To the shock of many, this documentary will show that it was the ATF, the FBI, and the higher levels of the United States government that were unfair, cruel, and fraudulent, not David Koresh and his followers. What Korseh and Davidian did was just protect their constitutional rights, and the higher powers completely violated and raped those rights. The AFT had no reason to storm the terrain; It was the AFT that shot first and they shot from above at unarmed men, women and children !! Even more shocking are the actions of the FBI when they reached the Carmel. Look at this and you will develop a new perspective on the US government. There are infrared images that clearly show that the FBI shot the men, women and children in the burning area with machine guns. It will bring your blood to a boil. It will really make you angry. You will wonder what kind of people this country rules. After all, you'll be wondering what you hear about the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This video is scary and I highly recommend it if you can find it. This documentation does not need to be purchased. it can be viewed for free on google video!
