If you follow the lines of the classic formula to take another leap from the material, the Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter has brightened up a rather vague screenplay of certain things (or perhaps very descriptive, who knows) and created so incredibly miserable, brilliant puppeteers and animatronic characters from Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also in the team). These effects help to bring the sound into the rough, detached environment that Carpenter builds with his characters. The film tells the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the midst of an Arctic climate, defying a malevolent power that takes the form of others. By choosing the sounds and surprises of Carpenter life is fulfilled. For someone who follows in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has much more confidence and talent in executing the material than most who have had the chance to revisit an old film. <br /> <br /> With the effects Working hard - under what Backdraft would probably contain as the most fire per scene (it could be exaggerated, but it all fits into the suspense) - the actors are catching on fine ensemble with. In contrast to the squad in Predator, these are mostly only regular workers. The leader comes from Kurt Russels MacCreedy (very good role for his style, indeed excellent). Juicy supporting roles are available for Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it's refreshing to see how the kind of absurdity of what's going on in the movie (an alien that starts with dogs and then goes over to others in bloody, denied transforming forms), faces such a timing timing with everyone. I loved the long silence sometimes, with Ennio Morricon's spooky, curious music in the background (and this bass line is already an advantage). <br /> <br /> It stands there, if anything, to deliver what it strives for in its genre / cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare horror movie, in which the story is told clearly and precisely about the position of the camera, the dialogue and the timing of the scenes. This does not mean that the movie is not full of violence. It's true, and a few times it's almost funny. Considering that this is a ridiculous era, the creatures and make-up were created entirely CGI-free alongside the stable, well-calculated script. It's disgusting, but it's real and atmospheric for a T.
