The film directed by Alfred Hitchcock was made brilliant. It starts with a family of three, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day) - who is a former stage singer, and her young son - I suspect - about 10 years old, traveling through Morroco for leisure. On the bus you meet a French government official, and they are a bit too nice for him. He is killed in the marketplace after he has found out the information he is looking for. He wants to pass this information on to someone, so he goes to the only person he knows, even a bit: James Stewart. The antagonists kidnap her boy and say that if he tells something about what the agent told him, his son would be killed. Stewart has to travel to London, because that's where his son is, and there's the murder the agent told him about. The movie is very exciting. There are many twists (typical Hitchcock movie). Plus it has just the right amount of comic relief. In addition, it won an Oscar for Doris Days performance of "Que sara, sara". This movie is very good. It's hard to find a problem. I would certainly recommend it to all Hitchcock fans and all suspense fans. I only give this movie an "A-" because it is a bit predictable.
