I've only seen about half a dozen films with Lino Ventura, but it seems to be very similar to the others. He plays a laconic criminal - one who has no words and is muffled and occasionally explosive. Because of his calm personality in films like ARMY OF SHADOWS and SECOND BREATH, I've noticed that his minimalist acting style is extremely effective. In other words, because he is so calm and gentle when he does bad things, you tend to notice it. And like these other films, he also has a very strong, if twisted moral code. Abel Davos (Ventura) and his partner, Lilane, both live in Italy and are professional criminals. Both grew up in France and eventually had to flee because of their criminal activities. Now that the movie starts, the thugs are still living in Italy and the heat is rising to catch them. Strangely enough, instead of traveling to a third country, they decide to return to France - even though Davos has been tried and sentenced in absentia. Much of the first third of the film concerns the covert return. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Davos's return is not perfect and now it seems every policeman in France is looking for him. Moreover, the reaction of his old compatriots in crime is not at all what he would have expected. In fact, her lukewarm reaction to his return triggers a series of terrible events towards the end of the film. Along the way, Davos meets and is greeted by my stranger, Eric Stark (Jean -Paul Belmondo). Although Davos does not seem to have any friends, Stark and his girlfriend try their best to make his return successful. What other monkey key throws into this affair are Davos' two very young sons - what does Davos do with them - keeps them in his hiding place? <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a very good thriller - much like the French film Noir. Unlike American Noir, the many French versions I've seen have both a more realistic and a darker perspective. Fatalism rules, that's for sure! The acting is first class (especially by Ventura and Belmondo), the direction is very safe and the writing very nice, although I'm sure many will not like the end. It just seems to be attached - like an afterthought. I understood why they did it that way, but I can also see that it leaves many unsatisfied. As for me, it has left me a bit flat. Otherwise an extraordinary movie.
