One of the best! As a fan of the Civil War, I was very pleased with the first edition of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives an extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. By observing this fabulous story in a never-forgotten time, the themes of love, passion, sadness, shame, harmony and cruelty come to life. In the eighth grade, I was first introduced to this series. As a little boy you would think I was not interested in this civil war soap. To be honest, this story has stolen the hearts of everyone in my class, and this is just the first book. I bought the novel and studied the tastes and differences and it was great. I'm 17 now and still enjoy the story, the characters, the theme and remember the times of the Civil War. As a film director of the future I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
