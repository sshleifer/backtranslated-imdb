"L'appartement" is one of the best French films I've ever seen (along with "Hatred", also with Vincent Cassel and the great Gerard DÃ©pardieu / Pierre Richard films). Cassel and Bellucci are great in the lead roles. Apart from "Brotherhood Of The Wolves" and "Doberman" I have not seen a bad movie with this couple yet. "L'appartement" sucks you in from the beginning and the twists and turns keep you excited until the end. Fragment Storytelling has not worked so well since "Pulp Fiction". Let's just hope there will be no God-fearing American remake of this unique romance / mystery thriller. (EDIT: You know what! A true American remake was made!)!
