I saw this last night at the 7th annual NYC Home Film Festival - a rather turbulent place where this sweet and touching two-woman movie calmed down. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two - one, one older and one blind, the other, a twenty-year-old who helps her at the post office - is well-established and its depth is readily apparent. <br /> <br /> There are no chases, explosions or insane special effects - just the sometimes difficult but rewarding task of helping each other to help and be helped. <br /> <br /> See if you can!
