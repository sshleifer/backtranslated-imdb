It's hard to use words for this movie because it does not contain any of them. <br /> <br /> But the images he conveys, both powerful and intoxicating, remind us why we watch movies. And you could say, "Well, Leonard Maltin does not like it, it can not be that good." But you are wrong. Watch this movie. French film brilliance and ensemble.
