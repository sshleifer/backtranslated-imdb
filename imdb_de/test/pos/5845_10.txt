Oz is in the correctional facility of Oswald. It tells the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hatred and survival at all costs. In a place like Oz you have to keep an eye in mind. <br /> <br /> This totally original, intelligent and captivating drama tells how twisted life becomes as soon as you step through the gates of Emerald City. <br /> <br /> What should be considered the most modern correctional facility is in fact far from it. The show highlights some of the many shortcomings in the prison system, the underestimation of humanity that cold, hard killers can still preserve, and the only fact is that the prisoners are the ones who control the prison. <br /> <br /> This great and somewhat surreal show shows the importance of life and helps to understand the reasons that most prisoners are there. This show may seem shocking at first, but to really say what it is like, it's necessary. <br /> <br /> Oz is a great depiction of hell on earth and as such a place teaches you some of the most important lessons you will ever learn.
