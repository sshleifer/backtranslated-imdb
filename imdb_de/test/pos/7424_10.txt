I used to enjoy "Happy Ever After", but was absolutely hypnotized by "Terry & June". After Aunt Lucy left, the emphasis seemed to be on the relationship between Terry and June, a middle-aged English couple, and I enjoyed it very much because I lost myself pretty happily in each episode. <br /> <br /> The 80s was the era of alternative comedy, but it was also the decade of choice - and Terry and June certainly matched traditional tastes. And mine - and I was also a big fan of "The Young Ones"! Every week, Terry got into a stupid situation and June was drawn into himself and usually had to get him out. How outdated the shows look today - it was a different world, but it's great fun to see trends from the 1980s - like the CB radio story of 1982 (CB radio was legalized in England in November 1981), in the Terry was imprisoned his car in a truck! I've seen the shows again on DVD lately and still find them great! Not loved by the enlightened elite - the clattering classes, but a big hit with the masses! Wonderful!
