It was obvious until the closing credits that this film was made in 1989, since all elements of its production were tuned to the 1960s - the acting, the characterizations, the sets and the props all had an aesthetics from an earlier time /> The film begins with the moments before the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects a family: a young woman, Yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. Even in black and white, and with special effects that are quite primitive, yet emotional and effective, by modern standards, the portrayals of the immediate consequences of the bomb are rather disgusting. Family members are becoming unrecognizable, while others are like zombies as they walk the streets and are in shock. <br /> <br /> The title refers to precipitation that fell shortly after the bomb mixed with radioactive ash which Yasuko is caught. Rumors that Yasuko was in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing are affecting her marriage prospects. Later, one learns that the black rain actually causes disease. The film not only looks at the physical impact of the bomb on the Japanese, but also at the social and psychological harm that has been done. <br /> <br /> I found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture. While the film deals primarily with the pain of a family, the gentle political message of the film is relevant today and probably forever - wars have terrible consequences and should not be considered unless it is absolutely necessary. It is said that history repeats, and the current leaders of the "Coalition of the Will" have learned nothing. While the nuclear war has not reappeared since 1945, other deadly repercussions have taken place. This movie is convincing to watch.
