I have always been a fan of Jackass, as have Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And if you're a fan of something, your expectations of whatever your "heroes" are leading to are high. And if there's something I've learned, if I've been expecting a lot from the people who just like to see you and never expect too much, because in 99 out of 100 cases, you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> When I heard that a Jackass 2 appeared, I thought, "Not even I can disclaim my expectations for this film," and as a result, I sat down today, ready to laugh, but ready to in the end saying, "Well, it was OK, but I'm a little disappointed." How was I wrong! Each member of the Jackass crew takes this movie far beyond the first one, showing you one crazy ass-stunt after another, making the whole world realize that there's nothing they do not want to do to hurt themselves - and we love that! I cried from the first minute and laughed from the first minute. Sometimes I even screamed with laughter and could not control myself until the last second of the movie! Stunt for stunt, prank for prank and funny comments on the river - it simply can not be better! Amazing from start to finish and you will be guaranteed to laugh. I have two more things to say; WATCH IT and PLEASE, let's have a Jackass 3 - these guys have a lot to offer!
