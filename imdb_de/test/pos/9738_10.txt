I originally saw the Flash Gordon series on PBS and thought it was funny and fantastic. I've missed the special effects of the rocket ships with sparklers and the big dragon monster with lobster claws, who cares that this is 1936. So every week they showed a new chapter: Buster Crabbe played three times Flash Gordon in all three series. Then in 1939 he played Buck Rogers, in 1933 he played Tarzan the Fearless. He was a very busy actor. Beautiful Jean Rogers played sexy dale Arden.frank Shannon as Professor Zarkov, and Charles Middleton played the evil with the merciless. He makes Darth Vader look like a boyscout. The series was very close to the Alex Raymond comic. Space travel was just a dream Not to mention the jet cannons and the television. This is the best series ever. The continuation of Gordon's journey to Mars is two chapters longer, the next flash conquers the universe in only 12 chapters. And then there are the natives of Mongo .., Hawkmen, Lion People, Hai-m The feature version omits the Hai-Men scenes. To see the full effect, you must see the complete series. I heard George Lucas was inspired by Flash Gordon when he starred in Star Wars. Flash was from Universal Studios. And the music on the soundtrack comes from many universal films like the Frankenstein Bride, the Werewolf of London, Dracula's Daughter, etc. Even today, Flash Gordon continues to delight young and old people. 10 out of 10.
