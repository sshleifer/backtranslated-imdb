I caught this movie about the most unlikely success? , from a lower league, football team. The plot is thick and rolls out some big, tough turns. Intercut with shots and comments from the 70s. I was stunned by his shear-footy fun. <br /> <br /> A great cast includes the excellent Tim Healy as the crazy (drunken) manager who drowns out all his team win ...? I keep reminding myself of pieces like the stolen secret file that has Don Revie (super leeds united and hated by the fans of all fans who are hated by everyone else) on Bostock United (the losing men) in this FA Cup -Final is just called "Sh-te". <br /> <br /> Many other footy gags long before the awesome feature film "Mike Basset - Football Manager" starring Ricky Tomlinson. <br /> <br /> Up there with the, Gung ho English vs German, football. Well, morally. Although the dotted lines are different, from "Escape to Victory" (I still applaud when England scores). from the "Ripping Yarns" series (with Terry Jones) was the team Bostonworth United, if you are interested. <br /> <br /> I was looking for a copy of the Bostock Cup - even Nick Hancock's biography Do not list it (probably someone - not Mr. Hancock's mistake) <br /> <br /> Play it again or sell me a copy - PLEASE ....
