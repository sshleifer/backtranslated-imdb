This movie is the most traumatic and painful horror movie I've ever seen in my life. Knowing that this film is based on a true story and seeing Jeffrey Dahmer (Carl Crew) brutally murder his victims is enough to make me cry. I admit, this was a low budget movie and not the best dialogue. However, he explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a psycotic madman. Being so selfishly inwardly emotional, his feelings and selfishness penetrated his brain so deeply that he became a murderer. Every person he lured into his home felt attracted to him and had feelings for it, and the reasons he murdered her were not just for the thrill of killing her, but because he could not overcome the fact that she was had left him. In the scene, when he killed his first victim by hitting an object behind the man's head, which I had not noticed, was not because he wanted to kill him, but because he was thinking of the man leaving him that was devastated. From then on, he got used to the murder behavior and brought him to death for evil and emotional reasons. <br /> <br /> The scene in which he talked on the phone while he talked to his mother and told her how much he loved her and what love he showed his grandmother and how he did not want to move out of her house that he had love in his heart. One scene that I found rather sinister and strange was when a priest heard Jeffrey in a pub, inviting a man to his apartment, and then calling him in a phone booth in the pub to make the guy lose patience and his Opinion changed home at Jeffrey. When the guy left the place, the priest hung up the phone and laughed at Jeffrey. I also found that Carl Crew played a remarkable acting performance as Jeffrey Dahmer. His evil and cold-blooded expressions before massacring his victims were so real that I shivered in my place. His facial expressions reminded me of what Vincent D'onofrio (Private Pyle / Leonard) looked like in the movie "Full Metal Jacket" just before he had gunned down the general in the toilet shack. <br /> <br /> If you're an emotional person, I would not recommend you to watch this movie, but if you do not, then keep watching.
