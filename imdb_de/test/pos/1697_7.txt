Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager holidaying in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy saves Serafine Pigot (the beautiful Julie Delpy) from suicide on the Eiffel Tour and has a crush on her. He does not know she is a werewolf. They go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. He is advised that the only way to get back to normal is to kill the werewolf who attacked him and eat his heart. This movie is a violent black humor movie. The special effects and soundtrack are excellent and underline the song of the band Bush. I do not know why some readers compare this film to the masterpiece "An American Werewolf in London". The stories have nothing in common (just an American teenager, werewolves and a city in Europe). Great for fans of werewolf and black humor films. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "To Lobisomem Americano em Paris" ("An American Werewolf in Paris")
