Series as a whole - Jim Henson's best work. John Hurt is the storyteller. Often Oscar-caliber scripts, not surprisingly, considering Minghella writing. Oscar-caliber acting, always. <br /> <br /> Sapsorrow - Everyone loves 'The Soldier and Death', but something about 'Sapsorrow' is pushing one iota higher in my favor. In the first ballroom scene the costumes, the music - perfection. Hurt and the dog usually interact halfway with the story, but this time Minghella pushes that extra notch in the ring scene between Hurt and Sapsorrow. The chemistry between the characters is particularly well developed, more than usual in the series, in terms of the friendship between Straggletag and the prince. Have seen it? Repeat it. Pay more attention to those who are not fanatically worshiping this 22-minute piece of cinematic perfection. I've never seen it I'm so sorry. <br /> <br /> Luck Child - not as demanding as Sapsorrow, but very smart for himself. This is a story about irony. Irony on irony, irony, I love it. With the exception of the ferryman, each character is perfectly represented. He made drama. Everyone else made a romantic comedy. I forgive him. This is my favorite of the mostly comedic episodes, with "Sapsorrow" and "The Soldier and Death" examples of more dramatic episodes. <br /> <br /> Note: Greek myths. What he lacks in Minghella subtlety (other writer) makes it sometimes daring, as it portrays the four chosen myths with more sympathy and respect and history than usual. Also, watch the Jim Henson Hour if you can get hold of it. For storyteller fans, there's the man himself who introduces the myths, the lions of "True Bride" and ... No annoying opening theme! Half storyteller, half-pure, unadulterated Muppet joke.
