A comment said it was not a comedy ... bugs! It was a delightful comedy from a time of history that is not so easy for this genre. Very busy ... and active film from start to finish. Often the shots from the window of the train or car were just beautiful. A pleasant way to spend a few hours in the theater. All the French historical figures, such as Charles de Gaulle and Petain and some of the people involved in the French Resistance, have been included in the script, which may be to investigate those unfamiliar with the collapse of France during the German invasion. The characters were captivating and the performers were outstanding. Recommend it, 9 out of 10.
