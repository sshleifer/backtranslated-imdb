*** Spoiler in fifth paragraph *** This was an amazingly open (uh-huh, uh-huh) image for 1955. Otto Preminger and Carlyle Productions took a chance by making a movie that openly exposed a junky who a syringe full of heroin thrusts into his arm. Frank Sinatra took the chance to play an addictive musician and fall on his face in a role that needed at least twice as much acting as never before. All in all, these games have paid off, the film is a classic, even if it is not perfect. <br /> <br /> Nelson Algren's novel may be great, but he has way too much to fit comfortably in a two-hour movie "The Man with the Golden Arm" lasts 119 minutes and often feels much longer. In my opinion, it is not just Frankie Machine (Sinatra) who produces the film, but also the other characters and their subplots that affect all of Frankie. After all, it is not just Frankie, who has the addiction, all and everything seems to be dependent on him and he feels it very much. When the pressure gets too high, the drums hit the soundtrack and Frankie steps across the street with his well-dressed "girlfriend" Louie. <br /> <br /> It is an exaggeration to say that Frank Sinatra's music career was actually really in the doldrums, but in the early '50s he was in abeyance between his big band tours and the Las Vegas era , "From Here to Eternity" established him as a serious actor and his career as a singer also recovered, but "The Man with the Golden Arm" was still a significant challenge, the whole show sinks or floats with his performance. He manages it with so much skill that for several minutes I've forgotten that I've seen Frank Sinatra, he must have known junk musicians and used that knowledge to the utmost. <br /> <br /> Sit side by side with Billy In Wilder's masterpiece "The Lost Weekend", the sociological causes of addiction in "The Man with the Golden Arm" are emphasized. While Don Birnem (Ray Milland in 'The Lost Weekend') tends to struggle against himself, Frankie Machine is plagued by outside forces and he grabs the needle. Neither approach is completely right or wrong, mostly because the addiction can not be fully explained, but it seems that the film has benefited from a little more insight into Frankie's inner struggle. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ** * One of the problems I have with this film is the cliched reliance on "Stop the cold turkey". I realize that 'The Man With The Golden Arm' is more likely to trend than follow, but that does not make it any better. At the beginning of the film, Frankie resigned with the help of a doctor and some kind of treatment facility. Of course, the film's drama requires it to fall behind, but I found the All-American ideal that a man does not have to cope with his problems alone (or perhaps with the help of a good wife). It was too unrealistic to drive the cold turkey into the sunset with Kim Novak. The end of 'The Lost Weekend' was similar, but in my opinion it was a little less rosy.
