I do not think I've seen a movie about a high school kid in his life that started his own college just to impress his parents. Nowadays, movies are either remakes or sequels or plots that have been used in many different films. This one has an original plot, and if you turn it into comedy movies, the deal just gets easier. With this thoughtful story and mixed in laughter, this is a good movie. Now I've seen better, but when I went to the theater, I thought of another drug / beer / frat party with a sexual allusion (aka "American Pie"), but I was surprised. To summarize: I enjoyed the movie and the next time you shuffle through the newspaper for movies, look for the Show Times under "Accepted". If you want to laugh out loud, then.
