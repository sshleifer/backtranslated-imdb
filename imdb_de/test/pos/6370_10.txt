Michael Ritchie's "The Couch Trip" is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It's so subtle and evil that you begin to realize what a stinging satire it really is. It is also Dan Akyroyd's best film, which was filmed for him in a particularly large film year (1988). First "The Great Outdoors" and now that. <br /> <br /> Akyroyd plays John Burns, a career crook who fakes madness to escape from prison. Well, a stupid comedy would only talk about it. However, "The Couch Trip" uses this as a springboard for everything else. Beverly Hills psychiatrist George Maitlin (Charles Grodin, here's a bit weird) has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is chosen: Lawrence Baird, who happens to be Akyroyd's psychiatrist! You can pretty much guess what's going to happen, but the great thing about "The Couch Trip" is not what happens, but how it's done. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he has ever had. John Burns is one of the most original comic book creations in film history. Wicked one liner and physical humor are a part of it, but the special thing about it is that it makes Akyroyd Burns a lovable character. We are rooted for him and become more popular in the 98-minute runtime. <br /> <br /> But Akyroyd is not alone here. He is strongly supported by other great comic actors. Walter Matthau joins the comedy as an art minister, who finds his way into the mystery of Burns and is tried out. Charles Grodin is slowly "burning" to another big comic role as the burned-out psychiatrist. Grodin was one of Hollywood's most underrated actors. It's criminal that they did not use it more often. Richard Romanus plays Grodin's Slimball lawyer to perfection. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" is one of many films of the now deceased Orion Pictures Corporation, which are currently not seen. MGM made a fortune to buy the Orion Library, but did not really make a profit from its acquisition. "The Couch Trip" is followed by "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out" and countless others who collect dust in the vault. Shame on MGM for their inactivity. With the new management, "The Couch Trip" will hopefully find and respect the audience that deserves it. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
