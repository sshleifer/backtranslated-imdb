After five minutes, I felt how easy it looked, you have a totally unhelpful hero and his overweight fool of a friend. I've seen everything before, yes, right. I was preparing to get bored out of my head for a few hours. That's something I've gotten used to ... we do not all have. Then, after a few minutes of testosterone, the truck came on. Okay, the shooting techniques that made it look fast were awkward, but who cares? This truck is incredible! But soon that's taken away and we're back to the geek and his overweight friend. But now I am satisfied that at least it will not be so bad. I am always surprised by the wisdom of the film. There are so many jokes at their expense, it is as if everyone in the world except the two is there. The mind behind the make-up and effects was a genius I swear. Believe me, if you are a man you miss so many jokes, there is so much here that only a girl can understand that finding everywhere, the fact that he is sewn together only adds to the effect. Of course, there are some really scientific facts, but that's not always the case. If our "hero" bleeds his nose and uses the blood to kill Brother Bob, it's garbage now. There is no way that a nosebleed can be so bad and does not mean a severed artery or something else. I'm busy with too much blood, but that's a bit too far. The incest jokes are a bit predictable, but still funny. And how brother Bob finds his end is more than classic. All in all, this film really ruled out the overclocked melodramatic horror that gave us so much in 2003-2005. The end of this step could not have been better. <br /> <br /> This is an absolute must for anyone who likes his horror with several gore subcultures and attitude.
