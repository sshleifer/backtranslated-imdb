This is not a movie I would normally see at 2:30 in the morning, but I got in and could not stop until the movie was over. Shia LaBeouf has shown that being not just a movie is a young actor here, but could handle more sophisticated roles. The fact that he has received these roles in the last two years is proof of his skill. <br /> <br /> It was really his movie.
