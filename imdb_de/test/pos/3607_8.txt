Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He does a good job as a title character. This is a romance against the background of a worn island. John Hurt's character gives some honest advice about love to his daughter, who is beautifully played by Penelope Cruz. This movie does not have the error of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to show a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the movie has warmed up beyond the opening sequence, you can focus on it. Again, Nicolas Cage did not disappoint.
