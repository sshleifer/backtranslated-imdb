This was a television program that I saw as a child in the 1960s and was intrigued by it. In the many years that have passed, I have often thought about this show and how good it would be to see it again, but I must remember that things of the past are not always as good as they are remembered. This was a great show in the 1960s and has not lost anything in 2007. Surely there are a few weird production errors seen when watching old shows, and it takes a few episodes to get used to the dubbed voices. After doing that, I was as fascinated now as I was in the 1960s. The samurai is played by Koichi Ose, who plays the role very humbly. I remember that in the 1960s the show was so popular here in Australia that he toured with sword games and so on and that the interest in the show and in him was overwhelmed. It was great that one of my favorite shows of all time still had the magic she had in my childhood. A series has to be seen.
