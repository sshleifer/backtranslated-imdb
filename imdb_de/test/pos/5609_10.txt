This is my favorite movie by Hal Hartley. All his films are little gems. I love independent movies and I hope Hal Hartley never becomes mainstream or sold. What if the Lord Jesus came back and loved his people so much that he could not open the last book and destroy the unbelievers? It was nice to see P. J. Harvey in a movie since I became a fan of her music. Do not look at it if you're a fan of Hollywood movies. You will be disappointed.
