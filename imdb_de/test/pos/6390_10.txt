It gives the ordinary man / woman the chance to sing on TV as favorite stars. <br /> <br /> For the majority of the time they sound like the singer they are supposed to represent. <br /> <br /> Another twist: A team of make-up people and costumes dress the participant like this singer. They may not look like them, but the likelihood of finding someone who looks like a person who looks exactly like them is very small. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun for your Saturday night - and the contestants are not 'the wild wannabe's like in another TV singing show. The fact that no prizes are involved and for fun means that it attracts a different group of people. <br /> <br /> The only criticism I have is the kids version - it looks like they did it Round of stage schools: what happened to the normal kids?
