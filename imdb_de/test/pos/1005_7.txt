In this TV special, Jon is the one who needs a life. The highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer. Not satisfied with it forever, Jon brings Garfield to a support group to meet people. How many people will be interested in a loner whose best friend is a cat? <br /> <br /> After several unsuccessful attempts to get a girl, including a sickly dance scene, David Brents' fusion of Flashdance and David Rents is similar to MC Hammer in The Office (disco is dead ?, says Jon), he is more than shocked to find a sweet girl as funny as he is. <br /> <br /> Of course they keep coming, but Garfield worries that John will forget him and he'd rather have children than a cat. Fortunately, Jon's new friend is allergic to cats. <br /> <br /> With a slicker animation like previous TV specials, this looks like a lengthy episode of Garfield and Friends.
