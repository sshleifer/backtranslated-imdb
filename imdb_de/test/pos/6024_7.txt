I own this movie and I love Canadian movies, but I'm building an actress like Rose I do not understand. She's totally useless in this movie, just a name that's all I was surprised by the plot that was not used for the first time. But these unknown actors were also very good at Jergen. I'm not a big fan of him, but I liked him in this movie. If you had the chance to see it
