This is a really sad and touching movie! It deals with child abuse. It's really sad, but mostly a true story because it happens every day. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello play the two children or Lorraine Bracco, a single mother who tries to give them a home. While living with her parents, a man who likes to be called "The King" comes into her life. He meets the youngest boy, Bobby, but the two brothers vow not to tell their mother. At last she learns that Bobby is seriously injured. The end ruined it for me because it's so incredible. But apart from that, I love the movie.
