When I grew up, Voyage into Space was my favorite movie. I remember the time when KTLA (Channel 5) ran the movie all week and my sisters and I saw it every day! I can still remember every part of this movie. The end was so sad when Giant Robot was blown up with Guillotine and then watched Johnny Sokko with all the tears running down his face calling for Giant Robot. There should have been a sequel to the film in which Giant Robot somehow survived the explosion. :) I can not believe that there are so many other Voyage into Space fans. I really want to buy the movie when it appears on DVD, but my sister said that the ones out there are Bootlegged and probably bad quality of the movie. I do not know why they have not published it yet, for over 40 years now. I think Voyage into Space was made in 1968. Only now my second favorite monster movie in Japan (The War of the Gargantuas) finally comes on DVD and will be released on September 9th. I can not wait any longer! :) Well, if only they would do the same with Voyage into Space. Giant Robot, Johnny Sokko and Voyage in the Space will never forget! In my eyes and probably many others, it will always be a classic of childhood for me! :)
