One of the main films by Alfred Hitchcock's director Alfred Hitchcock is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day and their young son) vacationing in North Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world-famous singer. You meet a Frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them with an incident on a local bus. Later, Frenchman Stewart whispers something in his ear after being attacked and died. The rest of the movie is a mystery as Stewart tries to rescue her and solve the puzzle. The film is full of mysteries and strangers from the exotic locale to the rare events. You never really know what's going on in this movie, why people appear, to the end, and even then you're not sure. The last scene is set in Albert Hall and is one of the most famous in the film, which lasts 12 minutes without dialogue. Hitchcock originally shot this movie in 1934.
