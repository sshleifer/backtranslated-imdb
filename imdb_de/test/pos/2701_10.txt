A must for every die-hard Carpenters fan! <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb plays a tremendous amount of justice in the role of KC, and while the "story" is not 100% factual, it still offers a good insight into the lives of both Richard and Karen and is worth a clock just for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> makes me cry every time !!! <br /> <br />
