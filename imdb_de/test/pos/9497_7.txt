I found this movie full of irony. But if you look at the movie, you can almost see what happens. Leila is a confused, bored housewife who is always looking for happiness. If she believes she finds true happiness, she clings to it and leaves behind everything she knew. But she herself almost finds the comparison between her ex and her current husband. She learned that once she had informed more about what had disturbed her in her previous marriage, she was much easier to rescue than she intended. She realizes that words are nothing without action, but she experiences this too far into her second marriage and finds herself back, hoping that she will change something again. The main conflict in this movie is Leila against herself. You can not be really lucky without being really happy. I liked this movie, but I would only recommend this movie to women. I can not see a man who really enjoys this movie.
