The War At Home is so good that it has become my new favorite show. My and my neighbors Carly and April look at each other every Sunday and laugh at how alive it is. Every little problem. Once someone does something stupid, they never live and that's the way the family is. The father always waits for every little thing with all three children. It's so true for real family life, and the fact that parents are so overwhelmed and have no idea how to solve the problems of their teens puts the show just beyond the top in which it has become a milestone for sitcoms. This is not Happy Days or The Brady Bunch, that's real life.
