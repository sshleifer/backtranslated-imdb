This movie is simply one of the best movies I can own. It took me years to develop this film and it was worth it. The film is said to be anti-drug propaganda, but turns even in the middle of the film to the opposite. The pleased expression on the faces of the players in getting their drug with drugs is gratifying to all who see. Heroin has its say until the end of her drugged life. YIKES! This is the anti-drug message that was so fabulously sought. The soundtrack for this movie is the blast! By far one of the best albums by Pink Floyds! Take a look at the opportunity, listen and experience a spectacular movie.
