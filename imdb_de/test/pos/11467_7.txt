PUBLIC ENEMIES is a throwback to the gangster biographies of the early 1960s such as PORTRAIT OF A MOBSTER, MAD DOG COLL and KING OF THE ROARING TWENTIES. Although cheap, the movie has a lot of energy and the acting, especially by Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone, is pretty good. Theresa Russell may seem too glamorous as Ma, but she has some very good moments. There are two action scenes worth mentioning: a shoot-out in a hotel and a machine gun fight in the middle of the road between the Barkers and the FBI. Both sequences are well done, and this movie shines in comparison to other low-bids mobsters like DILLINGER AND CAPONE.
