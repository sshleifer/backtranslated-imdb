There are films that are just another version of another, not remakes, but it's not like others. Although it talks about mafia, it is observed in other ways and often seems to be just a secondary issue. I watched the film to look at the case (because the other's theater was busy) and I was satisfied in the end. It surprised me because of its black irony or cynicism and there are always more interesting things to analyze. It does not follow the classic ways of movies, it's just different and I think I'm not the only one who likes that. I am also very happy because it is Italian and I was afraid that Italian directors and producers were not brave enough to change the subject. In this film you can also see new Italian style, but are not blocked in stereotypes. I hope to be understandable enough, I know that it is difficult, I also hope that this film can be exported from our borders, it is a good product for export. I also want to point out the music, a very good soundtrack, the movie needs him for his long silent break and they are perfectly covered by this music. Many compliments to the director and thank you, cinema needs these films.
