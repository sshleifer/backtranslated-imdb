I think the filmographic line could work that way. Please pay attention, because I had to look it up. In 1967, the ex-car racer Peter Yates directs the English film "Robbery". The most exciting part of it is a chase through the streets of London, through alleys in which many children play, and all that. It's a success. <br /> <br /> A year later, Yates directs "Bullet" with Steve McCool, I mean McQueen, with an even more spectacular chase through the San Francisco Hills, with amazingly authentic engine sounds. This seems to be dual clutch, full camshafts, no mufflers, twelve-cylinder engines under forty foot hoods, supercharged, overcharged compressors, and all five thousand horsepower running at full tilt. Many shots of McQueen's chewing gum chewing in concentration as he tries to push another car off the highway, even though a passenger in the other vehicle holds a shotgun. The hunt is staged by Philip D'Antoni. Bill Hopkins drives the criminal vehicle. <br /> <br /> One or two years later, when Bill Goodkin manages a good cause, he directs "The French Connection," a chase between a police car (Gene Hackman) and a raised car train in New York City. Many shots of Hackman's cursing face as he wrestles the battered car through the streets. The hunt is staged by Philip D'Antoni. Academy Awards follow. <br /> <br /> One good thing to feel brings one or two more years "The Seven Ups" with a chase between a car being driven by Roy Scheider, with many shots of Scheider's cursing face Another car being driven by Bill Hopkins is hurling off the street, though the criminal car may drag a passenger with a gun. No hills in New York City, just bumps, but they're still sharp enough to lift the cars a few feet. The pursued car screeches around a corner and races down a street where a dozen children are playing. Shots of the screaming children as they scatter from the sidewalk and let the car zoom. But once is not enough. The children immediately run back into the street and have to repeat the retreat for the pursued police car with Scheider. <br /> <br /> I witnessed a high-speed persecution on the streets of Philadelphia. Both the criminals and the policemen drove through the streets at a speed of about 40 km / h and came to rolling stops with each stop sign and red light - very boring compared to this film. <br /> <br /> Speaking of film, It's very good. "Robbery" and "Bullet" were cool. Everyone was dressed properly. But the New York movies are dirty. Everywhere is garbage, and the subway cars are covered with graffiti. Shootouts and beatings take place on uninhabited land surrounded by decaying brick buildings or in landfills for industrial freezers. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is pretty good too. Roy Scheider seems to be smooth. The other actors have made faces for the camera, especially Richard Welsh. And the story is captivating, if not completely unknown. The best part about this film is the way it conquers New York City in its almost total indifference to human degradation and nobility. At a funeral, the limousine drivers stand around with their collars raised, their butts hanging out of their mouths, kicking their cold feet and getting bored with the rituals. The movie wants us to believe that The Seven Ups is an elite group of untouchable police officers who stop at nothing to get the job done, and here it's a bit out-selling. They always seem threatening to do something immoral and illegal - to beat hell out of a suspect or physically damage a hospitalized and helpless hood - but they always manage to avoid it. (If indeed they did, their characters would become lifelike and ambiguous, and we'd rather have our heroes and villains of a more biblical nature.) Very enjoyable, even if you've seen it before, and you may well have the one or the other others of their previous incarnations.
