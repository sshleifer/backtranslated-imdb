"Sort of Nula" is Portuguese box office's # 1 box office of 2004. This extremely low budget production (estimated at $ 150,000) was opened at Christmas alongside American blockbusters such as National Treasure, Polar Express, The Incredibles and Alexander, but quickly aroused enthusiasm the Portuguese moviegoers. Despite the fierce competition, the small film has done surprisingly well, outperforming all the other Portuguese films of the past two years in the first few weeks. The film is a mystery / murder with a humorous tone cleverly written by Fernando Fragata, who has become a fixture in the European independent film arena. Did I like the movie? Oh yeah!
