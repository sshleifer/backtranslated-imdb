When we're young, we all choose an ideal job for ourselves: artists, actors, writers, rocket scientists, etc. While most of us grow out of our pipe dreams, the main character of American Movie, Mark, still has not let go of it (And even at the age of just over thirty years): to become a wealthy, acclaimed director. Despite the fact that Murphy's Law does not leave Mark alone and things always seem to go awry, Mark is able to persevere in any deterrent incident, with even greater drive to achieve his goals. His desire to be a director controls his character in such a way that he understands every person or thing in his life as something he uses to achieve the goal. While I notice other IMDB commentators beating up Mark's egoism, I think that this is an almost legitimate kind of selfishness, since Mark does not mean becoming a famous director. He's always talking about leaving a mark on the world, and he sees filmmaking as a way to do it. Unfortunately, every viewer of this movie early on attracts the fact that Mark does not have a chance to ever reach his dream. Is he aware of this? No, not in the least, and none of his family or friends wants to initiate him into the mystery (in fact, even some of them believe in him). Strangely enough, the disappointing future that Mark considers safe for Mark does not hinder the ability to find humor in the film. This is a very funny documentary. Most laughs come when Mark turns scenes for "Coven". There is a scene where an actor has to break his head in a cupboard, and it just does not work. In another scene, Mark's old uncle Bill says a few lines into the camera. Needless to say, Bill finally decides after 20 shots of headaches and slings that he has had enough. Unfortunately, humor comes from Mark himself. His screenplay, which he believes is worthy of a Pulitzer, is laughingly miserable: "It's okay, it's okay, there's something to live for, Jesus told me. " "American Movie" Contrary to what people might think is a documentary that everyone can enjoy (though my sister, who has seen some scenes, thought it was downright bizarre). The fact that Chris Smith can successfully bring a movie to the screen that inspires both the sadness of Mark's depressing lifestyle and the scenes with Bill (who unfortunately died before the release of the film) says a lot about him. I wonder how the dreamer Mark looks at this documentary. Does he realize that it casts him in a bad light? Or that it aims to show him as a fool in many scenes of the movie? Or does he see it as something being shown in front of his own A & E biography segment? It's a fascinating subject of wonder, and I hope the latter will one day come true for him. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie: 9/10.
