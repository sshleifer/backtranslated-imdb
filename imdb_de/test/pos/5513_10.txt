Honestly, this is one of the BEST horror movies I have ever seen. I was intrigued by the story, petrified by Captain Howdy and on the edge of my seat during the entire journey. I do not really understand the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> The setup has already been discussed in detail; Captain Howdy is an online predator who arranges meetings with teenagers, kidnaps them, and introduces them to his favorite body modification and piercing work. Dee Snider is Captain Howdy and he's one of the scariest psychopaths ever created. maybe the scariest thing about it, because it's so human and you feel (especially if you're dealing with physical changes at all) that there really are people in the world movie and the reason why it's so awful is that Captain Howdy becomes a hero. At the beginning of the film, the roles are clearly defined; The victims are innocent, the policeman is the good and Howdy is the pure evil. Things have changed a bit in the second act. They want Howdy to be evil, but it turns out that he's really just a victim of the circumstances and maybe the good and the bad are not obvious. It's scary to cheer for the "bad guy". <br /> <br /> A few people have mentioned that Strangeland should be split into two separate films. While there are definitely two acts, this movie works so well because the two acts are back to back. The first act is the typical psychological thriller, but the second act is the most disturbing due to the viewer's reaction to the situation. I do not think it would have worked that way if the second act were expanded and made a sequel. <br /> <br /> As a great horror movie fan I recommend this movie. It's the first horror movie that gave me ALL nightmares.
