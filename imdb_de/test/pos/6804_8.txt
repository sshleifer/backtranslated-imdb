In the 13 years of my schooling, from kindergarten to high school, there was only one day my class went on a field trip. When I went to school, you went to school from 8:30 to 3:30 and there were no guided trips. But for some reason that I could not remember at this advanced age, we went to a movie - National Velvet. I can not remember the movie, so on the eve of my 57th birthday, I decided to rethink it. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about a time that does not exist anymore. A time when people trusted others and did not close their homes. A time when people benefited from the doubts. It was a time when the family was the most important thing. This movie shows all this and more. It shows love and trust and caring and goodness of the people. <br /> <br /> It would not be bad for any family to watch this movie from time to time and discuss its message. <br /> <br It was a pleasure to see the young Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney at his best, the Academy Award winning Anne Ride, Angela Lansbury before Murder, She Wrote and Donald Crisp performing for almost 60 years /> <br /> What a movie!
