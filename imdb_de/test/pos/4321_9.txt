The writers of Lost have outdone themselves. The season two finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the first season finale. Locke's lack of faith has not only led to spiritual consequences for himself, but also to tragic physical consequences for the lives of other competitors. Michael's betrayal was a success for him, but could he possibly escape the island? He has to, if he wants to stay alive. I do not doubt that one or more of his former friends would kill him in revenge. This final has more questions than the previous final. and I can not wait to fall off. <br /> <br /> One side note: What is the point when posting a rating just to advertise all spoilers? Where is the joy of ruining the surprise for everyone else? The current test on this page is nothing but a big, thick spoilerfest, poorly built in barely legible English with the explicit purpose of driving somebody crazy. Well done.
