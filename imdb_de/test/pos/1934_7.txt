In one of Lionel Barrymore's last films, "Ten Cents a Dance", Barbara Stanwyck plays the role of the dance hall girl "Barbara" in her sixth role. Stanwyck looks pretty "plain" in this case and starts when she's chewed by the Dance Hall manager. Then comes the rich guy Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez), who wants to sweep her off her feet. (Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s.) Then she meets Eddie, who is very different from the barren Carlton. The writer, Jo Swerling, had been working on biggies (It's a wonderful life, boys and dolls and Gone with the Wind). I was surprised that the characters and the script were so normal. The story begins halfway interesting and is VERY similar to the "The Bride Walks Out" of 1936, also with Stanwyck ... T.B.W.O. is much smarter, but also tamer, because the Hays code was beaten ...
