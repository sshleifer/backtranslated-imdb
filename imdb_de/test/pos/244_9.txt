This must be one of Columbia's better post-Astaire musicals. Produced by Arthur Schwartz and directed by Charles Vidor, this image placed Gene Kelly on the map, cementing Rita Hayworth's reputation as the cinema's premier dance partner. She plays a double role here as she plays contemporary numbers with Gene and co-star Phil Silvers, but also puts her in the role of her grandmother, a late-night nightclub performer. <br /> <br The music should also be highlighted, as I believe this was the last project worked on by the legendary Jerome Kern (now famous for "Old Man River" and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes") and his lyricist was the same legendary Ira Gershwin. They delivered a score full of charm and characterization. The music for the historical sequences is particularly notable because it was so perfectly designed in the early 20th century language, which was the core of primeval times. It's a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the '70s and listening to them make a song in the original style of the time. <br /> <br /> The story is quite consistent, which is fine with me because this movie is an approximation you'll see from the Golden Age of Broadway in the 1930s / 40s with musical comedy in the movie. Even the war propaganda aspects of 1940s film music add a special charm to the film as the talented trio sings "room for tomorrow" and even humorously makes fun of America's enemies and uses an episode slang such as "Gremlins". <br /> <Probably the most memorable performance in the film is Kelly's dance to "Alter-Ego Dance", which quarreled with him as a metaphorical image of the struggle of conscience and then let him dance with himself. This will be a major part of his later work and will be an effective and memorable scene in itself. <br /> <br /> Fans will want to search for this for a variety of reasons - Kelly fans will see this as a rare opportunity See it outside the boundaries of MGM with another group of co-stars and music that is superior to its usual MGM material. Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in glorious color at the height of her fame and skill. Fans of classic Broadway musicals will definitely want to hear Kern's final score and admire the quality of Gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. This is an absolute gem in the crown of Columbia's music program.
