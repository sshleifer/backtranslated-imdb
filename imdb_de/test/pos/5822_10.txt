Oz is one of the most impressive and addictive TV experiences ever. <br /> <br /> After catching it on SBS, I was skeptical at first. Unfortunately, after completing Season 4, I know that this ingenious show is nearing its end (6 seasons), and yet I still can not get enough of OZ. <br /> <br /> Do you want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limit ... Oz adapts to the bill. <br /> <br /> This is not the stuff for kids, people, it's violent, brutal and not pretty. It is an experimental unit in a prison with maximum security. <br /> <br /> Tom Fontanas Oz is brilliant in all the right departments, actors, writing and directing. <br /> <br /> HBO's Oz website is also highly recommended for new arrivals for information on this series. This was the first one-hour show produced by HBO and it shows what a masterpiece this is and others will follow. <br /> <br /> Thank you, HBO
