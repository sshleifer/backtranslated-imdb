Do you remember the college friend who always insisted on renting the weirdest movie possible? That would be the movie he would have made if he had the chance. I wish I could tell you exactly what Sea of ​​Dust was about. It pretends to be the story of a doctor who is involved in strange processes in the Black Forest. He goes there to help, but ends up between two young women for whom he seems to have something. But that just scratches the surface. This is the kind of movie where things happens to happen by accident ... and not a nice thing. People are constantly flogged and stabbed. There are a few scary little girls who seem to have gone out of shining. Tom Savini is a kind of imaginary religious figure who decides not to be imaginary anymore. He has a plan to take over the world by sharing the suffering of Jesus. <br /> <br /> In a way, this is a movie about sex. It's one without nudity, which was a disappointment, but the intent is unmistakable. On another level, it is a paradise for Steinhauer. Unexpected stuff happens so often that it does not come unexpectedly. By the time the doctor travels through his girlfriend's birth canal to be reborn, it is simply made known by the wacky nature of the strip. <br /> <br /> One downside is the movie. Some points are hammered home again and again. If you see it with a few fossilized friends, this could be a win.
