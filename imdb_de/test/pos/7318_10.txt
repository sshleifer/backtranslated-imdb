This is one of the best shorts by Stooges. It was the only one of her shorts that was nominated for an Oscar. In this short film, the Stooges play doctors who cause trouble as usual. This short film has uninterrupted visors, puns and jokes. The part at the end where the Stooges break the machine apart. This is definitely a classic. I would recommend this to Three Stooges.
