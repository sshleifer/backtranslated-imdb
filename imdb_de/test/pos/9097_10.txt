Just go this movie. It takes on everything rock and roll has to offer, and the band boasts great songs (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder, etc.). All this with the humor of Teancous D makes this movie the best movie ever. <br /> <br /> The cameos are great on the back. Meat Loaf and Dio sing to JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are great, I really like Tim Robbins character. You also learn who Satan really is! The musical and musical references are funny and ingenious. Playin songs The great songs of The Who, Dio and others complete the whole thing. Personally, I did not think the band could beat the D's great songs, but they did have songs like Classico and Master Exploder. Really great music. <br /> <br /> Just to see, it's a must for anyone who loves rock!
