Apart from the fact that the women in the film are breathtakingly beautiful and all camp prisoners are too fat, this film looks like the post-war chaos of the Polish national character. <br /> <br /> It's very slow at points, but its pace is so different from American and Western European movies that it's quite refreshing. Both protagonists do a very good job. On the DVD version you can see interviews with the main actors and the crew, and the main actress Stanislawa Celinska has gained around 50 pounds and lost all her beauty. But in 1970 she was a stunner.
