A great movie. Every moment was masterfully managed by Toyoda and his crew. The actors give credible performances everywhere. The visuals are haunting, beautiful and sometimes hauntingly beautiful shots of the rural and urban landscapes of Japan. The sounds that were provided by the Japanese band 'Dig' are never too nervous, as one would expect from bands making soundtracks. It's strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes they are in right now. <br /> <br /> All in all, they have settled everything perfectly ... If they were to bring justice to history, perfection would be the only thing anyone could have accepted. <br /> <br /> The true magnitude of 9 Souls is the captivating story. The prison-break movie may be a lost genre these days, and road-trip movies are losing their appeal as the world gets smaller and smaller. But this story easily mixes something new to these two genres. <br /> <br /> 9 Detainees are given freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their place in society. Will society accept her? Will they really be free from their dark past? and can they stick together long enough to stay alive and find out? <br /> <br /> Every convict has an interesting story. Her crimes are as different as her apparent fates. A feeling of brotherhood among them keeps the story up in the drama and gives them funny and funny situations. And because of the nature of their backgrounds, violence is always something that just waits to happen.
