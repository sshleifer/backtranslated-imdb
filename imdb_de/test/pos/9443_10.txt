Even an old cynical DOCTOR WHO fan like me can be breathless when watching a episode of my favorite show. It happened earlier during the Eccleston finals and it happened to watch this episode. It's not often, but The Impossible Planet is an example of both the show and television in its best form. This is a stunning TV. The doctor and his companion end up in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience (many of whom will move behind the sofa) are immediately tied up. A door opens and terrible monsters pursue the time travelers. In the original show, this may have taken a full 25-minute episode, but all this takes place in the title sequence. You may miss the longer format of the original show, but at least this new series is closely plotted, and if we have a disappointing story, it's usually only for a week. <br /> <br /> There is nothing disappointing a spectator here. It is DOCTOR WHO from its most traditional side. Writer Matt Jones and director James Strong have done everything to write a story that will last for years to come. They do this by constructing a fateful narrative. The doctor and the rose lose the tardis and they stay with the protagonists in the distant future. It's interesting how many stories never have that kind of plot where the doctor and his companions no longer have access to the Tardis, creating a more intriguing kind of story. No doubt the highlight is the scene where Scooti searches for Toby to stand him on the surface of the planet, where he turns around and beckons her outside. Everything from Actors, Make-up and Murray Gold's music makes this scene a scene that really shocks the audience. <br /> <br /> Immediately after this episode I can imagine that the BBC switchboards received a tsunami of complaints in which accused parents say how traumatic their children are. That they took several hours to bring them out from behind the family sofa, and that now they refuse to sleep without light. To complain, one would deny the magic of DOCTOR WHO. Yes, it can be terrible and yes, such pictures will burn into a child, something they will never forget even when they turn 100 years old. But I bet my life that those "traumatized" kids spent the whole week begging to see the next episode
