I'm a fan of B-class movies of the 80s, where the hero is a bit of a villain, a strong man who finds love - and this movie delivers! how Sharky is not killed (and he does not let himself be beaten! Realistic, I think). But he does and it's not an exaggerated "The Hard" stunt. The 'past it' team he works with comes together, hence the title. His team is made up of characters who work at the same time because they do not quite adapt. These depictions are funny and sympathetic - they have a real feel. You're dealing with an assassin's iceman, with a good in-house team. The result is a great movie noir.
