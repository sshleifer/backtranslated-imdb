Careful, My Lovely is an experimental 1950s studio movie directed by Harry Horner, known for his stage sets. Robert Ryan plays a craftsman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do housework for her. The problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and does not know it. Miss Lupino is a sensitive soul and tries to win Ryan for little success. He is not the kind of person who can help or heal compassion. So we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can not do well because something is wrong with him. He suffers from periodic power outages, in which he commits acts of violence, which he later forgets. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the effect that Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and his prey or, in another sense, a sadist. The audience learns early that Ryan is a crazy assassin, but Lupino takes much longer. So we have to live with that knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try her best to 'win' Ryan to make things work, get the job done, and make life better. But getting on with things is not Ryan's makeup, since he's incapable of doing anything except the most rudimentary forms of normalcy, and as soon as there's an opening, his paranoia prevails. <br /> <br /> As a study on mental illness, the film is not particularly impressive. It is superlative to point out the effects of a serious mental illness with dangerous psychopathology and its effects on a normal person. In this regard, the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical, that we know that Lupino can not "fix" Ryan, but we want her to do it. If you want, you can get emotionally involved in this movie if you can put aside its melodramatic structure, so to speak. Horner gradually shows us the layout of Lupino House, a forbidden gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We are familiar with staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we learn which windows Miss Lupino can and can not use to escape.
