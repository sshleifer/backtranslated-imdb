It is difficult today and in the US to understand this movie. We really have nothing to compare with it. Here is a comparative experiment: It is as if a filmmaker in Iraq in the last few years of Saddam's reign somehow made a film showing, for the first time, life as it was really lived in that country. The life of an ordinary young girl, with all the terror and oppression. Then the film was freely exhibited in Iraq. If you could imagine this unlikely event, you may have an idea of ​​what was going on with the film in the last years of the Soviet Union. Prior to this film, Soviet cinema was heavily censored. Soviet films would only show an ideal life in the workers' paradise. Then suddenly that. The alcoholism, the random sex, the ugly wasteland of the Soviet city, the stifling pollution, the proletariat, which falls victim to each other and himself, the utter hopelessness - everything is there. The people were stunned. Soviet women often cried during performances. Many would say that this is the story of their lives. It was a cultural earthquake that filmmakers can only dream of. Undoubtedly, it accelerated the dissolution of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> When I read the reviews here, I see that only a few understand this film. It is said to be groundbreaking because it contained real sex. For the then Soviet viewers, gender was an insignificant event compared to the fact that for the first time it showed the reality in Soviet cinema. <br /> <br /> Others compare it to current films like "As Good As It Gets". Could compare Homer's Illiad with the latest John Grissam novel. They just do not compare. This is not just a movie, but a social document and a changing social force. It has to be seen that way, or you will not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers see it as a movie about a dysfunctional Russian family. It is even said that it is difficult to pity Vera because she keeps coming back to her family. The point is that Vera and her family are symbols of the entire Soviet life. There was nowhere to go because the family was the same down the block and in the next town. For most people, this was life in the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> This is a film that can be seen on many levels: as a drama it draws the landscape of despair, as a social document it shows the living conditions of the time, as a political document it shows the attitude of the people and many reasons for the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and as a moral document it shows the evils of a runaway dictatorship and the atrocities that the victims inflict on one another. <br /> <br /> Little Vera clearly shows the human toll that socialism ultimately inflicts upon its victims, despite all the good intentions of the system. In this way, the Soviet regime could be ended, which contributed to one of the most important changes in modern history. This film achieves what few films have ever achieved. Not only is it an impressive account of history, but it has also become a force in this historical story.
