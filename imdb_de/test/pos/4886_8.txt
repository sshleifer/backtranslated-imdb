I had only seen five episodes of the series before (I watched the repeats on BBC Two). I did not really have much experience in the league, but as a young fan and as a big fan of British comedy. I can say that this movie is hilarious. Mr. Lipp (who I did not see on screen before the movie) saw Briss and Geoff on the big screen, was a great comedy experience. Being on the screen is something the league exploits to the full, with heads flying (it's a surprise who it is) and cruel murders with random all-style medieval brawls. > Geoff is by far the funniest character of the three protagonists in this film, as he has the best liners and overall behavior as in the series. One of my only disappointments with the movie was that Geoff did not even hear "Well, I've heard this gun" (though there's an accumulation in one part of the movie) to use the phrase everyone else uses , Pythonesque, and it is very reminiscent of movies like "Life of Brian". Performances by Tubbs and Edward were welcome, but Papa Lazarous's line "Hello Daves" killed me more than anything that was said of them (Lazarou is after Tubbs and Edward probably my favorite character in Vasey) character, and I can only hope that this is not the league's last Vasey project. Since Gatiss has mentioned the possibility of another series or a movie, I'm very excited now. This is a movie I'm going to see again, partly because the projector died towards the end and left out about 10 minutes of the movie, but mostly because it's resourceful and hilarious. I do not really bother if it's not as good as the TV series because I loved it. <br /> <br /> One thing, if you've never seen the league, you'll still love it, but Dave knows what you think of the people who do this stuff. As Tubbs or Edward might say, it's a local movie for locals and a valuable thing. <br /> <br /> **** out of ***** (4/5)
