As a child, I have never been in a situation where I have dr. Who could be introduced, and although I had heard in passing from the series, I was never really sure what it was. With some hesitation, I sat down to watch as the ninth doctor and his antics were told he was something like Arthur Dent (from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), but cooler. I can not believe what I have missed so far, why had nobody told me before? My entire childhood was robbed of Doctor Who adventures. I'm a big fan of most sci-fi and fantasy adventures. Honestly, I enjoyed it very much and look forward to future episodes. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that at first I was not so sure that Billie Piper would be the best actress, but I'm glad to say that. She worked very well, I thought and added to the series a very realistic touch. I think that was actually one of my favorite aspects of the series; The contrast between great extraterrestrial conflict scenes contrasts with the annoying normality of the South London Council Estate. I am always interested in cases where people's ideas about the world are drastically challenged, and how people can accept any situation and work on it in their minds to fit into their earthly life. I also loved Christopher Eccleston. I have not seen many of his films, and I've never had another actor as Dr. Who saw, but I thought that his portrayal of the doctor was brilliant, immensely sympathetic and yet so dark that one can wonder. I find that many other characters are a bit two-dimensional with his character story. They all have the right emotions and actions, but they always seem a bit superficial. This doctor, on the other hand, acquired my loyalty with his layered personality. I agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for the special effects, aliens and so on, might have been a little more effective. On the other hand, it's not about special effects (though they help) from what I've heard from longtime Drs. Who fans have read and heard. It is the spirit of all things that really counts. And I do not think they did a bad job with what they had. I really liked all the aliens, but my favorite was the Daleks. If I ever talk about Dr. Who knew, before he saw the show, were things that looked like overturned garbage cans on wheels. Before watching, I was quite skeptical about those pepper heads that threatened humanity's existence, but some were pretty scary! Which I loved, of course. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good show. I'm looking forward to future episodes. The doctor has a new fan.
