What can I say about this band, I was addicted, I was a ten year old, I grew up in blues, though my dad, then these guys came from the Midlands, a mix of country rock, heavy rock and blues, I wish I could have seen her live in the early years. I was fortunate to be in 79 (Knebworth). It was the best concert I have seen so far. I hope a full version of this hot August night will be real soon. This CD gave me a chance to see the guys over and over again. The song is still the same, but this CD gets to the point. <br /> <br /> Long live the Zepp.
