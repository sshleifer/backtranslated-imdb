LIFEFORCE is an extremely schizophrenic film based on Colin Wilson's novel The Space Vampires. The script ignores most of the concepts and structures of the novel (in fact, it owes the QUATERMASS series more than the novel), but the scenes in which it leaves the novels are almost identical to those in the film. And when we talk about the script, it has to be one of the most irregular in cinematic history, even though it has been written by different people in chapters. Take, for example, Carlson, he disappears after the early shuttle scenes that made me believe he was dead. Then, halfway through the movie, he reappears to explain the plot to the troubled Brit, and this is a lack of attention Scriptwriters that spoils the movie. And there are many other clumsy scripts, like the heroes who return to London by helicopter and do not realize that they have been run over by zombies until they fly over it. <br /> <br /> I could go on making great lengths about these storylines, but LIFEFORCE is really enjoyable as long as you do not use your brain. It's nice to see a sci-fi horror movie from a time when aliens were portrayed as cute creatures hiding children in their bedrooms so that evil human adults would not get their hands on them. The special effects and pyrotechnics are very good, there is plenty of action and stunts, and LIFEFORCE is one of the Space World's most memorable aliens. When I mention LIFEFORCE in conversation with men, it's always a race to say, "See the alien in LIFEFORCE? It can deprive me of vitality anytime." Unsurprisingly, if you look at the demographics of the voices that make this movie more popular with men than women <br /> <br /> "Do not worry, a naked girl can not escape here." Too bad <br /> <br />
