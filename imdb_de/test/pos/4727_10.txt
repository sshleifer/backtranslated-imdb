Chris Noth plays a maniac who wrote a children's book as a young lad and poses as a doctor threatening a community to drive his sister's son into the position of the genius of his school. The only man who can stop him is a policeman who plays by his own rules and is covered with the help of his dumb father who communicates via the oujii board. Will Rick Springfield find out what's going on? Or will someone sabotage his recording studio! Does the mentally retarded boy who operates the bookmobile have any clues? Look at that! I do not believe that!
