I read some reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous Karate Kid rates. Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt that this fourth part of the film series was in line with the others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike the previous versions, the karate student is a teenager who chooses a slightly different learning path than a male teenager. Maggi finds this a bit more challenging, but takes the opportunity. The changes of action are credible and predictable. I've found that the bad guys are a little one-dimensional, but this weakness is present in varying degrees in all rates. The camera work is impressive and pans over beautiful landscapes from time to time. The Zen Monastery is austere and charming. The Zen monks add humor and lightness to the narrative flow. I liked the "Zen Bowling" scenes, which are a humorous counterpoint to the more serious Zen archery scene. The quality level of the movie is like a good TV series. The music chosen for the background is very good, especially when the Little River Band plays "Listen to Your Heart". The lessons in the film are valuable and worthwhile. They are faithful to the spirit of karate and are careful not to glorify the fighting part. All in all, I liked it.
