We enjoy a movie like "Fame" because we imagine ourselves there - music, dance and drama students enjoying our self-expression. This movie was full of humor and entertainment and must be an inspiration to young people to devote to the performing arts. Bravo "Fame". Surely worth 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Chris
