It's a shame that such an important movie is virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> I do not think Alan Bates made a better movie than this one. <br /> <br /> It's never shown on TV. The only time I can remember that it was shown on British TV was in the summer of 1998. I recorded it on tape, but unfortunately the quality is not great at the time due to a dodgy antenna ... < br /> <br /> I remember that I wanted to see this movie for a while before it appeared on TV. It was shown on Channel 4 early in the morning, ensuring that it was still not seen except for a very small audience. <br /> <br /> I lived in Bristol then and it was ironic that when I finally saw the movie, I realized that I had passed the VERY house, where it had been filmed several times !! The film makes a fine line; a couple trying to clarify the tragic situation of coping with their severely mentally disabled daughter by laughing at it and even involving the kid in his joke film is always compassionate and moving and never runs the risk of falling into bad taste. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I saw a clip of filmed theater production with Eddie Izzard playing Bri and Victoria Hamilton Sheila. <br /> <br /> It turned out that Izzard was improvising and loitering and Hamilton jokingly urged the audience to ignore him if he is like that. <br /> <br /> I may take this out of context, just as I've only seen a short clip, but after reading the piece and watching the movie, this is obviously such a tricky subject that one Approach is both insensitive and disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Izzard was praised for his performance, but I felt uncomfortable with what I saw. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps surprising that such a successful piece could not find an audience when it was finally filmed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best British movies of the 70's and will hopefully one day be released on DVD.
