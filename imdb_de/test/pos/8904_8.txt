... but I laughed. A lot of. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Astérix et les Vikings' at a public screening during the World Cup. The sound was lousy, it was too bright to see the screen properly - but I still had a good time. The names of some characters made me roll on the floor: Smsix, Abba, Vikea ... all not very funny, but in good Astérix tradition. Some very good jokes, but also some that not everyone seemed to get. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was the votes of Astérix and Obélix, at least in the German version. The speakers are very well known all over the world, which is why they were really only cast. They do not suit the characters at all. All in all, a great way to spend some time (and if it's free, in my case, so much the better) and to have a few laughs 8 out of 10.
