With boundless raw energy and an uncompromising vision, Talk Radio brilliantly explores the public's preference for transforming the private problems of strangers over the radio into entertainment. Eric Bogosian is sensational like Barry Champlaine, a your-face talk radio host. He's a natural for this kind of role and tunes off one of the most impressive, interesting radio personalities I've ever seen on screen. The timing and transmission of his insults to his various callers are geniuses. Alec Baldwin also shines as Barry's boss. He demonstrates the same explosive cynicism he would later portray Glengarry Glen Ross in 1992. But the supporting role that really stands out is the stoned, seemingly brain-dead teenager, played by Michael Wincott. You have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do a great job with photography, which is almost exclusively limited to a single TV room. The claustrophobic feel of the film perfectly reflects its tone. After all, one of the main points of the film is to use people's private moments to entice an audience. Stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is a movie that has strong emotional and cerebral effects that you rarely see today.
