Broken Silence or "Race Against Fear" (1998): Performers Ariana Richards, William Bumiller, Susan Blakely, Tracy Ellis Ross, Teryl Rothery, Scott Vickaryous, Marissa Rudiak, Ken Camroux, David Neale, Bruce Dawson ... Director: Joseph Scanlan , Screenplay Sara Charmo, Jean Gennis and Phyllis Murphy. <br /> <br /> This is another Lifetime Channel movie made exclusively for television and produced in 1998 under the direction of the longtime director of the television series Joseph L. Scanlan. Inspired by the true events, it is similar to the majority of Lifetime films, a warning to women that raises awareness of the predator lurking in the family (mother, father, wife, husband), and mentor (teacher, in this case track coach)). The young and little-known actress Ariana Richards (she played the little girl in Jurassic Park) delivers a compelling performance as high school track athlete Mickey Carlyle, who is raped by her coach Kurt Ansom (William Bumiller) and has to suffer silence No one believes her story, except, of course, her own mother (Susan Blakely). Together, mother and daughter fight to put Kurt Ansom behind bars. The film attracts a lot, is ultimately predictable, sometimes too melodramatic for drama itself, but in the end is really powerful. Ariana Richards' performance is of the daily soap type, but she is the strongest in the entire cast. Her facial expressions, body language and all her acting are realistic in terms of how she, as an aspiring sportswoman, adores her trainer, is hurt by him and now has to live with the shame, the trauma and fight in court. William Bumiller plays the role with a nasty kind of duplicity, though he is anything but subtle. He has already abused other star athletes who have kept silent and made it to the top and appear outwardly innocent. William Bumiller, a lesser-known actor like the others, has never played such a role, but overall he's doing a credible and strong job. It is especially troubling to see him in that role as he is a sexy lead actor in all other areas, including lesser-known films and the soap opera Guiding Light. The only real problem I had with this film is the way the film is structured. As the movie begins, we see Coach Ansom Mickey raped, and let us know immediately that this guy is not good. However, this leads to a weak character development and history. If the first scene was instead the sequence with the opening credits in which we see Mickey walking / jogging across the lake in town, we would have better character development, since we do not know that Coach Ansom is apparently interested in the success of his Star athletes are really a disgusting piece of work, and we would have seen Mickey worshiping a person she thought she knew and then received a rude awakening when she realized she was wrong about him. Director Joseph Scanlan is not a drama for television (Knott's Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Leap, The Outer Limits, Lois and Clark, Earth's Final Conflict and films like La Femme Nikitta). In 1996, Scanlan shot another Lifetime movie, similar to the movie "Stand Against Fear" (1996). He manages to convey the gravity of the event. The coach who lurks in the showers where he raped his own student really bothered us. These scenes are graphic and should be seen by adults audience, but his message is clear: Sexual predators and rapists are not always a stranger and can take various forms, and their hunting grounds may even include a high school. The film supports the fight against violence against women and urges women to silence were victims who testified and fought, so that rapists can do no other harm to others. Despite other negative reviews, this film does its message very well and should be given to mothers, daughters, hello students (both men and women). As bad as rape is, it's even worse to be silent when it happens.
