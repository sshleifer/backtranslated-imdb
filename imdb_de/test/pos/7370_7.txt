This film has Dr. Detroit Giggles as the best horror movie I've ever seen. The plot was great, the plot twists were even better, and the cast was great. It's hard to believe that 8 years ago they put together the most unknown people and today they are big names! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. 4 teenagers are ruining their car in the middle of nowhere. They stumble across this campsite and do what anyone should do that has an accident. Make a fire and tell eerie stories. <br /> <br /> 1. "The catch." Great start. Anyone who is in high school has heard variations of this story in the prom night. But they are doing really well in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. "The honeymoon." OK, that was not the best of the 4. It was pretty good and you get some breasts. Emphasize the word "some". It's just your basic creature in the woods. <br /> <br /> 3. "People can also lick." This is a cautionary tale of what's happening in internet chat rooms across the country. This segment alone should be displayed to parents whose children have Internet access. <br /> <br /> 4. "The medallion." That's the best story in the movie right now. A guy on a motorcycle collapses and goes to that dumb girl's house. Very good turn of action. <br /> <br /> The main story "The Campfire" has the biggest and best twist in the movie. I will not say what it is because I do not want to ruin it. I've never been so shocked in my life! <br /> <br /> Plot: A + <br /> <br /> Acting: A + <br /> <br /> Writing: A + <br /> <br /> Director: A + <br /> <br /> Music: A + <br /> <br /> Overall: A + <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone over 13 with the exception of "People Can Lecke too." Each parent whose Child has access to the Internet, this must be observed with his child.
