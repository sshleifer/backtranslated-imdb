I was lucky enough to see this at this year's Tribeca Film Festival. I was stunned, how well done and how entertaining this wonderful little movie was. Director Griffin Dunne has done a great job building this movie, which consists of several characters and several storylines that blend in seamlessly and seamlessly. The main story is about the family and it's a very thoughtful and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene. The film as a whole has credibility and integrity, but still has this commercial advantage - an "indie" movie for the masses, if you like. The performances of the performers are all outstanding, but it is Diane Lane who shines brightest. Diane Lane is simply sensational in this wonderful movie and should be nominated for an Oscar. I know early days, but Lane tolerates her socks here.
