The Original Female Convict Scorpion is a masterpiece of all time. The first installment, Jailhouse 41, was not quite as good in my opinion, though it is still remarkable that she took the idea of ​​the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has done the same with this film. The story is a bit different here, but he has managed to make the previous posts excellent and better than many other films of this kind and create something quite original. The action again focuses on Nami Matsushima (also known as "Scorpion"), and this time she is out of jail and not too much inclined to return. After escaping from the police, one leads to another and Scorpion finds it with a prostitute and her backward brother. The prostitute is eventually impregnated by the backward brother (...), while Scorpion is abducted and imprisoned by someone from whom she made an enemy in prison. But Scorpion does not like spending time behind bars and it does not take long for her to do what she does best, to bring her back to jail. From then on, however, the movie slows down a lot and Beast Stable is ultimately more a drama than the two previous films. That does not mean that there is not always enough action - Scorpion still spends a lot of time in 'Revenge Mode' and the movie is not short enough to have general issues. Meiko Kaji once again embodies her role as a sinister title character and it's another unobtrusive, almost wordless performance. However, her on-screen presence is great and she manages to have a menacing presence, even though she's just physically small. The plot structure of this film is similar to the other two, as everything becomes a crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have upset Scorpion in this film than in the previous two, so this section occupies a fairly large part of the movie. There are a few surreal sequences, not as many as in the first movie and not nearly as the second one, but the movie remains at that point in the remainder of the series. Overall, I would say that in terms of quality, this film is between the first two - not as good as the original and slightly better than the second.
