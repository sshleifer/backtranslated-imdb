It does not matter if you have experienced the plight of older people in America or if you are just unaware. Uncle Frank and Matthew Ginsburg give you this hint in a straightforward, witty way, wake up and smell the roses away. At the end of the film, it is obvious that although you are totally entertained, somehow you were educated. A great movie, from a great emerging talent in the film industry. Matthew Ginsburg is a name to watch out for.
