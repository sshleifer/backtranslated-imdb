Although some unrealistic things happen in the end (ie, a cop firing a gun into a crowded carousel where any number of innocents could be killed), it was still an intense, entertaining thriller, one of the better ones Films by Alfred Hitchcock. Robert Walker is an outstanding killer who is really convincing and offers a fascinating performance that is sometimes almost too scary. His co-star here, Farley Granger, is fine, but Walker can not cope with acting or the characters they play. It's the typical Hitchcock movie with strange camera angles, immoral motives, innocent people in trouble, etc. Unlike many other movies, I thought this was a fast moving story with very few boring spots. As a former tennis player, I enjoyed his recordings of some good old net matches that showed some good rallies. Hitchcock's real daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique supporting role here. She got the job not only because of her father; She can act. Noteworthy: The DVD has both the British and American versions and there were some differences in the story. This is a classic movie that is still referred to in modern films, even comedies like "Throw Momma Out of the Train."
