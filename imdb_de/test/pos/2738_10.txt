During the brief Golden Age of the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Home Movies, we bought a $ 148 GAF projector at a Downtown Chicago Camera Store. It seemed like GAF was quitting Camera & Projector Business. Although they would continue with their other companies, such as the earlier three-dimensional color slide viewers of Sawyer's Vue-Master. We did not know how fast the video camera is approaching, the Betamax or the VHS and the possible DVD revolutions. With the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Camera, which we also bought, we recorded some sound film as our daughter, Jenn's First Holy Communion and her younger sister, Michelle's Graduation from Pre-School. This was all around 1979-82. <br /> <br /> During this time we also bought some Daddy Toys; like some Super 8 Magnetic Sound films by LAUREL & HARDY and W.C. FIELDS 'shorts from Blackhawk Films, Davenport, Iowa. We also bought a Columbia Pictures Home Movies Sound movie from a forgotten classic cartoon, GERAAS McBOING-BOING (UPA's United Productions of America / Columbia, 1951). It was the hit of our Home Movies Time! <br /> <br /> As members of this baby boomer generation, the woman (Deanna) and myself remembered the character of Gerald McBoing-Boing. for Gerald had a Network TV Show on CBS, early Sunday night, circa 1955. Bill Goodwin was the announcer / host. But we had never seen this original UPA cartoon before. We also did not know that the young master McBoing-Boing had a creation by Dr. Ing. Seuss with the names "Grinch", "Horton" and "Mulberry Street" was. <br /> <br /> The assembled staff were very talented and deep. The excellent production values ​​are obvious. Director Robert Cannon and supervising director John Hubley were veterans at the forefront of their craft. The authors were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss, himself), Phil Eastman and Bill Scott. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott does not remember so much about his contributions to UPA, but as a partner of Jay Ward in television properties like ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, MR. PEABODY, FRACTURED FLICKER, GEORGE DES JUNGLE, HOPE HOOPER and FRACTURED FLICKER. With the Jay Ward Productions he was a writer, speaker and Kibitzer general of the entire company. The cartoon gets its only "voice" from the narrator, radio / movie / TV actor Marvin Miller. Remember him? He was Michael Anthony in the television series THE MILLIONAIRE (Don Fedderson Productions / CBS Television Network, 1955-60). <br/> <br /> Bold and imaginative design gave the UPA animations special feelings of loneliness. Fear, fear and eventual triumph. And, we could add, the animation is definitely from the "Limited" Variety. <br /> <br /> AS with so many great stories, ours starts with a simple premise; Somebody is born differently In this case it is the young Gerald Gerald McCloy who was born to create sounds when communicating rather than talking. Children can be cruel, and soon he is nicknamed by a group of youthful thugs with his unflattering nickname: "Nya, nya, your name is not McCloy, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing, the Noise Making Boy!" At this point, the animation team does a great job of shifting the emotional passages of the young outcasts from happy and careless to isolated and lonely, and finally to depression and despair, unable to turn to anyone for help and support To seek understanding. not even for his mother and father. <br /> <br /> A frighteningly designed, dark scene featuring a state-of-the-art UPA start-up scene with a train and equally stylized snowfall brings Gerald to the brink of absolute despair. But then he is interrupted by a gentleman announcing that the young Gerald of the producer of a radio station plans the sounds for the show in the studio. <br/> <br/> Once the premiere show is done with Gerald In the sound department, he plays in a huge sedan (which seems to have anticipated the stretch limos of our day) to the applause and admiration of his classmates and the world. IT has been told that there are only so many acts, and in this case it is most likely a variation of The Ugly Duckling; After all, a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and real happiness. <br /> <br /> NOTE: United Productions of America, or UPA for short, was an outstanding center of animated cartoon creativity. They were responsible not only for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several sequels and a TV series, but also for the very popular MR. MAGOO Theatrical Cartoons and subsequent TV show (featuring the vocal talent of Jim Backus), the classic original TV cartoon by FROSTY THE SNOWMAN and the rather bizarre DICK TRACY cartoon show (with Tracy's voice from Mr. Everett Sloane!).
