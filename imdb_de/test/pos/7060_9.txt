This is by far the best movie of the summer camps. In fact, few others are fair, let alone as entertaining as this one. <br /> <br /> The movie just wants to be good, clean and funny. Many people who have gone to holiday camps as children will see that it is presented here in the way it used to be, but mixed with a slapstick comedy. Bill Murray, the camp's chief advisor, Tripper, leads a good ensemble cast, and is usually in the midst of seditious nonsense. Tripper has great one-liners who normally broadcast his jokes as pseudo-announcements about the camp's sound system. <br /> <br /> Several great supporting actors played the campers and consultants to create countless fun and interesting subplots scattered all the time among the many incidents of the Hi-Jinx camp. Spaz (Jack Blum) and Fink (Keith Knight) were two particularly successful characters. The adventures (and mishaps) of these two are hilarious. Each has classic lines, and they are characters that you like and that you use as root. Look for Spaz in the scene of the Disco Dance Pandemic. <br /> <br /> The girls in the story are also realistic characters. They are not stupid, naive, freaky, exaggerated, nervous, or any of the other overused, hideous teen stereotypes. Kristine DeBell, Kate Lynch, Cindy Girling and others make these characters believable. <br /> <br /> The required jokes abound, usually at the expense of Warehouse Manager Morty (Harvey Atkin). The nature of these pranks starts outrageously and continues from there. Despite all the stupidity, Tripper and the others have their serious side. For example, Tripper makes friends with the shy, lonely boy Rudy (Chris Makepeace) and takes him under his wing. <br /> <br /> The story culminates with a sports competition against a rival camp. It's a great "root for the outsiders". When the chips fail, Tripper's motivational game "It Just Does not Mind" is inspired and one of the best moments in the movie. And get ready for the root: "Spaz. Spaz! Spaz !!!" "
