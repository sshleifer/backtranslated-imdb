Lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to see Garfield's groundbreaking performance (introducing a new, rebellious acting style that would be transferred to the Brandos and Clifts, etc. after the war), but all this sisterly affection is a little stifling. Priscilla Lane is a brilliant, dedicated performer, but the other sisters do not really register (though they're all allowed to be sharp and funny), and I found it hard to buy other male characters besides Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a pleasant actor, but he lacks movie credence to match Garfield's bad luck with Mickey Borden, which brings the movie a bit off balance. (Imagine a Jimmy Stewart or someone in the role.) I was not convinced that Garfield would make the decisive (to say the least) final decision he made. The movie took another half hour to explain this action better. it feels awful and under-motivated. <br /> <br /> Still, it's not hard to understand how someone who grew up with this image remembers it. It's not classic, but it does contain some classic moments. The two Gate Swing scenes are pure movie magic.
