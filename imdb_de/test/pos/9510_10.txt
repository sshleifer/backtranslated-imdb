It's the best movie I've seen this year! Excellent details and action (for a remake). <br /> <br /> It presents a "what if" situation in which the island of Japan could be completely wiped out of this earth. A thought-provoking life and death situation, not to mention all life on earth (including this particular Japan). It also represents a great and ingenious solution to this tremendous tragedy. Horror, action, suspense, science fiction, documentary, love story, and all the history of human rights you receive can be found here! But I also warn you that it is a true tear mower! The actors, actors and all are excellent, better than any Hollywood movie! <br /> <br /> The thing is ... that could really happen anywhere on earth! Now I want to ask you this after you've seen it ... "What would you do if you were in this life and death situation?"
