I enjoyed that for a few reasons. The emotional confusion was sometimes confusing and imperfect, but the mixture of newspaper material with the narrative of the film was often compelling. The other element I appreciated was the portrayal of the werewolves, the fanatical Nazis, who continued the struggle after the formal surrender. I do not know any other movie that deals with them. For example, they murdered the Burgomaster Oppenhoff from Aachen on Palm Sunday 1945 and caused problems for the crew. The film challenges the adjusted version of Victory and Crew with some bitter realities. The "human themes" are presented not so much by the figures, but by the historical reality that has conquered the survivors of Hitler - both victorious and victorious.
