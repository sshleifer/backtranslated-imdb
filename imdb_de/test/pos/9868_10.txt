Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers is probably the best follower of all Halloween flicks. Jamie, serial killer of Michael Myers' niece, gives birth to a baby that will be kidnapped by Man In Black after Halloween 5 closes. Jamie's baby is found and rescued by Tommy Doyle, one of Jamie Lee's children in the original film. Myers arrives in Haddonfield and begins killing the Strode Clan living in his old house. The film ends with scenes featuring references to Michael's evil, the man's identity in black, and an approximation of Dr. Loomis / Michael Myers reveal. I highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers is rated R for strong violence, extreme violence, short sexuality, language and short nudity.
