From the first to the last scene, this movie is very realistic, even too realistic, so sometimes we can not see details in night scenes (it's dark like real night), in the desert (sunshine is as strong as in the real desert) , , <br /> <br /> Screenplay and drama are also very realistic. Recordings and episodes are edited in such a way that they do not "effectively" show or explain things and events, or "explain" how many Hollywood films "entertain" viewers. The editing here is to present the events as if they really happened in Afghanistan. The camera is sometimes a long way from dying soldiers, even if the main character Major Bandura is shot. <br /> <br /> This method reminds me of masterpieces of Italian Neorealism. And the structure of the story is based on the same principles as "Pais√†" or "The Bicycle Thief" - chronological sequence of lifelike episodes and a few pathetic moments that at first glance seem suddenly and illogical, but have inner reasons. <br /> <br /> I think the main cause of Major Bandura's suicide is religious feelings - repentance for the deaths of innocent people (not just his accidental killing of a family in the village, but also his death.) Soldiers under his command ). He is not portrayed as an avid believer, on the contrary as a tactful and responsible officer. It is precisely for this reason that his last decisions (to return to the ruined village and to turn his back on an armed man, whose family he has killed) seem to be a regret. <br /> <br /> The Russian Orthodox Choir that sounds at the end ("Evening Sacrifice") is another context through which the entire film can be seen from this point of view.
