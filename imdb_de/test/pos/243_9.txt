A fantastic musical with Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where she dances. She's not a star yet, but she gets a big break when she chooses Vanity, whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother. When he sees the similarity, he immediately chooses her for a raffle in which his Maganzine runs. Hayworth's new fame may seem like wonders for Kelly's club at first glance, but her star is rising so fast and so high that his grip on it is beginning to fade. This is not the most original action, but the two leads really make it work. It also helps that the script is great. Kelly is not at his peak yet, especially as an actor. His dancing, however wow. Hayworth is the star, but Kelly claims the most memorable moment in the film as he dances passionately with his own reflection. It's obviously a start of Fred Astaire's shadow dancing in Swing Time, but I think Kelly is having a hard time, which is hard to believe. In fact, this was the most amazing dance sequence in film history, except perhaps the finale of An American in Paris a few years later. The rest of the songs are also excellent and the music numbers are even better. Too bad that Rita did not sing her own songs (well, maybe she has a few, as her voice sometimes seemed different). Her dancing is wonderful, as is the rest of her acting. It's hard not to love her in anything. She is truly one of the few really beautiful women from the classical era. Not plastic like many of them; No, you can really see the heat of this woman. Her smile is so disarming. Phil Silvers has the role of Kelly's best friend and he is also very funny. The trio of Kelly-Hayworth-Silvers is obviously the kernel who became the Kelly Reynolds O'Connor trio in Singin 'the Rain eight years later. One of the biggest music numbers in the film seems to be almost completely stolen with the "Good Morning" number in Singin '. I think Singin in the Rain is the better movie because Cover Girl is a bit rough on the edges. However, this roughness only adds to the charm. There are aspects in this film that beat Singin 'in the Rain and even An American in Paris. For example, the central relationship is more emotionally involved. Instead of the dominant older man chasing the little girl (after all, Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were just teenagers), we have a very nice relationship with two people who are more equal. There is no persecution - one aspect that unfortunately makes many of the best musicals mad, you have to admit. Kelly and Hayworth are a couple from the start, and when that starts fringing, I really felt it. 10.9.
