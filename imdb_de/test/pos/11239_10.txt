I think it's a great show with cool talking heads and very cool action. Two guys who pretend to be masters of seducing women demonstrate their skills in various nightclubs, and 4 experts (even pick-up artists) comment on them and choose the winner. Their jokes are amusing and some participants really enjoy looking at them. In addition, this show really shows men how to get in touch with women. Many expert comments are helpful in seeing how it works in practice. Actually, I think that this is one of the best TV series, and I can recommend it to all men who like women. <br /> <br /> ps / pardon for my broken stitch.
