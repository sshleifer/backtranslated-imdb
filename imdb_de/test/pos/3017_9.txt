THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Like Antz, The Cell has to be viewed twice to be honored. When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was mediocre, but after watching the movie, it made such a lasting impression on me that I had to rent it again. I did that and I liked the movie a lot. The Cell is not for everyone, but it shares its stories with quality and is a visually intelligent movie that dreams of images and plot spaces that could not go together. The film's script may be clunky at times, as well as acting, but the visuals are awesome, bringing the captivating story into an exotic and intriguing life. The Oscar-nominated make-up is also bold and cautious, while the beautiful costumes and absolutely brilliant set decoration go unnoticed. Tarsem Singh, who has also directed music videos, is totally crazy about his direction and the result is good. He has great talent and this movie has a lot of potential if you give him a chance. Overall, The Cell is a strong, annoying and sticky clock that makes it a great and enjoyable watch.
