I've seen some movies in my time, but this one is extraordinary. You have to see it more than once to truly appreciate it, it's emotionally very complex, it explores love and passion in the extreme and the cinematography is just breathtaking. The Count's character is extremely passionate and tragic, without having to raise his voice or leave his bed, the film is perfectly staffed and played perfectly. The film has a kind of mathematical precision and perfection that is rare these days. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics in one. This film is not to be overlooked, all the hype surrounding it and all awards can not do it justice. Hats off to Michael Ondaatje, who wrote the incredible book he's based on.
