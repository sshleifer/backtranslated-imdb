The Universal Studios version of "Flipper" (1996) is a great heartwarming movie for the whole family with good values ​​and sentimentality. It's the story of Sandy Ricks, a Chicago teenager who reluctantly spends his holidays with his uncle Porter Ricks in the Bahamas. This ultimately changes the lives of teens and he grows up. He learns to value nature and to respect the environment. I grew up in the 1960s and the NBC television program "Flipper" was my favorite childhood show. Elijah Wood is perfectly cast as Sandy Ricks of the 1990s and offers an outstanding performance. As much as I liked the NBC TV series and the MGM movies with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960s, I liked this feature the most! I think Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. Regarding Luke Halpin, I feel like Elijah Wood has more acting skills and more as an actor, which makes his performance excellent and believable. I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor working in movies today. Director Alan Shapiro also wrote the script and has done an excellent job as the writer and director of this film. Paul Hogan gives a funny and likeable performance as Sandy's Uncle Porter Ricks. Mr. Hogan's performance perfectly balances Elijah's role as Sandy. I'm a big fan of underwater movies. This movie was filmed in the Bahamas like "Thunderball" (1965 UA). The director of photography was Bill Butler A.S.C. who shot the movie "Jaws" in 1975. Mr. Butler is a very talented cameraman. The underwater director of photography was Pete Romano. He has done an excellent job with underwater cinematography. I enjoyed the soundtrack of Joel McNeely. Crosby, Stills, and Nash among other talented artists were part of this good score. This movie was shot in Panavision like "Thunderball" in the aspect ratio of 2.35: 1. If possible, try to watch this movie in a Scope version originally framed by Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler. It's also very nice that Mr. Shapiro gave the "original" Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) a small part of this remake. He portrayed Bounty Fisherman # 3 in this movie. This was a very friendly gesture from Mr. Shapiro! As you can see, I'm a real fan of this movie. Unfortunately, this movie was hit hard by the majority of film critics. I originally saw this movie in a movie theater on my birthday, May 31, 1996. It meant a lot to me. I have it on numerous video versions. The VHS versions are in "Pan and Scan". The laserdisc version is "letterboxed" 2.35: 1! I even have a VCD in 2.35: 1 from Hong Kong that is "letterbox". But my most valuable possession is an "original" 16mm theatrical imprint that I will cherish for the rest of my life! Thank you, Mr. Shapiro, Elijah Wood, Paul Hogan, and everyone involved in making this memorable movie for me! <br /> <br /> P.S. I must add that the quality of the Universal DVD is excellent! It's the best DVD I've ever seen. The color and resolution is spectacular. The soundtrack is great. I think Universal must have used the same transfer for the DVD as for the Laserdisc version. The 35mm imprint is "mint" and Alan's movie looks really wonderful. A great tribute to a wonderful movie! The resolution of the DVD is even superior to the laserdisc quality! It's just spectacular! Many thanks to Universal Home Video for the excellent quality control and transfer. Thank you for the excellent work in this wonderful family movie. Also thank you Alan for all your extreme kindness to me !!! It is a real honor to meet you !!! (Review revised / updated on June 27, 2005)
