"Hail The Woman" is one of the most moving films I've ever seen in my life. I saw it twice in a row and sobbed out my eyes. <br /> <br /> This silent movie masterpiece deserves a much wider audience. Unfortunately, the only surviving print is so badly scratched that most people will not see through it and miss the gem below the rough. This film could use a digital restoration to highlight its beauty, but I doubt it will be received by anyone, as its main theme is the spiritual restoration of the family unit before Christ, and this is politically incorrect today. However, it remains a powerful topic for those whose hearts are hurt by the pain of broken family relationships. <br /> <br /> The cast is great, especially Florence Vidor, who literally glows as Judith, the daughter; ethereal Madge Bellamy as Nan, the poor girl who becomes pregnant and is set aside; Theodore Roberts as the old-fashioned father destroying everyone around him by pride; and handsome Lloyd Hughes, son of David, was afraid of his father, but really of life. <br /> <br /> This is a nice movie, especially at Christmas. You will not regret being patient despite your deterioration and looking at it in its entirety.
