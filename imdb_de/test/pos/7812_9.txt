To pray in one minute, die a second, Clay McCord (Alex Cord) is an unfortunate outlaw with a ten-thousand-dollar bounty and degenerative epilepsy. His days as an outlaw are counted, he desperately (albeit reluctantly) wants to benefit from an amnesty granted by Robert Ryan, the harsh territorial governor (excellent performance), who desperately wants to give up McCord and the amnesty as an example to others Escondito Bandit Hub, Outlaw Mario Brega wants to kill McCord to prevent it. <br /> <br /> Also with Arthur Kennedy, Aldo Sambrell and some other well-known European faces, this is a co-writer of (American) spaghetti western pioneer Albert Band, also responsible for the pre-Leone movie Gunfight At Red Sands , <br /> <br /> Although the epilepsy solution of the main character has stepped straight out of Howard Hawks' El Dorado's The script is solid, fairly fresh and unpretentio us. This has a great balance between action and story and Alex Cord is great. He should have been a bigger star. <br /> <br /> To ward off the shorter (well dubbed) English version: Personally, I am the age when the longer version is always the better version, and the end of McCord is ironically shot down by dirty bounty hunters after being forgiven , is unnecessarily nihilistic and completely destroys the film's message of hope and salvation Happy End!
