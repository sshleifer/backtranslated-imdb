A very interesting addition to the surrealist Scandavian collection. Recommended ad for those who like their films complicated. My interpretation of the "strange" ending would be that Andreas' journey ends in hell. He does not like the bland consumption of purgatory; a kind of "life", but not progressive, d. h. nowhere to go - even the metro trains of the city do not stop at the stations. It has a subway system as you should be able to travel, freedom and flee, but you can never get on these trains. He can not reach the fragrant, sensual sky and continues his bus ride to the finish. The old Nordic version of Hell (Hades, NOT the earthly city, NOT) does not burn as hot as the British version, its cold and freezing, the land of Niflheim (land of cold and fog). This seems to be the place where Andreas ends, as he has just not passed through this tunnel into the sky.
