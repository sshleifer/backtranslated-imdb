I live here in the crocodile territory and remember well the real events that inspired this movie. Every time we hear of a Croc attack, our heads fall out. BLACK WATER is simply the best crocodile movie I've ever seen. While I loved ROGUE last year with all its effects and sparkling scenes, it was the local scenes that conquered our audience. Above all, we laughed in ROGUE. BLACK WATER, however, really resonated with the eerieness and fear that you can experience when you are alone in the mangroves (they are called swamps or bayous - but they are mangroves). Every tourist should see this movie before he goes to the Northern Territory. The ending was a bit disappointing after the rest of the movie, but I will add this to my DVD collection as it becomes available.
