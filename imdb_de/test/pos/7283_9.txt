Good movie, all the elements of a good movie were there, story, actor, script and director. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. <br /> <br /> No question, it's a low budget movie, but I liked it more than many big budget movies. <br /> <br /> Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders, who deals with his unfaithful wife. Then a voice in the phone and then just scared. <br /> <br /> Virginia Lustig is beautiful and brings a powerful performance. She is a great part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the increasing ambiguity in the end, even though we know that the main character can be involved. We saw everything from his perspective and asked: Who is the murderer?
