This video was my first introduction to the residents, and I could not stop playing it for the last three days. The visuals are more dynamic and imaginative and technically more complex than anything I've ever seen on the big or small screen. The DVD, however, loses points for the useless addition of new music. The original Resident music is unlike anything you've ever heard, and will optimize your brain in the best possible way. The new music, however, is consistently uninteresting and rather poor compared to some classic tracks. Even the incomplete Vileness Fats video feels VERY incomplete, and I could only fathom the plot of the story by reading the notes on the disc extensively. <br /> <br /> Talking about notes on the disc, this DVD contains loads of cool Easter eggs that will appeal to long-time residents of the Residents. Note: Look for symbols on the note pages that should not be there. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the disc is one of the best available DVD transfers. There is virtually no observable pixelation and only little contour at strong contrast points. <br /> <br /> A kudos for a first class presentation. This disc really deserves your attention.
