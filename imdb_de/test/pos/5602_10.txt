Hal Hartley was compared to the modern William Shakespeare because he gets his actors to present their lines in an iambic pentameter. He sure knows how to put together a cast, and Martin Donovan is again sensational, while Thomas Jay Ryan plays his role with an unforgettable intensity. Although the film lasts only one hour, the timeline works beautifully and keeps the audience on a fast track until the end. Without a doubt, Hal Hartley is one of the best directors to have come from America in the last 20 years, with a vision that is unique, funny and heartwarming.
