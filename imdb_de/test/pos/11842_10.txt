I hope Robert Redford continues to make more films of this kind. Hillerman's books are wonderful, and as a kid growing up in the southwest his stories strike home! Adam Beach is an underrated and subconscious actor. Wake up to Hollywood, not everyone thinks your Mel Gibson are cool! Many moviegoers today want to see films that make people think. I saw all the Redford / Hillerman series. They are thoughtful, scenic and have great land. I hope if enough people write to Robert Redford, he decides to do a few more! Many thanks to Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for great entertainment! If anyone has a chance to read Tony Hillerman's latest book, do it! It is great. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop at each vantage point and feel the setting of Hillerman's books. Great experience.
