From the golden age of British films, I chose one of the funniest of all times. Showed to an enthusiastic audience yesterday at my Film Society, I was amazed at how well the comedy lasted (Made in 1950!). It's really due to the expert timing and matchless performance of two of Britain's top British actors: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. After a play by John Dighton, this farce is handled by director Frank Launder. The plot is simple: A mistake in a ministry brings a girls 'school to a boys' school. I'll always laugh when I think about this movie.
