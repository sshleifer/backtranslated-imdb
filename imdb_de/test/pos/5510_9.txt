This thriller is one of the few (film) surprises I've had for some time. Everyone - and I mean ALL - with whom I spoke when it was in the cinemas said it was awful ... but then I thought ... none of these people really understand horror / thriller movies or Metal Rock - so WHY I listened to them in the first place ????? This movie does the fuck - but ONLY if you can understand and enjoy this kind of entertainment. In short (too late) - see it with an open mind and it could open your mind. ... the soundtracks are great too ...
