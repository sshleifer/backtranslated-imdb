The Last Dinosaur was one of the "out of the box" production films of the week in the 1970s, which was pretty exciting, especially for fans of Japanese Tokusatsu films. Originally scheduled for a theatrical release (like when Dino King Kong came out last December), it was suddenly pulled and turned into a Friday night ABC movie of the week. Rankin Bass, who was no stranger to Japanese co-productions, was the weapon behind this production, co-produced with Tsuburaya Productions of Japan - the people who brought us Ultraman in various forms. He played mainly an American cast, including the late Richard Boone, Joan Van Ark and the late Steven Keats. He told the story of a prehistoric time in a super-heated volcanic caldera somewhere in the frozen polar circle where dinosaurs were. It is very similar to the films The Land Unknown (1956) and The Land That Time Forgot (1975) in feeling and speed. Sure, the dinosaurs were guys in suits (A triceratops with front knees!), But they were filmed that way, the music and score were so well done, and the cast did a good job, which did not mean much to many of us grew up on Godzilla , The film has a lot to offer, from the opening score of Nancy Wilson's "The Last Dinosaur" to the overall "big" feeling of the film - the hot springs in northern Japan were exquisite and lush and the indisputable feeling of Kaiju Eiga to. There are some amazing sets - the T-Rex "Bone Garden" and a tracking shot that takes us deep into the jungle to see the T-Rex eating a huge fish from a stream. Tsuburaya FX people did their job here in style and apart from a few seedy matte shoots, they do their job well. This movie is considered the best 1970s "Kaiju" movie from Japan, even about the five Godzilla films filmed during this decade. Rankin Bass produced several other co-productions with Tsuburaya, who provided the creatures or miniatures - The Bermuda Depths (1978) and The Ivory Ape (1980) - but both did not measure up to the epic look of this film.
