Le conseguenze dell'amore (2004) is a beautifully made film that takes small, carefully positioned steps to the end that you must enjoy to be enjoyed. From the contrasting landscapes to the tightly-packed world in which the hero lives, we are led by the director and controlled from the moment we enter the hotel. Like the hero, we will never escape the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminal-driven mafia world. That the film resists the mafia stereotype while enjoying it makes it all the more successful. The concrete trash, the inevitable brutal executions and the overwhelming masculinity are exposed and exposed to what they are. Only brutality and business and nothing more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine, which is organized crime, not love or life for yourself, your family or anyone else. Our hero is indeed a hero because he gives up his life because of the touch of the beautiful barmaid, the solution to the misery that his only neighbors suffer at the hotel, and to escape his decorative prison. The consequences of love are indeed beautiful and brutal at the same time. See it !!
