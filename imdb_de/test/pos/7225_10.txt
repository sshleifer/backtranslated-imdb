I L-O-V-E in this movie ... every dentist of her grandmother's sister's lawyer must own it! It's funny, devilish, exciting, comedic and full of toastic action-packed goodness! the amazing people of troma offer you a completely new perspective on the history of romeo and juliet in a way that you would never have thought possible! It has all the makings for an instant classic - car accidents, delicious unsightly sex scenes, family struggles, street fights, amazing music, severed heads and Lemmy from Mot√∂rhead tell the story! and that's just a taste of what it has to offer! Every single one with whom I've seen this movie now owns his own copy or is longing for ... A +++++ and ++
