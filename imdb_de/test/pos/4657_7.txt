I completely forgot "Midnight Madness" until I found it while surfing the IMDB. Now everything comes back to me ... <br /> <br /> It was one of Naughton's first films (and also Fox's), and discerning connoisseurs will also pick Kaplan (Henry from the television "Alice"). ), Fiedler (he makes the piglet's voice in the "Winnie the Pooh" cartoons) and Blocker (son of Dan "Hoss" blocker of TVs "Bonanza"). <br /> <br /> But the two that stand out In my mind are Furst (from "Animal House") and the Superdude himself - Eddie Deezen. This time, Furst plays a bad one and has one of the best scenes when he asks his dad, "Why can not you just accept me as I am?" His father looks over his obese, sloppy body and gives a simple answer in one word - "Yuck!" <br /> <br /> And Deezen ... well, he's a show in himself. As Jerry Lewis, on the last day, he stumbles around, wading through miniature golf pools, putting melon halves to his ears and ending with Maggie Roswell falling in love with him. My hero. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, it's typical of the stupidity of the early '80s that college kids stay up after the curfew and do a city-wide scavenger hunt to prove the division of students the best on campus: the jocks, the nerds, the rich kids, the feminists, or the group, each of which is a little bit outdated. <br /> <br /> Who will win? Who cares? You will have a lot of fun taking Disney Pictures first excursion into the PG area before creating Touchstone Pictures. <br /> <br /> Seven stars. Catch "Midnight Madness" in every possible way! <br /> <br /> Long live Leon!
