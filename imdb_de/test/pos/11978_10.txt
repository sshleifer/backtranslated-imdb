All the people who have voted a skinny 1 in this movie, that's all I have to say: you guys are not mature enough to enjoy a movie of this kind. To achieve this appreciation requires a certain commitment. And that's the segment this movie was aimed at. No average movie audience by accident! , Back to the movie. This was a gem and definitely a shot at the Bollywood Hall of Fame. I would give him an all-time rank # 2, surpassed only by Kanti Shah's legendary Gunda. This movie had a flawless plot and created a wonderful mix of fantasy and science fiction. Pan's Labyrinth was indeed ashamed of the balance between the parallel stories. And now I really have to mention the outstanding performers and even the actresses (this is a word from NOW) of them (a special mention goes to Mr. Nigam for the best debut ever made in any movie on this earth). Every actor in this film had been chosen very carefully and the role was tailor-made for her (and I must add her age). Manisha Koirala still looks like she's 18 and wow, with that figure I would have raped her as well. Wondering, where did this rape come suddenly? Yes, a rape is based on the prerequisites of this movie. And that's not like the average Bollywood movies. If you happen to be an atheist or agnostic, this movie is again a must for you. Because this movie can heal your faith. I do not think it would even go too far to say that this film can cure cancer. Only the people who need it most will not appreciate their power, charm and immortal beauty. Tchch, so unhappy! <br /> <br /> Only mistake in this movie: In your dreams, baby! This was perfect. <br /> <br /> Only minor complaints: Mithun Since the director could not play. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin it any further. Just go and have a look. TODAY. And if you like it, here is a recommendation from me. Gunda, Desh Drohi, Aparichit, the old horror movies of the Ramsay Brothers, Loha, Indra the Tiger and Sivaji.
