Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray into science fiction, a genre to which he will return 14 years later with "The Fifth Element" (1997). Although this film was heavily influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still very gratifying. In 1983, "le Dernier Combat" unveils its own approach to science fiction. He takes back a worn subject, and his efforts are recognizable to do a stylish job. Shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually the entire population of the earth. We will never know what this catastrophe was and why men can no longer speak. There arose some barbarian hordes. In parallel, a man (Pierre Jolivet) lives alone and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris, where he is received by a doctor (Jean Bouise). <br /> <br /> There are no words in Besson's work. The actions of the characters and the course of the events are traversed by looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the scenery are disturbing, the movie never looks desperate. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions related to humanity prior to the disaster. The movie starts with the man who has sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him talk through a machine, and he is a painter in his spare time. This is all the more fascinating as these paintings seem to have come from prehistory. From this reasoning one could argue that the bearded giant (Jean Reno) embodies the evil and a threat to the efforts of the man and the doctor to regain what has finally made him human. The same applies to the gang at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The pessimistic breath that such a movie could convey is not really in the foreground and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have gained anything without music, except the one the man can hear with his tape recorder. Luc Besson was supposed to make better and more exciting films like this, he also reinforced the career of Pierre Jolivet as a director who will leave behind a confusing work in the future: "Force Majeure" (1989), "Simple Mortel" (1991), " ma Petite Entreprise "(1999) or" Filles Uniques "(2003).
