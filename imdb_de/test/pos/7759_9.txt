Good animations, a beautiful character design and a carefree story make Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu a pleasure. <br /> <br /> After my first visit, I thought this anime was pretty good, but much better for a second clock. <br /> <br /> This is because this is not done in chronological order, and if you look at it in the correct order you will notice compounds that you have not seen before. (OR You may see a second meaning for some events you did not notice before.) You may want to read the original novels (not manga) by Tanigawa Nagaru before / after reading. The anime can very well represent every detail in the stories it shows. <br /> <br /> However, there are some short stories from the book that are not animated, but referenced. (Bamboo with attached wishes) in episode 14) Overall, after a brief analysis of the plot, this anime is actually very good (reading the book also improves it). It's a nice break from the Shounen Jump anime, which seems to take control.
