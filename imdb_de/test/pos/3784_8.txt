Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film yet. With just over 45 minutes, however, he was not a feature film. With the First World War, which was the end of the First World War, many popular entertainers of the time helped to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovely tramp went to war! The film begins with the tramp in training, and the character is very unhappy even in the simplest of military exercises, including marching and rifle slings, much to the disgust of his sergeant. The tramp is then in the trenches and facing a more frightening enemy, although the Germans ultimately prove to be infinitely incompetent. The startling moment in which the tramp declared that he alone had thirteen German soldiers imprisoned by "surrounding" them had me in stitches. <br /> <br /> There are many other great moments in this film. Chaplin, awakening to find his sleeping barracks underwater, and unable to literally find his own feet, is hilarious, as is his ingenious use of a record player's tube to sleep under the surface. <br /> <br /> Most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly include Chaplin, camouflaged as a tree behind the enemy lines. The reactions of the limping German soldiers, who are unknowingly only a few yards away from a sworn enemy because they are single-handedly disabled, are extremely amusing, especially when a soldier takes an ax with the intention of cutting a tree for firewood. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining movie and one of the best of Chaplin's efforts before 1920. Highly recommended.
