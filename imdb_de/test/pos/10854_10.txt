As a lesbian, I'm tired of being portrayed in movies and on television as a sad person, always staggering between suicide and murder, but never destined to find happiness? <br /> <br /> If you, like me, are fed up with Hollywood's anti-lesbian propaganda, breathe in the BBC's delightful offer. Nan Astley is the daughter of an Oyster House restaurateur, wondering "why she can not feel the way she does with Freddy" (one of the local boys who has his eyes on her). She falls ?? and is difficult ?? for Kitty Butler, a male impersonator with a guest theater company. Nan accompanies Kitty as a dresser to London? <br /> <br /> Not everything that happens to Nan is pleasant in this story, and some of the things she does are not squeaky clean - but she's going to conquer your heart, and her story of winning love will be you leave with a nice lump in the throat at the end. <br /> <br /> If you're a lesbo-hating macho man or a homophobic housewife or a religious fundamentalist who believes that homosexuals should die and go to hell, this series is not for you. But if you have a heart and believe in love, in the end you will cry as much as I do!
