In many ways the perfect movie. The "Incredible Journey" and the story of Horatio Alger unite in a positive retrospective view of the normally depressing theme of Existentialism. In essence, the Muppets' efforts go into the finale of the film: "Life is like a movie, write your own end, hold fast, stay in faith." They create their own reality, which contains all the facets of every epic story: a high goal at the end of a necessarily obstacle-laden journey; an ever-growing group of like-minded people for camaraderie; an unpleasant group of villains who can not escape salvation; and a big budget for Hollywood, because, damn it, they CAN. <br /> <br /> Only Jim Henson could do it. He cuts the line between sentimentality and philosophy without dipping too long or too hard in both directions. Of course, it's strange that you put so much weight into a movie with puppets, but in the end they may be the perfect puppet to make those points. The atmosphere of the film allows the pure enjoyment of the Hollywood dream, the "happy" ending, unnecessary cameos and the opening of a song. Usually these aspects are a quality defect in the film, but the self-deprecating way in which the story is delivered provides for a guiltless view. One of the few films that can really be described as "suitable for all ages". <br /> <br /> The other films related to Muppet (including "The Empire Strikes Back") are not touching the simple grace of this movie. Take, for example, the music number "hope that something better comes," the duet of Kermit and Rowlf. It is amusing in its Vaudevillian stupidity, but makes a snappy deciding point about the motivations behind the choices of life. Brilliant.
