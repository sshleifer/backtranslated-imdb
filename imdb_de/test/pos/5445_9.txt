I do not agree with the other comments! I also saw this film at an early screening and found it very enjoyable. Robin Williams is in great shape. The sound is known, but it's Williams from Good Morning Vietnam: smart, funny. After too many dark turns, Williams is finally back to what he does best. The supporting actors perform well, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays himself as usual, but as an "agent" for the next president he was always a joy on the screen. Basically, Lewis Black only plays for himself, but he is wonderfully used here. There is also a funny twist from Jeff Goldblum. The film is also more than what the trailer suggests. The movie is funny, but it's not a pure comedy, as suggested. It has a kind of thriller line that everyone should seriously consider, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.
