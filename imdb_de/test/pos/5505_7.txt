The ill man Carleton Hendricks (Dee Snider) crosses the teen chat lines as Captain Howdy. He poses as a teenager and invites other teenagers to celebrate his house. Instead, he strikes her, pulls her out, sews her mouth and tortures her (usually with needles). He arrests the daughter of police officer Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). He finds him, arrests him and is institutionalized. Four years later, he is released ... completely cured. But a lynchmop (led by Robert Englund amusing) attacks and hangs him up. He does not die, but he grabs and Captain Howdy is back ... <br /> <br /> A very sick, disturbing, twisted horror movie. Captain Howdy enjoys pain and torture and tries to show the children that he kidnaps her, the way he enjoys them. The torture scenes are not so clear (you hear more than you see), but what you see is very sick. There is no humor and the (muffled) cries of its victims sound far too real. I have been away from the TV during most of the scenes. <br /> <br /> The action varies. Kevin Gage is not as good as the cop - he is not terrible, but he could have been better. Dee Snider is very scary as Captain Howdy - his attacking scenes are not pleasant. <br /> <br /> All in all, no ordinary horror movie. I'll probably never see it again (this movie really gets under your skin), but I recommend it to all horror fans - at least those with severe abdominal pain. I give a 7.
