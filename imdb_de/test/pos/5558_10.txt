Farscape totally rules! In my opinion, it is very close to Babylon five, although there are only 7 main characters in the series (including spaceship). The humor is excellent and the authors manage to keep the show interesting, although pretty much everything happens on the ship. <br /> <br /> What I really love and appreciate in Farscpae is that they do not use CGI for the alien characters or if they do, it is imperceptible. They use these adorable, crappy rubber animatronic dolls similar to those used in the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Farscape is something you absolutely want to see, if you have not already done so.
