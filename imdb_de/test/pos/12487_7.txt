The extraordinarily adorable Suzy Delair plays a statuesque actor obsessed with succeeding in the theater. Her husband and companion, played by Bernard Blier, is a composed but jealous man. When he finds out in less than favorable fashion that his flashy wife has planned a rendezvous with a lecherous old businessman to advance her career, he loses all control and threatens the businessman's murder. Now, at this point, I have to stop describing the movie to you because, with its twists, revelations, ambiguities, and the claim that any of this would be implied, it would skate on that thin ice. I'm not sure how good or bad that is for this French police deployment proceeding from the singing and dancing community, although it's certainly interesting that what we all know is who did not. We just do not know who did that. <br /> <br /> History depends on how to look for clues where ideal alibis fail and where cautiously created factories and deceptions fall apart. Interestingly enough, this is an exciting movie that creates suspense, even though you traditionally think too much too soon. Quay of the Goldsmiths is the least dark film by Henri-Georges Clouzot. It's not nearly as eerie as the shocking Les Diaboliques, as tragic as the fascinating wages of fear or as eerie as Le Corbeau. Perhaps it is the liveliness of the dance halls and theater scenes of 1940s France that all seem to be the milieu of this thriller. <br /> <br /> Clouzot understands and approves of his characters, even the lazier ones, with whom he plays a more vengeful role with his other films. Wherever he understood the wicked women in Les Diabolique or for the truckers who sink to the level of the terrible death to break out of the miserable life of The Wages of Fear, there is not necessarily any support or agreement on the part of the Filmmakers, because these are characters who have clearly made the direct decisions that determine their fate. All the characters in this quieter movie have scenes and moments that appeal to us, even the tough, cold detective, played by Louis Jouvet, who worries about his young adopted son amidst all the difficulties and despair that happen in his life at any time Touch of hat. <br /> <br /> There is humor and naked sexiness, the latter mostly by Delair, which neutralize the pressure to some degree. Clouzot quietly practiced his craft, patiently, until he turned his relentless later films, in which he would give his audience no pardon from the tension.
