Christopher Nolan's first film is a black and white, budget-less movie about an unemployed writer who starts following strangers, which in turn leads to robbery and violence. It is very good. <br /> <br /> As in his later film 'Memento', he does not present the story linearly. Instead, it jumps around a bit, so in the end, you're really tempted to put it all together, and early, seemingly random shots become more important as the movie progresses. This style also means that the twists are much more effective. Definitely worth a visit if you have the chance (especially if you like his later work and / or Film Noir).
