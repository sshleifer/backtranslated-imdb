I was in the movie right away. I've seen the other Coen movies, except Raising Arizona, and I've found that each of their films has a color. Fargo is gray / white, Lebowski is light orange and this movie is a pleasant yellow. <br /> <br /> The bright pleasant qualities of this movie start immediately. Soon the look will be accompanied by great, great music. It's the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written at a time when music was part of everyday life. Everyone, chain members, church choirs and even prison refugees enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Now to the prison refugees. I do not know what crime their characters might have committed, as they are a very friendly group of men. Clooney is awesome and gets his job in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> Check this as soon as possible. I believe anyone can enjoy it on any level. For some reason, the theater I was in was full of old ladies and old men, and they loved it. <br /> <br /> You will love it, too. I was forced to get the soundtrack into my hands immediately.
