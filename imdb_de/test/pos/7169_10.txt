OKNO V PARIZH is a funny and devastating criticism of Russian society and culture during the transition from communism and also shows the West in an unfavorable light. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg (also called "The Window of the West" by Peter the Great) find a magical portal that immediately transports them to Paris. Mamin's film is really funny, and just "strange" enough, keeps even the worn movie viewer constantly on the go. The songs, the dream sequences and the marvelously disgusting border areas of the society of both cultures merge into an unforgettable and meaningful film. Anyone who tries to understand the change in Russian culture since the fall of the USSR should start here.
