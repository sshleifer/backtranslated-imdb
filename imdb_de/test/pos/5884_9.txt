So many great talents have been used in "The Best Years of Life", the result has to be something wonderful. Think of what his director, William Wyler, was facing. After a military victory over statistical powers committed horrendous crimes and devouring the world in the event of battles, he made a film arguing that the US leaders themselves were deeply anti-individual - they had wasted the best years of their lives those who were drafted or misled to fight the war - which, ignoring the rights of the individual, had been nothing more than an argument about the degree of slavery men should live under. "There are beautiful sets by Julia Heron, cinematography by Gregg Toland and a screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood, author of" The Road to Rome "and other defenses against tyrannical ideas.The ironic title was used to capture the talents of actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell, and Hoagy Carmichael in a big but thematic drama The clever plot was the experience of the "couples" after the soldiers (of whom three were Their bitter experiences and their recognition that they were fighting their own need to fight again against what happened at the ISS Homefront provides a strong and sobering counterpoint to the sale of conventional ones Imagine that "everything was fine with" America ". March and his wife have a terrible time adjusting, and he drinks; O'Donnell's young man, Harold Russell, has done this hook rather than hands, wondering if life can even be worth living, and worst of all, Andrews' wife throws him out for a guy with dough, and he has Lost years, causing employers to ignore their rights to a job or reject his individual merits, even having what he had before he was torn from his life and pushed into the arena of risk - for nothing and the loss of everything what he had ever had. The shattering climax of the movie comes when each of the three must face E's fight, each for his own happiness; and all three succeed in finding the courage to continue fighting - each for their own happiness, which is now threatened by a strange anti-self, anti-reality indifferent of an un-American state. Wylers direction, especially the scene where Andrews sits in the cockpit of a mottled B-17, alone and the scene of Russell's wedding is indeed wonderful. This is a very powerful movie and a great movie on its own terms that women and men can agree on. Music by Hugo Friedhofer and costumes by Irene Sharaff add to the glamor. One of the best and most unexpected films of all time in stunning black and white.
