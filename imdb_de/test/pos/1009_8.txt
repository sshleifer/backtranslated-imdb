I hate football!! I hate football fans! I hate cars! But this movie was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> I had the great opportunity to see this movie over the weekend and all I have to say is that I laughed until I cried and when will it be available in the UK and Denmark. Girl, this is a football movie you have to see, it's weird! <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie started out as a crazy commercial for a phone company is just unbelievable, the guys may not be too well-known actors, but that's a down-to-earth real sense of humor, with real people, and me applaud them for bringing this to the screen. <br /> <br /> WELL DONE!
