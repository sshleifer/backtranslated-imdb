What Bergman has here is, "What if all the bad stuff here in Sweden had happened to nice people like us?" And what he gives us in Swedish with Swedish actors, in Swedish places (and with seemingly real Swedish military vehicles) is what you know from war films that are played in almost every other country in Europe - all confusing invasions and counter-invasions, political Lies, internment camps, fake confessions, executions, torture, envelopes, "collaborators" and so on. As in a modern short story, it is abstracted, with no real names, cities or countries. But the stronger factions are "Nazis": they're taking over themselves and some are wearing shiny knee-boots. You even whip with a riding whip (ok, actually it's a stick). The victim is called Rosenberg. Apart from the shame they find finding dirtier ways to survive - and who would not do what they did? - all that suggests is that the title should clearly point to the factual complicity of Stockholm with the Nazis. In fact, we showed what Sweden would have looked like if Germany had demanded more than mining permits. The first half plays like a black comedy. We see the "fog of war" from the point of view of a weirdly passive couple ignoring the troops all around, the long convoys, the bombed out buildings, the news reports and so on. You do not even need to find a working radio. They are the ultimate "Not in my garden". They speak of wine and cranberries; Meanwhile, friends have mysteriously been confiscated and more and more soldiers are emerging in the city. They show no curiosity about the war that has been taking place around them for many years. <br /> <br /> The man (Von Sydow) is cultured, grumpy and a navel gazer; The woman (Ullman) is a little more impulsive, passionate and outgoing. There is a beautiful scene in which the man talks about his violin: the manufacturer, he says unequivocally, fought in the Napoleonic wars, but his own interest ends with the cultural artifact in his hands - or more precisely, his own warm feelings are about the ownership and security that this possession occupies. Not in my garden! But when the war finally breaks into its idyllic idyll, the timidity of the man, who is an irritation in good times, becomes a guilt, for which he overcompensates in the end - as is often the case - as Bergman subtly and beautifully demonstrates , Definitely worth seeing.
