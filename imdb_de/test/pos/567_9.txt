I saw this movie with my mother. She is 81 years old and has become a fanatic. She even recognizes that. I do not think she really understood what happened, she had already decided that the boy was guilty. Creepy. I felt for this kid and his family. What torture did they undergo and remained faithful? That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted with the police and their inability. I am so glad that this defender has been selected to handle this case. It was a great blessing for this family that she had a person who cared enough about the crap he was given. I could tell when the cops had lied. He would not look the defender in the eye. His gaze wandered to the side as he answered the questions. It is regrettable that a black woman has to be punished for her skin color. I read the book about the black man pulled by three white men behind a truck. They were eventually found guilty after many years. I can not remember the title, but it was the same premise. Whites do anything they want with blacks. I'm sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I've pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. No comment from her I would like to praise the director and producer of this film. I believe that the exposure that they gave to this apparent injustice was a necessary project. I am an avid viewer of Indy films. I feel that they are well written and have substance. I'm glad that I found this movie on the shelf. I felt compelled to write a comment because I feel the film so strongly and the prejudices that exist in our modern society.
