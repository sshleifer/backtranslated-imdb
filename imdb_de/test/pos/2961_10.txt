Back when I was in the United States, I was about seven or eight years old, I always woke up early, just to see that, along with a lot of other cartoons such as HootKloot, The Road Runner Show and The Pink Panther. But this was perhaps one of the most memorable and funniest animated works, and I still find it very funny today. I'll never forget the episodes, like the one in which two aardvarks fought for the can of chocolate ant pudding. or the one where the Aardvark tries to reach the island where all the ants are, and my personal favorite, the one where the ant, the aardvark, and a dog land in an animal hospital, which later becomes the basis for an animal would be similar Looney Toon cartoon with Sylvester, Tweety and the Bulldog. This is one of the most memorable cartoons in which everyone would like to come back, I would. An excellent series.
