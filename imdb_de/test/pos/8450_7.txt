"The China Syndrome" launched a series of films about the potentially devastating effects of abusive nuclear power, a black cloud of paranoia that would hang over America in most Reagan years. It is a well-made and effective drama that is particularly impressed by its high-powered stars, notably Jack Lemmon, who plays a high-ranking nuclear power officer suffering from a crisis of conscience. But one can not help but believe that only a few weeks after the release of this film, the accidental time of the nuclear accident of Three Mile Iceland has occurred, which has proven him as a classic from the 70s sustainable. As good as it gets, it's certainly not a classic. <br /> <br /> With a red-haired Jane Fonda as news reporter and a bearded Michael Douglas as her cameraman (and the producer of the film, by the way). <br /> <br /> Note: B +
