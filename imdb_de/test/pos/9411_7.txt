Yes, it is a bit cheesy. But it's exciting and entertaining and one of my favorites; There are some great actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters. It's interesting to see David Soul in a role as a "villain". I thought he was pretty credible - and rather averse - than the more and more paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a longtime favorite - I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has star quality in all I've looked at - movies or television. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie over and over, but our band (a VHS-TV copy I have) is of such poor quality that it's hard to enjoy it. This is a movie that I think should be released on DVD; Maybe it would not be universally searched, but I'm sure there are many people like me who like this kind of movie. So it would be a market for a DVD version. I hope to continue!
