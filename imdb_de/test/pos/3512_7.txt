I was fortunate enough to see the horror classics DVD version of this movie before it was mysteriously removed from the 4-movie DVD and replaced with something else. The picture and sound quality of the film in this issue was a nightmare in and of itself. However, this version is still STILL better than the Deluxe DVD treatment. The reason was stated in Brad Fiedel's interview segments on the Special Edition DVD. He had noticed what I found most noticeable about this film first. This is the use of music in moments of inactivity in the film, but leaving the moments of activity alone, giving the horror scenes a stronger feel. The problem with this reissue is that it brings with it the extra film music to fill those deliberate gaps in the score. Fiedel complained about it and made it clear that the filler music was not his. The music actually sounded very much like Howard Shore's work for Videodrome. Sad for me, that I am also a big fan of the movie and I have to connect the two. <br /> <br /> The film itself has added some interesting realistic elements to the genre-like horror movie. A group of friends is walking on a mountain, which one of them has inherited. On the mountain, they face a family with a nightmarish secret. The movie moves at a fast pace. Every time I see it, I still find myself shocked that 45 minutes had passed before things really went awry for the campers. The fact that there is no score to the horror scenes makes this movie intelligent and most Slasher movies that I've ever seen, even superior. The director Jeff Lieberman had previously made some unique horror films, making this movie mainstream while being very different from the mainstream. It's a good fun movie with surprising theatrical performances. The new DVD version is worthwhile, the Horror Classics version for collectors is now worth the hunt.
