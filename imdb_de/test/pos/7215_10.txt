This was the best movie ever seen at Germen's Cine Club (Buenos Aires). This film is a realistic critic of the society of the past and the next century. It gives all partners of the "Germen's Cine Club" a very good impression. I recommend this movie to all fans of Troma and all the people who like the good movies, not the commercial ones.
