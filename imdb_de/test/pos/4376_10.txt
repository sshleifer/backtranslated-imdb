It's bad for Ya to show more of George Carlin's talents. He is still as sharp as a tack. It's a shame we lost him in the last year, but his comedy will live on forever. This stand-up special is literally one of the funniest I've ever heard on a comedian. Although he makes fun of little kids, he just makes you laugh as he says something about the stuff. It's true that Carlin can literally make something that does not seem disturbing, turning it into one of the funniest things you'll ever have and ever hear. I really enjoyed this stand-up especially from Carlin and recommend that those who like it have seen more of George Carlin's stand-up.
