I loved this movie. Jon Foster is one of my favorite actors, he was perfect as Micheal Skakel. I loved everything, drama, costumes, production, directing, photography, script and music, etc. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Coming Up! They were warned! <br /> <br /> Martha Moxley, who told the story in the film, was killed by her violent neighbor Micheal Skakel. Micheal did so out of jealousy of his brother Tommy when Martha turned him down and took Tommy instead. Fortunately, however, they caught him years later and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. I think he should have been sentenced to "natural life" without the possibility of probation. Two thumbs up.
