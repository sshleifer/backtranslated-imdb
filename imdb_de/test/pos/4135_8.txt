I saw The Buddy Holly Story for the first time when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember why I sat in front of the TV, hired HBO and saw this intriguing biopic. What I remember was the realization that it was a true story lived by someone who actually lived. I remember the music, great songs that I still love today (I can not believe that Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - what a stallion!) Then came the end. He died. He died crazy. I could not believe it. I had no warning, no prior knowledge like most people who come in this movie. It has taught me a hard lesson about life and how it does not follow the rules that most films show us. I just watched the movie again tonight and got engaged again ... and a bit sad. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, but I admit, a little prejudice.
