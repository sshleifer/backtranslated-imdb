Good drama / comedy with two good performances by Hunter & Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals every scene he's in. With a great script, this movie will increase and give everyone the chance to show off their acting talent. And although Joan Cusack is not that involved, she has one, if not the funniest scene in the movie. The highlight of the film for me was Albert Brook's speech about the devil. The only downside is the fact that places are a bit slow. And I was only interested in Brook's role, not so much in Hunter or Hurt. I give a 7 out of 10 points.
