Hitchcock once gave an interview in which he said he would like to stage scripts in which an ordinary person took care of their own affairs, who inadvertently caught up with a dreadful chain of events from which they can not get out, until the deceitful plot behind her difficulties is dissolved. In this way, the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero. We'll definitely do it in this nice movie. Barry Kane only tries to help his fellow man by showing kindness and consideration by helping Fry collect the letters he left in the factory. Barry even returns a lost $ 100 bill later to Fry ... that was 1943 BIG money !! It's Barry's Christian friendliness that gets him in trouble. Soon he is wrongfully charged with sabotage and murder and will probably get stuck if he can not clean himself. Similar to "The 39 Steps in Plot", the hero travels across the country, discovering plans for further acts of terror by fascist cells, an archenemy nobody believes to be a cabinet nazi, and a pretty blonde Patricia Martin. who suspects and hates at first, eventually falls in love with Barry Kane. Hitch is also a trademark of humor here. Patricia is a Billboard model whose various road signs are a great help and comfort to Barry as he drives the bad guys all the way from Las Vegas to New York. We meet a trucker who is a one-man comedy. "Someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day." Field staff of the fascist espionage animal howl that they are forgotten by the "suits" or ignored as if they were working for a legitimate business. During a chase scene in a movie theater, viewers laugh at the action of a fluffy comedy / gangster movie as the saboteur cell pierces them with the good guys and accidentally kills a laughing movie patron. Terrible for the dead old man, but funny! Hitch liked to use famous monuments in his films and this is the best instance, with the Statue of Liberty as the background and ironic icon! It works even better than the Mt Rushmore scene in NBNW.
