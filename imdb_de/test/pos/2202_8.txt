There are no shortcomings in this production. Perfectly entertaining, fun and worthy. <br /> <br /> That's what the theater is about. Definitely not for the little ones, but older children will get a big kick when they see it and can be introduced to the theater this way. <br /> <br /> Amazing and amazing.
