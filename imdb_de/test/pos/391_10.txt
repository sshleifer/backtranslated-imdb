Fine ... that one word pretty much sums up the whole movie. Everything from cinematography, directing, acting ... brilliant. At any point in the movie, you can pause the movie, and you'll no doubt look at some mosaic or "artistic fart," as some people would say. I assure you that after a visit "Bobbycrush" gets stuck in your head. I know that first-hand. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes very well with the sound and the tempo of the movie. Be grateful that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real (and surreal) imagery.
