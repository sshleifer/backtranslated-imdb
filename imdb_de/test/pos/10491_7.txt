In America, the president (Van Johnson) travels to Dallas after the civil war and is murdered by corrupt officials and businessmen interested in installing the vice-president, whom they can extort due to incriminating documents. An armed man (Guiliano Gemma) is convinced that his black friend is falsely accused of murder to reveal the truth. Tonino Valeri directed this intriguing, though flawed film, which is evidently an allegory for Kennedy's assassination. The film may portray false slaves as slaves on plantations in Texas, but the movie is still fun and an interesting interpretation - that Kennedy's death was the result of a coup that many Americans could not accept at the time. Oswald's murder is repeated here when the black man accused of murder is murdered by responsible men en route to Fort Worth. This moment in the film is more melodramatic than Oswald's death with its various escorts shot down in front of his towering death scene. Still, this is definitely one of the more interesting and rewarding spaghetti westerns. Worth a look!
