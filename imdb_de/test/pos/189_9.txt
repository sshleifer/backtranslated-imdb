This is a fantastic movie. Acting is one of the best I've ever seen. Tatjana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful and automatically draws you into the film with her credible acting. Cinematography was extremely ahead of its time. When I saw it, I could see parallels to today's cinematography. This is really a groundbreaking movie. Due to cinematography and acting, the audience can feel the sound change from beginning to end as the sound in the environment changes in the movie. It is a very touching and powerful piece. My friend told me it was a must, and I definitely agree with her. This is one of those movies you see and never forget. Everyone should see this deeply moving movie. This should be listed in the list of "movies to watch before the ________ (whatever)".
