This second pairing of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner is first of all a great thing. Predictably, perhaps, but I'm not interested and still laugh so much when I see it. The Wile E./Road Runner shorts always had the special place in my heart. Knowing that the second CD of the Golden Collection would not only contain 11 of them, BUT they were in chronological order (2 to 12, the first episode was on Volume 1), made me foggy. I love this stuff. This animated short film is on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 2. It also contains an optional commentary from Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My degree: A +
