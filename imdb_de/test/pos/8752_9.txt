I really enjoyed this program. It is exceptionally well written, with finely judged performances and intelligent images. <br /> <br /> It is also very open and honest, refreshing compared to the gentle portrayal of drug use in film and television Imponderable - one of the most beautiful television programs of recent years, and a success for Channel 4 at all levels. <br /> <br /> 9/10
