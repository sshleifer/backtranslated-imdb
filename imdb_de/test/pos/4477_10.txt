This movie is beautiful in every way. It's visually stunning, and that's a good thing, because the dialogue would only take one or two pages of paper. The spectacle is great. it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a great job of turning himself into an animal and mixing that wild nature with the overbearing passion and honor of a man. There is not a single mistake, not a single mistake or a wrong moment that can be found anywhere. It is perfectly perfect, but only if you understand what you will experience. It is not a movie for anyone who wants normality.
