I recently started syndication on this show and think it's a bit crazy. Some episodes are stupid - Doug is upset about something trivial and acts stupid, etc. <br /> <br /> Still, others are quite amusing and sometimes touching. These include those episodes that face the complexity of the characters. The topic "adolescent overweight guy marries sexy woman" can be found in several sitcoms, for example. (Carrie also has something about her, looks smart, not just a run of the mill's sexy mill.) But Carrie has an edge - she may be nice on the eyes, but has too many personality traits unlike her dad. <br /> <br /> And she likes to admit - for example, an episode is about her lack of desire to be nice to colleagues. Personally, I find her beauty sexy, but you have to be the right person to live with. The friendly Doug is a good match. And deep inside you can see the simple things. Maybe not as much as Doug, whose Nirvana watches TV and eats a big snack next to his big TV, but no culture for them. This lack of an overly sensitive side is one of the reasons why they do not have children. <br /> <br /> Of course, the simple pleasure of a man is nothing special and contributes to the charm of the show. They live in Queens a normal life of the working class - in this sense, this is realistic. And overall an amusing and pleasant sitcom kitchen, especially if you just want to relax. It gets a bit tired in the end, so it's probably good that it ends. It was a good run. See also Becker.
