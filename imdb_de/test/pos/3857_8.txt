I have to say, a big reason why I loved the AristoCats is because I love cats! I love cats, which probably gave this movie a big score of mine, but not only that, it was definitely a good movie Well, and I love where they play the film's location. This is one of my favorite animal films, though it's animated, and I love that the actors did not sound so unprofessional behind the voice of the animals. For me, this movie seems to be a classic, but I do not think that's the case for IMDb, because I think I'm too low on a rating than this, but still, AristoCats is one of the best animated films out there and me could always enjoy it !!
