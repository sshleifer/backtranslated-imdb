This is one of the better sci-fi series. It includes character development, some really exciting moments, and meaningful episode scripts. As another commentator here said, it looked like it was a miniseries, not a full series of filler episodes and low budgets. <br /> <br /> The problem with the series, which is in short a Godzilla series It was too big, with incredible monsters, fantastic science, and then the Americans settled here. Then the show ended too soon, as the Olympics came and hey! A sci-fi show is a sci-fi show, but half-naked athletes running aimlessly are much more important. So you only made 15 instead of the expected 22 episodes. The audience was also small, as people did not really hear it at 8pm. In the end, the suits made it. Trust a marketing plan to destroy everything that looks original and promising from a distance. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: You have a show with good special effects, like huge monsters that kill people or destroy boats, and then go into the genetic engineering, transform humans, human clones, doomsday, tsunamis. The only fillings are scenes of aggressive rednecks or other annoying people being killed for their stupidity. The downside is that after 15 episodes preparing something big, the show ends. No real end, no closure, just a bitter taste in the mouth, as if you had only swallowed a suit.
