I just want to tell the woman above that the film credits Beethoven with begging. In the beginning, they show it. Many Thanks. I think that's an amazing movie. They chose exactly the right music for the mood of the film, the animation is wonderful and they chose the voices for the characters very well. It teaches children never to give up and always have hope. Princess Annika does not give up and shows children that they can do the same. The film also offers humor for all ages, parents and children to laugh about. The colors in this movie are great, and kids can feel really good when they see him. I've seen this movie for the first time, now I'm a big fan and I'm sure it will be your kid as well. Walmart sells tons of Barbie and the magic of Pegasus, so your kid can enjoy the movie even if he does not see it. Thank you!
