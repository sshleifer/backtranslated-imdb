When I saw Greek for the first time, I did not expect a show with complex characters, intriguing action lines and impeccable writing ... but that's exactly what I got. <br /> <br /> Greek is followed by several college students who are in the Greek system of Cyprus Rhodes University. Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus-Rhodes as a major in polymer science who wants to live in a brotherhood. His older sister Casey (the center of the show and the upcoming president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the campus's most prestigious student body) does not exactly support his plans. In fact, none of her friends knew she had a brother until he entered the college grounds! In addition to having her dorky younger brother pushed back into her life, Casey's friend Evan Chambers (soon to be the president of the Brotherhood on campus, Omega Chi) cheats on her with a new ZBZ pledge (Rebecca Logan), the devilish ZBZ President Frannie urges her to stay with him and she still has feelings for her bad ex-boyfriend Cappie (president of the campus party house, Kappa Tau). These characters are joined by Calvin Owens (a sporty, intelligent friend of Rusty, who happens to be gay), Dale Kettlewell (Rusty's hard-core Christian and "possibly racist" roommate and best friend) and Ashleigh (Casey's quirky best friend and confidant) two seasons (or four chapters) of the Greeks are often reminded viewers that the college life is not black and white, but "in grayscale from here". Each character makes a fair share of mistakes, but each of them has redeemable qualities. Casey and Cappie have a complicated but beautiful relationship throughout the series. The friendship between Rusty, Dale, and Calvin is not always perfect, but they survive every obstacle they face. Even Frannie, Rebecca and Evan (the "villains" of the series) are occasionally shown to be human. <br /> <br /> Greek shows college students at their best, from their worst side and in between. It's a show that shows college what it really is: a four-year adventure that tests, compromises and sometimes even changes people's morality, belief and willpower. <br /> <br /> Greek has at least one season if not more before it ends. I can not wait to see where the characters end up next. Greek is not a typical sitcom of the ABC family. If you want to get involved in a show that shows the truth behind human motivation, Greek is the show for you.
