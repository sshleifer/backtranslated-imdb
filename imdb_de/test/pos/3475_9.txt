I'm I Dancing (Rory O'Shea was Here) is about the story of two disabled young men, Rory O'Shea, who is almost completely immobilized and wheelchair bound, and Michael Connelly, who is weakened by MS and Also limited to a child wheelchair. <br /> <br /> The film is shot in Ireland when Rory arrives at a assisted living center. He finally makes friends with Michael, but only after a few tense scenes in which Rory rebels against the staff and the other patients in the usual "film way", playing loud metal music, with obscenities and general dislike. His budding friendship with Michael is underpinned by the fact that Rory seems the only one who understands Michael, or at least is willing to give it a try, the right to live in a specially adapted apartment. The apartment is paid by Michael's father, who has essentially given up his disability. The two also hire an attractive assistant named Siobhan (played by Romola Garai) to help them with their daily lives. This is essentially where the core of the film evolves, as both develop feelings for them. Michael is hit especially hard. Unfortunately for both, but especially for Michael, Siobhan does not feel the same and it causes her to go. When Michael returns temporarily and wants to return to the Asst. Living Center, Rory convinces him to continue to live alone. The film ends with a sad remark that many viewers may have already come, but in the end we have the feeling that Michael really became independent and the future belongs to him, as Rory showed him towards the end of the film. <BR /> <br /> You know, I can not say that I have seen many "disabled movies" and I do not know if they could be considered as a particular genre. But there is a kind of formula to them. A person is unwilling to go beyond their illness until forced by a liberating force, and Inside I'm Dancing really knows something else. However, what works is probably more subtle about the peaks and valleys that the two men go through, which you might expect. There are no intentionally unfounded moments and no manipulation by getting up and applauding. The sad parts are sad and the funny parts are funny. Some viewers may be a bit shy that Rory is the spiky-haired punk guy who thinks earing in the nose is too perfect a "rebel clich√©," but actor James McAvoy somehow makes it real. The same goes for Steven Robertson, who plays Michael. When Michael's heart is broken, it does not seem like a bad script trying to refresh the audience, but a young man who is in pain because of the unfulfilled love. The kind of pain that can affect many, regardless of their physical condition. Again, these are the kinds of things that make the movie work and excite without being overbearing and pleasing on many levels. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
