I think it's been over 40 years since I saw this series, but the memory of it has not faded a bit. This would be a natural new edition for DVD, it seems to me. Many of the performers have led to greater fame (Robert Hardy, Sean Connery, to name a couple); Although it was a small role, I still remember Judy Dench, then in her twenties, as Katherine of France (Henry V). She was very beautiful then and now. <br /> <br /> There is an indication on this site that the series was shot in color - is that so? Who of us would know - practically no color TV. Mores pity, no videorecorder; If so, some might have recorded it. As a way to teach English history, this series has become so tangible that few class teachers can.
