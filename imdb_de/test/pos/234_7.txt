Although I'm not crazy about musicals, COVER GIRL is a pleasure for classic movie fans, and especially fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. The movie may be dated by today's standards, and the story and songs may not be special, but the musical numbers are superbly staged and there is a great cast that fits in with the movie. Plus, the movie is a worthy introduction for fans of Rita Hayworth ... it's just breathtaking in the gorgeous Technicolor. Despite Jerome Kern's collaboration with the film, his music here is far from memorable or memorable in SWING TIME (1936), but the songs serve the film well. Dancing is nothing short of excellent, especially Gene Kelly's solo number and my favorite music number "Alter-Ego Dance". The amusing Phil Silvers almost steals the movie as Kelly's partner. Otto Kruger, Eve Arden and Edward Brophy perform well in their dramatic supporting roles. And Rita plays a sweet, charming girl here; a role far removed from her femme fatale babes in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941). All in all, this is a delightful movie worth seeing, even if you're not into musicals. However, the music of the film could have been more memorable, if only my favorite songwriters, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter, wrote the songs for the movie. However, it is the glorious Technicolor cinematographs and the imaginative dancing that are the true delights of film production. <br /> <br /> While watching Rita Hayworth watch, I have never seen a beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since I saw Moira Shearer in Michael Powell's masterpiece THE RED SHOES (1948). Watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her.
