One of my desires is to be a filmmaker and all I have to say is that I can not compete with the powerful drama The War at Home. The reason is that the spectacle is perfect and when you watch the movie, you know what I'm talking about. All I can suggest is the reputation, I was so busy and was extremely impressed. Estevez and Sheen's relationship on screen was absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> And so was his relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). The best scenes include these two. <br /> <br /> and the relationship between Sheen and his daughter, Estevez's sister in the movie. <br /> <br /> 10/10 and definitely in my top 10. I want the DVD!
