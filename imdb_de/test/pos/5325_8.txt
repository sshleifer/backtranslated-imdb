There are subtleties in this film that I think many people will miss if they are not careful. You really need to follow what Leland says, and read his character to find out why the movie is portrayed in the end. Nothing solid, it's not definite, it's about what the individual viewer makes of it. I think that was the plan from the beginning, people should not all understand it in the same way, it's almost about building a personal relationship with Leland, maybe to make him feel a little better. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, but its summary could never explain what the movie really is. It's dramatic and thought-provoking, a lot of heavy ideas, but the tempo of the movie is almost reassuring, even with its more intense scenes of screaming. I think it's probably Leland, he's just calm and almost cheerful, even when he's sad. The film embodies Leland in a sense. <br /> <br /> Of course it's captivating and attracts you if you let it, but there are some recycled ideas. I mean, Leland has many impressive dialogues, he is anything but typical, but he is not a prophet. Everything he says is not revelation, many people I know have mentioned things that he has mentioned, even I have observed some things he has observed. Leland is the unique and attractive character he probably portrays for Ryan Gosling's portrayal. <br /> <br /> In the end, acting is all extraordinary, there are no real baddies, there is no way to psychologically evaluate Leland. Maybe you understand him and life a little better. <br /> <br /> Comparable to Igby Goes Down I think, not comedic, but similar in its general way of life.
