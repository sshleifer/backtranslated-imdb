Act of course! Think about it, Closet Land could easily have turned out to be so horrible - a whole movie made in a room with only two people, and there are damn interesting things to talk about terrible. On the contrary, thanks to incredible portrayals From Stowe and Rickman, Closet Land is a masterpiece in itself. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that there is something for everyone. Individuals whose attention span has been reduced by dazzling sex scenes and random gunfire may find it difficult to digest Closet Land. Those who appreciate good stories without explosions should take a look (no matter how many video stores you need to call to find someone with them in stock).
