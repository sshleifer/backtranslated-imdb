Many people have a movie that they consider their favorite movie. My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing! The main reason this movie is a cult movie is perhaps the splatter effects that are mainly produced by genius Rob Bottin, and that this is the film that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from NY) because of the effects no great movie, it has to do with the history, the atmosphere and of course the acting. I've watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day for the last 10 years), but no one impressed me as much as this one, not even the great "The Boat". <br /> <br /> Here's my suggestion to you who like sci-fi and horror movies: Lie down on the good chair of your home. Make sure you are not interrupted by anyone. If you do not have a projector, sit near your TV and watch this movie wonder. Let yourself be enchanted by it and you will see it in my own way! <br /> <br /> Best viewing time: end of February between 5 and 9 o'clock in the evening.
