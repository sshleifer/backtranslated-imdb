I like Dylan Moran from his work in Black Books, although I found that some of his stand-up fans were very forgiving about long-flung holes ... but I was intrigued to see this movie in which he and Michael Caine and curiosity starred better. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. <br /> <br /> Dylan's vocal range and the characterization of the various characters he played in the film was absolutely perfect, something that went beyond the skills of a mere man's stand-up comedian and really on par with Alec Guinness, John Wurt and the other greats - really good in his portrayal. Michael Caine was a very compelling prima donna and the standard British movie The fact that a precocious child was available to be overly wise and withered worked - the only aspect I did not really like was the incredible plot of chemistry between Dolores and the cockney gangsta hard guy played by Dylan Besides that, it was great. <br /> <br /> I also like the end of the non-cop-out It always ended happily, but MC was beaten. OK, it's not exactly what's being ranked by your goolies, and that's the kind of thing a real crime boss would do to you if you cashed in 50,000 pounds. But it showed at least a small amount of reality in the story. <BR> <br /> I liked the movie and I would recommend it to anyone - but I would also warn it not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a bit slow. If you stick it, everything will come back. <br /> <br /> And in terms of cursing, they are in Ireland. It would not be real otherwise.
