I was actually happy when I played this game. The graphics were something new. The missions were great. But I felt I wanted more out of this game. It would be great if they could make a 360Remake for them. It would be much better then. This could only be the case because I focus on games like Resident Evil, Dead Rising and such games It was OK to play. One thing I absolutely hated about this game was Natalya! She was dying all the time and could not walk
