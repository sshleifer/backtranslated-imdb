It's the best movie I've ever seen !!!!!! i just love her !! I watch it every day! I have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania the 6-season will be broadcast! I am glad that I saw the show from the beginning and I am glad that I can see the 7-season through the internet. So far, Season 5 is my favorite: D I love it because Logan appears and the scene in which they jump is my favorite. I also liked Dean, but Logan is the best. I want Lorelai to stay with Christopher because he is beautiful. This show is good for all ages and worth it to be seen. I really want the DVDs, but I think that will never appear here in Romania, because I believe that they do not even know that they have fans here. but no matter what, I'll see it. Bye!!
