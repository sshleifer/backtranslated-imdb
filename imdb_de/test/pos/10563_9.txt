The story was well planned and interesting in itself. However, I find it difficult to write the review of this film without ruining it. To avoid that, I will not talk about the story here. <br /> <br /> I regard this film as a good adaptation of the book by Sarah Water compared to the previous "Tipping the velvet". I first read the book and later watched the DVD. The film retained most of the ghosts of the main characters of the book. Due to the time limit, the movie seemed to have been in a hurry over the last 30 minutes to handle Part III of the book. Therefore, she could not illustrate the scene well when they all met in the kitchen of Mr. Ibbs and the afterwards (even the book seemed to me to be in a hurry in this kitchen scene). Nevertheless, the film has really portrayed the story really well. It is really worth seeing. It is still unclear when BBC-America will broadcast this film. This is a pity. <br /> <br /> PS: notices that the age of Maud and Sue is 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; The latter is more reasonable, while the former is more akin to the age of the actresses.
