OK ... I've seen pretty much everything ... and some are considered classics that should not be (like all the Halloween movies that suck crap or even Steven King junk) ....... and become some OK, these are really great ..... (like the Soul Carnival) ........ and then some are just ignored ............ like (evil ed) or (pumpkin head and brain dead "the bud Cort One") then have seen a few times in your head and never let go ........... that has done to me .... .... and for my money that is much better than the last house on the left ............ The last house was great until the end ... then it blew chunks ... .. what kind of dummy will give someone a blowjob that has just killed his children .... completely stupid ... think the movie is "bully" or even "funny games" if you want realism and slip out .. ..... ..but this damn thing stayed with me for years ...... ... a cause Chuck Connors was always scary ......... two Tanya Roberts is the best female victim of all times ..... ... three the chick Getting smothered in plaster is still one the worst murders in the movie ... and 4. the telekinetic powers that came to my mind and came completely unexpectedly ....... not to mention the dummies wax puppets etc ....... it should be right there with Psycho, Last House, Texas chainsaw, etc ....... it's a classic .............. and deserves it ........ ...
