One of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers (there were a number of such films in the 1970s). This is about an accident at a Neuclear reactor and the attempts to cover it up. Jack Lemmon is the staff member who realizes how dangerous the facility is, and Jane Fonda is the television reporter who takes the story on board, and both players are naturally scary at their best and not at all far-fetched (lots of What has happened here at Three Mile Island), and though it looks like a piece of the epoch, it nevertheless highlights how fragile and fragile a dangerous world we have created for ourselves. Expect a series of similar films on the effects of global warming (and no garbage like "The Day After Tomorrow") soon.
