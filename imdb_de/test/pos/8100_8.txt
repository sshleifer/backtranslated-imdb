Okay, it's too long and it's too contented. Nevertheless, "The Great Dictator" is a fascinating film. Chaplin is doing a fantastic job ridiculing Hitler and trying to portray the oppression of Jews in Nazi Germany (before the concentration camps were known). No Chaplin masterpiece, but still worth seeing. <br /> <br />
