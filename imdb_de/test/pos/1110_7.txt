This film has used its filming locations really well, with amazing shots, dark and disturbing, the movie moves very slowly, but keeps you constantly in view. Modern Love has worked well this year on the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program, offering audiences an insight into an Australian cinema that is usually neglected. Most importantly, it is refreshing to see that Australian cinema does not take over the clich√©s of the Australian characters and stories that we've experienced over the years to death. This film would compliment any festival and open a debate after its screenings. The performances and characters are well developed and the cinematography is fantastic. An interesting exploration of family relationships and environments.
