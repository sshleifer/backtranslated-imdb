Since this show was cut early, I never knew why until I recently read the story behind the series. I felt that this show was never paid as one of the biggest shows. This show is iconic and deserves the movie they should always have, if not with the original A-team, at least if the cast has been integrated into the storyline a long cameo, maybe at the end to the late Colonel Hanibal Smith (Preppard) , That cast gave us so much that we became happy when they grew up, that they deserved one last punch. The fact that the series ended openly because it cut the series is reason enough. This crew and cast has taught us as children that it is one of the good things to be one of the good guys, especially when you see how bad the world is today. I think a milder version like the original should be set in motion. I've already read the previews and know that I know. These are not the plans, but if any movie directly on DVD, I would definitely buy it. I really do not understand how crappy shows get serial finals, but this great show that's still going on today and probably more than some of today's current garbage shows, we do not always remember the Incredible Hulk series, Knight Rider, Airwolf, and the A-Team, because these kinds of shows are going through time, I'm almost certain that those knowledgeable about detectives will not even be remembered in 10 years. So why not bring something and show people what durability is all about as these old shows really are.
