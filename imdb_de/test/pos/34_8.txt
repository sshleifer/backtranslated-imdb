Lackawanna Blues is a touching story about Nanny, a woman who works for the needy. It is narrated from the point of view of a boy who was picked up by Nanny when his own mother does not quite live up to the task. <br /> <br /> I have respect for this movie for three main reasons: 1) It's touching but not sappy It's told in a very real way, without much of the aggravating Hollywood storytelling luggage. And the end is pretty good (tearful but not over the top). <br /> <br /> 2) Although it is clearly an African-American film that plays in the black community of Lackawanna, New York, it does not wear its ethnic appeal. The story is based on the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) that surround their lives. It's not preaching, it's just good. <br /> <br /> 3) It has a great soundtrack (can not beat old school R & B and Chicago blues). <br /> <br /> In general, the acting is strong, but not common. Some of the performances simply did not stand up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray. But if you consider that this is a TV movie, this is to be expected. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Imperfect but sympathetic, good movie for a rainy day.
