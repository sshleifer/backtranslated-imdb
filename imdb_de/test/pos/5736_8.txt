Six teenagers visit an abandoned old school where a terrible massacre took place 27 years ago for fun and pranks. Instead, the kids run by the vicious, crazy watchman (who was superbly played with the extremely scary threat of the Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy) who has committed the evil murders. Director Carlos Gil tells the fascinating story at a brisk pace and manages to create a captivating eerie and mysterious atmosphere. The witty screenplay by Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgueras offers a clever and inspired mix of slasher and supernatural elements that let the viewer guess right to the end. The filigree cinematography of Fernando Arribas uses light and shadow in a knowledgeable manner. The atmospheric score of David San Jose also does it. The attractive and appealing young performers all contribute to lively and engaging performances, including Carlos Fuentes as ringleader Ramon, Olivia Molina as panicky Maria, Zoe Berriatua as disgusting joker Jordi, and Carmen Morales as spunky goth chick Sandra. The murder kits are as bloody and brutal as they should be. Great hitting of a surprising dark ending. A solid and satisfying shocker.
