Every episode I saw as an innocent child was stupid. There were some weird-looking puppets called "The Mitts," who always dealt with childish things. They played this song before "The Mitts" as part of the show, which reads "Let's go to the mids ..." Before the session, this man sang "Hot Fudge! Right On!" There was a green puppet with teeth called Seymore. We would see more and more Seymore. He would joke and sing every episode. There was always a moral in every episode. In one episode a man sang "liars are losers!" In another episode, he sang about sharing and caring. Seymore told me about these two little girls "Sharon and Karen". The Hot Fudge Holey Moley part makes this man weird stuff and they played weird music.
