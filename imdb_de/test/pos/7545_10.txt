This funny English comedy about schoolgirl antics is a neglected gem. The key question is, where is the audience? The film is rated 10 by most voters, but how many voters are they? They no longer make comedies because the films are not spread or seen. I would never miss a chance to see this old arthouse classic again. But where are the art houses?
