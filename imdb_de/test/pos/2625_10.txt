I was a 20-year-old student who lived with the people when I saw this for the first time, and I've never forgotten it. I'm a big fan of Joan Hackett and this movie was perfect for her remarkable talent. I'm so glad to see that so many other people like to think about it. Of course it is not available on any medium! It would be perfect to show on Lifetime, but not because of his age. You never see anything there before the mid-eighties. I can still remember why I saw him on the first run: Rex Reed reviewed it in the New York Daily News, and said it was a throwback to the big Hollywood movies of the 1940s, and if so The Hackett and Grimes parts would have been played by Stanwyck and Crawford. Think about it! P.S. So sad that Joan Hackett left us so tragically young.
