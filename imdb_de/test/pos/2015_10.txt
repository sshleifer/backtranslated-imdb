This is the second movie about 1985, the other one was "The Wedding Singer". While the 'Wedding Singer' was the pop side of the 80s, 'Rock Star' is all about metal. Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of a famous rock act of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in one day. <br /> <br /> The story does not get too dramatic and just scratches the surface of a rock star. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it's full of rock'n'roll! The music is fantastic and the concerts are brilliant! The whole concert feeling is very well captured, as they used a real audience (no cgi here). <br /> <br /> A great direction and a brilliant performance by Marky Mark, who looks like a real Metal guy! <br /> Rock Star is all about fun, and if you're into the old metal scene, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
