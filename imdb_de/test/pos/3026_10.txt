"The Cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying journey into the mind of a serial killer, but also a talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved when people unleash their unrestrained ideas. This is boldness at work, pushing thoughts aside to fall into formulas and stereotypes and create something truly great. This is the best movie of the year so far. <br /> <br /> I've read a lot of complaints about this movie, from all style and no substance to badly cast characters and bad actors. Negatively criticizing this film means overlooking the point. This film could be a milestone, a tradition hopefully followed by future films. "The Cell" has just opened the door to a different world of imagination. So can we slam the door in the face and tell her and her director Tarsem Singh that we do not want more? Personally, I would welcome more than one other Tarsem film and would like to see someone trying to challenge him. <br /> <br /> We all heard how to get into the head of a serial killer, and yes, I agree that the "genre" is a bit overworked. The '90s were full of movies and tried to show what makes serial killers tick; Some worked, but most failed. However, "The Cell" is not the same track, we get a new twist, we are physically put into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject ever studied. Br /> I like it, like The film does not over-trick us with too much scientific jargon and tries to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually enters someone else's brain. Instead, she just lies down on a lab bench and is wrapped in really long twizzlers and dumped in another entity. "The Cell" wants you to "see" what it's about and not "how," and I guess some people do not like that. Although I like explanations with my films, when a movie breaks new ground, it has to do what it wants and just record it. <br /> <br /> I've noticed that the movie was very dark showed the reality to contrast the bright pictures in someone else's brain. Still, the scenery was amazing. It would not surprise me if this movie would take home some Oscar awards, best costumes, best director and stuff like that. If it were up to me, it would at least be nominated for the best picture. <br /> <br /> I noticed that somehow I repeated myself. Not because there is nothing else to say, but because I can not stress enough how fantastically I thought "The Cell". If you go into the movie with a very open mind and take it with miracles and a breathtaking party, then you have a good time. I think this movie was a little bit too much for some people, writing it as "weird" or "crazy". I am very interested in psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was in my alley. When I left the theater, I heard a viewer say, "Who made this movie made a lot of good drugs." If so, I want what he smoked. <br /> <br /> **** (out of 4)
