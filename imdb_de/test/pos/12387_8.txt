I suspect this movie is not a typical Spanish thriller as it is based on a true story that has taken place abroad. The film is based on the true story of Frenchman Jean-Claude Romand, and the real case is much more bloody and scary than the movie. In the true story of Mr. Romand, the family could not escape. After years of lying, he decided to end it by killing his wife, two children, parents and dog. It is very hard when he survived. I saw the movie with people sitting next to me talking about how it never happened in real life, that all those lies went undetected. I laughed when I read the book on Mr. Romand and knew that this could happen. I like Jos√© Coronado in this movie, he gave us a good performance like the rest of the crew.
