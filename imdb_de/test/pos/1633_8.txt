While the Da Vinci Code sent us Dr. Introducing Robert Langdon and his puzzle solving skills, Angels and Demons raises a giant puzzle with a limit of 8 hours. <br /> <br /> With a series of award-winning actors, Ron Howard manages to stage a story that's easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci Code threw so many angles in such a short time that a short break in the bath would make you a bit confused on your return. I did not feel that this was the case with Angels and Demons, the conspiracy was straightforward and the action kept interest rates high throughout. Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite feature of the film. His account of the Catholic Church's elite but misunderstood reputation was very good, and in combination with the victim of his treatment, the Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will immediately select the pages after the introduction. There is not much time for Tom Hanks, as the film focuses more on the story than on the character development, and this was good, since I had more than enough introductions from the first movie. Unfortunately, I have Ayelet Zurer's character. Vittoria Vetra was an unnecessary female search assistant because her lines were somewhat limited and thought-provoking. She plays an important role in the beginning of things, but she will soon take a back seat to being Langdon's "acquaintance," more than a necessary partner. <br /> <br /> The act, as such, is one of the organizations that the Catholic Church has wronged in the past (there were some), has been craving for revenge in the most artistic way. Some of the men of the church are kidnapped and executed at certain times until a final end is reached. Robert Landon is used to decipher the clues and works with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed a colleague who died by the enemy of the church. Music Remains Relevant and Cinematography Nice, I could talk about those vile things, but what makes Angels and Demons work is the conclusion. It was by far one of the most surprising endings I've seen in a movie, and I was impressed by how unprepared I was when it hit me. Like everyone else, I appreciate a great wrap-up, and this movie sums it up pretty tight and casts a nice bow on it. It is needless to say that I have satisfied the theater in its entirety. <br /> <br /> If you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that if the DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shady coverup group of sadists, the angels and demons paint it with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as a collective of good men destined to suffer for the sins of wicked and misguided men who wear their colors, and even for some who have invaded their modern ranks.
