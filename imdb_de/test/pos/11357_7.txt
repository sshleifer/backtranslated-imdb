I'm from Ireland and I thought this movie had the one or two minutes where the accents were off the mark, but no worse than any Brad Pitt or other American who plays the accent. Also, I've rarely seen a British actor use an American or Canadian accent, with the exception of Colin Farrel in Minority Report. This movie is a small movie and it was entertaining. No, it was not a Hollywood production of Blockbuster, but I'm sick of that shit. I laughed more than a few times and had a good time. It was definitely worth the rent. The main character is a spoof on other tough British gangsters. At least that's what I saw. If you expect a production of 100 million dollars, you will be disappointed. Enjoy what it is - a small entertaining movie.
