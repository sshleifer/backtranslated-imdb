It was the first time I looked at it in black and white, about Christmas in the early sixties, when it was shown on British television. I was addicted and kept looking at it when it was repeated on TV (maybe only two or three times as it happens - if we had only VCRs!). <br /> <br /> As previously mentioned Other contributors describe the return of Hoppity the Grasshopper after an elapsed time in an American city of the 1940s. He finds out that not everything is as he left it, and his good insect friends (who live in the "Lowlands" outside the garden owned by a songwriter and his wife) are now the "human" ones they are trampling threatened by the broken fence, which has the property in front, as a shortcut. <br /> <br /> Insects are crushed at their feet and often burned by discarded cigar stubs and matches. Old Mr. Bumble and his lovely daughter Honey (Hoppity's childhood darling) are in grave danger of losing their honey shop to this threat. <br /> <br /> To further aggravate their problems, sneaky insect "real estate magnate" C. Bagley Beetle has romantic designs by Honey Bee himself and hopes to do so with the help of his henchmen Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito Bumble force him to shake hands with him. Will the heroic and fearless Hoppity win and manage to save the beetle community from its insidious fate, and especially its precious honey from hers? Enjoy the classic songs ("Katy Did, Katy Did not" is an excellent, swinging example) and the colorful visuals as the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> Time has not mitigated my fascination with a masterpiece of animation and storytelling, and I was very pleased that it was released as a video, though I later found out that it was in NTSC PAL format was. Anyway, I sent the video immediately and only then bought a portable TV / video combination (complete with NTSC playback). <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed many nostalgic views ever since and have even discovered that TV rights have come from the BBC (who told me they're unlikely to ever show the movie on any of their channels) FilmFour, who showed him (finally!) In early 2007 on his digital channels. <br /> <br /> My granddaughter (three years old) was absolutely thrilled when we looked at it together - and this is a child influenced by the digital age and the resulting computer-generated productions! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie for all ages and especially for the youngest viewers. <br /> <br /> Give Max Fleischer a posthumous Oscar!
