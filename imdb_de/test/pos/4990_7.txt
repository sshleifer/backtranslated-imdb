"Comanche Moon" has given everything. For starters, Simon Wincers back, a man by name, who stands for high-quality TV Westerns. Unfortunately, even the most talented director can not solve the problems with "Moon": A bad script based on a lackluster novel. <br /> <br /> Forget Historical Accuracy - As any reader of the novels can say, the greatest travesty in "Moon" is that it does not even match the information from the original "Lonesome Dove" masterpiece. So many wonderful, rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater extent the book is completely missing in "Moon". Given that most Moon audiences are likely to have at least a kind of "Dove" background, the lack of a story based on characters and emotional backgrounds is downright painful. <br /> <br /> That is, "Moon" is an example where the customized version could and should be changed to make it more suitable for the screen. For example, the novel "Moon" focuses largely on the Comanches themselves. Granted, the miniseries try to serve the Comanches, but in the end, they give them just enough that the viewer gets the feeling that they miss an important part of the story. Similarly, Val Kilmers loses Scull here too - the role should either have been expanded so that Kilmer (and Rachel Griffiths) actually had something to do, or the roles should have been reduced to smaller, supportive parts. Instead, Kilmer receives a top billing for a character in which you have to scratch his head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act. <br /> <br /> There are weird moments throughout the movie that make no sense to those who have not read the book (a killer parrot? what?) - and there's not a single scene that shows us Call and McCrae are all close to the amazing Texas Rangers they claim. None of their Moon (or "Dead Man's Walk") expeditions ends successfully, and Call and McCrae seem to be bringing one mindless mission after another. <br /> <br /> Frankly, Larry McMurtry should never have written the script just because of the praise surrounding the other cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels (though there is some disagreement about the consistency of this statement), but he has never established himself as a screenwriter. This production would have benefited from bringing not just director Wincer but also original writer Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to the screen. Witcliff does not have a wealth of material to write on paper, but no one can deny that he did a fantastic job assembling the original "Lonesome Dove". Despite all this, "Comanche Moon" is almost a brilliant production, supported by a great cast, for which unfortunately there is not enough. Steve Zahn's portrayal of Gus McCrae - or rather his portrayal of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae - is terminally ill. And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call, he says his performance does not mimic the quiet, stoic Woodrow of the original film. I can only say McMurtry is to blame, because McMurtry is the one who is both in the "Moon" novel and now the miniseries - turning Woodrow from socially inept, awkward, but natural leaders into an emotionless character whose lines are just boring and whose motive motives are only clear if you see them in the "continuation" represented much better ". <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is the cast that sparkles in "Moon" so much that I left the miniseries with the same sense of melancholy when I saw the original "Lonesome Dove" - ​​this time because of Me It has become clear that this is probably the last time that we will see these characters on the screen for a long time - and frankly, this cast could have done so well in a well-built Network Series television series. <br /> <br /> All in all, aside from the cast's wasted trait, Bi Ggest's travesty is that the original novel Lonesome Dove contained so much rich background story for the characters that would have been intriguing and absolutely mesmerizing to be translated on the screen. Unfortunately, all this was dropped in favor of McMurtry's boring, contradictory and ultimately irrelevant prequel.
