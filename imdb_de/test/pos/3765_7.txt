It took me a while to find this movie because it's not on DVD yet (and my VCR is not worth reconnecting it). I think that all references to drug use are too much for some people. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay, and I have to say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is left behind. It's a baton parody in the vein of "Airplane." I have to say, when I saw it on Showtime or Spotlight in the 80's, I enjoyed the humor much more than now. But in any case, it is worth seeing only what they (that is, filmmakers) could get away with before the Just Say No hypocrites unleashed their propaganda. sing ... "We're all on drugs" hahaha It's a stupid movie and worth the 10 dollars I paid from Ebay to get them on DVD. What are you up to?
