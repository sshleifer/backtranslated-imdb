Loved this movie, what a scream. Rupert and Julie are great, and Rupert is almost a poker against Julie's animation, which worked well. Laura did a good job as a cocky mother. Of course, Julie is wonderful as always. While this movie will make you laugh most of the time, it also has a poignant side as it reveals the secrets in the lives of the main characters. Interestingly enough, it was titled "Driving Lessons", as it could be assumed that this is the main feature of the film. However, this is not the case, although it could certainly be seen as a "ben" sitting in the taxpayer's own life. Like most things that are funny in life, there is always the sad side and there are moving moments in this movie. Very pleasant movie and worth seeing.
