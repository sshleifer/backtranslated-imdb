I have not seen a movie for a long time that moved and grabbed me. that I could not take my eyes off the screen. I blew up for the toilet; and I did not even want to pause it, because I was directly involved. Emotionally; powerful; very touching; terrible and heartbreaking. It gives you an amazing insight into South Africa. her struggles and her life. The acting by the leads was incredible and the script was amazing. Despite the terrible events that are developing in this film and how horrible the story is; I was intrigued I do not even want to try to explain the story; It's way too complex and I would not do it justice. Please see that; You understand why, when you do it. Cheers, Hol
