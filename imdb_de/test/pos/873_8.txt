On the island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, the owner of a Louis Mahé cigarette factory (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is hired by correspondence with Julie Roussel and does not know her. When Julie arrives on the island to marry Louis, he waits for them in the docks, but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger ship, noting that she is completely different from the one she sent to Louis. They marry and Louis tells her bank account. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis urging her sister to write to her, Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie, who is missing. He also notes that the woman has deleted his bank accounts and left the island. Louis and Julie's sister hired an effective private detective Comolli (Michel Bouquet) and Louis travels to France to look for the woman, but he has nervously collapsed in Nice and undergoes intensive sleep therapy at a clinic. He recovers and realizes that the woman, actually Marion Vergano (Catherine Deneuve), works at the Phoenix Club Privé in Antibes and lives in the low-budget monorail hotel. Louis breaks into her room and when she leaves the club, she tells her that she was happy with him, but her once dangerous lover Richard had blackmailed her. Louis is still in love with Marion and flees to the country with her. But Comolli follows Marion in France, who is accused of murdering Julie. <br /> <br /> "La Sirène du Mississipi" is a film noir of the great director / writer François Truffaut with an unconventional love story of passion, murder and death love that hurts. The Femme Fatale Catherine Deneuve is amazing, probably in the forefront of her beauty and she is delightful to see her face and the top without scene on the street and in the room. Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic and the order in which he escalates the walls of the hotel is impressive. Catherine Deneuve makes this film worthwhile and gives credibility to the passion and lust of Louis. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sereia do Mississipi" ("The Mississippi Mermaid")
