... means "to record and read", and that's what I wanted to do after this wonderful movie. Stimulated and inspired by angling with this stunning and excellently executed adaptation of Tobias Wolff's 1995 New York article of the same name. The incredible power of Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and direction are truly inspiring. The nuanced changes and embellishments of the original story are subtle and clever, making the film kinematically more dynamic. The lyrical tempo is hypnotic and asks you to look at it again. <br /> <br /> Take care of this young director ... he goes to places.
