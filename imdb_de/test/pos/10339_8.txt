This is the kind of movie you initially choose to put together the numbers from the video rental ... just to discover an undervalued entertaining and entertaining movie !! The opening sequence of the police arriving in a dark and rainy house where the "woman" committed the murder ... or is it ?? ... and the rest of the movie tries to figure out what really happened. ... OK ... the film is a bit "tough" ... but has good editing and dialogue ..... professional acting ..... often humorous ...... and the very last scene with The facial expression is one of the best of its kind ... definitely worth a look ... and deserves at least a 7 or an 8!
