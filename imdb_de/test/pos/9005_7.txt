As a former Highland Rugby (HR) player, I may be able to answer some of the questions and confusions that have been asked. I think that I am also able to give an insight into the club and background stories. Oh, and that will be a long mail, I can say that. <br /> <br /> First of all, the people who said that the movie does not show a proper rugby have a valid point. The film is full of bad duels, people in the wrong places and much more. If you want to know what a real rugby game feels like, you will not get the best idea in this movie. But the thing is, just sitting down and watching a highlight roll or jumping into a game yourself will not be satisfying. It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Really, in how many sports movies do you really feel like in the game? Not many that I have seen. I think it's important to know that this movie is about rugby players, much more than rugby. <br /> <br /> Next, the Haka is VERY part of Highland Rugby. It's not something they just threw into the movie. To be honest, I do not know how the tradition started, but Highland mimics the All Blacks in many ways. The uniform is also based on the All Blacks. The film did not explain the origins of the haka well, and to be honest, I do not think that's right. But I can tell you that each team member knows exactly where it comes from and what it means. As for the person from China (?) Who said that only a Maori can perform a haka, I would suggest that they look at the All Blacks and tell me if they think they are all Maori. Believe it or not, Utah has a very large Polynesian community, and a large part of them like and play rugby for the local teams. I myself am part Hawaiian. Whenever possible, the haka is led by a Maori. The team does not do it because they think they are Maori, they do it because of some of the problems that are shown in the movie. The concept of unity and "those who have gone before" is a big part of the HR culture, and the message behind the Haka supports those who are familiar with it for those values. It is the song of a boss who thought he was going to die (Ka Mate) and the supporters around him said he would live (Ka Ora) and strengthen him. How appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys to do that is not for me to say, it's the ideology behind it and why it's done. "Kia Kaha" is also a common team motto, though it was hard for the actors to say it. <br /> <br /> Also for the people who questioned Highlands rugby gambling ability, I would like to remind you I have not really seen Highland in this movie. Many of the extras were former players from Highland and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. Believe it or not, Highland is really good at what they do and pretty well respected in the international community. Granted, a few years bring out better teams than others (that's what you expect from a sports team), but you do not get an HR record if you're okay. The year after I graduated (1998), Highland was one of 12 teams invited to the World Schools Rugby Championship in Zimbabwe. The teams were selected by hand from around the world and were the best rugby talents in high school back then. Obviously, Highland did not win the first place (New Zealand did), but they managed to reach the third place of the tournament and win in the final game against the Tongan national champions. And although American rugby can never reach the talents New Zealand or South Africa have, third place in the world is not something you can think of. Highland has a tradition of touring New Zealand every few years, and usually brings more profits than losses. <br /> <br /> The majority of the characters portrayed in this film are based on real people and real stories. I saw this movie with my brothers who also played for Highland, and we were pretty sure we could identify almost all the main characters. Nobody knew a white rasta. Of course, since this was not a documentary, Hollywood took some liberties, but to tell the truth, not as many as you might think. The film was actually pretty accurate in terms of the two and a half hours of daily exercise and the prescribed personal running and strength training. Sometimes it really worked, until you vomited. It also showed the service and other team activities (like the chuck-a-rama buffet) that made up a large part of the team's commitment. <br /> <br /> And finally the movie, my (obviously very biased) opinion It was a pretty good movie. And I think the reason for that is that I saw it as an inspiring sports movie. I did not think it would be a pure rugby movie or an academy-winning drama. It was just an uplifting movie about a rugby team, complete with morals, encouragement, and a good dose of jokes to entertain. I hope I have addressed some of the issues that people have had with the movie, and I hope you can enjoy it the way it was. <br /> <br /> Kia Kaha
