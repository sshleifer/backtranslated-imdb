The main criticism of AT THE EARTH'S CORE is that it's cheap, the special effects are bad and so on and so forth. Yes, some of the special effects are painfully bad, but many people overlook the fact that it's really fun, which is very important in my book. <br /> <br /> In comparison, you should only look at the latest STAR WARS movies: they have the latest special effects created by the latest technological advances. They are capable of producing stunning visual effects as far as human imagination can imagine, yet these movies were as exciting as a funeral. As Yoda would say, they are not fun! In other words, who cares if the effects are not the best, if the spirit of the film is fast, humorous and clear on the side of the action? I love everything about AT THE EARTH'S CORE: the contrast between boring Victorian England and the wild world, the colorful backdrop of Pellucidar, the cast of characters, the concept of a lost underground world, the telepathic Pterodactyls, the rebel human slaves, Jubal the Ugly (lol!), the inspired interplay of Peter Cushing (who is great!) and Doug McClure, the excellent music (really good), the camera of the amazing Alan Hume and not least Caroline Munro. She is sexy in this movie. One of the sexiest B-movie girls ever to be screened. <br /> <br /> Seriously, anyone who does not like this movie does not know what's fun. Gimme AT THE EARTH all the hot STAR WARS prequels at any time! At least Caroline Munro has no CGI effect ever.
