I saw this movie at school and was really excited. Based on a true story, this is an absolutely great masterpiece of a movie. Seriously, I could not find anything wrong. A key plus is how it was filmed. The Wind and the Lion, set in Morocco in 1904, is particularly filled with exciting images like the big Raisuli on horseback. The cinematography was impeccable, the cut was crisp, the costumes were great and the scenery was breathtaking. I have to mention the music of Jerry Goldsmith, she was phenomenal. I have needed a lot this lately but Goldsmith is not for nothing my favorite composer. His score here is so rousing and exciting, it shows the true musical genius of the man, and this gem should end with the best notes from Goldsmith with Legend, Rambo: First Blood, Patton and The Secret of NIMH <br /> The action is intoxicating and the script is smart and refined. The direction is also treated sensitively. The performances were also amazing, with Sean Connery, who always portrays the image of charisma and thoughtfulness, as magnificent as the Great Raisuli, dominating almost the entire picture alone. He is accompanied by a spirited Candice Bergen, a cunning John Huston and a captivating Brian Keith in one of his more restrained performances. The story is pretty accurate, maybe weak in some areas, but with acting, music and visuals, so good that I do not care anymore. 10/10 Bethany Cox
