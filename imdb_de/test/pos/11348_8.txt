This extremely intimate story of a failed romance between two married people bound by their traditions succeeds in staging Hong Kong in 1962 (in turbulent times, as we are informed), scene after scene of lush colors, evocative yet restrained Sensuality (as opposed to the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes that have become the norm in a novel) and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication. It is not difficult to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here, as she is known for minimalism in storytelling and powerful drama with the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two strongly-bound characters, as well as the use of re-describing scenes that may be occur in the lives of both characters. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, the pin is clearly visible as we enter the cramped rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Ms. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung), to the last scenes where the intensity explains will regret that he remembers as he remembers the opportunity that was lost in confirming this relationship. <br /> <br /> The plot is even similar to something that Duras could have written: Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su Li-zhen, Neighbors in One Although they are both quite successful professionals, they begin in the most banal way discover that their spouses are cheating on them, and they naturally discover that they are together. The question is whether they should act according to what they feel to each other or not like their partners. Each scene plays with the notion that they are going to yield to each other at every moment, and at some point it is suggested that they are as intrusive as the camera tells us their encounters in detail (the ones that appear on a scene) on a daily basis, like through the frequent change of clothing from Cheung can be seen), we never see it. And if you do not see one of the two partners adding to their own love story, the fact that you're not attracted by it makes the final split even more bitter, because we want something at any given moment - some catalyst - and that Only one who comes is when Leung reveals to her that he loves her, followed by his silent brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, which means he will not. It also gives us an insight into what culture and timing can do: from a Western perspective, their romance could have become a more solid, enduring affair, especially in the 1960s, but as cultural values ​​are in Hong Kong, as well different. <br /> <br /> The performances are of a high standing: It's very easy to play a hot love affair, but playing a repressed, platonic relationship that's so close to craving is hard and hard whole sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual. Cheung and Leung are smoldering and their depraved chemistry lasts long after the credits end.
