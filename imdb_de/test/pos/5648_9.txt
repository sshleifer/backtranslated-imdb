A relentless descent into a psychological and physical oblivion that will undoubtedly burn images of the true brutality and suffering of war into your cerebral cortex like no other movie does. In fact, there is simply no other war movie like this one. <br /> <br /> Director Kon Ichikawa experienced the unimaginable horror of Hiroshima just ten days after the bomb was dropped. He said that from that day on, his job would be to express the pointless, empty power people inflict on each other and themselves. <br /> <br /> Mr Ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in the war ... because the roads to victory and defeat are paved, and the same soldiers march soullessly through the streets, only death and destruction at the end to have. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa manages to bring his message through this haunting cinema.
