This movie is all about entertainment. Imagine your friends, with whom you like to spend time, and those who know you from inside, a little stupid and may accept one or two characters. That's what this movie is about. An imaginative script and brilliantly performed. It's not about pleasing the masses, it's about having fun with a bunch of talented people. I'm sure they all thought when they signed up for it. <br /> <br /> The above review sounds totally unfair and I think the person who wrote this was in the mind when they saw the movie. In a carefree moment there is a great dignity in it, if you want to take a look at it. <br /> <br /> A good job, I thought it would be a great movie. I would look at that every day before the North American standard. <br /> <br /> In short, it's not the best movie you'll ever see, but it has a hell of a lot of moments. I did not laugh so long at one age.
