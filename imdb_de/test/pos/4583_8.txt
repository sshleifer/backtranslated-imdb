This must be the stupidest movie I've ever seen and therefore deserves a special award. Ok, so it starts off pretty well, logically, humorously and then quickly changes to completion and utterances, which makes perfect sense. The strange thing is that I hardly laughed at it, though I think it should be funny, with a very serious message. After thinking for a moment why I did not laugh, the answer was pretty clear ... This movie is much more realistic than I would like. So it's extremely stupid and very wise when it comes to reaching people who are not blessed with a lot of neurons and synapses and electrolytes (like electrolytes?). This film could be understood by a large audience on a certain level! <br /> <br /> Although they probably just laugh. <br /> <br /> Well, nice try ... <br /> <br /> I am currently editing my comment as I have read some of the other comments. At first I noticed that some people see racism in this movie. Well, that did not occur to me at the sight. But I can imagine that if you look from this perspective, you will see a few. Of course we could discuss the connection between intelligence and race, but I think that's not the place to do it. If we were to rate the Huxtable family here, you would complain that they are all black. I do not think so, but I think you could ... (Besides, of the two smartest people in the world, the half, the woman, the woman does not seem to be totally coquettish to me, so what's the problem? ') <br /> <br /> Second, the film receives very mixed ratings. From 1 to 10 and everything in between, but a lot of polarization there, which means that the movie does its job very well! It irritates people and lets them talk and judge. That said, it's a good movie, whether you like it or hate it. After 5 minutes it gets very predictive and boring, though you always look at all this crap. I assume you continue to hope that this is not the case. Or maybe it's our sick way to see terrible accidents. Well, that's for sure.
