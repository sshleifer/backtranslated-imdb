This is halfway to a top movie. The opening section, in which films from Hollywood "Social Message" are faked, is absolutely awesome. It's a turmoil from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The second section, which introduces us to the main characters in the story, is also really great. We get a lot of great comic setups, first-class performances and the dialogue is very dynamic. <br /> <br /> (Warning about spoilers!) <br /> <br /> One really bothered me about it But the movie is the end that I think contradicts everything that went before. My interpretation was that this film exploited all the stupid biases and allusions of gossip in the small towns and the national tabloid sensational mix. I loved that the movie argued for the cause that the sexuality of a person is NOT determined by hobbies, idiosyncrasies, fashion sense or whatever. And then the end ends and reinforces all the gossip and stereotypes that made the film successful in the first place. It turned out that everyone was 100% right !!! (godamit!) This was very disappointing for a really great story.
