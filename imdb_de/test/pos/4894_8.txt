After three outstanding BBC television series and a Christmas special, the bizarre and grotesque (but perverse loveable) characters of the dark fictional city of Royston Vasey and their creators - The League of Gentlemen - make the leap into celluloid. <br /> <br /> Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are the better known three quarters of the foursome, with the trio's key roles in common. In another twist, the final member of the team - Jeremy Dyson - is portrayed by actor Michael Sheen. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? Dyson (Sheen) is in discussion with his writing cohorts as two of his cruelest characters pay him a visit. Both Tubbs (Pemberton) and Edward Tattsyrup (Shearsmith) are unhappy with the League's decision to kill the Vasey residents. "You are not real!" Dyson screams in vain as the local shopkeepers take their revenge. Mayhem follows as reality and Vasey come together with the large number of characters who enter our world to save their lives. <br /> <br /> confused? They will, like the camp, be affected by allusions of homed Germanic tribesmen, Mr. Lipp (Pemberton) has to dress himself daily to the Pemberton, while Pemberton (Pemberton) is kidnapped by the cannibalist Hillary Briss (Gatiss) and Geoff tips (Scissorsmith) <br /> <br /> With the shades of an even more denigrated Misery, Briss tries to force Pemberton to rewrite the film - and thus continue his life - but leaving Geoff in charge is never a good idea. The former comedian becomes involved in The League's latest adventure after Vasey - The King's Evil - and enters a typically twisted 17th-century England, complete with cameos by Victoria Wood, Peter Kay and David Warner. Geoff, known as George of Asda (due to his chosen clothing line), saves the day and is treated like a hero, but to release the film he meets old and new characters of the Church of Royston Vasey to meet them makers , <br /> <br /> For fans of the series, the film is a must. And yes, there is Papa Lazarou (if a bit too fugitive). Pin-loving Pauline, Mickey, Barbara and damn veterinarian Matthew Chinnery are some of the favorites featured in the show, and The League's portrayal of herself (plus Sheen's as Dyson) is also a fascinating discovery. <br /> <br /> The League of Gentlemen is the radiohead of the British comedy - they are ambitious, groundbreaking (witness the excellent series Three) and are not happy to rest on their laurels. They also share the opinion accordingly. <br /> <br /> Her macabre sense of humor is certainly not for every palate, and although he was not written exclusively for "fans," an understanding of the plot would benefit those who have previously dealt with the theme series , Nevertheless, Apocalypse is a standalone film, and The League will undoubtedly succeed in attracting and appeasing a new generation of fans.
