Alistair Simms inspired Miss Fritton's transcendence of objects. It's one of the big comedy characters in the movie. Equally wonderful is Joyce Grenfell's character - Ruby Gates. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you need to curl up on the sofa on a wet Sunday afternoon and be transported to a time when there are only terrible, raging schoolgirls winning our respect - not our anger! I've heard that a remake with Rupert Everett as Miss Fritton is imminent. He'll have a tough job competing with Master - or should that be a lover? - Alistair Simms. <br /> <br /> Go and lend it - it beats so much of what is considered a comedy today.
