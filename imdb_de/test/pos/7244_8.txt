As always, Joan Hickson is as wonderful as Jane M. Subtil, keen and aware. I do not want to go into their acting skills as they are praised enough on this page. I would like to criticize some of the smaller parts as the rest of the cast was hand selected by director David Tucker. Liz Fraser's performance as Mrs. Bent (the mother of the missing girl Nora) is a pleasure to see. Subtly and deeply moving like the alcoholic mourning mother who desperately loves and misses her daughter. A good shot of her monologue (thanks Tucker!), So that she can be fully enjoyed. I was touched when I saw her the first time she was sent, and I moved back, now I have her on DVD. Brava. <br /> <br /> Joanna Hole as Madge the tour guide I find very amusing. She is on the verge of over-functioning, but her role can be. She's as funny as the over-organized tour guide who wants to do good with everyone on this bus, I think she's weird. Her reaction, after she has climbed everyone on the bus, is great ... As always: To play comedy, you have to take it very seriously, and that's what Ms. Hole does. <br /> <br /> I hope the two ladies have good careers (since I live in Holland, I do not know if they can, not all theatrical productions can be googled ...) - their performances on screen deserve it , <br /> <br /> Pieter
