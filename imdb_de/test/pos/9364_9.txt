Crossfire is one of the forties movies that is screaming for a remake, if for no other reason than it may be time to do it the way it was originally written. The story on which the film is based is about killing a gay man. But anti-Semitism was certainly a hot topic in the days following World War II, and the Holocaust was on everyone's lips. <br /> <br /> In the Lee Server biography of Robert Mitchum, director Edward Dmytryk was interviewed and bluntly said that at a time when The Code was firmly anchored, the film never turned over a hate crime against gays can be. It could, however, have happened because Robert Ryan has so much equal opportunities for everything that deviates from his social norms. Mitchum was said in unequivocal terms that he was riding in the movie exclusively for the movie. Robert Young was cast as the murder commander of the Washington, DC police who are handling the case. While Mitchum received the second prize, he knew from the beginning that the film would belong to Ryan. However, due to his appearances in The Story Of GI Joe and Till The End Of Time he was the new star of RKO, so he was there for the health insurance. Mitchum's role was as sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case of George Cooper. Crossfire is not a whodunit, even though we do not see the crime, it's clear that Montgomery is the only one killing Sam Levene, the epitome of the Jewish salesman. Young and Mitchum realize that Ryan is almost as fast as the guilty party. It is only a matter of proof. <br /> <br /> Ryan received one of several Oscar nominations that the film received, its Best Supporting Actor category. Although he lost to Edmund Gwenn, the film was Ryan's breakthrough role. Similarly, Gloria Grahame was nominated for a short role as a party girl for Best Supporting Actress, but lost to Celeste Holm for Gentleman's Agreement. In fact, Crossfire met Gentlemans agreement and lost to Best Picture and Best Director for Dmytryk against Elia Kazan. It is already the fifth nomination for the Best Screenplay, and Crossfire was short again. The winner was Miracle in 34th Street. Gloria Grahame also had her own troubles on set, bubbling out of her personal life. She had big problems with her then husband Stanley Clements, who was an abusive husband. He hung around the set and caused many problems for Ed Dmytryk. Fortunately, Grahame was a small part. In fact, the entire film was shot in 20 days in the typical RKO-economy style. <br /> <br /> Robert Young has a particularly beautiful scene with William Phipps, a young kid from Tennessee in Mitchum, and Ryan's outfit, which Ryan constantly disdains. Young speaks most about the caustic nature of hatred and how he influenced his family as Irish Catholics who came over in the years of potato famine. It was one of Robert Young's best moments on the silver screen in his long career. <br /> <br /> As good as a movie like Crossfire is, it's time to tell a story about an anti-gay hate crime. Especially with the real murder of Barry Winchell from the last decade and the debate on gays in the military. This is a movie whose time has come and is almost over.
