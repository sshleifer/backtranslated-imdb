A few years ago, when I rented a few movies, I came across Subspecies 4, looked at it and somehow liked it, we need a good vampire gore strip that does not hold back. But when I went back to the video store, they said they had no other subspecies videos. Unfortunately, this would work for any other video library that I checked out. I gave up until someone on Youtube actually posted all the subspecies movies and I was able to watch them all last night and I'm addicted. I am now a fan of the Full Moon Subspecies series. I think because this was the type of horror movie I was looking for, I was looking for a good cheesy fear for a long time, and subspecies filled that place. Radu is one of the coolest vampires on the screen and almost gives Nosferatu a run for his fangs! <br /> <br /> Radu is a bad vampire who is looking for his bloodstone, his birth rite, the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives him strength. Three American women studying Romanian history and culture encounter a man, Stephan, who offers help. You stay in Radus Castle, where we learn that Stephan is Radu's brother; Radu seduces and transforms two of the girls, but Stephan falls in love with one of the girls, Michelle, and will do anything to protect her. <br /> <br /> The subspecies is a funny series, despite the cheesy effects it creates in some ways more personable. Plus Radu was a perfect villain, because Stephan was the perfect angel like a romantic vampire. The story is chilled and I think that was a funny vampire movie. This was also the first part of the series, the best part is, the sequels are just as much fun. I would recommend it for a scary movie night, looking in the dark, Radu will certainly send shivers down her spine or even her neck ... OK, cheesy joke, could not resist. <br /> <br /> 7/10
