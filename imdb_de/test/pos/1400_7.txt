Finally, I had the opportunity to settle in and compare the two versions of this film that are currently in circulation: first the good old, shabby Embassy VHS print called SCREAMERS and then a new fully restored Italian DVD from every new favorite media company. No shame about Italy. <br /> <br /> The American ads about "men turned inside out" are, as everyone says, utterly misleading, suggesting a Roger Cormanized interpretation of what would otherwise be a superior fantasy adventure. Thriller would be adults. The complete Italian version is a slightly extended, well-designed and deliberately made version of "Island of Dr. Moreau", and there's nothing wrong with that. It's a lush, attractive euro horror trip with a brain, good conspiracy, character development, filming, costumes, and sets. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that the 14 year old Knucklehead Weed Buffer is still lurking Somewhere in my interior I got a bigger kick from the slightly sharper, sloppier and unkempt Roger Corman version that is a bit over the top Horror, a catchy but absurd opening segment and then the bulk of Martino's original film, albeit shortened, has room for Roger's notion of entertainment. The tempo was a bit faster, the shock sequences approached each other, and you see as much of Frau Bach's fantastic shape as you do in the extended Italian version. <br /> <br /> I still do not have much idea what the story is about: there are a number of plot shifts and random characters that were a little hard to follow. A local voodoo subplot did not help much, and it's funny how it all culminates in another fistfight between the noble, castrated prisoner and the mad scientist ... Maybe a few more sightseeing trips are fine. I say it this way: Fans of the film should take advantage of one of these PAL imports and take a look at what a movie is, and not just a bleak old home video - the compositions for wide-screen shots show once again that Martino has one eye had to fill his screen with interesting stuff. Nobody gets torn off like in the SCREAMERS print, but it's still interesting stuff and again proof that his standards were limited to the gutter area, but Roger Corman is a new, trashy fun than he is did for him and next to each other, these are actually better films than they had to be. <br /> <br /> 7/10
