Less than a year after the withdrawal of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan, the issue has been re-launched in the eyes of the cast, the director and the public. Most performers are real soldiers and officers who have just returned from the war. The Soviet Army cooperated quite a lot during the shooting, which is strange. The Afghan intervention was a bloody and senseless war in which even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed. This film shows the tension and cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy of the troops and the pain that shook a small nation torn by war and civil war. <br /> <br /> There is no lack of powerful scenes. One of the first are photographs of steel coffins being loaded onto a transport destination for the USSR. Soldiers go about their work while an officer quietly picks off the targets: Moscow, Rostov, Donetsk, Baltic Sea. <br /> <br /> An earlier comment describes the final scene with Maj. Bandura as illogical. It is absolutely logical and in the spirit of the film: The only human relationship Bandura entertained was the Afghan family he accidentally kills in the attack. After losing his one and only buffer against the futility of war, Bandura turns his back on the boy (and his weapon) to give up his fate. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the last scene: a flock of MI-28 climbing over the mountains when a pilot's voice screams: "Uhodim! Uhodim rebyata! (we go, boys, we go!) In a tone of sincere relief. <br /> <br /> Afhanskii Izlom is an excellent movie - brutally honest and as unholliwood as they come.
