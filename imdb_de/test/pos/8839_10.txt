When John Carpenter's masterful version of The Thing came out in the summer of 1982, critics banned it and bombarded it at the box office. The audience could not deal with another "evil" alien, they wanted ET. Your loss in the long run. <br /> <br /> I would kill to see this great movie on the big screen. This is a movie that was far ahead of its time; Now it has influenced a new generation of filmmakers who are making their mark on things like "Se7en", "Alien 3" and even "The X Files", which they are tearing down page by page. And the structure that avoids the character's development in favor of the incredible SFX is commonplace in today's blockbuster flicks. Carpenter shows the same skills he has refined in "Halloween" by using the camera to create a disturbing and claustrophobic impression of atmosphere. The performances are all good and the end is terrific - still unique today. <br /> <br /> A paranoid masterpiece.
