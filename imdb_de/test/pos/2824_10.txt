OK, first to all hate: Get a life! I do not understand why you even bothered to post on these forums when you obviously do not know anything about cinema, robots or people. <br /> <br /> In this film, we learn all important information about gender, stereotypes, relationships and AIM. Really, we are all robots programmed to respond to certain stimuli without thinking. How many times have we seen a sunset and made a few banal comments without thinking about it? I say: THANK YOU Aqua (brilliantly played by Bernadette Peters), that I must stop thinking about the incredible power of Mother Nature. <br /> <br /> Only when Val and Aqua refuse their programming, they begin to understand their true desire - to find love and escape from the factory in search of a creative life. This film should be seen in prisons - just think of the dreams and hopes that it could inspire for the inmates. Maybe they could even overcome their "bad" programming and join us in a criminal-free world. <br /> <br /> We can all learn a lot from these robots. I am a better person for Heartbeeps.
