We still love the movie and the soundtrack "Valley Girl". I have been obsessed with video for eons of time and have worn off the original soundtrack. I have several friends to meet and we have "80's Raves" - parties we meet, music from the 80s and "Valley Girl" on the big screen. We have a great time. <br /> <br /> It's all a lot of fun, you know?
