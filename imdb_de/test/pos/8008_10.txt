Of all Bat movies, Batman Returns is my favorite. This beautiful, dark and funny movie is one of Tim Burton's best works. Although much more violent and darker, this is the Batman that the creator Bob Kane imagined many years ago. Michael Keaton repeats his role as Avenger of Gotham City. This time he has two deadly enemies, Danny Devito's penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. With a great cast and score by Danny Elfman, the movie takes us on an adventure as Batman battles the evil forces trying to take over Gotham City. Christopher Walken is a great act as Max Shrek, a smart businessman who has a nasty system up his sleeve. But Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who steals the show. With all these components you have a movie that will blow you away. That's why you go to the movies. It has everything. It is a pity that Tim Burton was unable to lead the other sequels. If so, I think the franchise would still be strong today. Batman Returns is a fantastic experience for fans who like cool movies.
