Over the weekend, I saw the movie Tipping the Velvet, and if I had to make this movie out of 100 films, I would have to ask him 100 questions. I am a true believer in true love and this film has moved me in many different ways and the actors fit without much to the roles. But I have to say the end was not so great, because I did not see that spark in Nancy's eyes, if she ever saw in Flo's eyes, as her eyes sparkled with every glance at Kitty, Kitty had to be in the room or in Nancy Thought and Nancy would glow before that spark. Kitty told Nancy that she could not find her and that she was looking for her, but could not find her. Kitty was ready to give everything up to get Nancy back. Kitty's eyes showed Kitty's pain. I think Nancy should have made Kitty realize that her love is true and strong and that she would not let her go that easily. You have to do a second part and they have to do it together, but you must not let anyone else play the roles that it is, the real Kitty & Nancy, or it will never work. My mother once told me that true love is just not real. I'm not a fool, I know that we all have a true love, waiting somewhere for each of us, and I believe with my life that Nancy's true love is really just Kitty and Kitty's true love is only Nancy. Come on, let the game play the right way, just like that. Let Nancy's eyes light up again ... Kitty lost everything by losing Nancy. And Kitty is not the only one being charged. I'm gay myself and being gay is not easy !! WAKE UP!!! In 1889 I did not want to be gay, Kitty was deeply lost in herself, and in 1889 perhaps it was the right thing to be married to a man. Although you love a woman. Kitty needed Nancy to stand up against her, needed Nancy to fight for her. I remember how much I loved this girl, and I let her escape because I thought I was doing something wrong and went back to my ex-boyfriend. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I knew it was wrong to let her go, and I'll pay the rest of my days, because like Kitty, I could not find her anywhere. I heard that she is married to a man somewhere in the US. I even heard that he defeated her. I think in the end we both lose. Give the two girls another chance. Life can be very lonely if you are not loyal to you and your loved ones. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Kristen Ann
