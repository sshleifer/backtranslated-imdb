This is their top priority, though there were others, such as micro-phonies and punch drunks, who deserve Oscar nominations more than these. But if not otherwise, the recurrent announcement of the speakers "Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard" followed by Curly's "woo woo woo woo" makes this a classic on two levels. First, it symbolizes everything the henchmen represent; My daughter loves to repeat the announcement when she's about to do something stupid. Second, the absurdity of these three as doctors in a hospital; I imagine the horror I would feel if I were a real patient in a real hospital and heard that announcement over the loudspeaker. During this short message you will hear this announcement and you know that something terrible will happen and the speaker's voice will stay with you months later.
