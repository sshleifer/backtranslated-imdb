Based on the novel The Dismissal by Ermanno Rea, the story essentially revolves around the slow friendship that develops between the Italian maintenance technician Vincenzo Buonavolonta (Sergio Castellitto, who is seen as the malign king in Prince Caspian) and the main character in Bella Martha ) and a Chinese translator Liu Hua (Ling Tai). They were indeed on the wrong foot, the former chastising the latter for their inaccurate accuracy, and slow translations of what he wanted to tell a Chinese delegate who had bought faulty equipment. Vincenzo wants to do the right thing, which is rare these days. This means informing potential buyers of the shortcomings and intricacies of their purchase, and he is worried that the deal is still going on. He takes a break before him to make a component that would put things right. <br /> <br /> But that also means traveling to China in search of the elusive machine, which proves to be well hidden and seems to have disappeared without any trace. With the initial reluctant help of Liu Hua, they set off from town to town for this treasure hunt, leading us to lesser-known attractions in China, away from the Beijing and Shanghai, to cities like Wuhan, with industrial backdrops such as steel mills and nuclear power plants Chimneys characterize the scenery. The mighty Yangtze River also appears. Along the way, the usual features of such travel-style films come into play, such as learning culture, ideals, food, and basically understanding that the world is strangers, if you just try and try to connect , Although hints of romance between the two leaders are hinted at, it rarely has become a contentious issue until it may be late in the movie (hey, opposites attract, no?). Apart from the large industrial plants and factories, we see various metallurgical companies, such as seamstresses who work in a sweaty environment, and I believe Cotton, along with pasta making. As a film, he offered me the opportunity to travel without leaving my place, watching as a merit that he had no moral good for exploitation and the like. And also a big praise for the movie to start a dialogue based on the characters' native languages ​​instead of (and I will not name names here) some other films / intercultural collaborations that enforce dialogue and become unnaturally and truly annoying , Some may find the supportive characters too friendly by always opening their arms and their doors to a foreigner, but I would imagine that people in the more rural areas in general are more likely to be more genuine, friendly, and basically not received in the rat race caught trampling others or being trampled on. <br /> <br /> If there is a message that I should take out of the film, apart from the fact that I have mentioned that the world is without a stranger, then that is one I remember that some of the things which I consider important, for others may not be so. Importance is something you put on something else, and its basis really depends on how we define the boundaries we set. Considering our limited lifespan, I think I should lighten up a bit more, live and let live, and sometimes indulge in the illusion that ignorance could be bliss.
