This is one of the best "Bloke" movies from the early 90's and although it's a bit dated, it's one of those films that would never be done today, which makes it something very special! In fact, in the 90s, a very similar movie titled "Masterminds" was filmed and it was a PG variation of the same theme, but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic as to what's special about this movie? It is the comrade between the main characters and the contradictory theme of the film. Sean Astin is very sympathetic and has starred in some of the most memorable movies of the 80's / 90's, especially in "The Goonies". He also went with "Rudy" and "Lord of the Rings" trilogy about bigger things, but "Encino Man" is a good journey into the past. Will Wheaton from "Stand by Me" gives the film a nice support and Andrew Divoff is a terrific villain. Louis Gossett Jr goes through his sleep in his role, but he adds a certain amount of brevity to the film, especially his relationship to Astin's rebellious nature. <br /> <br /> So what does it look like? By today's standards, it's pretty boring and cheap, almost like a TV movie, but the production values ​​are good and the violence is quite uncomfortable for a movie with students. However, the director compensates for the limited budget with some exciting moments and well-placed humor. <br /> <br /> So park your brain at the door and enjoy this lovingly reminiscent action movie, but do not expect Oscar material!
