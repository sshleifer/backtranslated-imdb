We bought the DVD of "Walking with Dinosaurs" and were almost thrilled with the things that are being done so well. Many DVDs today provide the bare essentials ... the feature itself and perhaps another language (which does not help the viewer at all, but makes it easier for the company to see the DVD in different markets). <br /> <br /> Not so at WWD. There are so many wonderful extras and sophisticated vignettes that it is even interesting to see for yourself the * navigation menu *. The intros to each chapter in the "The Making Of" DVD are funny laughs. The quality of sound and video is excellent. And of course the story and the content ... what more could a dinosaur lover ask for? <br /> <br /> I watched most of the TDC-broadcast version (told by Avery Brooks) and then viewed about half of the DVD (narrated by Kenneth Branaugh). As far as I can tell, the broadcast version slipped in a series of predominantly American slang terms in the narrative (ie, in a section on T. Rex's mating, Branugh says, "The female tires the man's attention," and Brooks : The Honeymoon is over "and some of the closer puppetry games cut out. I prefer the Branugh version just because it's more complete. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good value and a wonderful production BBC and the crew that made this gem.
