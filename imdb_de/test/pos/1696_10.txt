Of course I think it was a great movie. I recognized several people I did not see during the shoot. I was the one who played the watchman in the movie on the death row practice site for about an hour and asked for a cigarette. I also changed this one scene. Originally, they had set it up so they could go to the rec yard, line up the detainee, turn him around, and lead him out. The director said, "It takes too long, what would you do to Gower?" I said, "We have to go in, hook our arms in and pull him out the back, so your camera can stay on his face when we get him started." I also lived as a small child in the same prison because my father was the deputy security guard. I am also a current employee of the Tennessee Department of Corrections as a Supervisor at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. Although many films were a joke, the part I was in was real enough. Also in the bar scene, the dancer jumped high and left the stage as a stripper with whom I work in a club called "The Classic Cat".
