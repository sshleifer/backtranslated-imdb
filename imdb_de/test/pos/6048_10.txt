By today's standards, the DI may seem a bit hokey. Lee Emery's version is more accurate. I completed a boot camp in 1964 in Parris Island, SC. Jim Moore is as close to reality as you could see on screen in 1957. PVT Owens is like many in a much more difficult situation than he expected. Like so many, he joined the Marine Corps for wrong reasons. My drill intructors were more like GySgt Hartman than TSgt Jim Moore. A lot more. The DI is more Korean era and Full Metal Jacket is more Vietnam era. Today's films allow such a thing on the screen. I have the DI in my collection. I recently found it on DVD.
