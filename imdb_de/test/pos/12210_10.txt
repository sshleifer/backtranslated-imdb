I am new to this area, so I ask for your understanding. I'm a big fan of Surface. I found the script and computer graphics extraordinary, just about every sci-fi strip I saw in the theater. In February, the TV guide Season Finale said the presenter of the show said something to the effect "... and now to the season finale of Surface." Season finale, no series finale! I could not wait for autumn to come here to see what would happen next. Autumn is coming here and can not be found anywhere! If NBC does not pick it up, what about Sci Fi or the US? It seems to me that Bay Watch did not last long at ABC, then the US picked it up and it went gang! (I bet ABC has hacked) Ha! If it is not a series, then at least a mini-series to give us all loyal fans the conclusion. What happened to our guy in the church tower? Was the creature in the chapel Nim? Did he have a scary spurt? Is the cloned guy coming to our site? There are so many unanswered questions. Thank you for listening to me babble!
