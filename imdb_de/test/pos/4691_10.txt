I have some great memories when I saw "Robin of Sherwood" on TV as a kid (but I think for some reason I just saw the episodes of Michael Praed). And recently, my brother bought the newly released DVD boxes of the complete series. It was great to see it again, and it's the best of all Robin Hood movies and TV series. The cast is great, and the locations blended with Clannad's music give it a very special feel. Personally, I think Praed is the best of the two Robins, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series. Ray Winstone, Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie are great in their roles as Will Scarlet, The Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne. It is a pity that a fourth season was never made, and I have also heard that the author Richard Carpenter had actually planned a feature film after the events of the series. Robert of Huntingdon (Connery) could marry Marion (Judi Trott), or maybe Herne, the hunter, could revive Robin of Loxley (Praed), and he could take revenge on the sheriff. As already mentioned; If the producers of "Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves" were smart, they would have gotten the cast of "Robin of Sherwood" and made the movie a sort of sequel to the series. As Ray Winstone has included in the DVD bonus material, it would have been great to see her as old men, as well as in Sean Connery's "Robin and Marian." Who knows, maybe in the future we will see more of this perfect interpretation of the legend. In any case, we can now see our favorite series again and again!
