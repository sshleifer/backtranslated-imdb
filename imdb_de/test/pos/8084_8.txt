This is an action-oriented film and extremely entertaining. Nothing terrible or original within the plot, but what matters is that it moves at a fast pace and therefore attracts your attention. I did not really notice acting, which I think is a good thing. John Mills was fine, but seemed to take everything in his stride, considering how his life was shattering around him. He was shaken on the head, got up 20 seconds later, dusted himself off and kept going as if nothing had happened. A small mistake in a movie with a strong story, authentic locations and an action that keeps you guessing right to the end.
