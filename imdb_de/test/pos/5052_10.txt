As a Czech, I am very happy when I read these comments here. I am absolutely sure that this movie is great. And what you may not know is that the story was written especially for Mr. Brodsk√Ω. The man you can see is him and his typical attitude - to live and to resist death. He was one of the great actors and we are very happy that we have made so many beautiful films in his life. You are lucky that you could see at least one of them. Enjoy.
