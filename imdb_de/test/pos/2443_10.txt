Yes, great cult TV series. Great atmosphere, first-class screenplays and good performances make this DVD an A-candidate. <br /> <br /> This is a groundbreaking tour of Australian TV history. The soundtrack of this unforgettable, groovy piece with Doug Parkinson's pebbles and slime spewing the 70's Australiana across your entire cathode raybox is amazingly revealing the open road religion in all its antipodean glory. This is a souvenir from another and not too distant epoch, and has the proud stamp of the mighty Down Under from start to finish in all its raw freedom and pithy grandeur. <br /> <br /> Come on, ABC! Get the program and release this cool '70s cult baby so everyone can enjoy it - or enjoy it again if you're lucky enough to have lived the dream at that time.
