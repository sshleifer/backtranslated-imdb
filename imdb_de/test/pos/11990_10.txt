I'm in a huge minority here. I did not particularly care about the original caddyshack, apart from the chase / murray duo scene and the selection of rodney jokes. Okay, break it up: Rodney Vs. Jackie - both Jews and have a similar sense of humor. Rodney is a bigger name and clearer. Jackie has a casual and more observant approach to his jokes. Jackie's attitude to everything is memorable and inspiring! His quick lines and too much trust made me want to express myself that way. Rodney was good, but there was not enough of him, and he was more in your face and dismissive. jackie, in a rare cinematic performance, is a perfect sub for rodney (come on, a gun-shaped hair dryer?!?!). really, look at the little things! <br /> <br /> stack vs knight- both snobby yuppies play very well. Ted Knight shows his age despite his wonderful TV / movie career. But he removes the snobber claims of the part and we want to see him fall. Ted looks a bit weak and is pretty annoying, playing his anger and his frustration too slapstick while stack is more random and vengeful; You really hate him and enjoy it when he constantly fails. stack wins with me. <br /> murray vs.. aykroyd-well, both had great, SNL-like scenes with the ubiquitous and entertaining chevy chase (ty webb). i liked the murray / chase one better. Murray plays his big, annoying, talkative character with obvious improvisational skills and is adorable - but annoying. and the same goes for aykroyd. both get annoying after a while, but it's a draw. <br /> <br /> I really loved the second part. There are 2 completely different mood. Part one is more drug / bad / sex humor with a cast full of big names. Part 2 uses golf as a backdrop for a comic-it-to-the-rich comedy that makes you feel better with the working class. 80 script? Yes. a bit far-fetched? yes, but was not the first? an insult to the sport of golf? Yes, it is a movie. thin story? Yes, it's a comedy with real humor - not 'dances with wolves' !! Besides, part 2 has a much better soundtrack !! PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT THIS SEQUELE TO SHARE !! IT IS 98% OF ITS OWN FILM AND SHOULD NOT KEEP THE 'CADDYSHACK' NAME. That said, I'm a big fan of Caddyshack 2 and it's a great exponent of 80s fluff entertainment with high quality humor. VIVA JACKIE MASON !!! lighten to all reducers! It's a great comedy for itself. cool quaid was wonderful, Jonathan Silverman was wonderful, shit, everyone was !! all this chat and now I want to see it! I think I will
