In my work with the only nationwide non-profit organization, Security On Campus, Inc., which focuses exclusively on the issue of preventing high school crime and raising students' awareness, I too often see the kind of violence and "cover-up" on the issue secret campus dishes that are depicted in the movie "Silent Mary". In fact, every month we receive numerous calls and information requests from campus reporters such as Mary, who are in similar situations. <br /> <br /> The portrayal of a campus rape and the subsequent crusade of "Mary," the victim's roommate, and a student journalist played exceptionally well by Melissa Joan Hart, for justice was very well done and well researched. <br /> <br /> This was the first TV movie I ever saw, and it really felt and reflected all the various complex issues associated with it, such as rape and other violent crime in college and our university Nation treated. Although it would not be possible to fully address all these issues in two hours, this film comes closer than anyone I've ever seen.
