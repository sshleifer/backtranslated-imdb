Well, for all the hype and Oscar nominations, I expected an epic Civil War drama (and something about the "size" of the "English Patient" given to the same director). This movie is not epic in stature, but it turned out that I was relieved that it was not him. It's a love story amidst the horrors of war, where young men are sent into battle, deserters are persecuted and killed, and the women and children at home have to take care of themselves while the men have left. <br /> <br /> I found Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger quite decent and did not know much about Jude Law, he was fine too. It seems that Rene Z. had had the funnier part of the 3 leads and was able to intelligently play a spirited, lively Downhome woman with a lot of sovereignty. It was also good for me to see actress Kathy Baker ... someone's talent needs to be more recognized. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing - I can not say why, really, but maybe because it's a bit of Americana. <br /> <br />
