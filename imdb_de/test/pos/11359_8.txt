MY DINNER WITH JIMI takes a look at Howard Kaylan's dizzying and dizzying journey with his 1960s folk rock band The Turtles. The Turtles were a kind of "second tier" run in the 1960s, but the film clearly shows that they can eat, drink and party with the Titans of Hippie Culture. And not only that, they had the musical possibilities to support it. Many of the most outstanding acts of the era are seen at work and playing with the band. This is my only complaint about the movie. Almost at the beginning of the film you can see that it is almost impossible to find actors who are convincing imitations of such recognizable stars. Too often during the movie, I had the feeling that I saw a fascinating exhibition of false wigs and mustaches. However, if you're a fan of The Turtles or The Swinging 60's, this movie might be for you. Do not forget to see the extras. Band members Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan report on their catastrophic experiences with managers and agents.
