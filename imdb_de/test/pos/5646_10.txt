My first Ichikawa for many years and the first of his war movies I've seen was gripping and brutal from the start. In the first scene, the nominal hero Tamura is told that he can not continue his unit to which he returned from the hospital. He apparently has TB? but he is not sick enough for the hospital to bring him with the amount of casualties they have. But his old unity will not bring him back; His commissar gives him a grenade and tells him that if he really feels hopeless about blowing himself up, that's a matter of honor. <br /> <br /> The Philippines of 1945, and the situation seems really hopeless, for PFC Tamura and everyone else. Nobi is an odyssey through hell or hell? barren forests, dead rocky plains and the dead and dying Japanese soldiers who hope only for an end to peace or death. Ichikawa's film is shot in a breathtaking black-and-white area that highlights both the devastation of Tamura and those he encounters on his journey towards destiny, showing how small and naked they are all in the midst of endless mountains and forests are. This little affair of man will end soon, the earth seems to say, but I will survive it and barely notice it. Tamura travels back to the hospital, but is (not surprisingly) rejected and spends the rest of the movie on living, staying human, and avoiding the danger. He certainly does not manage very well to starve slowly and eventually make some rather repugnant acts. Finally, he joins forces with two other desperate men who have lost or survived their units and returned to cannibalism. In his weakened state, confronted with other armed men, the only way to live is to break with everything he believes in. Ichikawa's film is so brutal, uncompromising, and so on intense like every war movie I've ever seen. There are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are fleeting and unappreciated, as is the scene with the man on the top of the mountain, who practically asks Tamura to eat his flesh - the recurrent black-and-comic piece in which Tamura is Swap exchanges ragged shoes for the better leather of a fallen comrade ?? the degradation that people will survive? the truth that this is some war, all wars, all humanity, as long as we go on like this. A masterpiece that I probably will not look at for a long time. Seen on the beautiful Criterion Collection DVD.
