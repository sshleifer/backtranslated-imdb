I do not think this movie deserves the low rating most people will give it. It's one of the best "teenage" horror movies I've ever seen. and that says a lot. Nothing can be explained without explanation, the characters and the storyline break countless stereotypes of the horror movie, and that has nothing to do with some of the other awful pieces that have been presented to us lately. (A clear example is the mindless "Saint Ange".) The first 30 to 40 minutes, with the exception of the beginning, are downright boring, although some minor flaws are easy to spot. Upon arrival in the village, however, begins the horror - another twisted kind of horror -. <br /> <br /> With the plot and the details, blunders are insignificant; The characters are the strongest point of this movie because so many clich√©s are broken in it. For example, the two male protagonists Nick and Wade are by no means the idiotic types we're used to. Although Dalton could fit better into this stereotype, he is not the only one paying for this lack of awareness. Some scenes are really satisfyingly dreadful and make good the tense moments that are spread throughout the movie. And in the end, and although everything is decorative, it's easy to see that things are not that easy for the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> The only flaws I can see that do not imply continuity (ie, Carly does not find her own finger in the pockets of the unconscious bo) is the lighting that in the first, boring 30 minutes somehow is annoying. Although in terms of actions and effects, everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters in Ambrosia, this small village in the midst of nothingness, so do I. It is fairly often claimed that about 70% of the film is illogical; "How can two people build a whole house of wax?", "Where do they get all the wax from?". These would not be an increasing issue if people had paid more attention to the film. The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax; Her mother worked on real wax figures and was exhibited in the museum. The answer to the second question is the scenario in which the unfortunate character of Paris Hilton encounters her premature death. What about all the personal belongings (cell phones, cars, clothing) of the dead? If you use your third brother as a connection to the outside, it's quite controversial that the Sinclair twins should get the money they need to buy the wax in a World War II way. I think the movie is worth a lot more than that he gets, and nobody should lose the chance to look at him. So go to the house of wax. Right now.
