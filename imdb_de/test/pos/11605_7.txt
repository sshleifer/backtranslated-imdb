I agree with what mallicka.b said. The movie is presented in a way that looks like a denigration on the original content. Emotions are not conveyed correctly. I think a few less good performances also contributed to mediocrity. In my opinion, taboo would have been a much better choice than for Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she seems a bit relish, which is not what the movie should have been. I also noticed that some of their scenes were overplayed. I am a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can not help me; I'm sorry. "Raincoat" was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing raincoat. I was not impressed at all.
