It was likely that I saw this television movie that interested me in the debate as to whether "Anna" really was the daughter of Tsar Nicholas Anastasia. Since I've seen it, I've looked at various documentaries and also bought a book. Despite the evidence that has been discovered since the release of the film, I still sometimes think it was. So powerful is Amy Irving's acting in this 2-parter movie, which is a bit liberal with the historical facts, but crammed with frightening drama and Irving's totally compelling performance. I was not aware Irving was aware before, even though I must have seen her, without noticing it in "Carrie" (another favorite movie). In "Anasasia" I never felt for a moment that "it's just a movie". For me, this woman was Anastasia, and when the first part in the railway carriage ended with members of the royal family, I knew that hell or the high water had to see the second part. I just wanted to see her prove that she's the one she claims to want to be, and as the story progresses, I feel a strong hatred for Rex Harrison's character, though I admire him very much as an actor. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie again in the TV Newspaper, I convinced my mother to see him and thanked her for being almost as enthusiastic as I was watching Part 2. Then I bought the video and totally recommend it. "Anastasia" is one of those rare television movies that you just have to see to see the best acting I've ever seen on TV, and it does not matter if you believe the legend or not.
