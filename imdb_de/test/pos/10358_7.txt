I saw this black and white comedy noir at the London Film Festival yesterday. Structurally, it has been compared to Pulp Fiction, but it may be closer to the structure of Amores Perros and the relaxed mood of Kevin Smith's employees. Four stories cross at a French motorway restaurant. The first vignette made Franck (Edouard Baer) stop at the diner. The waitress Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) takes pity and tells him her story. The second has two incompetent kidnappers: Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere) take a young girl from her rich family. Unfortunately, she is suicidal and her family does not seem to have her. The third is a dialogue between two aging rock stars meeting in the restaurant (Alain Bashung and Arno play themselves). The last part is about four ex-criminals smuggling their old partner out of the hospital to visit their old hideout. The Diner An "epilogue" returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story (not really an epilogue, rather a conclusion). <br /> <br /> The structure does not really work. The stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in Pulp Fiction. The diner is also not crucial to the action on at least two of the stories in which the car crash was crucial in the four stories of Amores Perros. The quality of each story is different. The story of the hiding place is a cute idea with some good gags, but it does not come off; and the Rockstar reunion is pointless and boring. On the other hand, the hijacking story is hilarious, though their connection to the diner is weak. The most balanced and successful story is that of Franck and Suzie. <br /> <br /> This film is not quite successful, but has moments of interest and joy. I look forward to seeing more of Samuel Benchetrit's writer / director's work.
