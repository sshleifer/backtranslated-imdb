I saw this movie much like Skywalker02, but when I managed to see it again, and with formal film training, psychology, and life, I had the time to really take my hand and beat up on the movie. I remember that pay for service cable channels played this thing almost to death, much like poltergeist when it first came out, and many other popular movies. I had the feeling that it was not worth it, the constant "airtime" (I know, cable is not really on air), but I was very young and the adult drama would not have done that and should not have worked. However, the recent consideration of the film has enlightened me in the film. I think Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald probably studied the script together, and I would be a little surprised if Surandon had trained Ringwald during this project. Although Ringwald's other projects are good, they do not reveal the potential depth of this role. Surandon nailed her, as did Raul Julia. Cassavette and Wife provided acceptable performance, but I admit that first-class acting is mediocre. A steady ups and downs of acting take place during many scenes, but overall I can see why history can make the dynamics more subtle. <br /> <br /> All in all, I do not think this movie is meant to be boring, like "Skywalker02" that you could believe in. I think with this proper psychological training and a bit more harshness in one's life, strategically placed, coupled with some film classes, this movie might look different. I would say that if you feel a bit melancholy and long for a simpler life and have had your share of marital discord among dysfunctional family units, then this movie may offer more insight and entertainment than you might think. I think it's a classic and it's much more entertaining than mainstream movies, which should contain many of the same elements, such as: For example, Terms of Endearment, which I believe could have some extraordinary performances by Jack Nicholson, then solemnly burned until nothing is left. Talk about boredom.) Best of all, do not take my word or that of others, watch the movie and support our industry.
