If you had a mother who described you that way, you might just want to bounce off your own. It's how Danny DeVito feels about Anne Ramsey, it's just how the plan is put into action. <br /> <br /> And his creative writing lessons, taught by Professor Billy Crystal, give him the idea. That and a look at Alfred Hitchcock's classic Strangers On A Train, which gives DeVito the idea to trade the killers with Crystal, who hates his wife Kate Mulgrew, who does not cheat him out of an idea for a book he wanted to write, but is also going on with Tony Ciccone. <br /> <br /> Throw Momma From The Train into a kind of Strangers On A Train when DeVito ends his murder program. But Crystal has a problem with suppressing Ramsey himself with Danny's help. This woman may have to be killed, but she will take a lot of it. <br /> <br /> The Academy's only recognition, received by Throw Momma From The Train, was an Oscar nomination for Anne Ramsey as Best Supporting Actress. Ramsey lost to Olympia Dukakis for Moonstruck, but the film turned out to be their finest hour. Ramsey already had the cancer of the larynx that would kill her next year, but look at the list of loans she has amassed herself after throwing Momma From The Train. She worked until the end. <br /> <br /> I've seen interviews with the two stars of the turn-out Throw Momma, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, and both have gladly acknowledged that Anne Ramsey's performance as Mother of Hell made the movie a success and stole him from among them. Her recognition of Ramsey's talent and achievement is the best possible tribute. <br /> <br /> If Marion Lorne had been here like Anne Ramsey in "Strangers On A Train," Farley Granger would have liked to partner with Robert Walker. To throw Momma out of a train is one of the best black comedies that should not be missed.
