I went into another gross movie with gross humor. From my first sentence to say, I do not like this humor and this movie had its moments, but I loved it. Justin Long has never really made such a comedy where he's sarcastic and smart and I loved it. Lewis Black ... enough said. The end that I really loved, because it had to take itself seriously. I mean, how else would you stop it? Yes, it's another underdog story, but not in their typical format, and the movie was not their ups and downs, they were people who came together to achieve a common goal: to attend college where they were accepted , The cast was fantastic and yes, I laughed aloud when I did not think it would, and the laugh lasted longer than I thought. The parents and sister played their roles well, but their characters are used when needed. The film did not focus on them, but showed itself when expected and not expected. They played very well in the story, and I loved the familiar faces of Anthony Heald (Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long), Ross Patterson (The New Guy) and Sam Horrigan (Brink). Blake Lively added a certain something to the movie, which made it even more fun, as did the Friends of B. I can recommend this movie to anyone who has hated the rough comedies of the last 4 years and really something with humor and a real plot want! ~!
