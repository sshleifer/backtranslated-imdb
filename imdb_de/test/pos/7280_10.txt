The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up. A quality movie all around. <br /> <br /> I think you could only love this movie because of its action, but I liked it more than that. <br /> <br /> This is a pure thriller / horror movie. It offers a more detailed script than most horror movies. I thought, at least the US version, ended brilliantly and was consistently great. The story felt honest and brutal. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent, tight script that keeps the action moving, with credible characters in largely credible situations.
