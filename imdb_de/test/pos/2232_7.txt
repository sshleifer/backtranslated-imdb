I tested this on Turner Classic just because it was a pre-code and sounded interesting. Looking at it, I noticed that the "critique" was one and a half stars on a four-star scale. I started to look worried - even old movies can be bad movies - but I quickly got into the story and performance of Mary Astor as the business minds are behind the rise of a simple salesman. Not a really great movie - too predictable - but certainly better than announced. And I would have liked to have seen more of Ricardo Cortez than the man who appreciates Mary, but does not give up his wealthy wife. I would recommend taking a look just to appreciate Astor and how far we have come, baby.
