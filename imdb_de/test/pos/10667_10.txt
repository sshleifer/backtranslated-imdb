If you are or have been a film student or intend to become one, the name Battleship Potemkin has or will resonate. Sergei Eistenstein, as well as other silent film pioneers like Griffith (though the innovations of Eisenstein are not as common as Griffiths) and Murnau, have so influenced the history of cinema that it goes without saying. The reason why I look at the film student part is that your film professor will show the sequence "Odessa Stairs" of this film 9 times in 10 times, whether you like it or not. It's hard to say if it's the "best" part of the film's various sequences that deal with the (current) times of the Russian Revolution. But it leaves the most impact, and it can be seen in many films that show tension or just montage (the culmination of the Untouchables). Montage, which is not only Eistenstein's gimmick, but also his lifeblood early in his career, is often abused in current cinema or if not abused, then in an inappropriate context for the story. Sometimes mounting is now used as another device to get from point A to point B. Mounting was something else for Eisenstein; He tried to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency, the passion (s) and the ultimate tragedies that were in the Russian population at the time and place. Even if one does not consider all of Eisenstein's stories or the traditional "storytelling" ideas to be very well founded (Kubrick has said so), one can not deny seeing the ships arriving in the harbor, the people on the stairs. and the soldiers came with weapons on every path toward them. Some find it hard to believe that this was done in the 1920s; It has this power, like the Passion of Jeanne d'Arc, to pass its time and to remain meaningful when it comes only to technique and emotion. Of course, one could write books (they did) hundreds of times, not least by Eisenstein himself). In terms of the movie, Battleship Potemkin is more of a dramatic newsreel than a particular story in a movie. The first segment is also one of the big sequences in the film, as a mutiny is recorded against the captain and other heads-up of a particular ship. This is almost detailed in a manipulative way, but somehow extremely effective; Assembly is also used here, but in energy bursts, which catch the eye. In other cases, Eisenstein is more content to let the pictures speak for themselves, as the soldiers get tired without food and water. He is not one of the directors who will try to win all the pages for the story. He is, of course, Russian very early in the 20th century, but he is nothing but honest in terms of the way he sees his themes and his style, and that is what ultimately convinces. <br /> <br /> Some like it To check it out outside the film school, the sequence "Stairs" is like one of the landmarks of a serious tragedy in the movie that shows the ugly side of the revolution. Although Eisenstein is not one of the more "accessible" silent film directors, if montage, detail in the picture, non-actors, and Bolshevik motives are your thing, then this is truly one of the highlights of your life.
