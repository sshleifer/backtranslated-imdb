Jeff Lieberman's Just Before Dawn not only offers a lot of news on the conspiracy of the hillbilly classics Deliverance and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre - a maniac sets off and kills a group of campers - but he manages to be more effective Thanks to the director's skilful handling of the material, the great use of the stunning scenery, the even greater use of women in hot pants, a brooding synth score by Brad Fiedel, and a subtle turn towards the end (though this may be obvious to them should, who have paid attention). <br /> <br /> Thanks to solid performances of his capable cast - including Oscar winner George Kennedy as Ranger Roy McLean - there is a sense of realism in Just Before Dawn that is all too often lacking in this type of fare. The movie also features a pretty scary madman (who chuckles like Mutant Dickley and uses a nasty jagged machete to kill) and delivers some very ingenious sequences that lift him up over many of his contemporaries: a topless woman (involuntary nudity) box well and really ticked) in a lake discovers that the hand she has sampled underwater does not belong to her friend; and a short-sighted character makes out with his buddy's girlfriend (as a joke), not knowing that the person who is slowly approaching is not his friend but the killer.
