THE DEALER OF THE FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first shot at acceptance in the mainstream. In a turbulent career of only fifteen years, he managed to create an amazing work in film and theater, both as a performer and as a creative producer, actor and director. Although this film can not appeal to many viewers, the film has much to offer. The plot is pretty straightforward. A man is ostracized by emotional and economic problems from his upper middle class family and is unable to control his downward spiral. THE DEALER OF FOUR SEASONS is filmed with a slavish devotion to elegant details, and each set is very carefully designed and constructed. Every object on the set seems to be carefully arranged to provoke layers of emotional texture. Many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak of Hans's desperate search for spiritual meaning or direction in his life. Much thought has been given to how lighting and color are used to contrast and enhance the drama. Several times during the film I have frozen the frame to admire the beauty of the composition. I streamed this movie and the print was almost flawless and unsurpassed. Fassbinder employs his actors in an almost vehement "anti-natural" style. He does everything to prevent the actors from reacting normally or colloquially, resulting in a more gradual effect "hyperreality" to the narrative. Rather than presenting a secular melodrama, the actors almost militant lack of affectation compel the viewer to confront the film in other ways. Trials and Tribulation: You are constantly on the outside looking in. This will be a disturbing experience for many, but I found it a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.
