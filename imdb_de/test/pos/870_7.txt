He is a single man looking for a woman, then he promotes a bride and gets a beautiful woman named Julia (Catherine Deneuve). If she appears spontaneous, she is much more attractive than expected. He marries Julia, but she disappears suddenly. A French eye specialist (Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister and soon he is on the trail of his former spouse. Later, Louis meets her in a dance hall under a different name. Despite the romantic delusion and everything, Louis continues to fall in love with his enigmatic wife. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great drama full of betrayal, deception, killing, theft and hitchcock tension. Good achievements of Jean Paul Belmondo as a young owner of a cigarette company determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful Catherine Deneuve as a suspected heroine. The film receives several references to American cinema, but Truffaut (400 hits) was a passionate moviegoer, such as: Johnny Guitar, Colorado Jim, Bogart and Hitchcock. Locker is based on the novel "Waltz in the Darkness" by Cornell Woolrich (rear window and scriptwriter of Alfred Hitchcock Hour), which was also shot in "Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black" by Antoine Duhamel, the usual musician of Truffaut. This is one of the best of his exciting movies along with "Farenheit 451 and Shoot the piano player". Repetition of an inferior version by Michael Christofer (2001) with Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie and Jack Thompson, full of erotic and pleasure scenes.
