In the history of cinema, every great filmmaker had to make a first film. Often when they are looked at for their success, a light bulb goes on in our heads. The connection is made and we see the solid foundation from where it started. This is also the case with PFERDE AUF MARS. It's the subtle humor that's woven around a seemingly straightforward narrative that tells a great story while giving you the opportunity to enjoy the visuals. In the imagery I found a lot of attention to detail and a production polish, which is rare in every student film. <br /> <br /> A young filmmaker always has to make improvements. But if Mr. Anderson continues on this path, we will probably look back on this film as a great career. <br /> <br /> You should definitely watch this movie. Nothing is bigger than the size of the big screen.
