I only get the chance to dig into former Austen movies and I picked it up because Persuasion is my favorite work by Jane Austen and Anne Elliot my favorite Austen heroine. With great anticipation I put the CD in my player. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed either. I knew there would be some downsides, so I'll explain it and try not to be fat. Anne Elliot is the most introverted of Austen's characters; She is the least talkative and the least funny. There are passages in the book in which Anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. This works well for printing, but how do you successfully transfer that to the big screen? Without thoughtful voice-overs (which would get bored for over four hours), you have a long series of shots where the heroine says little or nothing, and has to communicate everything through her expression. This can leave the feeling that the movie is slow and futile. If you need a more open style of Austen, this movie is certainly not for you; But if your style is more subdued and you tend to pick up unspoken "vibes", that will live up to your expectations. Anne Firbank (as Anne Elliot) is, fortunately, an actress whose face can convey much. She looked the way I had always imagined Anne Elliot: no knockout - Anne should not be the elegant family - even in her first youth - which is occasionally highlighted by lighting and make-up. What you see is someone who is very similar to Austen's character: someone whose looks you might pass over; but hear them speak and look more closely, and they will become more attractive the better you know them. This is Anne Elliot, as brought to life by Anne Firbank. <br/> <br /> Captain Wentworth is skilfully portrayed by Bryan Marshall. The bitterness is obviously never obvious (except in the concert scene); and yes, I found it hard to believe he was injured, Louisa Musgrove found interesting when she was shown. But that's another point in Austen's book: he did not find it interesting, he tried to find it interesting, and ultimately failed (sigh of relief). So that fits in with Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the portrayal of Lady Russell, which I thought was not portrayed as really bad in the book. This is also apparent in this processing. <br /> <br /> So this is a movie that followed the book closely; I could write much more about how faithfully everything was reproduced, but I would run out of space here. Charles Musgrove was still one of the liveliest characters (a lot of fun), Mary the most annoying (I just wanted her to shut up - but I had the feeling when I read the book), captains and the admiral I did charming. <br /> <br /> I considered the cinematography to be a bit stiff. There was little or virtually no crossfading from one screen to the other - maybe that's because it's a TV movie. A scene - CHOP! - the next scene, the actors enter from the right, go left and - CHOP! - another scene in which the same thing happens. This was the only part of the film that made me feel a bit cheated. A low budget has to show up somewhere, I suppose. <br /> <br /> If you want to have some speed for Jane Austen, you should not, as I said, deal with this step too slowly. I enjoyed it immensely because it brought a wealth of details (the sets were very elegant!) To a great adaptation of my favorite Austen novel. I highly recommend it!
