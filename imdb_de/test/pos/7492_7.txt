When I saw this movie, I had no idea what it was about, and I had never heard of it. But I have to say, I was positively surprised. The first few minutes are almost the funniest of the whole movie. The seller from India is just too funny! Anyway, the story is not really much to discuss, but I think it's okay. The acting is pretty good and the only actor I recognized was Mickey Rourke, who was not really in the movie until the end. I think the end is the point where I can switch off, it's not bad, but I do not feel it really ends. I feel like there should have been something more. In a way, a final battle. I dont know. All in all, this was a good movie and I recommend it to anyone, the Tarantino-like movies with a lot of violence and dark, sinister humor! I rate it at 7/10.
