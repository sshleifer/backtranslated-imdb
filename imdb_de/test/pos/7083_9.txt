I loved One True Thing since I saw it in the theater for the first time and my eyes were screaming. I bought it as soon as it was available and lost track of how many times I saw it. <br /> <br /> For me, One True Thing is the ultimate family relationship film. I love watching family relationships and developing what they are at the end. I can relate to many details in the film. My mother died of bone cancer, so it really hits me. Maybe that's why I love it so much. <br /> <br /> I like the relationship between the children and their parents and the relationship between brother and sister, but especially the relationship between husband and wife. It's really nice for me. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this move to anyone who likes this kind of movie.
