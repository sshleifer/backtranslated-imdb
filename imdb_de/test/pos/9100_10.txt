This movie is everything a Tenacious D fan can expect. Director Liam Lynch is a partnership with The "D" and is a mix of epic proportions. Of course, you need to understand the humor and format of Tenacious D. When I saw it, there were not too many audience laughter, but the reason is no humor or smart jokes. This film seems to have been passed on to an unsuspecting audience that has not familiarized itself with the musical duo. This film remains true to its roots. For the few of you who have watched the HBO TV series and heard the album, they have not forgotten what their audience loves. Like the TV show, the trailer people have noticed the JB and KG apartment scenes and of course the open mic evenings that start and end every Tenacious D episode. The soundtrack is phenomenal and every song will blow you away. <br /> <br /> ... And Dave Grohl plays a fantastic devil. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie for anyone looking for a hard time and a rock musical.
