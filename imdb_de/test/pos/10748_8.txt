I honestly do not know why so many people hate this movie, I've always thought it's one of my absolute favorites. the fight with tiger and his men rocked, the fight with the pirates with the axles swung, the whole sketch with everyone who tried to avoid each other in the house is just awesome ... ok, so he did not have the necessary kickarsche conclusion confrontation The Manchus were pretty good. I give an 8/10.
