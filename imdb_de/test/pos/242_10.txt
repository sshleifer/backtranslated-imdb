I really like this movie because of all the stars and the dancing and the related story. Rita Hayworth was the most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were beautiful. Although I'm a musical, I thought that Rita Hayworth also did a great job in this film. As for dancing, I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable was quite supportive of Rita's dance in this film when she noticed that Rita was dancing rings around her own dance and let's face it, Betty Grable was a great dancer. The cinematography and the lively colors are also mentioned. Rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine, but she also loves her mentor, played by Gene Kelly. Will she leave Kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass the love and the Broadway star, or will she stay there to find this unique pearl that will change her life forever? You have to see the movie to find out!
