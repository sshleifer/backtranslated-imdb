Anthony Minghela (writer / director) Cold Mountain is a carefully engineered, sensitive and intelligent drama that plays in the social context of the Confederacy during the Civil War, addressing the politics of war in a very subtle and realistic way. While it accurately portrays the brutality and inhumanity of this war, it also does something that many movies have to do with this period in order not to act so effectively - Cold Mountain explores the southern context from the inside out, portraying changes among the non-members. Slave Owners People who were affected by the war. And almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not generalize the Southerners, Northerners or others. <br /> <br /> The film surfs through the genres on demand - without causing a boring moment. It's a romance, a war story, an action adventure and a historical fiction, all woven together in one. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) in love for very simple reasons. As this young romance begins to bud, Inman joins the Confederation force and takes a book that Ada gave him and a photo of her. Ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from the perspective of a third person, but the story is clearly theirs from beginning to end. Ada is a smart southern beauty and daughter of a liberal minister. She begins the film as the girl of a father who is familiar with many of the arts that were expected to teach southern women who were surrounded by servants most of their lives. In other words, as she admits Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a master of all useless. Ada's father goes on, and she has to manage his modest estate by himself. Without experience of this kind she fights and survives by holding the memory of Inman to her heart. Ruby appears as a tough young woman brought up by a drunken and careless father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities that Ada lacks, and when they become inseparable business partners, they love each other as best friends. Inmans experience is radically different, but a reflection. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for reasons they do not really believe in, and decides to leave. No one he encounters comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand-mile journey back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie takes place during the long walk of Inman Both protagonists live, learn, grow and change. A perpetual, desperate act of will preserves her intense passionate love. For Inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure despair. For Ada it is almost the same, but also a symbol and a remnant of the old South - a world that passes quickly. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful pictures of Appalachians that give the film a strong sense of history. The script and editing are also extremely strong - highlighting the large class and educational differences that are reflected in the southern ante bellum dialects of the middle and lower classes. With the occupation of this film nothing less than perfection is to be expected. And the cast usually rises for the occasion. My only criticism, however, refers to the accents that the characters of Kidman and Law have adopted. An Australian and a Briton should probably not be expected to accurately reproduce the South American language, but there are some occasions when these two exceptionally talented actors produce distracting ballot papers. I admit my hypersensitivity to it and can say with some confidence that it does not bother most people. Zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character that I will remember in my senescence. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
