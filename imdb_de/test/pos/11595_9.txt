Greetings from the darkness. Director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all contradictions, based on a true plot version of a man's struggle for his fate. The great Javier Bardem is fascinating to see in his role as Ramon. His eyes and head movements leave no doubt as to what's going on in his head. The dream and fantasy sequences are not overused, so it's very effective to explain why he wants what he wants. Instead of forcing us to answer the euthanasia question, the real question is: What is love? At every turn we see people in love looking for love or dying to be loved. The script is tight and keeps the movie moving, though it's mostly shot in a room. The side cast is wonderful and we really feel their pain and how each family member deals with Ramon's decision. This is a gem and deserves to be seen.
