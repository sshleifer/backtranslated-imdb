A study of one of these well-known, physical and / or emotional states: Isolation. I think the film also comments on cultural repression. <br /> <br /> The film introduces the experiences of two Turkish men (cousins). One has money (and the comfort it has "made" with a fixed income); the other one does not have a job search. Both are not happy. Do not expect a feast of life here - this is loneliness, warts and all. <br /> <br /> The film manages to offer a powerful, bleak journey through the "low lands" of human condition. Brave filmmaking. Good and good shot in my opinion (outdoor shots at the harbor are my own favorites). A film that should be grateful for those who are not unfamiliar with life's happiness and fulfillment (not to mention employment); Everyone else will find a companion in this movie. A film with all the warmth and speed of an ice floe. Expect a bitter pill, not a "happy pill".
