Today I had the honor to see the movie "These Girls" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. When I went into the movie, I knew very little about it and only took a chance, as the plot of the movie sounded interesting. When I entered the theater only a few hours ago, I wondered what the final result would be: thumbs up or thumbs down. <br /> <br /> "These Girls" is the story of three best friends from a small town. Keira (Caroline Dhavernas) is the ringleader and basically does not know what to do with her life after high school, but her dad keeps pushing her to college, which she does not want. Lisa (Holly Lewis) will go to a Christian school after the summer. And finally Glory (Amanda Walsh) who wants to spend her summer babysitting. But this summer will be a special summer as they blackmail Keith Clark (David Boreanaz), the sexy older guy they care about. Funny times and many laughs follow ?? <br /> <br /> I do not usually like movies like "These Girls", but I like that movie a lot. I think the quality I liked the most was that it seemed pretty realistic. Three girls who want to explore their sexuality choose a hunky who lets them all have sex with him for later extortion. It's a pretty funny story about growing up, friendship and sex, but although it sounds rather cheesy, I see that the majority of this movie happens in real life. The movie was not released in the US. It is assumed that all the girls in this film are under 18. If I remember correctly, two of them are 17 and one 16 years old. In the US, minor sex is done on a daily basis, but many production or finance companies do not fund a film like this because of sexual content. This information was actually confirmed by director John Hazlett following the film. The thing that gets me is that the sex scenes in this movie are not graphic and the nudity is low. Not to mention that all actresses in this film are well over 18 in real life. Go figure. <br /> <br /> What the movie does best is that it has a lot of laughs and very strong characters. I liked all the characters in this movie and every character seemed to have a "now & then". The jokes were funny because they were cleverly written, not because they were dirty or exaggerated. Everything seemed to flow well, both the comedy and the drama. The script was very strong. <br /> <br /> The show was very good for the most part. I found all three girls great. Caroline Dhavernas, who also played "Wonderfalls" in one of the most underrated television series of all time, was just great. as well as Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh, both of whom have also done a good job. David Boreanaz did a good job and he looked like he enjoyed shooting most of the scenes. The guy was playing a pot-head, so it was funny to see him playing that role. <br /> <br /> Today I had the pleasure to meet John Hazlett, who acted like a very nice guy and appreciated the comments about the movie movie. I'm shocked that this movie has gone nowhere. I think with a little marketing behind it, it could have gone down. Unfortunately, it will be one of those direct DVD movies that so few will ever see. I think with the small budget that Mr. Hazlett had to work with, the movie went well and I think he did a good job managing this little gem. Honestly, I really enjoyed this movie. The character development and the witty script allowed me to sit and be amused for an hour and a half. This is a fine comedy because she has heart and sperm. I know that if he appears on DVD on May 16, 2006, I'm sure I'll buy this movie. If you're a fan of old age stories, teen comedies, or romantic comedies, you should definitely watch this movie because it's one of the funniest films of its kind to be released in years. <br /> <br /> MovieManMenzel's final rating for "These Girls" is 8/10.
