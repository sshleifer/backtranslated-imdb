Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea, and despite the mostly negative reactions I've heard about and the suspiciously late DVD release, I could not help but dare - every Wu Xia movie is better than most non-wu xia movies in my eyes: D Maybe low expectations were beneficial because I was quite pleasantly surprised by the movie. <br /> <br /> An assassin kills a number of ministers involved in a revolution that seizes the throne, and the supreme swordsman of the government has the job of identifying the culprit. It does not take long, but he did not want to hear the answer. Prolonged flashbacks tell us why and the story of the swordsman and the assassin as well as the revolution. The film is typically melodramatic for a Korean movie and resolute in tone - no HK-style comedy moments to find here. The story may be a bit difficult at first, but ultimately it all makes sense. The movie is a bit shaky in the end, but no worse than a Chang Cheh movie, and for the most part, I found it pleasing. The production values ​​are high, with some good films to capture it. The fighting scenes are not the caliber of HK wu xia's better films, but they may not be intended - the fights are "more realistic" as they are less like choreographed dance routines, but there are some wirework and occasional CGI that make the movie in put the "Wu Xia" mode. Unfortunately, the film does not have the best cast because the leads lack a bit of charm and are sometimes difficult to distinguish. There's a young woman in the movie that I think I have not seen before, but she makes the best impression of one of the main characters - not just because you see her nekkid ... or maybe it's like this: p The movie lacks the charm and grace of HK wu xia's better movies, and maybe the beauty, but I just wish HK would do them half more well - TWINS EFFECT 2 gives me no hope that * that * soon will happen. although Tsui Hark is sure to have it in him, if he can get the funding and the cast. SWORD IN THE MOON will definitely not be on my list of favorite Wu xia, but it's a whole bunch better than ROMANTIC WARRIORS or LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE - maybe better than BICHUNMOO, even though I liked the movie a bit more second visit. It's obviously not far from the wonderful MUSA, but it's really a different story. SITM will probably receive a second visit within three years, which is perhaps the best indicator of how much I liked it. 10.7
