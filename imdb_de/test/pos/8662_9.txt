The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. All technical aspects are in my opinion perfect (lighting, acting, directing, tempo, etc.). The HISTORY is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Our main character seems to live beyond death in a world without beauty, passion or something that pleases the human senses. His work is cold and uninteresting. his relationships are numb and boring, and when everything gets too much, he tries to finish it before a move. But it does not stop - it can not leave this strange world by suicide! When he returned to a man who seemed to feel the same solitude and loneliness, our main character joins to raise a stone wall, hoping to reveal the source of a strange and wonderful smell and music. Just as they break through - and I will NOT reveal that, everything ends and the movie ends as strangely as it started. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that you will either love or hate this movie. I feel it's like a magical poem - open to many different interpretations and all of them as valid as the next one. If you enjoy new cinematic experiences and want to be pampered by Hollywood's crap, try this movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10 (and I can not rate that easily!), Even though it is so despite its darkness, this movie made me feel like something bigger ... something mysterious and beyond from us. Well done!
