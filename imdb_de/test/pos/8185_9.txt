Chen Kaige gives us a wonderful depth of atmosphere. Yes, it's a "period piece," but Chen's artistic use of images makes it a little more. The actors often behave like gamblers using the stylized diction, posture, and facial expressions of Peking Opera. All the actors in a scene play on the "back wall", even if they talk to each other. They are like ghosts of the past that, with powerful clarity, represent a story of great importance to those in the present. "Jing ke ci qin wang" is an impressive story combined with great attention for scaling and masterful indoor and outdoor cinematography.
