A genius. My genius I still remember the second in 1994. I was sitting in a pub in Shropshire, England. I remember the exact seat. "Bill Hicks dies of cancer," said the headline in the NME. I felt like someone had hit me in the stomach. Buy this DVD. If you can not find anything in one way or another, I'm surprised. <br /> <br /> RIP Bill, I wish you were still here.
