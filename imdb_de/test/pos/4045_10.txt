Who compares this movie with big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix, will inevitably be disappointed, how this film has developed. Although there is no such thing as a big special effects division, and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterly fusion of two ancient folk tales. The acting talent is not an A-list, but still great, and the interaction between the characters may be more honest than in a larger movie with an A-List cast. My special favorite from this film is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as a Snow Queen herself was very moving, supported by an amazing wardrobe and make-up. She inserted humanity and a feeling of pathos in the fallen season's character, corrupted by the evil magic of the devil. Apart from acting, Fonda was not what we would expect from Hollywood, which I think is a good thing, since Hollywood seems to run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to portray roles, and so they are stale and rely on them CGI and other special effects to remove us from the actors who all use the same tricks. Instead, new ideas are shown how the actors can really think about how to change the old themes of love and danger.
