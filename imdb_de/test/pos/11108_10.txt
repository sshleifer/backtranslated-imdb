I really fell in love with the characters. They were very down to earth, but each of them had a dark hidden side. Somehow a mystery. David Graysmark himself was a mystery. The secret fears and just secrets he had. There was a whole page of him that the other characters knew nothing about and that either left the audience asking or suspecting. There was always a part of this man he kept hidden, but he also shared a little of himself. He was the strong male main character, and I admire that kind of character. Billy Moses himself is an incredible actor who can do almost any kind of part! He is an amazing talent and a good man. His fans love, respect and support him endlessly. <br /> <br /> Since this show he has been involved in many other projects and has expanded his acting skills a lot more and more. Kudos to him and all other actors on this show who have done such a great job! I wish you all the best. I wish the series would continue! It's a shame it was not like that!
