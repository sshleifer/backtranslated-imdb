The feeling that someone has to play the role of the arbiter of public taste and political correctness always manages to get under our skin. It seems that these self-proclaimed, even superior, pseudo-intellectual types are everywhere; Be it in the family, in the church or in the bowling league. <br /> <br /> These are the guys who would totally ignore society and ignore what was going on. unless it is, it does not stand in the way of today's "acceptable" language, customs and general "standards" of "right" behavior. So it's like these are the last days High-tech bookbinders have instigated much of what Hollywood's biggest accomplishment was; Your participation in our own Allied propaganda through their selfless messages and theme films. <br /> <br /> Cold brutal in their generation, the Prohibited Code and list of now unacceptable lists extend to the Wartime cartoons, which do not meet the new, sensitive, socially oriented "official" attitudes; which this "thought police" has imposed on us. <br /> <br /> We were really surprised that there are so many animated short topics. The majority we know comes from Warner Brothers' LOONEY TUNES and MERRIE MELODIES; with bugs, Daffy, Elmer & Porky, all in conflict with Hitler, Goerring, "Il Duce", Tojo and the like. Surprisingly, however, we found a large selection of cartoons from MGM, Walt Disney, Lantz, Paramount-Famous Studios and the Brothers Butcher. <br /> <br /> YOU ARE AN SAP MR. JAP (Famous Studios / Paramount Pictures, 1942) is a prime example of what we are talking about. <br /> <br /> Virtually unrecognizable from the cartoons previously produced by the studios of Max and Dave Fleischer the 1941 business deal that broke them out brought the new name "Famous" Studios, YOU'RE A SAP MR. JAP wore none of the sober plot elements that would reduce the Popeye cartoons of the last day to the level of the ultimate short film. <br /> <br /> We all remember how we would have Popeye and Olive Oyl together. Enter Bluto, usually the exponent of Wolf Whistle, and an acceptable on-screen version of a male reaction to female Pulchritude. Olive is less honorable than Bluto; until he gets a bit too physical and always gets out of hand: "Hey babe, how about a kiss?" At this point we hear "Help! Help, Popeye and the little sailor" to save the day; full of the obligatory can of spinach! Are we exaggerating, Schultz? Once again, this JAP-SAP cartoon is nothing like that, it follows the plot to have Popeye now in the US Navy: The brothers Fleischer put the little man in the service in 1941 to adapt to the mood in the country and as open Gesture of support for the men now being drafted into the United States First Peace Draft in United States History Max and Dave have even commissioned Popeye aboard the mythical battleship USS Pensyltucky. <br /> <br /> OUR point is that. You are an SAP MR. JAP and other SPINACH FER Britain are not comic book comics in the Theater program, literally, but rather a compilation of editorial cartoons similar to those of any "Great Metropolitan Newspaper." These animated shorts are similar to those still panel illustrations, have charac characters that are highly symbolic and representative of nations, ideas and ideals, such as a just and lasting peace. In most cases, the hero (Popeye, Bugs Bunny or whoever) is alone with the enemy's symbol. Both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concept and thinking; Even if they are cloaked in humorous costumes for a wider palatability. <br /> <br /> Our liberal Stupidgencia (the antithesis of the intelligentsia) may not see it that way; But for this kind of behavior, they are nothing more than neo-Nazi book writers. <br /> <br /> Please ask future generations to see and appreciate a glimpse of past events that are both historical and humorous. <br /> <br /> POODLE CARVING !!
