"Toy Soldiers" is the story of five outsider boys (notably Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton, and Kieth Coogan) trying to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the American government arrested the leader's father. Lou Gosset Jr. plays the headmaster of the school, an idiosyncratic type who teaches disciples to his students. <br /> <br /> 'Toy Soldiers' is a fun and pretty cool action and certainly the better of crime hostage films. I think most of the attraction comes from the teen actors, but the terrorists are not completely useless, even though in some movies they never seem to be the intimidating group they should intimidate. Locked up in the boarding school and threatened to be killed in military or police interventions, this is a huge challenge for this group of boys who want to save the school. They are also pretty wise about it. <br /> <br /> I was surprised it was a pretty good movie. It keeps a constant pace and does not become ridiculously sentimental or something like that. Astin and Gosset Jr. perform well. <br /> <br /> I also agree that this is an underrated action movie.
