Tell yourself what that was. Dylan Moran is just the funniest actor on the screen (and on stage) and with Michael Caine as your partner, it's not bad either, both are great to see in a really funny movie. It's true that not all the jokes come away, but it's worth it for those who do, but have Micheal Caine in a dress (all the entry fees are worth it), and every time Dylan Moran appears on the screen, it resembles Bernard Schwarzer film. The story is about two actors (Moran and Caine) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by playing different people to deceive them all, but it's a different matter. Basically "The Actors" is a great British comedy that was somehow missed by many if you see Moran fan (or Micheal Caine in a dress) definitely see it
