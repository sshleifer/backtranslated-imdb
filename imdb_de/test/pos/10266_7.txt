I had a great time watching Femina Ridens a couple of mornings, a bit drowsing. For most of the movie, it's almost a two-hander, showing the games and the crazy relationship of crazy doctor Philipe Leroy and the stunning Dagmar Lassander. I've seen her in some Fulci movies when she died a horrible death, but here she is young and pretty. The film is quite predictable and certainly mild in terms of exploitation, but thoroughly entertaining, also because of its wonderful colorful kitsch feeling. The stage design, music, lighting and cinematography are all in the classic Italian style of the late sixties, a surreal feast for the eyes and ears, and although the general thread of action is not too hard to predict, there are more than enough unusual events and remarkably bizarre sights and sounds to keep things interesting throughout. Both leads are pretty good and it's worth repeating that Dagmar Lassander is really good. The music of Stelvo Cipriani is also crisp and fits perfectly with the pictures. Director Pierro Schivazappa has come up with a cracker that is not perfect. Although very tempting, there is little substance here and the exploitation elements are as mild as possible. I think that gives him a kind of charm and innocence, but I can not help thinking that the subject could have been more soggy, more threatening, that kind of thing, especially since it's pretty easy to figure out what's going to happen. I suspect that this is a little pointless for strong exploitation fans and certainly not for people who want sex or a lot of nudity. It is more of a light, fun pop art, lovable but unimportant, like bubble bath. Recommended especially for lovers of the 60s, Dagmar Lassander or for sweet set designs.
