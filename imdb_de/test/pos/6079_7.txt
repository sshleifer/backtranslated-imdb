The book is better than the film, mainly because of the prose writer Ondatje. Before I saw this movie, someone who had seen him said that the love portrayed in this movie is not real. After seeing this movie, I can see that their suspension of disbelief in this regard has distracted other moviegoers as well. Honestly, some of the intense love portrayals were ridiculous and seemed to be on the verge of parody. But in the end, everyone should realize that this is a great message art piece. It is not specifically about love, it uses "love" to expose dialectically the human division or the arbitrary borders of countries that help justify wars and hatred. It's about misunderstandings and the blind following of the things that supposedly separate us. The critical scene for the actual theme of this film is when the helper of the hero or the antihero is ignored and ignored for help to his stranded lover in the desert for the reasons shown in this scene. This film is also about hope and forgiveness, the hope that echoes in the interracial relationship between Binoches recovering character and the Indian minesweeper (in the Sikhs mate relationship with his white colleague, who ends up nonsensically dying), and the Forgiveness in Caravaggio The character's first hunt and then giving up on what he believes will be the hero's confessions for his war crimes (betrayal of land). I think the movie could have been done better than it is. I do not know if a more realistic account of the circumstances of love would have made the real issues and points of this film even more obvious or not, but I agree that this film is not about realistic romantic love, as people are behind it. A work of art or a movie point to an early scene when the potential lovers meet. The hero talks about the fact that a new car, a broken car, a fast car, etc. (I paraphrase) is still a car, no matter which adjective you preface. She answers, but parental love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. are very different kinds of love. This is ironic because this film is really about the love that all human beings should desire, namely the love of (or for) peace (not materialistic things, which are usually the real reasons for wars that are in something, that Otherwise, we could stay stranded to die in a cave in a huge desert with old wall art / drawings of floats, suggesting that the seas and the The English Patient won the Oscar because of these great messages, which were not specifically meant to portray romantic love, and awards tend to go that way. The relationship of the hero and the heroine was necessary to attract the audience, but unfortunately this view of love in the age of divorce is outdated and so many singles appearing on so many Eb Such ridiculous versions of the myth love is hard to achieve, even in daydreams, which film love has always been, especially in good old Hollywood. The film misses what people expect but one of 7 out of 10 worth watching.
