This is one of my favorite movies. The performances of Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal are excellent and their performances in conjunction with the music, scenery and reality of the film are very compelling. A look at a true one, tell it like it is, lumberjack, miner who refuses to give up his lifestyle in the name of progress and development. The music of the Horseflies is unique and adds an uncanny quality to some scenes. After seeing this movie for the first time, I had to buy the video and soundtrack. Overall a quiet kind of movie with panic outbursts. Both Torn and Cardinal are very credible in their roles. I put this movie in the same category as Winter People, with Kurt Russell and Kelly McGillis, another favorite.
