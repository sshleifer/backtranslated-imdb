I wonder why I have never heard of this movie. It's really a great comedy (I'd say farce, but it's played too well and I'd hate to compromise its quality). A comedic character study of the hardships of the mid-life crisis, the unfairness of gays who can not have their long-standing unions recognized, and the general differences between people who can not fit in well with society, namely, Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett with a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together. The timid, terrible and outrageous daughter-in-law Maudie (Meredith Eaton) is a really wonderful character. If you liked the Tales of the City movies, you want this quirky charmer.
