On one level, Hari Om is a movie that uses a familiar genre - the road movie - to tell a familiar story: Curious Westerners explore the mysterious East. But in essence, the film is about two people, a young French beauty (Isa) who wants to experience life to the fullest, and a motorized rickshaw driver (Hari Om) with Bollywood aspirations, from very different cultures, their slowly growing appeal to each of them and the beautiful crazy chaos India is today. The gap between them can never be bridged, but the director manages to bring them as close as possible to the brink of an affair without compromising the plausibility of the story. India and its people are integral parts of the narrative, and apart from the main characters, the roles of locals recruited during film production are beautifully and convincingly played on the road between the Indian cities and villages that make up the film's location. A major drawback to this viewer: a Keystone Kops hunts near the movie as Hari flees from mobsters focused on collecting gambling debts. But the final scenes in which Isa and Hari say goodbye are poignant and unforgettable.
