It helps that the characters on which this show is based are among the best Disney has ever had. Writing is what makes this show really. It is a total classic. To do this, you need to appreciate the nature of humor in order to enjoy it, and that's hard to explain. The humor is similar to the old school scenarios of Disney of the 40s and 50s with modern turns. It's never demoted to fart joke or anything like that. It's also no Adam Sandler humor, though I enjoyed that. It's exactly the same humor of the movie, which is only extended as long as a TV program allows. If you do not like it in the movie, you will not like it here, but IMO The Emperor's new groove was the best Disney has had since Gargoyles
