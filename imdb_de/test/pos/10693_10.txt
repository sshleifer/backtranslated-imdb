There are few films that have the uninterrupted ninja action as Ninja III: dominance. This is a story about love, salvation, and revenge, but mainly about turning off and killing people for no reason. If you've been looking for a movie in which a ninja is absolutely crazy and brings all sorts of people to graves just because he's a ninja and he can do it, this is the movie for you. I can not imagine movies that I can compare to, because no movie is so great. Wait, oh, have you ever seen the thing with two heads? There's a part in the titular thing driving around on a motorbike and chasing about a million police hunts around it, but they are constantly crashing and not falling because you can not catch the thing with two heads !!! Well, that's Ninja III. I especially recommend this movie if you like the following things: Ninjas, swords, Lucinda Dickie from Breakin 'and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, videogames about a bouncer in a bar, ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or "good" ninjas.
