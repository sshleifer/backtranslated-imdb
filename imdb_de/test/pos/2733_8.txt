I watched this movie with my family, a neat story like '' mr. & mrs.iyer '' and they returned home completely disappointed. Therefore, this is a warning to all 'final story-lovers'. stay away.15 Park Avenue does not try to answer questions or find moral solutions for dealing with the mentally handicapped. Rather, his intention is loud and clear. He asks every person, whether he is reasonable or not, the sense of reality. I even arouse doubts about my self-evident sense of mental health. The security, bondage and contentment that I find in my presence, is it really what I am, or does it really create an illusion that we are all desperate and sometimes ignorant of the neglected 'meethi' that is in us all of us in one way or another exists to comfort us wrongly? Why does Anjali go insane enough to show her spiritual strength when she is really tormented by the realization that she is becoming a monster? Are not we all who we consider "normal", really monstrous and helplessly vulnerable deep inside? Is not it better to be incredibly happy than to give the impression of 'normalcy' while suppressing its fragility? meethi brave, crazy, sincerely doing that. and society calls her "schizophrenic." The end first puzzled me, but then you realize that the courage and sincere beliefs have made her where she wanted to go. She found what she wanted and did not care what the company had to say about her search. and it's the seemingly "right" people - Anjali, the psychiatrist, and Jojo - who never get anywhere. My family thinks I am also schizophrenic when I try to understand a movie that is "crazy" for the rest of the movie world.someone else is ready to believe in my sense of reality ......... ..?
