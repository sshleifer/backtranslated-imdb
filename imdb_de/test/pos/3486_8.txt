The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ("The Antichrist", "The Killer Is On The Phone") is a really exciting, but incomprehensibly neglected Giallo that contains just about every trademark that makes this Italian horror sub-genre so awesome and Addictive to the Fans There are some very disturbing topics (child abuse, false priests?), lots of scary moments, left and right plots, great music and? last but not least ?? a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, a kind of prologue, is a powerful horror! What makes ordinary children's dolls so scary? When the anonymous man, dressed like a priest, attacked a little girl and the broken head of the doll hopped down a staircase, he really threw cold shivers through my back! Years later, the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman, tied to a wheelchair. She has inherited a lot of money, but she uses her fortune to encourage people with disabilities to do sports and stay positive. You ?? Joanna ?? falls in love with her personal trainer and she marries immediately. Of course, he's only concerned about their money and begins to terrorize Joanna by making her experience the childhood trauma that crippled her. Repeated images of a sinister-looking priest led by eerie sounds and a nursery rhyme give "Formula for Murder" a lot of real fear and Alberto De Martino's direction is very determined. The acting is quite competent, with David Warbeck ("The Beyond", "The Black Cat") in a glorious greedy villain role. With some holes in it and a lack of originality, this film may not be able to compete with Italy's best horror efforts, but it definitely deserves more attention. Many formerly obscure and unknown Italian Gialli received wonderful DVD releases, and hopefully "Formula for a Murder" will receive the same treatment shortly. In the meantime good luck to find this baby!
