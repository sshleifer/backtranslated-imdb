Well, I saw it yesterday and it was a lot better than the other make-off of VH1, too bad than this, it's pretty outdated, but you can see all employees doing South Park very interesting stuff. <br /> <It's also funny that this documentary features Trey and Matt as selfish, greedy snobs creators who do not work and spend all their time having fun or relaxing (which is kind of ironic because they are work pretty hard on the show). <br /> <br /> It also shows the entire animation process to create a South Park episode, an interview with the actors who bring the voices of the characters, and much more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of South Park, I am very excited to recommend it to you
