The Stepford Children is the second best Stepford movie in the Stepford series. I saw the original The Stepford Wives in the theater when it came out in 1975. I was totally excited, it was great. I saw all the Stepford movies. and I like them all. I think The Stepford Children is such a vicious and entertaining movie. I saw him on tape recently and enjoyed it very much. The cast in this movie was really good to look at. Barbara Eden did a good job as usual. Every role she has ever played was very good. Barbara Eden is very good at playing roles in which she is a friendly and aspiring person. Don Murray as husband and dad was just fine in this movie. He was particularly effective to be the irritated father of his two teenage children. I made sure to enjoy the whole Stepford movie on tape. If you have a chance to see this movie, you should do so.
