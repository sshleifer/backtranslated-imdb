After George George & Mildred built five seasons on the small screen in 1976/79, she switched to the big screen in mid-1980. Instead of keeping Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke as writers, Dick Sharples was brought aboard a writer. Unfortunately, this movie adaptation just did not seem to be public. Shame. I liked it, better than the series itself. It was a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> 'Mildred Roper' (Yootha Joyce) wants to know if her sloppy husband 'George' (Brian Murphy) remembers her wedding day. Obviously not, but to convince his wife otherwise he'll book a table at the restaurant where he married Mildred some years ago. <br /> <br /> When they arrive at the restaurant they will find out the place has changed hands. When Mildred finally sees through George's lies, he insists that they celebrate their anniversary in a chic hotel. Upon his arrival at the hotel, George is considered by Harry Pinto (Stratford Johns) to be a ruthless killer who wants a rival to be exterminated! <br /> <br /> No outstanding comedy as such, but a good-natured piece of fun anyway. Unfortunately, plans to revive the series after the screening of the film ended when Yootha Joyce died of alcohol poisoning on August 24, 1980. The funniest moment - George talking to his favorite garden gnome. His neighbor, Tristram, sneaks behind him and says, "I think it was time we talked." George believes that he has developed the power of language and lets the gnome fall in shock! <br /> <br /> Merry Christmas to other IMDb users, especially "AdamFontaine", "Cyril Blake" and "TheLittleSongBird". Have a good one
