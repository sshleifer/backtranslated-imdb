This is a good movie that is flawed at low production in many ways. Martha Coolidge herself said she only has $ 350,000 to work. This is a movie I grew up in the Midwest. I remember friends and myself when I had the nostalgic journey in this movie 10 years ago. Great thing about this movie ... Great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. Bad points in this movie ... too small for a budget that requires far too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge got more money and time in this film, the results would have been even better. They should have taken the story from a perspective in their early 20s and not from a 15-17 year old high school point of view. Most of the actors were in their early twenties and tried to play 15-17 year-olds. The best scenes in this film play in dodgy Hollywood clubs after the figure of Nicolas Cage. I gave this movie a high rating of 9/10 for five reasons. Nicholas Cage's improvisation on location; The camera work and camera angles are excellent given the budget available and only one shot of each scene is possible; The sytles, music and language are captured perfectly and forever. Again the music is incredible and carries the story from scene to scene; And finally ... Martha Coolidge could turn a weak script, unknown actors and a very low budget, and shooting the entire movie in 20 days is an amazing movie!
