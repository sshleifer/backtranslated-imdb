A teenage film about fear, friendship, loyalty and growing up? However, this is not a happy trip due to the circumstances and life-changing dilemmas that surround the premise. What happens is pretty numbing, insistent and downright cold. However, I expected something stronger and more effective, and although I was intriguing and unforgettable, it did not get very emotional. The performances are reasonably mixed, but there is a brutal honesty for everyone. Dennis Hopper and especially Daniel Roebuck are fantastic? Crispin Glover is downright eccentric, and Keanu Reeves' dead as a felling seems to pay off in his role as a custom slacker. Joshua John Millar is pretty good, as is Ione Skye. Jim Metzler plays with a short but very compelling performance. The story is in a dramatic confrontation, with her character and her hard breakdown, in which she gives a hard and painful blow. The whirling music score by JÃ¼rgen Knieper seethes with fear, tension and astonishment when the morality and commitment are tested and learned.
