I enjoyed two of the three films in the "Sarah, Plain & Tall" trilogy. This was the final of the three definitely one of the "good". It is an excellent family movie with wonderful acting by the three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but understandable. The only underperformance was from one of the kids. It was interesting to see how the kids had grown since this first movie. <br /> <br /> Of the three, this initial "Sarah" was best shot with some nice movies. This movie did not have that, but it had the best story. It had some real-whiny sentimental moments and a very nice ending. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
