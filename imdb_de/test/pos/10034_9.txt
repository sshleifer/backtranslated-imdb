It is true that "They died with their boots on" a very fictionalized account of the life and career of George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn), but a notable one, especially with regard to the Battle of the Little Big Horn. For it is not a matter of course that a 1941 film attempts to portray both American cavalrymen and Chief Native American chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) in a favorable light. I'm almost tempted to say that "Little Big Man" appears unbalanced in its unqualified anti-custer stance. Besides, one should not be misled by the title of the picture? This is not just a film about the Battle of Little Big Horn, but the unreliable cadet of West Point, the famous Civil War hero, the Indian fighter and last but not least the husband /> <br /> The movie begins with Custer's time at West Point Military Academy, where its rebirth and its apostate behavior lead to frequent disadvantages. During a military exercise, he meets his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, like Custer himself, is from Monroe, Michigan. Custer wants to woo her, but the outbreak of civil war calls him away. Custer's legendary courage is shown in a series of battle scenes, the largest of which is dedicated to his confrontation with legendary Southern Cavalry General Jeb Stuart during the Battle of Gettysburg. On vacation, he travels to Monroe and enlists Elizabeth, who promises him his hand in marriage. Immediately after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon are married. <br /> <br /> After the civil war is over, Custer is demoted, does not get a real commando, and has to go through the laboriously slow ascent process of the small, professional American army. When he starts to drink, his wife intervenes on his behalf with former General Manager Winfield Scott. Custer receives the command of the 7th US Cavalry, which he trains to an elite unit. Neither Custer nor Crazy Horse want a fight, but greedy businesspeople and corrupt politicians decide to build a railway line through the Indian lands that clearly goes against previous contracts. Custer expressly acknowledges the justice of the Crazy Horse cause, but went into battle to fulfill his duty as a soldier, revealing the conspiracy of monetary interests in a letter he wrote on the eve of the battle. <br /> <br /> "She Died With Her Boots," Although historical accuracy is scarce, it's as good as wartime movies and westerns in the 1940s: both Custer and Crazy Horse are played by great actors, neither the Indians or the Southern Confederation are denounced and the courtship scenes with the beautiful Livvy de Havilland are simply enchanting. The only minus, and therefore I can not give this picture full, is the undercurrent of racism in the representation of African-American servants. Elizabeth's servant Callie is the stereotypical, overweight, good-natured, superstitious black mammy. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting that the film does not find fault with either Custer or Crazy Horse, but with the greed of the railroad companies that are putting pressure on Washington politicians to use their semi-criminal methods to break the pledges that they gave to Native Americans. Just a few years later, the suggestion that American entrepreneurs might even think they were questionable from afar was probably an indication that the filmmakers were Communist sympathizers. Needless to say, "Died With Their Boots On" overlooks the fact that Custer's overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the fool, greatly overestimating the importance of his involvement with Stuart, and the lack of awareness before the Battle of Little Big Horn was not mentioned, but Custer was regarded by his contemporaries as a war hero and had some spectacular successes he had pointed out in the bouts of Brandy Station, Gettysburg, Trevilian Station and others, although his weaponry was not as crucial to the civil war as " She "Proceeds with her boots" suggests. "<br /> <br /> In any case," Bullfight with her boots "is a well-made war movie with Western elements, three outstanding performers (Flynn, Quinn and de Havilland)) and offers a positive view of the Native Americans as well as a negative take on big money, resulting in the coming decade not to be seen in major Hollywood productions. It would deserve a 10 if there were not the racist minstrelization of African Americans.
