Man, I can not believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie. Okay, it's certainly not a demanding work of film art. But it's much more fun sticky fun. For starters, the titanic supernatural killer guy with pumpkin heads is one of the most laughable and ridiculous things that ever stumbled in front of a camera. It looks like something you would see in a fourth-rate carnival haunted house. Second, the moderate Gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing, with the definitive climax when this annoying, extremely conservative woman is electrocuted by a toaster. In addition, the always lovely Linnea Quigley is always welcome, who has introduced a memorable, long and absolutely free shower for two minutes. Amazingly, we also have appearances by deceased lockup legend John Carradine as a wicked warlock and Cameron Mitchell as the host of a horror TV show. In addition, the screaming queens Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have fleeting cameos. Senior child actor Ryan Latshaw projects all the charm and acting skills of a moldy old stump. The beautiful brunette Rachel Carter pops her top and exposes her cute little breasts. The spooky special effects are very unusual. The score has been revised accordingly. Overall, this film has a certain appeal that makes this honey a truly cheesy huss.
