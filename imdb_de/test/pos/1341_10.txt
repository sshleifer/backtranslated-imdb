When I was five, it was my favorite show on TV. I remembered that it was on channel 11 every day at 14:00. The premise of the show was just with Carole and Janis as hostesses of this children's television show. They sang songs and read stories to us as children. It was shot in a studio with only 54 episodes, which was sent again and again. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. The show taught us how to count, add, subtract and the alphabet. For thirty minutes a day, I've learned something new from Paula and Janis. I remember these days as pleasant memories and now I hope that today's children can love things easier, such as listening to stories, inexpensive props, riding swings and talking to puppets. The kit was ideal and simple, but it was Carole and Janis who were worth it. I miss my childhood and those days when the most important thing was to watch the magic garden. Life seemed so much easier and better. Now I hope the kids enjoy the show today.
