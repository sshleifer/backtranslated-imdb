MICHAEL's 1996 is a warm and award-winning comedy fantasy featuring one of my favorite performances from the John Travolta Library. Travolta gives one of his most airy and sympathetic appearances as Michael, an archangel whose quiet existence is disturbed in the home of a lone innkeeper named Pansy (Jean Stapleton), as Pansy reports to Michael's presence in a National Enquirer-like newspaper and the editor (Bob Hoskins) sends reporters (William Hurt, Andie McDowell, Robert Pastorelli) to the motel to see this. Hurt, McDowell and Pastorelli are pretty good, because the baffled newsers, who have a hard time accepting that they've met an angel, are Travolta's show and he rules like the tummy, sugar sweet, smelling of biscuit, pie loving, Aretha - loving, bull-following Michael, an angel who's just not what you think when you think of angels. And you have to love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance to "Chain of Fools". I love this movie more and more when I look at it, and this is mainly due to the resounding power of John Travolta.
