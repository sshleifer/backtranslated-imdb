SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgotten, the satire is light and the action sequences are well set but not particularly exciting. But I laughed. A lot of. Thanks go to the inspired couple of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro hits us with a look or a grimace. This film is received by critics RUSH-HOUR-like reception. Do not listen to her. If you are a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you will enjoy this movie.
