Family Guy is the best show on TV. JE. It has achieved great things that have not been achieved with any other animated sitcom or show. <br /> <br /> In terms of animated sitcoms, this era should be referred to as "The era of animated sitcoms." because there are so many of them, and almost everyone imaginable is released on DVD. There are some good ones (ie H. South Park, Futurama and The Simpsons). Each animated sitcom has its own style / technique to create humor. For example, Futurama is funny because it always comments or acts on what has just happened, with a touch of humor. The Simpsons are also a great show as they use the same comedic technique and style as Futurama. The Simpsons, however, deserve the prize because they were on the air before Futurama and are still in the air. South Park is in my opinion the funniest show next to Family Guy because it uses a smart mix of vulgarity and stupidity as a technique for creating humor. <br /> <br /> But enough about other animated shows. Let me tell you what makes Family Guy so funny. Family Guy uses a comedic style that no other show has ever used before. It uses a technique where flashbacks occur after every joke. This not only enhances the joke, but also makes it funnier. It also moves very fast. These two criteria make it the funniest show on TV. You have to see the show to believe it, but as soon as you see it you will most likely agree. (FYI, which were two funniest moments at Family Guy: 1) The 5-minute chicken fight in "Da Boom" and 2) The Dick van Dyke parody in "Holy Crap". Family Guy is also a modest show in my eyes because while other shows create humor by becoming familiar with their shticks / routines and characters, most of Family Guy jokes are based on the stupidity of current events and pop culture. This also shows that Family Guy is not only modest, but also intelligent, because it shows that the show has insight. And this technique is extremely effective because it relates their pop culture references to the particular plot of the episode in which they are found. Family Guy can be enjoyed by all ages, as younger kids may not understand it. Pop culture references amuse them with the witty, stupid antics of the characters, especially Peter. The show is a bit more vulgar than The Simpsons and Futurama, but it's less vulgar than South Park. In terms of vulgarity, Family Guy would stand in the middle of the above shows, but in terms of humor and intelligence she would be # 1 !! Unfortunately, it was canceled last year, not because it was not popular, but because FOX constantly changed its time window, nobody knew when it was. Fortunately, we have the DVD box sets (which, incidentally, sell like crazy) and repeats on Adult Swim by Cartoon Network available to us.
