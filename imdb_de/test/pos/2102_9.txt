The ruthless evil warlord Samanosuke (superbly played to the hateful grip of Yutaro Gomi) cruelly maltreats the peaceful inhabitants of a small village. The huge stone statue Majin finally comes alive to destroy Samanosuke and his evil cronies. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and screenwriter Tetsuro Yoshida give the captivating story all the power and simplicity of an ancient, legendary tale: There is a very strong sense of an ancient time and a distant place (it is located in feudal Japan), the good ones are noble and appealing, while the villains are really evil and abominable. The occasional rousing swordfights are staged with considerable skill and enthusiasm, the special effects are subtle and impressive, the serious tone and steady tempo never waver for a minute, and Majin's last role of raging wild destruction is extremely lively, exciting and more than a little scary , In addition, the fantastic elements of the narrative acquire considerable credibility because they are firmly anchored in a thoroughly believable, dark, hard, and robust world. This movie gets bonus points because he portrays Majin as a brutal and fearsome force of angry revenge rather than a pure spirit of good. The experienced composer Akira Ifukube delivers a typically rich, robust and rousing touch. Even Fujio Morita's sharp, capricious cinematography hits the bull's eye. The capable performers all give a remarkably solid and sincere performance, with Jun Fujimaki as the brave, protective Kogenta and Tatsuo Endo as the common stooge Gunjuro particularly praiseworthy. Highly recommended.
