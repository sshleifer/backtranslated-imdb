I give 10 out of 10 points, not because the plot was hard to find because it was not ... but because the characters are caring. Acting is outstanding among all performers, especially Joan Hickson, and because of her heart it is a wonderful episode. Miss Marple is being asked by Jason Rafiel's dying request to investigate and investigate a murder that took place seven or eight years ago, and she needs to find out who, why and when she is there. Mr. Rafiel is the same Rafiel as in A Caribbean Mystery, and there is a sense of connection here. <br /> <br /> Nemesis is definitely one of the amateur psychologists among us, and if you're one of those who are just pleased with lots of blood, guts and rousing action sequences, then you will not like it. But if you're like me, who loves to know about PEOPLE and find out what drives them, then Nemesis is for you.
