Like one of the other reviewers (possibly @ Amazon), I was first introduced to Tourist Trap in January 1983 by the popular, run-down WOR-9 in New York. Hellhound: The hellhound I've been I'm waiting to see it since it debuted on Halloween in 1978, had just come to an end, and I thought I had had enough of my horror for the day (laughing) - that three-eyed "Borgost" (sp?) monster that Ike Eisenmann pulls into his room disturbingly). <br /> <br /> Even though I still like Richard Crenna with his horror hat designed for the TV, it was the first 10 minutes of Tourist Trap to Devil Dog that day, which really made a good impression Mark - and months later, it became the first movie I've ever recorded on TV. WOR played this quite frequently, often as a million dollar movie on Saturday afternoon, as others have observed. It's one of those offers that delivers a powerful horror punch to the front, a real left hook - and then virtually the rest of the cast, the dances and jabs begin, putting the opening scene in a larger context, and then the real climax ( see Night of the Living Dead, re-animator). Two paragraphs and I have not mentioned a single mannequin. Imagine - the damn things are scary enough, without the music and the script. I can also remember fearsome costume dummies and similar in the attics and basements of various relatives and say what you like about the relatively straightforward approach of Schmoeller and Carroll - nobody has ever played it so well before or since. In real life, a good mannequin will make you double-and this is probably the last thing you'll likely see when you get stuck in Slausen's late wax museum and the roadside. Yes, there is a point ("I loved it very much") that Chuck "Slausen" Connors tries to fit Vincent Price. Yes, the conspiracy might have taken a whole paragraph at the beginning; I can not see the script that thick. It does not matter From the guide to competent action (Meryl Streep is explicitly not present, and here it helps rather than hindering), to another useful and effective Pino Dinaggio score (see Carrie and various other de Palma films), to different lighting, footage, use I could go on - every element of this low-budget production comes together and you get a work that's much larger than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that it is scary hell? Stephen King addressed this film in Danse Macabre about a year after its release for a good reason. Like many of his works, it may not be great art, but it certainly tells a scary story and does it well. The rest of the cast may be relatively unknown (was not Jocelyn Jones in this car hunt in Texas?), But Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were and are just familiar enough to make the public think - Stephen King style - that this could happen to you or the persons you know. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Psycho (conspiracy) and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (general appearance), even though they are not the first associations in me, mind you, are valid. I just wish I could comment on the DVD that I'm looking forward to, as Tourist Trap has become known since the nearly complete extinction of independent video stores where it had a home alongside WOR and Kabel in the '80s (though TMC / Showtime apparently played it and played regularly). No, no spoilers here, I'm afraid, no plausible failure - take a look for yourself (okay, there may be a little little thing, please scroll away if you want - better than sorry). The mannequins are damn creepy and I prefer to show it as telling ... :) <br /> <br /> For the record, Tourist Trap is also full of great lines, from "we're going to have a party!" How do I look, huh, how do I look ?! "," You are so pretty "," You can not hurt me "," I should not have to hide it - it feels good! "(listen again to the Vincent Price phrase), the inevitable" you're crazy! "(delivered at the right moment and in the right tone) ... and try - just try it - keep your hair on your arms, if you hear the head of the mannequin scream "Molly!" - especially if you realize whose head it used to be ... :) <br /> <br /> PS ... Charles Band was the producer, believe me I, and probably had the rights to Dinaggio's music ... Band, from what I understand, were the brains behind Full Moon Entertainment, which both the later use of the music in Puppet Master and the pleasing Full Moon commercial approach Puppet could characterize master and subspecies franchises, too, uhhh ... Trancers and Bad Channels (sorry, BOC).
