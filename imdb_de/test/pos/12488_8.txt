A nice, humorous mix of music room (mostly in the first third) and police procedural secrecy as the stories of the various suspects collapse. The ultimate discovery of the murder can be surprising if you do not look closely. A bitter view of Paris at the time. You can ignore the last scene (the Hollywood ending). Louis Jouvet is best suited as a police inspector, who seems to be running straight, but really has everything under control.
