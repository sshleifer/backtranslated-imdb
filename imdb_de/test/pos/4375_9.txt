Mr Carlin left our joint forum in June 2008, shortly after he went to hospital for chest pain (he had heart problems in the past). The media and comics everywhere covered the loss more than I or he ever expected ... but he was the grandfather of the observation comedy. This recording was his last production and contains a large section dedicated to the topic of death and the perspectives of life afterwards. The shooting of the project took place shortly after his 70th birthday, which he had gladly achieved (observed?). I watched Carlin's career from the time of blurry black and white television and enjoyed his current records. <br /> <br /> It's a privilege for any Carlin fan to at least see (if he does not own a copy) this special show. He was still fast and had good timing, even at 70! As he would say, "he does NOT smile from the sky on you". If he does anything, he does not need harp lessons. Maybe he'll look up !!!
