After reading the commentary on this movie and watching it, I can understand how the person felt about it. The decisions were made after hearing common sense. When the movie came out, I had heard the information about how it came about. The plot was made from an actual event. During an awards ceremony, an actor who thanked the relatives wrote the award to a former school teacher who unexpectedly visited the person every day. Each trip is different for each person. In real life, the outcome of each person will be different too. And the willingness to accept who they are is the most important thing in life for achieving personal happiness. For the people around them, the joy and honest acceptance can make life much busier. For the movie, Howard's result is much stranger than real life. And the acceptance of the community showed the others that Howard was himself and nothing else. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performances were crazy. The memorable quotes and the use of music contribute to the stereo types in the world, but they are recorded with humor and humor. It is a movie. Sit down, look with your mind open and laugh your head off.
