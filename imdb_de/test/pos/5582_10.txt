There are not many TV shows that address so many different types of fans like Farscape ... I know teens and 30/40 year olds, both male and female fans in as many different countries as you like the TV miniseries. It has elements that can be found on almost every other show on TV, a character drama that could have come from an Australian soap opera; In the same episode, however, there are scientific facts and fictions that would provide even the toughest "trekkie" for his money in the Brainbender missions! Wormhole theory, time travel in true equation form ... Magnificent. It includes cultures from all over the map, as the possibilities are endless, with multiple stars and thus thousands of planets to choose from. <br /> <br /> With so much leeway; It is to be expected that nothing can sustain the illusion for long, but here Farscape really comes to its own element ... succeeds where all others have failed, especially Star Trek (a universe) with virtually zero Kaos. Element!) The ideas ran pretty fast + they washed up again and again! Over the course of 4 seasons, they manage to keep the audience's attention through good continuity and continuous character development with multiple threads for each episode with unique personal touches on the camera that are specific to specific character groups within the whole. This structure allows for an extremely wide range of topics, as loyalties in many areas are forged and broken in many ways. I accidentally saw the pilot (Premiere) passing by and just had to keep turning to see if Crichton would ever get "Get the girl". After seeing them all on TV, I was pleased to see them on DVD. Admitting that it was the only thing that kept me healthy, while I had a 12-hour night shift and developed chronic sleep disorders ... Farscape was Only thing that got me through these extremely long nights ... <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor; Watch the pilot and see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> Farscape Comet
