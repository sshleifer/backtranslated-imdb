Great little groundbreaking movie (1955) about an important topic. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much from Sinatra's performance and was pleasantly surprised. Beloved Kim Novak! She was beautiful! <br /> <br /> Loved the jazz score of Elmer Bernstein! As great as that of Lazlo Schifrin for "Bullitt"! I am very surprised that it does not seem to be available on CD (if anyone knows anything about the availability of the soundtrack in a different format, it should be posted here somewhere!). <br /> <br /> Premingers direction as usual borderline impeccable. <br /> <br /> Do not read the novel by Nelson Algren, nor do I have any idea how true the script was. The subplot of Frankie as a "hot" card dealer was just as surprising as some other things. But see for yourself. It is very worth seeing ...
