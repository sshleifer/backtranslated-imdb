This wonderful three-part BBC production is one of the sweetest love stories I've seen in a long time. The actresses are very talented, especially Rachael Stirling as Nan Astley. She is funny, seductive and sweet. The love scenes and the kisses are very erotic, regardless of sexual preferences. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined and very believable. I think that's a by-product of a good adaptation of a well-written novel. <br /> <br /> A truly remarkable, well-done drama that picks up quickly after a few boring (but necessary) scenes in the beginning. <br /> <br /> My voice: 9/10
