Even a bad Julie Andrews musical is worth seeing and that's not bad! In fact, it's pretty entertaining. In fact, it's a fascinating study of trying to manipulate the personality of a star. <br /> <br /> To break Julie's "goody two shoes mold", she plays a German spy / English musical hall actress. As a result, she has in the film S.O.B. and play a drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not so good girls, usually under the direction of Blake Edwards. <br /> <br /> The film is admittedly problematic. It's hard to feel for her character because she's a German spy. We want to love Julie, but she's on the wrong side of the law. That's probably why this movie flop. Julie as a German spy? Our Mary Poppins? our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German spy? <br /> <br /> The romance seems to happen overnight and does not come from anywhere. But no matter, it's a musical and it has Jullie. Oh, and did I mention that hunky Rock Hudson is there too? <br /> <br /> Julie gives a wonderful performance that every musical comedy fan should not miss. Great WW 1 songs and beautiful pieces by Mancini. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie has some holes in it and sometimes it does not seem logical. Why, for example, is Julie and her uncle suddenly persecuted by the Germans when she spied for her a minute ago? <br /> <br /> But on another note, who cares? The musical numbers are funny and exciting. The costumes and the landscape are extremely elaborate. Cinematography is under scrutiny. <br /> <br /> It has the annoying idiots that Blake Edwards puts in all his movies. (Yawning) <br /> <br /> But Julie was desperately trying to change her image. (You can imagine a dinner with Blake and Julie: Julie: "Blake, we need to change my image.") Blake: "I'll make you a German spy, then we'll take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in another movie They will not recognize you It will be the death of Maria von Trapp <br /> <br /> Fascinating study on changing a picture Wonderful Julie music comedy fans, much more entertaining than Star!
