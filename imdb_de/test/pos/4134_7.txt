I have to say it. Gary Busey has saved this movie. Without his good acting talents this film would have been below average. I hardly recommend the movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest difficulty of the film is that it largely disregards historical, geographic and physical accuracy. Why is Lubbock green and hilly, for example? How come that Buddy's producer Petty is ignored? Where are the daily trips to Studio Clovis, New Mexico? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp to destroy the holly sound? Why was Buddy's two-week courtship with Mary treated as a complex, tabooed racial hybrid? Why are Buddy's tile boxes as light as feathers? After all, why are the crickets presented as difficulties to create obstacles to Holly's talent? <br /> <br /> Given their inaccuracies, these inaccuracies should be a fate for any movie that calls itself "The Buddy Holly Story." Busey, however, provides a compelling performance as the man whose death eventually led to the day the music died.
