Of all the Mafia films I've ever seen, this is one of the best for many reasons. The acting from Pesci, Cortese and Vincent. The story is one of the best ever (in the mafia genre) because it is realistic. The characters are people with whom many people can identify. This movie is great too, as the dialogue is good. It also has very realistic fights and action scenes. This film also launched the careers of Pesci and Vincent. Without the success of this movie, Casino and Goodfellas might not have been as good as they were. <br /> <br /> Story 10/10 Acting 9/10 Realism 10/10 <br /> TOTAL 10/10 <br /> <br /> My favorite mafia films are <br /> <br / > 1: Goodfellas 2: Casino 3: The Godfather Trilogy 4: Family Enforcer 5: The Sopranos (I know it's not a movie)
