Impressive! I saw that recently on the IFC after seeing But Im a Cheerleader. I have never heard of this movie, but the description sounded interesting from afar. I went in with low expectations and now I have to say that this is one of the best love stories ever made in the movie. Robin Tunney does an excellent job showing a person with tourettes. The relationship between the two and only the smallest details in the film are so accurate and believable. I usually hate "romance" and love movies, but this movie really touched me. I therefore recommend this movie to anyone with vision.
