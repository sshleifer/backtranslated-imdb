Since I have seen only once and in the morning, I can not forget this haunting movie. A mixture of mystery, suspense and heartbreaking romance reminds me of Vertigo. The actors are not well known, especially Joan Hackett in one of her best performances. They believe in her, in her love, in her new search for freedom brought about by her love and ultimately her overwhelming pain. The plot is subtle and captivating and does not extend its credibility. The direction and the technical stuff could certainly be better, but they do not affect the overall effect. And there is a message: Do not be blinded by revenge, you can become his last victim. Too bad it was not redone, but maybe it's a piece that's better left alone.
