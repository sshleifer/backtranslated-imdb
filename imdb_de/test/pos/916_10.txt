"Rouge" is part of a trilogy, but stands alone. It's not a sequel of any kind. The end that I do not want to reveal adds the three films together, but not seeing the other two does not make that too confusing. <br /> <br /> This film fascinates me because it is so sparse, so subtle and simple, but as emotional and intellectual as a big budget or an all-star melodrama. Kieslowski investigates the phenomena of coincidence and fate. Both themes are loosely interwoven throughout history. The movie is a mystery, but the message is pretty simple: everything happens for a reason. Love is in all our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it. The title "red" refers to the French flag, where red stands for "brotherhood" or brotherhood. The color dominates the look of the film. I tend to portray it as love or passion or the blood of life. It's great when a movie allows freedom to do so;)
