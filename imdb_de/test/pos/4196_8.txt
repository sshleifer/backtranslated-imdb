"I'm ... proud of Head," said Mike Nesmith, "It should be," because this film, which many of us have mocked or been studied and reviewed by film professors, works on many levels. <br /> < Yes, this is unconventional, frustrating for many, it's almost as if the producers are giving you the movie and trying, "You understand it." You probably already know that the Monkees TV show was a tremendous marketing success that depended on business sense and not too small of public delusion.Tv broadcasts are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than entertaining.That The Monkees went out of the box for a short time to make "Head," is a testament to the popularity and importance of the group in pop culture, even when the head is in. Make one thing clear: "Head" is not The Monkees TV Show. <br /> <br /> So we have here a "psychedelic documentation" about we Eastern pop culture from a source that has authority in this area. "Head" is a movie that could only come from those in the box. In 1968, the crew and crew of the Monkees were experienced and tired professionals who had seen their share of promises and disappointments. The film was a deliberate attempt to reposition the market. So it did three things: Make a movie the way the Monkees imagined it. Most importantly, reinvent the group that is not subject to their old bosses - and you're hipper than before. Make a film that shows the American attitude to information dissemination. <br /> <br /> "Head" is really about media manipulation and its result: deception. The mass media should inform, enlighten us on what is happening in the world, and ultimately we are asked to formulate opinions on these events that can turn thinking into positive actions. Therefore, we assume that the information we receive is complete and unbiased - how else can one draw an estimated conclusion for an idea of ​​a book, a newspaper or a television program? In one of the street interviews in "Head," a man admits, "I have not seen a newspaper or a television for years." Is he less or better the man? Even the drug parallels are a soft cover of "things are not what they seem". Do you remember the old joke "Everything you know is wrong"? The script begins with the public recognition of The Monkees for its own "finished image" and literally goes with football. Is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea of ​​"Head"? Is the film an awareness exercise? Is the movie the culmination of smoking marathons? There are too many matches in the movie that point to something else. My guess is that "head" is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intended and unintentional. <br /> <br /> Especially the insiders responsible for "Head" seem to rejoice in the revelations that take place in the film. There is anger - anger about the chaos that characterized the late 60's, and Anger at how the media, especially television, had changed culture in a negative way. Drugs and violence were and still are strong negative forces in the late 1960's, but the producers of "Head" want to let you know that bad "information" poses a far greater threat. <br /> <br /> Wars were attributed to jokes and lies. What perfect way to disseminate disinformation than through television? The mysterious Black Box is repeatedly seen as an obstacle to the Monkees and, apparently, all of us. In one scene, Peter grumpily sits in a drawing room and holds a melting ice cream cone. He is asked by another monkey, "What's going on?" "I bought this ice cream cone and I do not want it." The film suggests that the primary purpose of the media is NOT to inform but to blindly sell. "Head" goes on: Put an idea into someone's head, and he's happy. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers know that and the danger is real. "Head" is either a film that is created "at every turn," or an intentional statement. Maybe not. Maybe it's just "Pot meets Advertising," as critics mocked in 1968. The jokes are about The Monkees and us. Be careful what you ask, you might get it. <br /> <br /> Cheers: A true guilt. Very funny. Intelligent. Fans like it Find the substance, it's here. Outrageously funny. Bizarre collection of characters. Good mood. Length is appropriate. Many great one-liners, including my ever-prophetic favorite: "The tragedy of your time, my young friends, is that you get exactly what you want." <br /> <br /> Precautions: Dated. Drugs No plot No linear delivery in particular. At least twenty-five stories interwoven in a stop-and-go manner. This can easily frustrate you. May seem presumptuous to some. People who can not stand The Monkees do not have to be careful, although this in itself is no reason to avoid this. The psychedelic special effects may kill your battered picture tube or your acid burned eyeballs. <br /> <br /> Take care, cut.
