I have to admit, at first I was worried about Farscape. The opening segment was not very strong and I began to worry about what would come. However, as soon as Henson became familiar with the dry humor, the unique and enduring characters, and the compelling story, an outstanding piece of science fiction was created. The story follows John Crichton (played by Ben Browder), a scientist who has developed a spaceship and a theory based on the spin drive. However, during the first test, his craft encounters an unknown magnetic field, and he is driven into an unknown galaxy in the midst of a battle between escaped prisoners (on the Moya spacecraft) and the Peacekeepers (human enforcers). , He is literally drawn into the prison ship, and after many twists and turns, he is associated with the prisoners (Ka D'argo, a Luxom warrior, Pa'u Zhaan, a Delvian priestess), Rygel XVI Sun, a peacekeeper who is himself reluctantly joined the crew. With outstanding special effects, moderate make-up and puppets and robots that exceed the Henson standard of perfection. In addition to a well-written story and character-driven storyline, FarScape seems to be a fantastically original, creative and clever science-fiction series.
