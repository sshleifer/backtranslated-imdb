Here is a movie that fixes almost everything, with good performances by all and three strong performances by Hanks, Seymour Hoffman, and a fine performance by Julia Roberts, who had captivated me from the very first seconds of production to the stars lift and leave it there for the duration. <br /> <br /> Aside from one or two very minor factual issues with the script, the only thing that leaves this movie down is the technical direction, there are far too many bad cuts (fake continuity) and a series from camera "cheats" that just do not work. This is surprising and annoying for a movie of this size, but does not destroy an otherwise beautifully crafted movie.
