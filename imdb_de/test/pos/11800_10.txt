Such a great movie - I was tied up all the time and in the end so emotionally defeated! The two young male actors in the film were more than convincing in their performance, as their friendship and mutual support were quite credible, and I thought that the comparison / contrast between their respective lives and health between them had become so very real. The success of bringing this movie to life was obviously a team effort. That's why I tell actors, EPs, producers, writers, directors and the entire production: "WELL PLAYED!" After missing the credits at the beginning of the movie (shown on HBO), I was very surprised that I actually (though briefly) had to research the internet to find the title of this movie - something so great I would have known must be a clear indication that this film must be re-published!
