Calling this movie a "lesbian love story," it's about as accurate as calling Pride & Prejudice a "straightforward love story." There's just so much more than that. Yes, the main character is a lesbian, but her story is a classic educational novel, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence to maturity, from personal blindness to self-discovery. There is a stylistic element of the camp in the direction of the film, but it is not an obstacle. Rather, it underlines the staged and dramatic parts of the character's life. <br /> <br /> Anyone familiar with Anna Chancellor from the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice will surely be thrilled. Rachael Stirling is a prominent character as the main character Nan, and Keeley Hawes is all the best as her lover Kitty Butler. The chancellor could play the most prominent role, except for Sally Hawkins, who plays Zena Butler. This movie is not for the faint-hearted, but also not for gays. It's a real story, with real comedy and drama, a gripping story with captivating characters and worth seeing.
