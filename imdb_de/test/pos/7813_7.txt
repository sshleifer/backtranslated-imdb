I found this to be an underrated, quietly spaghetti western (also known as DEAD OR ALIVE). Despite modest evidence (apart from the multi-purpose co-writer / producer Albert Band, the only composer Carlo Rustichelli is the only notable crew member), the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three American stars (newcomer Alex Cord is an ambiguous anti-hero while the veterans Arthur Kennedy and Robert Ryan give the proceedings a mythical quality) and the unusual conspiracy (with a crippled protagonist, an amnesty trick that covers a strategic cleanup of the city, and finally supports the law shooter in front of a horde of Mexican bandits) , <br /> <br /> There are several hard action scenes? The film is crowned by a grandiose climax in which the star trio is besieged in a blazing cabin. In addition, a few extraordinary moments that are something of a trademark of Spaghetti Western: In the middle of the street, Cord sees a hidden shooter at a window, which is reflected in a whiskey bottle; A man who helps Cord escape is repeatedly bathed in an oil bath by the villains. Nicoletta Machiavelli also makes a nice impression as a village girl with Cord. So the supporting cast is peppered with familiar (albeit largely anonymous) faces? All were essentially genre fixtures. <br /> <br /> I did not know that the English language version of the movie on the R1 DVD was shortened by MGM / UA: I was misled by the wrong runtime listed on the back; the movie was only 99 minutes long and not 118 ?? Obviously, Cord's character is killed in the longer Italian version!
