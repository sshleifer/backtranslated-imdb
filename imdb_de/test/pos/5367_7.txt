The first time I saw Brotherhood of Satan, I was 12 years old. I saw it in a small Washington State town in front of the crypt tales we left early because my sisters were scared even before the Brotherhood of Satan. All in all, I found it a pretty good movie. The beginning was good, we had just sat down, and this tank had a number on this station wagon. <br /> <br /> What impressed me most about this movie was the scenery in the city where it was filmed around Chelan WA, where I saw the movie, especially as it headed toward the city Hillsboro drove to where the movie is located in a small town in southwestern New Mexico. I have always liked LQ Jones and Strother Martin and also Charles Bateman, who has been to another show at Get Smart. I gave the movie a 7 and later, when I saw stories from the tomb, I thought the brotherhood of Satan was better.
