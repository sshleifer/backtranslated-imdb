Jamie Foxx did an incredible job playing Ray Charles. I loved this movie because there was always a Flashback scene and then the current movie. When Ray Charles was little, he went blind and his mother did not give birth to him. She was a strong woman who did not treat him differently because he was blind. She forced him to do things alone, and that made him a great musician later in life. His mother also sent him to school. When Ray Charles then became a man, he could stand up for himself and take care of himself, but there was a crash in narcotics, sex and betrayal. When I am discouraged about something, I can just think of this movie and it will inspire me.
