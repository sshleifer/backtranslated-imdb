I always thought my dad had a second life, and waited anxiously for the development of 51 Birch Street when I sat down for the first time. Amazingly, the film's journey took me to places I did not expect, causing me to rethink assumptions and judgments. A truly remarkable personal story told in a clever but straightforward way. I particularly liked that the filmmaker pulled out the type of his mother's daily diary - very effectively. I read the previous comment and would like to say that the sound was good when I saw this. I have a suspicion that either the movie was changed a bit or the theater might have contributed the worse sound quality for the other writer.
