Why is it better? Because it fits the dark vision of the comic. Because the imagery is inventive and unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one. The first one had too much of Jack Nicholson's shit, too much Prince music, and an awkward "romance." Instead of a villain, there are three here. No Robert Wuhl, and the lead actress is more than just a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the # 1 attraction in this film. Their transformation is what drives the current topic. She is really scary. The costumes and make-up are excellent. Danny DeVito's Penguin is inspired and tormented, not just a nut. His circus gang is the only element of comic relief (besides the giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character I've mitigated, Walken is pretty malicious like the reckless businessman. Danny Elfman's score fits perfectly together as always, and the Siouxie and the Banshees song ("Face to Face") is by far the best of all the songs from one of the films. It fits perfectly with music artists and film music. The least of Campy's films, it's macabre, does not waver, and demands second and third looks like an amusement park ride. Bravo Tim Burton and cast!
