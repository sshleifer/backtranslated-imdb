Having not seen this movie for a long time, we recently caught it on the beautifully transmitted Criterion DVD. "Le cercle rouge" is a film that has much to thank other films. He reminds us again and again of "Rififi", "The Asphalt Jungle", partly because they all deal with capers that are central to the film and reproduce it in detail. Unfortunately, we know that the old adage that crime is not worth doing is doomed to failure right from the start. Jean-Pierre Melville was a director in a few words. He has not filled his pictures with many dialogues, as is the case here. Since they were not "talkative", they had their own style, such as "Le Dolous", "Le Samurai" and his masterpiece "Bob le flambeur" proved. Mr. Melville had a style that was reflected in everything he did. In this film, he takes us along with his cameraman Henri Decae on a ride through the streets of Paris, which show the vibrant city, especially at night and the gloomy winter in France. The score is by Eric Demarsan, who emphasizes jazzy music that accompanies most of the action. <br /> <br /> Although the film stars Alain Delon as Corey, he is the smart inspector Mattei, the true hero of the film. As the great Bourvil plays, he is a man who shows much patience because he has figured out from the beginning how to catch a bird, and he is involved in investigating the jewel robbery in which he knows the escaped man he is big behind the loom. Bourvil offers a hugely satisfying performance as Mattei is as determined and tender as the three cats are. Alain Delon always responded with interesting performances, which he showed in Mellville's pictures. Here he is Corey, the man who sees the jail abandoned first and promises not to return, but he can not do any good if he decides to join the robbery. His connection with Vogel and Jansen pays off in the way they do their job, but it will also be a mistake in the way they can not eliminate the loot, as the fence on which they are have left a change of heart. <br /> <br /> Gian Maria Volonte and Yves Montand are called birds or Jansen. They were outstanding actors who fit in well with the action of the movie. Both actors were in their best moment when they took over the roles in the film and it shows. Mr. Montand has the more complex character when we first see him in front of the camera as a man with many demons in his head. Jean-Pierre Mellville has received wonderful results from him in a movie that feels a bit longer but still manages to show his style in one of the director's most memorable images.
