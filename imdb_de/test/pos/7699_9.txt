Well done melodrama that tells the story of Sally, the tomboy dancer in the circus, the singer of actress McGargle (played by WC Fields), the top hat, the little mustache, the plaid pants and the skill as a juggler, pickpocket and Runners from raised carnival games such as Three Card Monte and the Old Shell Game. McGargle has raised Sally, who adores him as her "real father" since Sally's mother (who was kicked out of her home by her father, a judge who married a "circus man") died and orphaned Sally. Sally is steadfast and loyal to McGargle, no matter what he's up to - but McGargle seems to feel a bit guilty for keeping her in the circus and not in her own family. When they finally perform in a carnival in the city where their wealthy grandparents live, McGargle takes the opportunity to "examine" Sally's real family with the idea that he can restore them. But the grandfather, the judge, displeases Sally immediately because he does not like a "showgirl" - what a stern, narrow-minded man he is, a real piece of this guy! And in the meantime, Sally is busy being followed by a handsome and rich young man, son of the man who helped grandfather get his fortune. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie with some laughs here and there and a kind of odd editing style (I do not know how to describe it unless it shows long beats, then jumps for a few seconds back or suddenly changes the angle when a close-up is displayed). Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is adorable - pretty cute and weird in her performance. TOILET. Fields is very funny even without his famous voice - just as he moves and how he reacts weirdly (like a little dog in a funny scene), we even see him juggling for a moment. I love the few insights into the old-fashioned circus and carnival shown here. The print on this DVD is very handsome, with a light sepia tone, and the keyboard is really outstanding, played by Philip Carli, based on the original cue sheets.
