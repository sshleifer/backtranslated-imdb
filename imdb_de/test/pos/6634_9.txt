Extremely tricky vision of a war situation, in which the pair of Vargtimmen (ok, they have different names and initial situations, the actors are the same) in the crossfire of two fronts advised. The portrayal of the combat parties as faceless, superordinate authorities is often captured in sublime surreal imagery and draws interesting parallels with Orwell's 1984, although Bergman thwarts this context on a personal level of a slowly burgeoning marital war. Therefore, countless fundamental and philosophical questions regarding Eve and Jans marriage are relevant and indispensable, while the threat and danger from outside open up an abyss inside that was previously heavily burdened with Lambency. An intense allegory on the fragile facades of bourgeois conventions.
