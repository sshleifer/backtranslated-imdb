This is a typical Sandra Bullock movie in which she plays a lousy (but profane) woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the heroine. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> There are many holes in this story. Things just do not go together and some of the tensions are a bit cheesy. But - this tension is very good. There is a lot of tension in this story, which is permeated by a strong paranoia. The story begins slowly, but soon sets in and stays that way, making the viewer an interesting movie. That's why I rate it pretty well - the movie gets you there. Bullock is more cute than annoying, which she usually does for me, so this is my best rated movie with her in it.
