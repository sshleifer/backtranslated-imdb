Valeria, an elegant and pretty young woman, lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her timidity and depression. Although she has a one-night lover, or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference that she is completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman, who can take action to approach this special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with "yes", "no" or "I do not know" answer. The way of emphasizing the loneliness of the character is great. An example would be the removal of both Massimo and Valeria who drank coffee in the same room, separated by subtle separations and unable to see each other. I could mention several sequences, but it is better to watch the movie. It is impressive to see that the director does not get a single detail out of control. Although all actions are performed in slow motion, no screams are needed, no special effects, just good drama and a touching, well-written story. I loved it.
