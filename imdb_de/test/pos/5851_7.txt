Rating: 7 out of 10. Director: Barbet Schroeder. If you like Hitchcock's "rope" you will like this movie. Sandra Bullock as "Murder by Numbers" star as a psychologically distressed but brilliant police officer Cassie Mayweather. Her partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective of Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> The teenage murderers are high school students Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These young psychotics want to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it, but the proximity of the capture is exciting and exciting for at least one of the murderers police chief, a deputy district attorney and the janitor of the high school on which the killers to commit the murder. The movie reminds me of several Hitchcock films that were crossed with the TV series "Law and Order". We see a lot of police work, and it's really interesting to see what clues the detectives are tracking and which are not. <br /> <br /> The other plot in the movie refers to Cassie Mayweather's past and detained ex-husband. Most viewers found this aspect of the film unnecessary and slow, but I found that to be the most intriguing part of the story. <br /> <br /> 'Murder by Numbers' is a neatly designed movie if you're looking for a safe movie or should I say dangerous, murder mystery. For more excitement and excitement, try 'Se7en' or Hitchcock's 'Dial M for Murder'.
