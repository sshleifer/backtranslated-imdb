L'Appartement is, I think, a very targeted Hitchcockian movie. The plot was full of symbols (ie, the white and red roses) and the twists of action that neatly wrapped themselves. The look was very Parisian and drew you closer to the story. I have seen it in London and I am very sorry that it is not on video in the States
