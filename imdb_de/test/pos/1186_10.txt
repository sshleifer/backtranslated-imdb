It could not have come at a worse time - just as the nation entered the Reagan years, the boom boom of the 1980s, the time of no regrets and misgivings. It got no word of mouth and opened badly. The studio gave up. But Hair is probably the best musical ever made - with Forman Director and Tharpe Choreography, it's an amazingly beautiful, well-made, well-written triumph that few people remember. The casting is perfect, the musical numbers are unforgettable, and even the downer of an end does not diminish the movie's indomitable spirit. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie, you have not seen the best musical ever. Serious.
