This was the best movie of 1998 and one of the best of the 90s. Yes, it's a rip-off from Goodfellas. But as the saying goes, good poets borrow, and great poets steal. And PTA has brilliantly stolen from some of the best and added his own ingenious accents. I gave this one ten (which is very rare for me). <br /> <br /> The main reason I'm commenting on this (because I could just swarm all night) is all those people who saw it on VHS Standard Edition ... what do you think? This deserves the FULL SCREEN experience. Look at the relationship in which it was recorded! I've seen it five times in the cinema and have not bothered to watch it on video. <br /> <br /> Nuff said!
