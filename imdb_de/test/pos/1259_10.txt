This is a totally awesome movie! If you have not seen it yet, you should do it damn well. Sure, the plot is developing slowly, the special effects are ridiculous, the drama is ridiculous and the plot is badly choreographed, but as the wrestler would say, DDP would say; That's not a bad thing ... that's a good thing! Everything about this movie is hilarious, especially if you get the dubbed version that has even worse actors. There are countless laughs until you come to the end and long for the sequel, in which the mummy fights against women. So I give ten stars. If you are not one of the "discriminating" and "intelligent" people with good taste who only like "high quality" movies of the highest caliber, I recommend this absolutely monkeydellic movie!
