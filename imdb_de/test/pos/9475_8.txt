This is the first James Cagney movie I've ever really seen. I've never been interested in his films because I thought I did not like anything in this cinema style and because I've heard that most Cagney films are the same. I have to say that I really liked it. By today's standards for movies it was not special, but I found it surprisingly entertaining. Cagney did not look like a tough guy, but he played the role very well.
