Gary Busey's best performance in a beautifully flowing biography. Since he had a musical background, he could make his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see good actor Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith. <br /> <br /> An 8 out of 10 points. Fortunately, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated and lost to COMING HOME against Jon Voight. A pretty cheap streak that does not disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope that made a lot of dough. Busey has never been so popular again for a variety of reasons, but luckily he has this great on his CV.
