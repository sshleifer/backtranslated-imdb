<br /> <br /> As a fan of Harold Lloyd, I agree with the comments of the other reviewers, with the exception that "Movie Crazy" is the best sound movie for me. "Cat's Paw" is a close second. (But that's just my opinion.) <br /> <br /> This film is a "scream" from beginning to end and in many scenes George Barbier (the crook who voted him mayor) almost steals the show! (Especially at the end of the movie). <br /> <br /> One wishes that Una Merkel's character would be a little more sympathetic to Harold, especially as the movie progresses. Only in the last minutes of the movie do we get to know her true feelings for him. (And even then there is no "romance" - kisses, etc.). <br /> <br /> This is a must-see movie!
