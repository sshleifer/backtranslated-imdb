With a debut segment mimicking the music and cinematography of Todd Haynes' Safe (1995), David Lynch uses dreams, myths and discarded notions of reality to narrate the broken story of a disappointed Hollywood actress / waitress, Diane Selwyn Glory and her own demons obsessed by Camilla Rhodes, who is engaged to hot-headed director Adam Kesher. <br /> <br /> The movie is effectively playing in Diane's mind, which is fueled by drugs; We are witness to their crazy distortions, their wishfulness, their regret, their obsession and their fears. Lynch uses dream counting as a way to present two notions of reality in conflict, and does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy, but actively engages them. The last 45 minutes are as dreamlike as before. and the arduous atmosphere of detached, otherworldly ambiguity still permeates the seemingly sure distinction between reality and dream that we expect in films about nightmares and dreams. Lynch's film borrowed from many old and new films, but ultimately is a movie like no other with the exception of the director Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. It constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what they have seen, not just intuitively but intellectually as well. However, it's not as presumptuous as you would have imagined because Lynch lets us sympathize with the protagonist despite her murderous acts - an element that was missing in any other film except the straight story. He does so by presenting Diane's dream-alter ego, Betty, as a healthy Canadian peasant girl destined for fame. Lynch also presents a fascinating story that equally affirms and negates. Are Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? Who is the blue lady? What does she mean? Who's the butt behind Winkies? What is the significance of the decaying corpse in the Sierra Bonita? Does Aunt Ruth really exist? Is Silencio an abstraction of hell or maybe a self-centered view of the status of the film as a fiction? Lynch is unwilling to answer any question he raises. Instead, he wants to present his "Love Story in the City of Dreams" as a series of interconnected abstractions and motifs. <br /> <br /> Especially acting Naomi Watts as Diane Selwyn / Betty, which will replace this idea. Laura Harring has the requisite Hayworthesque appeal as Camilla / Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam gives his role free-rooted arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression. It was staggering and a grave injustice that not one of them was even nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that requires you to be seen and analyzed. The puzzle in the heart of the movie remains in Lynch's hands, but half of the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of apparent disagreements he presents. On closer inspection, there is some sense of a puzzle, perhaps an incomplete puzzle that annoys us with the closure, but denies the imaginary fullness of narrative coherence. Ultimately, this is the key movie by Lynch.
