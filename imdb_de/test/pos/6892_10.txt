I absolutely loved this series and was very sad that it was running. Yes, it is Christian and traditional too. These are some difficult topics, as the other reviewer states, but I think it depends on your point of view on these issues, and as a teenager who grew up, and now as a mother herself, I was so happy to see a television series clean and well frankly wonderful! Unlike the other reviewers, I was encouraged to see how they handle the condom. Instead of listening to the typical, wishless ablutions of condoms, they showed that the son was actually working to be chaste and apply it to his later relationships, which were pure and god-fearing, and thus much safer (100%!). <br /> After watching this entire series, you will be extremely committed to all the characters in the family and out of the family (once they have settled permanently), and the moral values ​​that they have in each episode mediate are simply priceless. I found Touched by a Angel (by the same producer) cheesy here and there (though I liked it overall), but this series was much better in my opinion and had a better acting and was also more interesting. It was good for the whole family and interesting for the whole family, which was a big plus. The family was not outstanding, they had their own mistakes, but in the long run, they did what was right, and they saw them grow and change and fight as any real family does. It was my favorite show at the time and will always be at the top of my list. I hope it appears on DVD!
