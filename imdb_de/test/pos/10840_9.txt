So far, only the first episode has been shown, and the lesbian sex scenes have made a big uproar. But for those who take the trouble to look ahead, they will find an incredibly beautiful love story that ended with an exciting climax / cliffhanger in this episode. I found the story so powerful that I was inspired to read the novel on which this fantastic series is based.
