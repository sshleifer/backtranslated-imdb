I was half asleep when I looked at a selection of late night short films - but I sat upright from the first pictures of "I Shout Love" and could not avert my eyes for its full, short, perfect length. With incredibly safe tempo and performances, this film retains its comic / sad / insightful tone throughout. The credits were so fast and so small in the end that I had to search online for the person responsible for this masterpiece. What a pleasant surprise when you see the name of Sarah Polley, a great actress who is rarely seen. Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) show rich and poignant performances as a couple the ache of departure. While working from their time together by repeating Tessa's favorite moments, both actors reveal dimensions of their characters and relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents - and the director / writer's abilities. The film creates a moving narrative with loud, loud moments and a deep breath. <br /> <br /> "I Shout Love" is without doubt one of the greatest and most memorable short films I have ever come to expect. It has wit, heart and stunning originality. It is important.
