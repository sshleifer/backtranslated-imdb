This could be the most exciting movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's so nerve-wracking that after two years I could not watch it anymore, but I'll get the DVD there. There were a few scenes here that are almost too much to see. So if you have problems and need to "escape" for an hour and a half, this movie will distract you from anything else. <br /> <br /> Russian actress Marina Zudina did a great job on her face alone, which she had to do because her character is dumb. She plays a cute and healthy make-up artist for a shabby filmmaker. After the day is over and "Billie" is about to leave, she hears something. She glances into the room where they were shooting and discovers that they are now shooting a "snuff film" and actually killing someone. Billie's eavesdropping is discovered and she's running for her life as the killers search for her in this large warehouse. There are two extended scenes in which our heroine runs for her life and both will exhaust you. The first one I described above. The second scene, the climatic, takes too long and is not as well done as the first one. In fact, the film should have been trimmed a bit, but overall, since it can hold our attention so well, it served its purpose as a conversation.
