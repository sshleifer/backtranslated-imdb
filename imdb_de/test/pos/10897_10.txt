GoldenEye is a masterpiece. The plot is amazing, the characters are nicely animated and the weapons are tyte. The story is so interesting, even if you have fulfilled every single mission. To reach more levels, you must defeat them on a higher difficulty level. And the multiplayer mode is so much. You select the weapons you want to play with and then play. Me and the three of my friends always play Goldeneye together with my brother. If you do not have this game, I suggest you buy it.
