In a sport that values ​​the scurrility and treasures of their characters, Dizzy Dean was one of the largest from the 1930s. He was such a colorful personality that he was probably chosen for his strength in the Baseball Hall of Fame, as opposed to his pitching statistics. After all, part of Dean's story is this early end of his career. <br /> <br /> In the pride of St. Louis, Dan Dailey successfully captures the figure of Dizzy Dean, at least the dean I remember. I'm not old enough to remember him, but I remember he aired the baseball game of the week in the 1960s. Because that's also part of the Dean story of being a pioneer on the radio and later on TV. Now that the announcers are in the Hall of Fame, there's no question that Dizzy belongs there. <br /> <br /> Jerome Herman Dean was one of a tribe of jokers with little education, but an amazing talent at throwing baseball at dazzling speed. In fact, he had a younger brother, Paul Dean, who was a pretty good jug himself. Richard Crenna plays Paul in this movie and it's one of his first movie roles. Paul Dean was a quiet retirement in real life, whose career was also interrupted by injuries. That's why Crenna does not have much work with it. During the dean's heyday, sports journalists tried to label Paul with the nickname Daffy, but it never lasted. <br /> <br /> Joanne Dru, a break from playing, Western ladies in gingham dresses and corsets, is first class, because the smart, patient and understanding Patricia Nash, who met Dizzy and married when he was in Houston for Houston played Texas League. <br /> <br /> In the 1937 All Star Game, Dizzy started for the National League. Looking at Cleveland's Earl Averill, Dean was struck by a line-drive blow at him. Dean refused to listen to medical advice and came back too early. He had broken a big toe and strained his arm too much. He was never the same pitcher and his refusal to accept it is part of the story. Would he have had a career of about ten to fifteen years, who knows what pitching statistics he got to the point? Dean was the penultimate pitcher who won 30 games in 1934, and after Denny McLain (who was himself a character) did so in 1968, he has not been taken since. Although he was not the first former player to go to the radio booth He immediately became a hit with his colorful game descriptions. He began to be a rather miserable team for the other St. Louis team, the Browns and the Browns, who did not have much to cheer about. Dean became a major attraction there. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of Dean's story is the problem he came into because he was not so well-educated and colorful in the air. This is part of the story that I will not go into, but in the movie it is treated with tact and humility, and your eyes could moisten if you are interested in the sentimental. <br /> <br /> A good baseball movie, a true tribute to an American success story.
