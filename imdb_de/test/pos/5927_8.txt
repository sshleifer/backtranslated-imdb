I have seen this movie several times over the years and always find it entertaining. As a retired airline pilot, I'm interested in most aviation films and this is one of the better ones. I know that at the time of his historic solo flight to Paris, Lindbergh was only 25 years old and James Stewart was nearly 50 years old in making this film, but I can overlook that fact, since Stewart has always been one of my favorite actors doing one of his usual outstanding achievements as a "lonely eagle". <br /> <br /> There is a good mix of comedy and drama throughout the movie and good use of flashbacks. It also helps that James Stewart was a pilot in real life, both in military and civilian life.
