Well, this is certainly one of the most easily told stories in which Bruce Willis was until today and still - it is still touching. I really like the style and personality of Bruce, I did not love everything he's ever been in, but in most of his film efforts, he does it for me at the "big time". <br /> <br /> The story begins ..... He is power, self-confidence and style with a Capitol 'S'. He drives a Porshe, he lives well in a palatial estate with a great view of the fair city. This is Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant for those who stand at the top or rise to it. His recognition is Russell Duritz. He knows what matters. It just seems that as life moves fast and fundamental allies emerge, there is a problem: an intruder at home, the alarm has been activated! <br /> <br /> Russell does not seem to find out for the moment what's happening to him. It is different and yet somehow familiar. A little boy who looks just like him ... As their lives merge, there seems to be a reason that screams to him, "They have unresolved issues to worry about!", Amy, who Supportive Young Woman of History is probably the best balance he has seen and has seen in his life. She works with him, settles for his 'ego' and is in love with Russell. Very much so. With Rusty being his former "me" now in the picture and talking a mile a minute, singing too late at night, all that was fundamental, like jelly! <br /> <br /> Willis is fun, self-centered and sometimes out of his head in this adorable modern Disney classic "The Kid". And with its small, resilient sidekick, Spencer Breslin is a perfect complement to this sparkling story from childhood to adulthood and back to the childhood adventure. Chi McBride is an inspiring minor character, as he is the heavyweight champion who teaches little Rusty how to resist the bullying on the playground. All in all, this is a real winner of a movie, even with Lillie Tomlin as secretary and consultant to Russell. I originally saw this in 2000 and then years later with equal enjoyment. This is a brilliant family comedy with a great ending that will warm the hearts of any Disney fan. Recommended high (*****)
