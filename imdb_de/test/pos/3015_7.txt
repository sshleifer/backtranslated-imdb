I went straight to the big screen to see this kicker. This is the only movie that I know Tarsem Singh directed, but the boy was intense. This movie was a total mental stimulator and one of the best special effects of its kind. <br /> <br /> The characters were alive and nothing less than beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombards the senses with fear and amusement. This movie is like no other I've ever seen, apart from the level that it's oddly odd. So it's a pretty big step over A Clockwork Orange. Be sure to watch this movie on the big screen and do not wait until it appears on tape. It's not half as good on tape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for people who are easily freaked out. It will get confused in your mind and you will be left with pictures that take a while to forget. But for those who like to be freaked out ... ENJOY!
