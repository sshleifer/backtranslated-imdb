THE FALKON AND THE SNOWMAN is a great example of an anti-80s movie. While many other films of the decade generally lacked substance, this movie is pure substance. There is nothing stylish, wrong or superfluous. It offers two outstanding performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as lifelong friends Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee, respectively. Hutton, Penn, and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of early-'80s actors who all looked at much bigger and better things (all three were in TAPS). As the popularity of Penn and Cruise grew, Hutton was largely forgotten, and that's a shame. In fact, Hutton is the first of the three to win an Oscar for a supporting role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980, but I think his performance in this film is even more outstanding in his character Chris Boyce's war uprising. Chris is a failed seminar student and has a love-hate relationship with his father, well played by the great character actor Pat Hingle. The scene in which Chris quotes the poem that he believed his father had long forgotten is a particularly powerful one. Chris gets a job at the defense department and uses his hatred of the US government and their foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the Soviets. He gets his buddy Daulton, a hyper drug dealer self-server, as a messenger of the project plans for microfilm. While Chris does it because of his belief, Daulton does it exclusively for the money. The Soviet Union is superbly played by David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have a really quirky chemistry and it's a kind of fun exchange. But make no mistake, this movie is anything but that. It's a serious character study of pessimism, malaise, paranoia and mistrust. <br /> <br /> Again, the leads are making this movie. Hutton delivers a brilliant and understated performance as Chris, a pretty smart young man with so much potential. Penn, as usual, stands out as Daulton, a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks, and usually does not think at all. The end of this fact-based film is very sad at several levels. A really strong character study.
