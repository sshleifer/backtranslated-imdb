The Beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks who wanted to survive in New York in the 1980s. This includes fighting with the other street gang, with whom they directly share a high school class, trying to stay in school, and attend local shows involving bands that look like Dead Kennedy's and the name Skulls for their band name to have. Rex (played by David Jacobson) Plays an autistic child who starts out long with all these types and starts to show them that poetry is really beautiful. When applied to what these children do in life, this can really work for the better! Billy Kane (played by William McNamara) and Kate Kane (played by Kara Glover) are brother and sister. Even though they roll with this lot of thugs, these kids are not the same people as this group. They take care of Rex, they take care of others and really show an enlightened side of themselves. While his sister sleeps with the head of the gang, she also falls in love with Rex and tries to show him that she is not a slut. But in the end, the teachers at the school finally come to him and want to take him to a mental hospital. After all, he feels it's time to end his life while Animals of Sound plays without him. But they like to believe that he is not dead, he lives only his full life, rides sharks and is happy to live in the ocean. This movie was one of those movies that I was glad I saw. It was very entertaining, but it also had a big message. The lines in which these children had no direction, no future, no figure to look up to, but as a worried child passed by, they all realized that there were much more important things in life than the local black children to fight or be destructive to everything. Rex showed them the beauty in angry music. Rex showed them the beauty of rats, diseases and murder. Rex showed them the beauty in almost everything, while some of these things have no beauty, they could still recognize that these poems, when used in poetry, talk to people. Rex played an important role in this move, which changed the heart of everyone from depression to seeing that there was hope for them, and therefore he began to show them; The beat.
