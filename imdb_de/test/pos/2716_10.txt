Despite the recommendations to see Park Avenue, I refused to reject the film as a clich√©d topic of extreme emotional drama and exaggerated acting. <br /> <br /> Every now and then movies like 15 Park Avenue come and sweep you off your feet. <br /> <br /> The movie captures your attention pretty early, and after that, there's no time to rest. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of sticking the audience in every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, "just the right amount" of emotions and an enigmatic end to achieve it all ... <br /> <br /> Once again, I have respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi. She surpasses expectations once again on Page-3 and Mr. & Mrs. Iyer. Prof. Anjali's role is very well developed and Shabana fully lives up to the character. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chaya and Waheeda Rehman give the movie an incredible flair. <br /> <br /> I define "shower moments" as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you endlessly think in your shower until your wife / girlfriend / mom knocks on the door. 15PA has many "showering moments", especially the conversation between Anjali and her mother, where the mother is careful when talking to Anjali about her thoughts. It brings Anjali's personality to the audience immediately. <br /> <br /> The ending is a very bold statement by the director; probably westernized for the Indian public; yet it provides the elements to promote the movie from "good" to "great".
