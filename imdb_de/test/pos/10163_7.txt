Hitchcock's remake of his 1934 film concerns the well-known story of the McKenna marriage (James Stewart, Doris Day, Leslie Banks, Edna Best in the first version) and her eleven-year-old son, who travels through Morocco during vacations. In a bus they know a sympathetic Frenchman (Daniel Gelin, in the old version Pierre Fresnay). While they are in Marrakech, they also know a couple (Bernard Miles and Brenda De Banzie) and suddenly come to a crime scene, the dying man whispers a political message. Then the kid is kidnapped to keep his silence, and McKenna gets help from Morocco's Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie about a family that encounters an obscure international conspiracy, and then they are forced to play excellently by James Stewart and Doris Day. This exciting film shows suspense, intrigue, suspense and interesting dramas written by John Michael Hayes and Charles Bennett. Grab a common theme from the suspense mage: innocent people fall into a cobweb intrigue and sinister, intelligent villains. Colored and shimmering cinematography, recorded in the studios of Morocco and London by cinematographer Robert Burks, but with excessive transparency for the scenes in Marrakech. Elaborate sets by Henry Bunstead, Hitchcock's usual, and until his last death. The highlights are, of course, the event of the famous murder of the Royal Albert Hall in London, in which the taunting murderer Reggie Nalder tries to perform the instrument while the composer Bernard Herrmann conducts the orchestra. In addition to the climax Doris Day sang "Queue sera, Que sera", in the meantime, her son had risks, the song won the Oscar for Ray Evans, Jay Livingstone. The story was heavily reviewed because of its double characters, but today it is considered a classic movie and quite entertaining. Rating: better than average, Hitchcock's enthusiastic undoubtedly will enjoy it.
