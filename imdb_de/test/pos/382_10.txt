I have been using this film in my college ethics courses for over 10 years (including Woody Allen's "Crime and Crime" - another terrific, multi-level ethical study). <br /> <br /> It's fiction. I do not focus too much on the unrealistic characteristics of "Strangers," as all fictional films on many levels are obviously wrong. I love the movie as gallows comedy, with strong narratives, with many ironic twists and visual pleasures - even if it's "unbelievable". The story is told so well that I do not even think about criticizing its plausibility (although I must confess that the tennis match seems to be the weakest part - too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competitions). <br /> <br /> Some issues presented in the film promise realistic moral education and ethical discussions: <br /> <br /> 1. Ethical passivity: Some weaknesses of the Guy character are intended by Hitchcock. An essential ethical insight into the film is the danger of inability to articulate its moral positions. Guy can not effectively block Bruno's crazy suggestions at the beginning. An interesting question is, why and how does Guy behave so passively and ineffectively? One possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process. <br /> <br /> 2. Misunderstanding: Guy makes another failure at the start: On the train, to get away quickly, he agrees that Bruno's ideas are all good. But Guy's literal meaning is opposite to its sarcastic meaning. Bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the cross murders. Guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from a murder agreement. To some extent, Bruno may argue that he has reached an agreement to continue Guy into a network of complicity. Bruno manipulates Guy. Guy's linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno the chance to give Guy an ethical stranglehold. Bruno, who manipulates Guy, can also assume other meanings. , , , <br /> <br /> 3. Secrecy: Some have speculated about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. It seems ridiculous at first glance, especially since Guy appears to be heterosexual in his relationships with Miriam and Anne. Remember, however, that Guy is ineffective in both women as well. Guy appears (stereotypically - remember the year 1951) especially in the relationship with Bruno. Guy, the strong athlete, is weak inside. Bruno is also in conflict (he plays "against himself"), appears physically and physically strong first, but then shows some "feminine" traits (Bruno's fashion and footwork, he bubbles around emotionally with Guy in various situations and receives a manicure from his pouting mother, Bruno, is kissing and caressing his mother's hand, and other subtle gay stereotypes that are cryptic in Hitchcock's view, I wish I could hear Hitchcock explain his intended meanings here. <br /> <br / > 4. Dishonesty and Mistrust: Guy makes some colossal mistakes by hiding the truths about Bruno from the family and from the police Guy does not quite understand that confessing mistakes can be faster than a cover-up or a delay in the confession. Again, Guy is driven by passivity, insecurity, fear - and perhaps a self-loathing closer to Bruno's self-hatred lies when we want to see or admit. Both Guy and Bruno play their own parables of impotence. <br /> <br /> 5. Lack of evidence: Guy feels the problem of gathering evidence to break free. While a quick police call would solve a huge problem, Guy joins in with his own doubts and insecurities: the lack of desired alibis; the inability of the Alcoholic Professor to testify in Guy's name; the obsessive need to be politically immaculate; and other personality factors that make Guy feel defenseless. He is just as dysfunctional as Bruno - just not so dangerous (but you could blame Guy partly for the murder of Miriam). <br /> <br /> 6. Illness and mental disorder: An interesting question is how legally Bruno is responsible for the murders. The more ethically incompetent Bruno is as a sick sociopath, the more guilty Guy can be who is healthy and does not stand up and acts morally to prevent the crimes. Guy fails like a man who does not call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide and death occurs. One could argue that more than one crime is committed and Guy is an emotionally limping accomplice. <br /> <br /> These and many other features of the film make "strangers on the train" a jewel of morality diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections.
