(Contains Spoiler) <br /> <br /> People who put a Lonely Heart ad in the newspaper are often idealists. They try to describe in a few words what they are and expect. The correspondence is full of hope ... Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of a cigarette company on the Ile de la Réunion (east of Madagascar), is so affected by the letters of Julie Roussell that he proposes to her. But not the expected pretty brunette comes from the board of the "Mississippi", but - Catherine Deneuve. And we know from the beginning that she is a marital pirate and a crime has taken place. She shows no interest in "Julie's" wardrobe (she does not even open her suitcase) and neglects her canary until he dies. But the most basic tricks of seduction (an open zipper) are enough to turn Louis into a bendy little dog. First, a joint bank account. And then, as Julie's sister draws attention, the flight. With £ 27.850 million of Louis '28 million - she would have needed his signature for the entire sum. <br /> <br /> Louis and Julie's sister hired a private detective (Michel Bouquet). Louis tries to track down Marion (Deneuve's real name) in Antibes, where she works as a taxi girl - her gangster lover has left her destitute or rather nondescript male. Louis can not kill her. She tells her story: orphan. Precocious Lesbian Experiences. Many sugardaddies. Prison - and soon she leads him back to the nose. The detective turns out to be clever as a fox and stubborn as a bloodhound; Louis and Marion bury his body in the basement. They flee to Paris, where Louis discovers that Marion has an expensive taste. She adores money like a deity. He sells his company at a fraction of their value. When the body of the detective is discovered (high tide), she has to flee again - without the money. Living in a mountain lodge, along with a howling loser - Marion can imagine a happier life without this tag ... <br /> <br /> A highlight in the careers of all involved. Belmondo's self-deception makes him almost adorable. Deneuve looks gorgeous in her Yves St. Laurent wardrobe, and her performance is delightful: First, she fakes the fragile woman - too shy to ask her husband for money, so the shared bank account is needed - but after being suspended, she sounds like Katharine Hepburn in the prison scene of BRINGING UP BABY. The landscape is spectacular - the tropics, the Riviera, Paris. Truffaut goes without saying: The 60s was the only decade in which European films were head and shoulders above American productions. After this film Truffaut could see his idol Alfred Hichcock in the face.
