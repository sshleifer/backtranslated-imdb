As an American, I've never met this character, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare. I did not enjoy the mindless idiot humor in American teenage movies, and although this is a somewhat similar kind of humor, I could not stop laughing. I hardly laugh aloud about a movie. And usually a movie has some funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over. I'll buy that on DVD if I can.
