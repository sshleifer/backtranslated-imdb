It is a risky business to film such a costly production of "The Merchant of Venice". It could be a boring piece of wood from the time, or it could be ridiculous for its excesses. This version is no. Although I am not fully sold by Al Pancino's very reserved Shylock, he does provide a competent and honorable performance. Jeremy Iron's Antonio is as always with his tormented self rolling and fascinating. Some of the smaller roles seemed to be a little too much in the spirit of exuberant fun "a Venetian adventure story of a boy," but the central plot is moved efficiently and compassionately through the film. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the filming, costumes and interiors of the place were breathtaking, almost to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> One thing I do not want to comment on is the antisemetic content of the game. The film is as sympathetic as possible to the situation of the Jews, while still portraying Shylock as an instrument of its own self-destruction. It is a sad comment that the director of this film had to comment on his nuanced view four centuries later, before the Toronto Film Festival premiere. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie and I look forward to several visits.
