If Hollywood had the well-being of the public in its heart, we would watch 20 movies a year with the kind of healthy power behind this movie. There are several experiences of personal growth in this film, and while the characters are still very human, even the lessons are not that greed will benefit you or others, whatever you want, as long as you want -aa-okay- with-it, no, that's what our sad, desensitized life needs, more meaning ... more love ... you ... more HOPE. (Thanks, Ursula!) This movie has a smart joke, not "yo'mama" tears, which are common in the so-called comedies. People have to feel good. In this movie you will feel good and possibly inspire you to improve your life and the lives of others. Side Note Each person counts on ticket sales. This is a really independent movie. If you want more quality films, you need to support them.
