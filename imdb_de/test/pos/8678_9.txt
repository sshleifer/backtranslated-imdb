Andreas arrives in a strange city. He can not remember where he came from and how he got there. He should come to work and get his own apartment in the city. All his colleagues are nice and polite to him, they say hello and smile when they pass him by. But later, Andreas discovers that the city is not as pleasant as it seems. As he walked home from work, he saw some people wearing gray suits and cleaning the bloody chaos of a dead body, apparently a suicide victim who had thrown himself out of the window. The process is done with a calming mind as if they were emptying a trash can. The next day, Andreas meets the suicide victim at work fully alive. More and more Andreas discovers the insensitivity of the city. The brysomme mannen could be the best norwegian movie i have ever seen. Norwegian films usually lack original, artistic direction, with a few exceptions. The storyline is also very original and could even be described as a postmodern horror, as the film presents us with a terrible thought of dealing with a world that is completely unfeeling. and the more you try to fill your life in this city with meaning, the more meaningless it becomes. I'm fascinated by how the director manages to create the feeling of a riddled universe, a nightmare that you simply can not escape, not even death. I gave it 9 out of 10 points.
