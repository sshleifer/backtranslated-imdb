Those who dislike this film seem to believe that a loved one somehow "belongs" to them and must be discarded when dating someone else. Fortunately, human nature is much deeper than that; To love someone who inevitably inevitably brings suffering, even though we are lucky only with their death. <br /> <br /> This film focuses on Nigel Balchin's original novel ("A Path through the Forest") in terms of atmosphere, atmosphere and dialogue. and by showing a seemingly incompatible dilemma captures the quiet despair that is behind many seemingly idyllic life (and the representation of the English country life of the upper class is very accurate). <br /> <br /> I loved the movie and hope it will be released as soon as a UK-compatible DVD is released
