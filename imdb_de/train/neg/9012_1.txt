Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me that it's the worst movie she's ever seen ... Since I thought it was pretty awful, I got to thinking - which movie was the worst movie, I've ever seen and that was the only movie that came to my mind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's been a couple of years since I saw him, but I remember the terrible Miscast Dean Cain as a cocky military (the pretty boy Cain is not very pushy). The strange deal with the CGI helicopter, when it would probably be cheaper to rent a helicopter than hire some CGI people, but I guess they found the helicopter a free sample for a CGI program or the manufacturer's son liked to play with his new computer. And what did it look like? Dreadful. And when the dragon storms through the corridors of the complex, then reuse the same shots again and again - looks very cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really awful ...
