NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Cut: R <br /> <br /> Director's Cut: NC-17 <br /> <br /> It's an unusual Oliver Stone image, though when I read that he was drugged while filming. I did not need any further explanations. "Natural Born Killers" is a risky, crazy filmmaking product that we do not get often. strange, psychotic, artistic pictures. <br /> <br /> "Natural Born Killers" is essentially the story of how two mass killers were popularized and glorified in the media. There's a great scene where an interviewer asks some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says, "Murder is wrong ... but if I were a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory." Mickey describes this with a situation of "Frankenstein (the Monster) and Dr. Frankenstein" - Dr. Ing. Frankenstein is the medium that has turned her into these monstrous killers. <br /> <br /> Most Oliver Stone films examine the mistakes of America, the country the director loves and admires. I think Natural Born Killers is about the impact of mass media, technology and how obsessed the Americans (and most of the world) are as a nation about things like mass killer and bizarre situations. <br /> <br /> The killers of Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are amazingly executed by two outstanding actors who enter into the lives of two interesting brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worthy of being killed, perhaps in the cruel theory of social Darwinism (survival of the fittest) - Mickey says in his interview in jail that other species commit murder, we as humans devastate other species and they exploit the environment; The script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this movie is, in the sense that we have to think about society and human behavior, and not about the intensity of a 2-hour bloodbath that we saw. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the movie takes place in a high security prison. we see the harsh realities of prison life; the attitude of the guardian, etc., overcrowding of the prisons - perhaps stone questions the future, the way that society leads. <br /> <br /> Two more interesting characters; First, a reporter who directs a show about "America's Maniacs" and is obsessed with rising ratings, that he is doing everything he can to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is the policeman Scagnetti, an insane, perhaps sadistic officer in love with Mallory - he also has a strange obsession with mass killers since his mother was killed by Charles Whitman during the Waco, Texas slaughter. <br /> The Cinematography is outstanding. different colors, shadows and styles create a sense of disorientation; The greenest color of all is green, to resemble the killer's disease (in the drugstore, when looking for an antidote to the rattlesnake). <br /> <br /> The camera work is crazy. Shaky, lively, it takes some determination to get used to and accept it. Very unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual. <br /> <br /> 'Natural Born Killers' does not enchant the existence of lunatic murderers, it questions them and how we as a public can fuel this attribute ... <br /> <br /> Although the above review is quite positive sounds, I did not like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the film, was not satisfied with the revised script and asked to cancel his name. I can see why. Natural Born Killers is sometimes interesting, but a mess of a picture. <br /> <br /> 4/10
