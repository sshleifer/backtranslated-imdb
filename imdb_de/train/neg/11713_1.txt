Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've seen in years ... I could not watch it to the end ... It's a waste of time ... I'm really sorry for Snipes that he ended did in such a movie. There really is not much to say. Terrible spectacle, unbelievably bad lines, history, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see what a movie should not be like. Just to tell you a scene: The police are looking for Snipes and surround the building with helicopters and cars. They shoot around in the building, but they still whisper, so Snipes does not suspect.
