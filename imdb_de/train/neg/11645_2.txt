This is a review of "Freddy Mercury The Untold Story," theatrical release, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the most fanciful, uninspired and boring biographical documentary films I've ever seen. When the film I've seen in a movie theater, was originally published on TV, I would ask his producers and distributors, not to deceive the paying public with the false promise of a cinematic tribute documentary. Even as a TV documentary the sentimental piano solos that accompanied the respondents who were sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms, and the pompous, pseudoliterale narrative were more like a sleeping bed infomercial. The only redeeming aspects of this "The unwritten story of Freddy Mercury" - or, um, it was "the unwritten story of Princess Diana," are the original concert, video and television - unabridged Freddy Mercury and Queen. Witness interviews with irrelevant witnesses with insights such as: "He was a free spirit" (really ... I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man ...) reduces the Freddy testimonials from Brian May and Montserrat Caballe, who were new and loving light in the complex life and character of Mercury. And ... what about the Harry Potter-style boarding school sections? How has contributed to the interview with the first girls swarm ( "... who now works in a travel agency") and members of Freddy's first school band, what I really want to know about Mercury? Important milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and his growth, Queen, the band remains unexplored. These filmmakers do not constitute a provocative question, nor does it deal with the independent or visionary research their topic and provide instead a boring assembly polite clean and completely empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend who does not deserve In order to this History Channel biography To be reminded, your grandparents can nod on a Sunday night.
