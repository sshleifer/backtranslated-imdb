This film does not capture the puzzles and intrigues the book offers. The main point of the book, the insights, are barely touched, and the viewer wonders why everyone has so much to do with it and why he is willing to risk his life. Character development is not good at all. With no background or personal development, the audience does not really care about what happens to them, and so the storylines fall flat. <br /> <br /> The search for the manuscripts ends abruptly and without any real explanation. There remains a sense of contentment, which was the whole search. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I have ever seen. It is terrible and a waste of time. If you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you have read the book, skip the movie and read it again. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the movie discredited the movie, it's so bad and ridiculous. It's also a shame, because it could have been good if they had capitalized at the peak of their success and probably would have gotten a good script writer and some good actors. <br /> <br /> Please do not hesitate do not waste your time, READ THE BOOK !!!
