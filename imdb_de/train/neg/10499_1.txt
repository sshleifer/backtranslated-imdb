OK, first, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. They were loved by many fans. Well ... this movie was not a movie at all. It was "The Crocodile Hunter," a television show with bad drama, bad scripts, and bad governance between Steve, who captured us or taught us about animals. He was entertaining as an animal investigator / specialist. Millions will miss him. But the whole movie idea was a big mistake. The plot was so broken that it almost did not exist. Casting was terrible. The spectacle was not even compulsory. The direction must also be faulty. If you can not get a reasonably decent performance from your actors, no matter how bad the script is, you should not be so good at all. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never seen this movie before. Of course I saw it for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son) while traveling with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of Scooby Doo live action. My son, who is not that discriminating, liked the movie, but he has never asked to see him again. If you want to have nice memories of Steve Irwin, buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve, I would not want to remember this movie. Respect him: avoid this movie!
