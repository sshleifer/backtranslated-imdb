The screenplay for this TV soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins eventually had to play like a drama student to get life in his script-dead character. I do not know if that was the purpose of the director, but Hopkins' Ciano only smelled of vanity, fear, and lack of self-esteem. The real Ciano might have been everything, but why did he make a movie about him? Mussolini was a bit more persuasive and his long journey was closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was just ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the powerless writing), while she had to be the central figure of this alleged family drama. See it only if you enjoy the Venezuelan soap opera.
