Um ... I was pretty surprised that somebody actually gave this movie good grades. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress ... and this movie just proves the extent of her "talent." The plot of the movie was weak ... I bet the fool, who came up with this concept was a perverted peeping tom.If there is anything good in this movie, I would say that it is the daughter of Tommy Chong just because she is his daughter, but stop listening to his dramatic abilities help. * Why does IMDb need at least 10 lines? How many more options can you simply say, "This movie is shit"?
