I can not stand this show! Was there ever a single redeeming quality, a funny punch line or a plot line that "did not" make the average viewer drown in a bowl of fully-fluted cereal? <br /> <br /> The voices. Oh, those terrible, miserable voices. Just as a fine cutlery is repeatedly pulled across a dusty board, each character annoys in his or her ability for shrill, nasal vocals. Cosmo sounds like a howling mongrel, Vicky sounds like a stereotypical spy, and Timmy's dad makes every line sound like a bad imitator of a game show host (Guy Smiley of "Sesame Street"). <br /> <br /> The animation is terrible; even the producers of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" laugh at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show. Each character has forte-teeth or a square head or a head that is three sizes too big for his body. And what if the characters speak each line with wide eyes and are grinning, as if posing for a photo op with the president? Then there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic. Not since the subtle grace of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson, and Buddy Lembeck of "Charles in Charge," characters have been portrayed so unrealistically stupid. Normally "unrealistic" is synonymous with "unfit," and that is definitely the case here. Since "The Naked Gun 33 1/3" there was not as much slapstick based on ignorance ... and Leslie Nielson was at least good at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the premise of the show was (and it is in every episode the same thing, so here's the time loss (Spoiler) :) Timmy wishes something with his two "Fairly Oddparents," something goes wrong, There is always a reason why he can not immediately reverse the course and wished the damage away, and in the end everything is fine. Oh, and by the way, Timmy's parents never believe him when complaining about Vicky, and they continue to keep her busy on every occasion. Maybe it's just me, but it seems that a children's program with the subtle message that it brings nothing to report an abusive babysitter probably is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> If you want to write a paper and give an example of how far the quality of the cartoons has fallen, has "The Fairly Odd Parents" be a good starting point. An excellent example of how TV producers put together a worthless product that is aimed at children, with little or no effort, just because they know that someone will see it somewhere.
