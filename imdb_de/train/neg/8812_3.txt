Unfortunately, realism is boring. I thought this movie would never end, it would have been better if all the characters had been killed in the first five minutes. Where is Blade if you need it? As gloomy as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and as nightmarish as BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES is nowhere near as entertaining as the gloomy films mentioned before. Although cannibalism makes the would-be Jeffery Dalmers hearts beat a little faster, he was not nearly as interesting as Ravenous. Really, I found it about as interesting as nocturnal infomercials and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you can not endure this for anyone else. I was really surprised that this was not done by the people at Brain Damage because that was the quality of Dead Creatures.
