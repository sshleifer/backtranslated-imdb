I rented this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment with the little Laura Ingalls, who was involved in such badly produced products. I'm not sure if it's terrible writing or bad direction or both, but it's disappointing to the viewer that he's wasting time watching this dizziness. It consisted of a weak, naive plot, very bad lines and was based solely on pretty landscapes and pretty people to sell it. Unfortunately that was not enough. It would be better if you borrow a band full of statics than waste your time with that crap. Lindsey Wagner also played a rather miserable role as a ranch owner, who apparently works very hard to do nothing. Anyone who has ever been near a ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young man from Los Angeles and not by someone who knows much about the world.
