They let me see that at school and it was awful. The movie is outdated. The episodes become confusing because facts are combined with fiction to make the story more interesting. The teachers talked about it as a treat, but it was really a painfully boring experience. I read that very few people are actors, but most of them do what they do in the movie in real life. Very often the story is slightly outrageous and far-fetched. I do not like the way some lines were written, and I wish they had more meaning for them. Although it was written to be educational, fun, exciting and hip, it got boring, dry, far-fetched and old. I hope nobody takes the time to watch this movie because it would be good if you did not see it.
