In general, I've found that there is a good reason for not listening to a movie before you watch it on DVD. I had not heard of this movie until I was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf. Since all the good movies were already rented (the ones I wanted to see anyway), I thought I'd give this movie a chance Genre like The Singles Ward or the RM If you're interested in such movies, you'll probably enjoy it , <br /> <br /> However, if you are not a Mormon, this movie is unlikely to appeal to you. There is no way to avoid the overt religious (Mormon) message contained in it, and sometimes it looks juicy and cheesy. If you are not within the Mormon population, it may be better to see something different. <br /> <br /> Granted, there were some very funny moments in the movie, but I did not think it was enough to save the movie altogether.
