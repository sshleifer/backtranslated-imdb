... the first movie I had to get out. And it was the cast and crew of the crew (Not that I was involved, I hurry to add). I survived the first hour, so all I can say is that I'm only allowed to comment, but that was my limit. As with other comments here, how did that happen through any kind of QA. An accumulation of the worst dialogues, the epitome of playing the wood, terrible casting, all without a plot. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald's casting was bizarre, almost funny. She has the worst Russian accent in film history. <br /> <br /> When I left the show, the director and producers drank in a bar outside the cinema. Obviously they could not stand it anymore either. <br /> <br />
