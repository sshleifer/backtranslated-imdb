Okay, in the previews of this movie you only learn that a rebellious young girl lives with her grandmother for the summer to calm down. That's not the case! It's about a young, rebellious 17-year-old girl revealing a secret, and it's up to her mother to believe whether she's telling the truth or not. They had a really good story and a really good topic of a love / hate relationship between mother and daughter. However, I did not enjoy seeing Lindsay Lohan's acting. In fact, this movie would have been great if they had someone else, maybe a better actress. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person and somehow reminds us of the real Lindsay, so she takes away a lot from the movie Lindsay aside, you will enjoy this movie. The end is pretty great (and sad).
