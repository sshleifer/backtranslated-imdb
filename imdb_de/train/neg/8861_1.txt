Terrible horror successor to "The Howling". This begins with the funeral of Karen White (she was killed at the end of the first movie). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee, unfortunately) arrives there and tells Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) that Karen was a werewolf. He goes to Transylvania to kill the chief werewolf Striba (Sybil Danning). Ben and a colleague of Karens (Annie McEnroe) join him. <br /> <br /> An awesome script, bad direction, inappropriate editing and truly cruel drama by Brown and McEnroe submerge this devotion. The werewolf effects are usually stored in the dark - for a good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Subpar special effects too - though I liked the cartoon flash that comes from Danning's fingers. There's also a werewolf orgy that is especially stupid, and Danning takes off its tip at least EIGHT TIMES during the credits! <br /> <br /> There are a few good things - I found the village in Transylvania amusing - it seems like it came from a 1930s horror movie! Between transition scenes, there are interesting camera tricks. Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good at it - but they can not save it. Really - WHY did you do that? Where do you have the money? This is one of the lowest rated IMDb movies. That alone should tell you something. Supposedly Danning was horrified when she saw the movie - I can understand why! A must!
