I bought this movie in a local video store for $ 5 at a local store, Chase Masterson, but I should have let the five break down, throw in a toilet, and flush. The film is about a bunch of twenty things that peaked in high school and reunited on the day of the death of their idiotic friends, who got drunk and wandered into the forest and died. The problem is that a reptile monster chases them bit by bit. Acting is miserable, these worthless people were apparently rejected at shows like 90210 and Dawson's Creek. Directed at the age of twelve, the script was probably written by a thirteen-year-old. The entire set looks like someone's backyard in Malibu. The people here who have praised this movie are obviously friends of the director and / or the actors. Avoid this garbage heap at ALL costs.
