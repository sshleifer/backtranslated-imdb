What a pathetic movie. <br /> <br /> I will not waste much time commenting on it. I'm still trying to get the few hours I've wasted for it. <br /> <br /> Just let me take it - Shaq has NO BUSINESS as an actor or singer. He is absolutely talentless at both displines. It's a terrible shame that much more talented people are wasted in community theaters and karaoke bars, while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservingly cast in movies and cut CDs. Film was Shaq's pitiful non-talent.
