In the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Crab is a gay alcoholic who sleeps without underwear, fantasizes about the murder of his roommate, tries to steal a magazine from a newsstand, and looks for a young man, the he meets the station. And he's the hero of this nonsensical film that's completely disguised (except for crab in at least one scene too many) but can not go anywhere. The basic curve is very simple, but is drawn to almost two hours before a meaningless conclusion is reached. Verhoeven has a nice visual flair, but attacks scenes of wild hallucinations, overt symbolism and unfounded pallor when he runs out of ideas.
