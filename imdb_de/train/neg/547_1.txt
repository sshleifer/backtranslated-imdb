The full title of this movie is "Waqt: Race Against Time". This is a race that nobody can win, but you can certainly lower your loss margin by not wasting any of your precious "Waqt" on this Bakvaas. This film was awkward and manipulative, so K3G looked honest. It has burdened my credibility too much. It was ridiculously stupid in its history and deserves to be mocked for it. <br /> <br /> It's not as horrible as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend. Stupid, pointless, with a ridiculous OTT performance by Amitji. The central "conspiracy" is another disagreeable example of the grossly manipulative propaganda that afflicts so many "family" BW films. If my father, who raised me and whom I love very much, treated me like Big B Akshay, I would shoot him myself. Not to mention the trivialization of a deadly disease.
