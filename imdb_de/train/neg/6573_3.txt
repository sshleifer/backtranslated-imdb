I read the reviews and while I did not expect a rescuing private Ryan, I expected a movie with a substance. <br /> <br /> The movie starts very rag-sided with the usual intro of the story and how the unit came into being. But it's 1944 right now and you do not know where everyone is. The accents etc. are very bad, as this unit is supposed to be Hawaiian / Asian Americans, but all speak a very bad attitude to Harvard's English imitation of a Japanese woman. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3 out of 10 because I could not see anything after 10 minutes. The characters were one-dimensional and although they were most likely based on real humans, I did not have any feelings for them and that did not interest me any further. Very bad direction of a very average television movie being shown on a cable channel at midnight. I would avoid it and look for better efforts. <br /> <br /> This is a good story, but it deserves a better statement. They felt that the director had seen a group of brothers and thought that was enough to sell his film. My advice, avoid and band of brothers, Tuskegee flyers, Glory or another movie like when trumpets fade ...
