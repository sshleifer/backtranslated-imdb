There was nothing about this movie that I liked. So obviously it was a bad budget with bad lighting and camerawork (almost like Blair Witch Project, just it should not be that way). There was not really much action and the movie was just drug use. I fast-forwarded in the last third of the movies, but that did not help much. It looked like it was good from the box, but I have to say again: nothing about this movie looks so good. No good actors, the special effects were so fake, the camera work was terrible and the dialogue was painfully horrible. On my personal scale, I give this movie a 0 out of 10. Yikes!
