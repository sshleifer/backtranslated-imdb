Although the book was not exactly accurate to the actual situation, it had a sense of Japan. I can not believe that anyone involved in this movie ever came to Japan because it does not feel Japanese at all. Almost everything was terrible. I have to admit that the actors were generally pretty good, but had no chance to save them. Before filming, I was surprised that on a Friday night, shortly after the film opened in Japan, only ten people were in the cinema. After 30 minutes, I was amazed that they stayed. I stayed, so I have the right to criticize it. The whole movie was interrupted by my groaning and suppressed the incredulous laughter of my Japanese girlfriend. Everyone I saw leaving the cinema looked confused and disappointed. <br /> <br /> You owe me two hours to the creators of this film.
