In the show of Steve Irwin he is incredible. He does not even try to be funny and he's just, but his movie was not even what I would call a movie - I mean, if the guy in his car tries to kill him, he just says' Oh 'That's one of them guy!' and look directly into the camera. He has put his face too much in the camera! And if the guy falls out of the car, would not you expect him dead? And Terri had the worst drama I've ever seen! As if the crocodile had almost eaten Steve, she simply says "Steve." She did not sound scared or anything, it was just "Steve." I mean, I hate to sound mean, but that was not worth it to be seen. I love Steve Irwin, but his movie was just too stupid.
