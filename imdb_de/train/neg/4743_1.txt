I'll be back at your local mall (of course, because the high school kids hang out there !!!!!) to show how awful "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" really is !!!!! To prove how bad this joke is from a DCOM ... <br /> <br /> ... let's take these four sumo wrestlers into this photo booth. How cozy !!!!! <br /> <br /> shark! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How awful is that ????? It's so bad, Disney Channel washes away its money with these exciting but crucial 10-second promos that ask viewers "WHEN'S THAT ON?" And then, suddenly, when it comes to use, this not only has a higher TV rating than usual, but this has only been seen once !!!!! Oh no!!!!! Once all !!!!! Besides, this movie is all about high school and stuff, and believe me, I will NOT go on with what else is there ..... <br /> <br /> Say ch ... smile !! !! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. 0/10
