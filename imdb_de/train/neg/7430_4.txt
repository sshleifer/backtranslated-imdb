It's interesting to see how Pierce Brosnan's career was before Bond's move. In this "tense" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays Gentle Patrick, the leading ghetto kids working on "Trust Courses." He loves a woman who has a Moor-top mop top called Eric in the mid-90s. The drunken ex-husband of the woman soon comes on stage and begins to deal with Pierce. In one phase, Pierce innocently makes "Vegeburger". The husband enters Pierce makes Vegeburger again. The husband attacks Pierce. Small pieces of half eaten Vegeburger call fall from Pierce's mouth. The fight ends abruptly without showing the result. That's as good as the movie gets. <br /> <br />
