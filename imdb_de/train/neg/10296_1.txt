It was probably just my DVD - but I would not recommend anyone to watch this image on a DVD. I had to adjust the volume of my TV to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialogue. Part of the conversation was still inaudible. If you come from Scotland, you may have a chance, albeit a small one. <br /> <br /> People's voices have been drowned out by almost all ambient noise, including unpacking a packet, striding or even plucking a cigarette. <br /> <br /> When the volume is raised to a level where voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police if the scene turns into a noisy environment like a disco. And that you will hurt yourself if you look for the remote control to turn it back. <br /> <br /> There is art and art in audio mixing as well. But this effort would meet international criteria in a time of war to be considered cruelty. After about half an hour, I gave up, because I had not seen anything else that would have seen something redeeming in the picture.
