Well, I have to say, this movie was so bad that I would have gone out if I did not have to check it for work. And the worst part is, I wanted to see it so much that I drove all over the city and paid $ 10 for parking twice because the newspaper lists were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - the only time I saw him playing someone else was in this movie with John Travolta. Anyway, the plot has potential - it sounded great in the preview, but it's full of ridiculous, predictable, weak plot turnarounds. And I was hoping that this would be a Christmas movie where Christmas did not have to be saved and Santa did not need a replacement, but no I'm sure this movie would be great for young kids, but for adults it's like that lame that it's boring to sit through.
