"Plants are the most cunning and vicious of all life forms," ​​informs a dopey victim in "The Seedpeople," a stupid, flabby remake of "Bodysnatchers Invasion," "Day of the Triffids," and a Thousand Euter Movies. And why is seed more dangerous than plants, one might ask? Because after the same jerk "seeds can hunt us". Yeah, I can remember a terrible incident when MooCow was just a calf and was chased home from school by school ... Yeah, right. Unfortunately, the "monsters" in this shabby little turkey style look like shaggy little muppets, some of them rolling like evil tumbleweeds, others sailing on threads. There is not even the slightest idea of ​​terror or tension here. Inexplicably, the seed monsters are turned off by 50 volt ultraviolet lights, though they can walk around in daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000,000 times more UV energy. As you can see, not much thought was given to this cow flop. The MooCow says you have to weed your garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. : = 8P
